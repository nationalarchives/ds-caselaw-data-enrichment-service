Appeals lie to the Court of Appeal, so in this way it’s the same as any other constitution of the High Court. But it is arguably superior to a standard sitting of the High Court because of it appellate capacity. "
EWHC-QBD-Admin,EWHC-Admin,Administrative Court,King's/Queen's Bench Division of the High Court,Court,[year] EWHC # (Admin),,TRUE,3,,,"This is a weird case. The Adminstrative Court sits with a single judge. The Administrative Court can also sit as a Divisional Court. A single neutral citation pattern applies to both. The main difference is that a Divisional Court hears ""appeals by way of case stated"" from the Crown Court (a special appellate procedure) and more significant cases that would otherwise have been heard by a judge sitting alone in the Administrative Court. As a rule, the Divisional Court sits with one Lord Justice and a normal High Court justice. Really, the LC should be thinking about giving Divisional Court judgments their own neutral citation patter (e.g. [year] EWHC # (DC)"
