The Adminstrative Court sits with a single judge. The Administrative Court can also sit as a Divisional Court. A single neutral citation pattern applies to both. The main difference is that a Divisional Court hears ""appeals by way of case stated"" from the Crown Court (a special appellate procedure) and more significant cases that would otherwise have been heard by a judge sitting alone in the Administrative Court. As a rule, the Divisional Court sits with one Lord Justice and a normal High Court justice. Really, should we be thinking about giving Divisional Court judgments their own neutral citation patter (e.g. [year] EWHC # (DC)"
