	    <p class="Mstyle" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Claimant ("Spar") is the registered owner of three supramax bulk carriers, the SPAR CAPELLA, SPAR VEGA and SPAR DRACO (collectively “the Vessels”).  By three charterparties dated 5 March 2010 on amended NYPE 1993 forms, the Vessels were let on long term time charter to Grand China Shipping (Hong Kong) Co Ltd (“GCS”).  The charterparties provided for guarantees to be issued by the Defendant (“GCL”), which is the parent of GCS.  Three letters of guarantee were issued on behalf of GCL dated 25 March 2010 (“the Guarantees”).</p>

	    <p class="Mstyle" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The SPAR DRACO was built in 2006 and was of some 53,500 mt dwt.  It was chartered for minimum 35 maximum 37 months in charterers’ option with hire of US$16,500 per day payable semi monthly in advance.  It was delivered into the charter on 31 May 2010.  The SPAR CAPELLA and SPAR VEGA were newbuildings at a Chinese yard of some 58,000 mt dwt and were delivered into the charterparties from the yard on 6 and 12 January 2011 respectively.  Those charters were for minimum 59 maximum 62 months in charterers’ option with hire of US$16,750 per day payable semi monthly in advance.</p>

Spar recouped some of the arrears by exercising its lien on sub freights, but there remained substantial arrears of hire on all three vessels throughout the summer of 2011 and a chronology of missed or delayed payments.  Spar called on GCL for payment under the Guarantees on 16 September 2011.  On 23 September 2011 Spar withdrew the SPAR CAPELLA and terminated that charterparty.  On 30 September 2011 Spar withdrew the SPAR VEGA and SPAR DRACO and terminated those charterparties.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.99in;text-indent:0.12in">Damages for loss of bargain in respect of the unexpired term of the charters.  In respect of the SPAR DRACO it was common ground that there was at the date of termination an available market for a substitute time charter for the unexpired term of the charter of about 18 months at US$13,000 per day, on the basis of which damages were quantified at US$2,739,029.  In respect of the SPAR CAPELLA and SPAR VEGA it was common ground that at the date of termination there was no market for a substitute time charter for the unexpired term of the charters of about four years.  Spar has quantified the damages as the difference between what it would have earned under the charters and the actual earnings from employment of the vessels to date and estimated future earnings of US$9,600 per day until expiry of the charter periods in December 2015.  The calculations performed by Spar in respect of actual earnings did not in fact cover the entire period up to the hearing date but only up to 31 December 2014 with the period thereafter being treated as future earnings.  The amounts claimed were:</p>

Spar contends that Mr Jia had authority to sign the Guarantees.  This is an issue governed by Chinese law, on which I heard evidence from Mr Greg Yang on behalf of Spar and Ms Liu Yan on behalf of GCL.  Spar contended in the alternative that Mr Jia had ostensible authority, or that GCL had ratified the Guarantees.  </p>

	    <p class="Mstyle" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">GCL further submitted that it was not bound by the Guarantees because they did not comply with Chinese exchange control laws requiring the approval and registration of guarantees to overseas entities by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”), which provide that the issue of an unapproved/unregistered guarantee is an offence and such guarantee is unenforceable unless the guarantor is at fault.  Although the Guarantees are expressly governed by English law, GCL submitted that such illegality under Chinese law prevented their enforcement.  Spar contends that Chinese law is not applicable, and that in any event the Guarantees would be enforceable as a matter of Chinese law because the fault in failing to secure registration and approval was that of GCL. </p>

	    <p class="Mstyle" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">GCL submitted in the alternative that if it was bound by the Guarantees, it was under no liability in relation to the unexpired periods of the charters: the right of withdrawal under the charters was a contractual option but there had been no breach of the charters giving rise to a right to damages at common law for repudiation or renunciation. Spar contended that it was entitled to damages for loss of bargain for such period because payment of hire was a condition of the charters; alternatively if payment of hire was an innominate term, GCS’s conduct was repudiatory and/or evinced an intention not to pay hire timeously which constituted a renunciation of the charters.  </p>

	    <p class="Mstyle" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In the further alternative GCL challenged the method of calculation of damages for the unexpired periods of the SPAR CAPELLA and SPAR VEGA charterparties.  It submitted that damages should not be based on Spar’s actual earnings, but on hire which would have been earned by replacing the charters with timecharter employment, albeit that it would have required two consecutive fixtures of 30 months and about 20 months respectively, alternatively a series of shorter charters.  This was not an argument that Spar had failed to mitigate its loss by acting unreasonably in not taking such time charter employment for the vessels, but an argument of law that this was the proper measure of damages.  Spar disputed that this was the proper approach as a matter of law and disputed that in any event there was a market for a 30 month charter or a 20 month charter at the relevant times.  On this issue, and a number of more minor quantum disputes, I heard expert evidence from brokers, Mr McDonald on behalf of Spar and Mr Lewis on behalf of GCL.</p>

He explained that Spar is a Norwegian company which has grown from its inception to its current position of owning 23 mostly modern Supramax vessels.  It is run with a small staff of five people with the fleet mostly time chartered out and serviced by external technical managers.  Mr Ellefsen was himself responsible for fixing the Vessels.  The SPAR CAPELLA and SPAR VEGA were two of eight vessels which Spar bought in the spring of 2010; they were bought two at a time, with long term employment being secured for each pair before purchasing the next two.  </p>

They were suggested by Spar’s Norwegian brokers, RS Platou, who also had an office in Shanghai.  On 1 March 2011 Mr Jan Egil Roald of RS Platou’s Norwegian office passed on to Mr Ellefsen some background information on GCS.  This indicated that it was a relatively new company, established in February 2008 and commencing operations in June 2008; that it was wholly owned by GCL; that GCL had been established in April 2007 as part of the HNA Group; and that GCL was a substantial concern with registered capital of over US$100 million and subsidiaries operating businesses in container and bulk shipping, shipbuilding and repairing, air cargo, ports and terminals, and integrated logistics.  </p>

Whilst fixture terms were being negotiated, Mr Ellefsen provided the required wording for the guarantee on 3 March 2010.

Lines 5-6 described the charterers as <span style="font-style:italic">“[GCS] [Shanghai address], performance guaranteed by [GCL] (se attached Performance Guarantee Letter)</span>”.  Clause 10 provided for the charterers to pay hire at the rate of US$16,750 per day and pro rata for part of a day 15 days in advance.  Clauses 23 and 61 provided for the owners’ lien on all cargoes, sub-freights, sub-hire and bunkers on board for amounts due under the charter, and that in the event of owners exercising their liberty to withdraw the vessel, bunkers on board would become owners’ property with a duty to give charterers credit for their value.  Clauses 45 and 55 provided for English law and London arbitration.  Clause 77 provided that “<span style="font-style:italic">If the vessel is off-hire for more than 60 days continuously, Charterers have the option to cancel this Charter Party</span>.”  Clause 11 provided:</p>

Mr Kong explained that they had a difficulty making punctual payment of hire because GCS’ capesize vessels had been chartered in at a rate higher than the current market and so payment of hire on those vessels was taking up most of its cash.  Mr Kong said that with support and help from GCL and HNA they were working on a structure to separate the capesize vessels from their other smaller ships so as to ensure that hire for the latter was paid on time.  He gave the opinion that GCL and HNA would not allow GCS “to go bankrupt” and Mr Shao was convinced by this.  Mr Shao said that Spar might have to take “more serious action” in the light of the failure to make punctual payment, to which Mr Kong’s response was that he would not have any grounds for complaint, but he strongly wished that Spar would not do so.  He said that he regarded Spar as “a best partner” and would put Spar hire as “the first priority”.  </p>

In both this conversation and the one the previous day with Ms Li Cen, GCS said that other owners had received payments as a necessary part of renegotiating lower rates with them.  An email from GCS the same day, 15 June 2011, asked Spar to withdraw the notice of lien on sub-freights of which notice had been given in respect of the SPAR DRACO.  GCS said that some funds had been received from its parent company but that it would take a few days to arrange foreign exchange; and that there would be at least one hire payment on the SPAR DRACO that week.</p>

An email of the same day proposed a payment plan which involved punctual payment of all hire instalments when they fell due thereafter and payment of the arrears, then standing at about $2.2 million in two equal instalments on 31 August and 30 September.  Spar rejected this proposal, complaining that GCS were effectively treating Spar as a bank from whom it was borrowing money without interest or security.  Spar proposed a slightly more ambitious payment plan with the remaining arrears being paid off in two equal instalments on 31 August and 30 September, with arrears to carry interest and the debt to be secured by an HNA guarantee.  GCS rejected this proposal.</p>

What had happened at the meeting was that Adam Tan, the number 3 in HNA and now in charge of GCL stated that he was very unsatisfied with GCL; and that “HNA could afford to lose the money but would not afford to lose the face”.  It was reported that “Adam Tan has given the instruction to solve the issues with Spar asap, and this is not a big amount of money anyway.”  There is no firm evidence as to who told Ms Li Cen of the fact and content of the meeting but the email suggests that she and her colleagues were on good terms with Mr Tan and another senior person within the HNA/Grand China group and I have no reason to doubt that her email is an accurate report of what she or her colleagues were told had happened at the meeting, or that what they were told was an accurate account of the meeting.</p>

In respect of the SPAR CAPELLA, the outstanding May instalment was paid in full and the outstanding first June payment was part paid.  The July instalments were paid in full, albeit one day and two days late respectively.  The outstanding balance at the end of the month was reduced to US$382,898.09.  In respect of the SPAR VEGA, there was no payment of the outstanding May and June instalments, but the July instalments were paid in full, albeit one day late on the first occasion.  The balance outstanding at the end of the month was US$872,025.80.  In respect of the SPAR DRACO, there was no payment of the outstanding May or June instalments, but the July instalments were paid in full, albeit a day late on the first occasion.  The balance outstanding at the end of the month was US$609,420.66.  The total outstanding balance had therefore reduced to about US$1.8 million, and the July instalments had been paid, albeit mostly late.

The amounts outstanding were US$448,354.81 for the SPAR CAPELLA, US$497,276.29 for the SPAR VEGA and $601,016.05 for the SPAR DRACO, totalling some US$1.5 million.

However GCL’s new letterhead reveals that it maintained the same fax number at its new address as before.  Since the letters were sent by fax, I conclude that they were received by GCL at its new office in Shanghai.  The letters attached copies of the Guarantees.  </p>

It referred to the claim on the Guarantees in the letters recently sent to GCL, and urged GCL to pay all the arrears by 23 September, or at least to pay half and put forward concrete proposals for payment of the balance.  Mr Luo Zhipeng responded by email on 23 September 2011.  He said that 23 September was unrealistic because of the financial pressure on the group to pay off substantial interest owed to banks which was more vital to the survival and sustainable development of the group.  He stated: “I request the owners be more patient until October when financial support will come, in view of the relatively small sum and long-standing cooperative relationship”.  Such a response gave Spar no cause for confidence that there would be any substantial payment in the immediate future.  Mr Luo Zhipeng did not question the existence or validity of the Guarantees; nor did he query the reference in the email to which he was responding to the letters recently sent claiming on the Guarantees and imposing the 23 September deadline, which provides further confirmation that the letters of 16 September were indeed received by GCL.</p>

	    <p class="Mstyle" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Three relevant aspects of Chinese law were in dispute. The first was that Ms Liu contended that the articles of association of GCL required a resolution of the board of directors before the Guarantees could validly be entered into, by reason of article 30(8), which includes within the functions and powers of the board “examining and approving important operational decisions of the company”; accordingly Mr Li did not have, and could not confer on Mr Jia, any authority to execute the Guarantees in the absence of such a resolution.  Mr Yang disputed this interpretation of the articles of association and contended that the Legal Representative has power under article 31(3) to execute important contracts and other important documents of the company irrespective of whether there has been a board resolution.  Mr Yang’s evidence was also that, even if a guarantee is issued otherwise than in accordance with the articles of association, that does not render it null and void and it remains binding on the company.  He identified a decision by the Beijing Higher People’s Court, a decision recommended by the Supreme People’s Court in its published bulletin, which stated and applied this principle.  Decisions made by the Supreme People’s Court, or approved by it, are treated as authoritative.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Mstyle" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On this issue I prefer the evidence of Mr Yang.  Ms Liu’s contention only really emerged in the course of her oral evidence at the hearing; it was not a point taken in either of her written reports or at the experts’ meeting, although if it were a valid point it would have been critical to the questions she was asked to address as to whether GCL was bound by the Guarantees.  In her first report she was unequivocal in stating that if the Guarantees were signed by the Legal Representative they would “certainly” bind the company, without any qualification of the need for a board resolution.  At the experts’ meeting she agreed that the Legal Representative’s behaviour in the name of the company bound the company “unconditionally”.  In her second report she mentioned articles 30(8) and 31(3) of the articles of association and the lack of a board resolution but only for the purposes of making the point that Mr Jia had not been given any express authority to sign the Guarantees, not in support of a wider and more general point that GCL could not be bound in the absence of a board resolution whatever express authority was conferred on Mr Jia by Mr Li.     </p>

	    <p class="Mstyle" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Secondly Mr Yang’s evidence was that there was an established principle that a company was bound by acts of “other personnel” of sufficient seniority (which would include Mr Jia) if they were performed in the course of duty related activity, irrespective of any authorisation by the Legal Representative.  He explained that this was necessary to enable normal business transactions to take place because contracts and business commitments are normally made by personnel at management level and counterparties must be able to assume that such a person has authority.  He said that the principle emanated from Article 43 of the GPCL and Article 58 of the Opinions of the  Supreme People’s Court on Several Issues concerning the implementation of the General Principles of the Civil Law of the People’s Republic of China (Trial Implementation) (“the SPC Opinions”) which provide respectively:</p>

	    <p class="Mstyle" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Mr Yang drew attention to two recent cases decided by the Supreme People’s Court in 2013 which he said illustrated the application of this principle, in which companies had been held bound by duty related activities of “other personnel” at management level.  The first was the Dunhuang Company v Bang Jun Company case, in which a company was held to be bound by a contract signed by its vice general manager without any special authority from the Legal Representative, on the grounds that he was performing a duty related activity.  Although Article 43 GPCL and Article 58 of the Opinions were not specifically mentioned in the judgment, Mr Yang’s evidence was that the duty related activity language and analysis is well known shorthand for the concepts in those articles.  The second SPC decision relied on was the Jia Heng Company case, in which a company was held to be bound by construction confirmation certificates signed by its superintendent engineer on site on the grounds that he was performing a duty related activity. </p>

She relied on a decision of a regional court, the Jiangsu High Court, which Mr Yang dismissed as of no relevance or authority.  </p>

	    <p class="Mstyle" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Again I prefer the evidence of Mr Yang on this issue.  Ms Liu had not given any consideration to these articles until they were drawn to her attention by Mr Yang in his first report.  This was one of a number of aspects of her evidence which gave me less confidence in her opinions than those of Mr Yang, others being her last minute espousal of a requirement for a board resolution, and the introduction, again for the first time in her oral evidence, of reference to and reliance on Article 50 of the Contract Law.  I regard Mr Yang’s view as being supported by the Dunhuang Company v Bang Jun Company case, in which the vice general manager had been “designated” for “participation” in the relevant project but not “authorised to sign [the contract].”  It does not therefore appear to be a case of a chain of delegated express authority from the Legal Representative.  </p>

	    <p class="Mstyle" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Thirdly, there was a dispute as to the potential applicability of the principle, emanating from Article 66 of GPCL, that if a principal is aware that a civil act is being executed in his name but fails to repudiate it, his consent shall be deemed to have been given.  Spar characterised this as a principle akin to implied authority, and therefore an aspect of actual authority which is governed by Chinese law.  GCL contended that this was an aspect of Chinese law akin to ostensible authority and therefore of no relevance because questions of ostensible authority are governed by English law as the putative proper law of the Guarantees.  The dispute between the parties is therefore not so much an issue of Chinese law as an issue of categorisation for the purposes of the application of English conflict of laws rules, albeit informed by the Chinese law on the nature and content of the principle.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_77">

	  <content>
	    <p class="Mstyle" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On this issue I prefer the submissions of Spar.  The relevant part of the article requires two elements.  The first is contemporaneous knowledge by the principal: the article is directed to situations in which the principal knows that the civil act “is being executed in his name”, i.e.  at the time of its execution.  It is distinct from any later ratification which is dealt with earlier in the article.  Secondly there must be an absence of repudiation by the principal.  Again this is directed to the time of execution.  The repudiation does not have to be made or communicated to the other party to the contract or to anyone in particular in order to prevent the principle applying.  What is required is a failure to disavow that the person who is purporting to bind the company is entitled to do so.  The effect of a lack of repudiation is that the principal is “deemed” to have consented to the person who is purporting to bind him in fact doing so.  It is a form of deemed actual authority based on knowledge and silence: the combination means that the principal can be taken to have given his authorisation.  In his first report Mr Yang described it as “implied authority”, before the current debate about categorisation emerged, and for the reasons explained I regard this as the correct categorisation from an English conflict of laws point of view.  The principle is not akin to ostensible authority which is governed by the putative proper law of the contract.  Both Mr Yang and Ms Liu identified a separate principle of ostensible authority under Chinese law which arises under Article 49 of the Contract Law and Article 13 of the SPC Opinions, and is unrelated to Article 66 of the GPCL.  </p>

I have already expressed my conclusion that the obvious inference from this exchange, and from the further exchange on 8 March 2010, is that a board resolution of GCS had taken place on 5 March 2010 following conclusion of the fixture negotiations, in order to give or withhold approval of GCS entering into the charters.  Mr Coburn submitted that the fact that the subject was lifted did not necessarily mean that a board meeting had taken place.  But there would have been little purpose in imposing the subject in the first place unless board approval was regarded as required.  The significance of this is that Mr Li was not only Chairman of GCL, but was also at the time a director of GCS, who would have attended such a board meeting in that capacity and participated in giving approval on behalf of GCS.  The fixture terms made very clear that GCS’s obligations were to be guaranteed by GCL and Mr Li could not have been unaware of this as a member of GCS’s board considering approval of the charters.  He must have known that Guarantees were required to be, and would be, given on behalf of GCL.  </p>

If these required authorisation from Mr Li, the natural inference is that the procedures were followed and such authorisation was sought and granted before any Guarantees were provided.  Mr Kong confirmed on 25 March 2010 that the formalities had been completed.  The natural inference is that whatever authority was required by internal procedures for the execution of the Guarantees by whoever was to sign them had been obtained. </p>

Mr Yang’s unchallenged evidence was that Mr Li’s background was in aviation, whereas Mr Jia’s was in shipping.  It would therefore have been natural for Mr Jia to be in charge of executing Guarantees for long term time charters.  There is no evidence which suggests that Mr Jia was the kind of man who would execute guarantees without being authorised, or of any reason why he would have done so in this instance.  The fact that he did so over the title of Chairman is consistent with his not noticing or being bothered about that inaccuracy given that the draft was prepared by Spar and would have been presented to him in that form.  Mr Coburn referred me to some internet material which raised the suggestion that Mr Jia had subsequently been accused of bribery in relation to a different charter, but Mr Coburn made clear that he did not accuse Spar of involvement in any bribery, and GCL could have been expected to adduce evidence if there were any grounds for even suspicion of bribery in relation to these charters or Guarantees.   </p>

Whilst not accepting Mr Phillips’ submission that such a document retention policy was incredible, nevertheless I find it hard to believe that no documentation survives from the formal compliance and authorisation procedures for those guarantees executed by Mr Jia in other cases, or that copies of those guarantees themselves, which would be important documents, were not preserved in copy.  I am forced to the conclusion that such material has not been provided because those within GCL who are responsible for doing so did not wish the court to see it because it did not assist GCL’s case.</p>

Although he has left GCL, it had access to him as a cooperative and potentially available witness who agreed to provide a statement.  In advance of the trial GCL adduced no evidence as to why Mr Li was not to be called as a witness.  The Court will only take into account evidence, not submission, which is tendered as an explanation for failure to call a witness if advance notice has been given that the court will be invited to draw an adverse inference: see <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Imam-Sadeque v Bluebay Asset Management</span> [2012] EWHC 3511 (QB) at paragraph [10].  In his opening, Mr Coburn submitted on instructions (from what GCL had told his instructing solicitors, not as a result of any direct contact between the solicitors and Mr Li) that Mr Li was unwilling to attend.  Mr Phillips said that he was prepared to treat this as being evidence.  I therefore proceed on the basis that the explanation for his absence is not incapacity or unavailability but simply an unwillingness to give his evidence on oath and face cross examination.  There was no information from GCL, still less evidence, as to why Mr Li was unwilling to give evidence.  Mr Coburn speculated that it might have been the result of a reluctance to travel a long distance to be subjected to an ordeal in a hostile foreign environment.  This is illegitimate speculation, but in any event would not explain an unwillingness to give evidence by video link.  In the absence of further explanation, it is permissible to draw the conclusion that he was unwilling to give his evidence on oath and have the evidence tested by questioning because he did not think it would stand scrutiny.</p>

And again, if so, why was Spar not informed?  What explanation could there be for Mr Jia executing the Guarantees when he knew he was not authorised to do so?  He could hardly have expected the fact that he had done so to be secret from others.

It does not therefore depend on communication with or representation to the third party and is thus in principle distinct from estoppel, but since the intention to ratify must be manifested in some way it will in practice often be communicated to and relied upon by the other party to the transaction. Ratification can no doubt be inferred without difficulty from silence or inactivity in cases where the principal, by failing to disown the transaction, allows a state of affairs to come about which is inconsistent with treating the transaction as unauthorized. That is probably no more than a form of ratification by conduct. Where there is nothing of that kind, however, the position is more difficult since silence or inaction may simply reflect an unwillingness or inability on the part of the principal to commit himself. For that reason it will not usually be sufficient to evidence ratification, nor will it amount to an unequivocal representation sufficient to give rise to an estoppel.’”</p>

	    <p class="Mstyle" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The only reasonable conclusion from the evidence is that during this period, Mr Jia actively and unequivocally adopted as Chairman and Legal Representative the Guarantees which he had signed as Chairman of the Executive Board.  That is sufficient manifestation to ratify the Guarantees if, contrary to my earlier findings, they were not authorised when entered into.  Such conduct is to be inferred from the absence of any internal documentation, or any external communication, which suggests that Mr Jia ever expressed any doubt about the validity of the Guarantees at any time before his departure from GCL in September 2012.  His conduct internally must have amounted to positively accepting their validity because it is unrealistic to suppose that the Guarantees were never known about or discussed by senior management within GCL and HNA.  The Guarantees must have come to the attention of senior management within GCL when Spar called on them on 16 September 2011 at the latest.  It seems probable that they would have done so earlier, as is suggested by Mr Tan’s comments at the meeting at the beginning of August 2011, not least because they were referred to on the face of the charterparties which must have been under discussion when GCL’s cash support of GCS was under consideration.  This conclusion is reinforced by a Lloyd’s List report relied on by GCL, which reports that in April 2012 a number of GCL executives were “punished” for payment disputes affecting the company; it is to be inferred that amongst these were Spar’s claims on the Guarantees.  Mr Jia was said to have “recorded a serious demerit” but remained in his post as Chairman for a further 8 months. </p>

	    <p class="Mstyle" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">GCL’s argument in relation to SAFE was that although the Guarantees are expressly governed by English law, Chinese law is mandatorily applicable because of the provisions of Article 3.3 of the Rome Convention.  Mr Coburn acknowledged a difficulty in articulating any basis on which such provisions could apply to a charter with a Norwegian shipowner requiring payment of hire at a Norwegian bank account. A similar argument was advanced in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Vine</span> [2011] 1 Lloyds Rep 301 and rejected by Teare J for reasons given at paragraphs [172] to [179].  I reject the argument in this case for similar reasons.  In any event, even were SAFE provisions relevant, they would not assist GCL because they do not render a guarantee unenforceable for non registration where the guarantor is at fault, and in this case the fault for not registering the Guarantees lay solely with GCL. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">"That unqualified statement of a general rule comes from a source to which the greatest possible respect is due. It is fortuitous that my own instinct should have coincided with it. However diffident I might have been in relying on instinct alone, the coincidence encourages me to suggest a reason for the rule. It is that it is desirable that the law, at whatever level it is declared, should generally be certain. If a decision of this court, reached after full consideration of an earlier one which went the other way, is normally to be open to review on a third occasion when the same point arises for decision at the same level, there will be no end of it. Why not in a fourth, fifth or sixth case as well? Mr. Barnes had to face that prospect with equanimity or, perhaps to be fairer to him, with resignation. I decline to join him, especially in times when the cost of litigation and the pressure of work on the courts are so great. There must come a time when a point is normally to be treated as having been settled at first instance. I think that that should be when the earlier decision has been fully considered, but not followed, in a later one. Consistently with the modern approach of the judges of this court to an earlier decision of one of their number (see, e.g., <span style="font-style:italic">Police Authority for Huddersfield v. Watson</span> [1947] K.B. 842, 848, per Lord Goddard C.J.), I would make an exception only in the case, which must be rare, where the third judge is convinced that the second was wrong in not following the first. An obvious example is where some binding or persuasive authority has not been cited in either of the first two cases. If that is the rule then, unless the party interested seriously intends to submit that it falls within the exception, the hearing at first instance in the third case will, so far as the point in question is concerned, be a formality, with any argument upon it reserved to the Court of Appeal."</p>

The first is actual breach.  The second and third, commonly termed renunciation and self induced impossibility respectively, are the two forms of anticipatory breach.  </p>

Any breach of a condition will entitle the innocent party to terminate the contract.  Only a sufficiently serious breach of an innominate term will do so, often expressed as one which goes to the root of the contract or one which deprives the innocent party of substantially the whole benefit of the contract.  The expression repudiatory breach is sometimes used to cover only a breach of an innominate term, in distinction to a breach of condition; sometimes it is used to cover both.  I shall use it to cover both.  It is also commonly used to describe the form of anticipatory breach directed to performance of future obligations, which I prefer to call renunciation.  Elision between use of the terms repudiation and renunciation is common in the cases, not least because an actual breach may itself evince an intention not to perform in the future and therefore be renunciatory.  But use of the word repudiatory to refer to conduct which is relevant not as actual breach in the past but only insofar as it casts light on future performance may lead to confusion of thought, and I prefer to use it only to describe a category of actual breach.  </p>

For the purpose of assessing damages, it is the defaulting party’s repudiatory breach or renunciation which is regarded as the cause of the termination, not the innocent party’s election to terminate. </p>

Where the obligation in question falls to be performed by a certain time, the question has often been formulated as "whether time is of the essence”. Other formulations include whether the term is an essential term or a fundamental term, although Lord Diplock who has played a large part in the development of the jurisprudence in this area, uses the expression fundamental breach to connote a repudiatory breach of an innominate term in contradistinction to a breach of condition.  </p>

The consequence is that delay in performance is treated as repudiatory, without regard to the gravity of the breach, such that the injured party may elect to terminate and recover damages in respect of the defaulting party’s outstanding obligations. </p>

Parties may agree that in the event of breach the innocent party should have the right to terminate the contract, so as to put an end to future performance obligations under the contract, but without intending that the defaulting party should be liable for any consequences of the termination.  Such provisions are concerned solely to provide the innocent party with an option to put an end to his performance obligations, but not to confer a right to claim damages flowing from the termination itself.  In such cases it is the innocent party’s election to exercise his option to terminate which is treated as the cause of the termination, and the cause of whatever loss flows from it, not the breach which triggers the innocent party’s right to cancel.  I shall use the expression “option to cancel” to connote such a term, whilst recognising that contractual language couched in terms of cancellation may be equally consistent with an intention to treat the term breached as a condition with the full damages consequences which flow from that analysis.  </p>

In that case a contract for hire purchase of a truck provided for payment of a deposit and monthly instalments over a period of two years.  The hirer failed to pay the first two instalments.  The owner terminated the agreement and retook possession of the truck pursuant to clauses 8 and 9 of the contract which provided that if the hirer failed to pay any instalment within 10 days after it had become due “the owner may by written notice forthwith and for all purposes terminate the hiring” and “without notice retake possession” of the truck.  Having retaken possession and sold the truck at a loss, the owner claimed damages representing the difference between the two years’ hire due under the contract and the resale price.  It was held that the owner was confined to a claim for the two instalments which had fallen due prior to the termination.  The owner argued, among other things, that the effect of the clause giving the right to terminate was to elevate the term providing for punctual payment to the status of a condition (see p.108).  This argument was rejected.  At pp. 110 – 111, Lord Denning said:</p>

I see no difference in this respect between the letting of a vehicle on hire and the letting of land on a lease. If a lessor, under a proviso for re-entry, re-enters on the ground of non-payment of rent or of disrepair, he gets the arrears of rent up to the date of re-entry and damages for want of repair at that date, but he does not get damages for loss of rent or for breaches of repair thereafter.”</p>

But if there is no repudiation, and simply, as here, a failure to pay one or two instalments (the failure not going to the root of the contract and only giving a right to terminate by virtue of an express stipulation in the contract), the owners can only recover the instalments in arrear, with interest, and nothing else; for there was no other breach in existence at the termination of the hiring.”</p>

There are important differences between a time charter and a hire purchase agreement.  Moreover the contract in that case provided for termination upon events which were not confined to breaches; and there was a clause providing for interest on late payment which Diplock LJ treated as significant in indicating that time of payment was not intended to be of the essence.  These are significant distinctions.  The case does, however, illustrate that the mere fact that a contractual right of termination is conferred for any breach of a term, however trivial, does not answer the question whether the term is a condition.  </p>

The wording of the withdrawal clause was essentially the same as that in the 1946 New York Produce Exchange form.

That argument is fallacious. The non-payment of the hire was not the cause of loss, if any, incurred by the owner through not getting possession of his ship till January 23. The real cause was his own act in withdrawing his ship of his own volition on January 11 when he was well able to make an advantageous choice between leaving control to the charterers and assuming it himself. Having done that act, presumably with a just view of his own interest, he cannot rely upon it as giving him a right to damages.”</p>

The charterparty was on the Baltime form providing “in default of such payment the owners shall have the faculty of withdrawing [the vessel] from the service of the charterers”.  The charterers argued that the damages were caused by owners’ decision to withdraw rather than the non payment of hire.

For my part I do not think that the case provides even this limited assistance.  Greer J was not concerned to decide whether <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">any</span> breach of the hire obligation gave rise to a right to terminate, and his determination that the non payment was repudiatory in that case is at most neutral on whether the term was a condition.  The decision was that where non payment of hire is repudiatory, the exercise of the contractual right to withdraw does not cut down the entitlement to loss of bargain damages which exists independently of the clause.  As such, it does not advance the current debate.  </p>

The clause in that case was on the Baltime form providing for payment of cash in London, but the practice of the owners had been to accept payment by cheque.  Hire fell due on 27 September 1939 and a cheque was posted from Belgium on 25 September, but due to the outbreak of the war it did not arrive until October.  In the meantime the owners withdrew the vessel on 30 September.  The House of Lords held that the owners were not entitled to withdraw because the charterers had performed the hire payment obligation in accordance with accepted practice by sending a cheque by post.

The duty to pay is unqualified so far as the express terms of the charterparty go. I think this is the true construction of the terms of the contract, and it is confirmed by the cases cited in argument. A dictum or decision of Bigham J. in <span style="font-style:italic">Nova Scotia Steel Co., Ld. v. Sutherland Steam Shipping Co., Ld</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">. </span>(1899) 5 Com. Cas. 106, has been relied upon as an authority that a certain latitude was permissible so that payment made two days after the due date did not constitute a default in payment. But I cannot agree that so drastic a departure from the specific words of the charter can be supported. In that case the clause provided for regular and punctual payment: these adjectives however add nothing to the stringency of the simple and unqualified language in the charter before this House. I think that so much of Bigham J’s judgment as conceded a latitude as to the date of payment is erroneous in law and should be overruled. The importance of this advance payment to be made by the charterers, is that it is the substance of the consideration given to the shipowner for the use and service of the ship and crew which the shipowner agrees to give. He is entitled to have the periodical payment as stipulated in advance of his performance so long as the charterparty continues. Hence the stringency of his right to cancel.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.01in">I cannot attach the same significance to the passage.  What is said here, and in passages in the later authorities identifying the importance to owners of full and punctual advance payment of hire, is that they afford good reasons for construing a clause conferring the right to withdraw as having the stringency which its clear language suggests.  They explain why there should be no inclination to construe the words in the withdrawal clause which trigger the right to withdraw with any latitude, or otherwise in accordance with their plain terms.  If the owner is not paid fully and on time in advance, effect should be given to the right for which he has bargained, in unqualified terms, no longer to provide the services of the master and crew to the defaulting charterer, and to be free to employ his vessel elsewhere.  But this says little, if anything, about whether a trivial breach should additionally carry with it a liability on the charterers to pay damages in respect of the unexpired term of the charter.  If full and punctual advance payment of hire is the lifeblood of the owner, on which he is entitled to insist, a withdrawal clause which amounts to an option to cancel adequately protects this commercial interest: once exercised the owner is free to employ his vessel elsewhere, trusting to the performance of a different charterer to pay hire fully and punctually in advance.  I see nothing in the owner’s interest which is not adequately protected by an option to cancel.  This interest does not require the term to be construed as a condition, and nothing in the passage from Lord Wright’s speech suggests such an analysis.  There is no mention of the term being one making time of the essence, or being an essential term.  The passage, and those in subsequent authorities which emphasise the importance to owners of full and punctual advance payment of hire, are to my mind equally consistent with a withdrawal clause being an option to cancel, which is to be construed as having the stringency which its unqualified language suggests whilst not treating the non-payment as conferring any additional rights or obligations which would not exist apart from the withdrawal clause.  </p>

In that case the clause provided for hire to be payable to the owners’ London bank and the accepted method of payment was by tender of a banker’s payment order from the charterers’ correspondent bank.  The relevant instalment fell due by midnight on a Saturday.  As a result of charterer’s mistaken belief that because banks were shut on a Saturday, payment on the following Monday would be timeous, the banker’s payment order was not tendered until the Monday morning.  The owner’s bank, in accordance with owners’ instructions, refused to accept payment on the Monday and owners then gave notice of withdrawal that evening.  The parties first came to the Commercial Court on Wednesday of the following week, the trial with oral evidence was concluded on the Friday, with Donaldson J giving judgment after the weekend only a fortnight after the events in dispute.  He observed that “The Commercial Court exists to serve the national and international community.  It has no other purpose.

Nevertheless Donaldson J and the Court of Appeal were addressing an argument by Mr Hobhouse QC, as he then was, that the effect of the withdrawal clause was to treat the payment of hire as a condition.  The  argument at first instance is recorded as being that “the charterparty imposes an obligation on the charterers to pay hire in advance, that time is of the essence, and that breach of this obligation gives rise to a contractual right to end the charterparty” (p. 494C).  In the Court of Appeal, where the argument is reported more fully, it is clear that Mr Hobhouse was arguing that non payment of hire was a breach of condition at common law given the terms of the clause, and that <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Petrofina</span> was authority on the same clause to that effect: see p. 498C-F, 501F-G, and the responsive argument of Mr Staughton QC, as he then was, for the charterers recorded at p. 500E-H.  </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">“It is important to remember that in relation to the payment of hire under a time charterparty, time is of the essence of the contract only in the sense that there is a breach of contract if payment is a moment late. It is not of the essence of the contract in the sense that late payment goes to the root of the contract and is a repudiating breach giving rise to a common law right in the owners to treat the contract as at an end. The right to withdraw the vessel and thus bring the charterparty to an end is contractual and the situations in which this right is exercisable depend upon the true construction of the contract. In the present case the words are ‘In default of payment’. Does this mean ‘If there has been default in payment’ or does it mean ‘Whilst there is default in payment’? If it means the former, a shipowner can take his time considering whether or not to withdraw the vessel and there is no action which the charterer can take to retrieve the position, although a stage will eventually be reached when, in the absence of a withdrawal of the vessel, it can be said that the owner has waived his rights. If it means the latter, the owner can still withdraw the vessel if he acts promptly, but the charterer can retrieve the situation if he pays or tenders the hire before the owner acts. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">“The effect of a stipulation as to time always depends on the true construction of the contract. A default in payment does not automatically give the other a right to determine it. Usually it does not do so. It only does so if there is an express provision giving the right to determine, or if the non-payment is such as to amount to a repudiation of the contract. That is shown by <span style="font-style:italic">Martindale v. Smith,</span> (1841) 1 Q.B. 389; and by the well-known judgment of Lord Blackburn in <span style="font-style:italic">Mersey Steel and Iron Company (Ltd.) v. Naylor, Benzon &amp; Co</span>., (1884) 9 App. Cas. 434, at p. 444. In the present case the non-payment was clearly not such as to amount to repudiation. It was obviously a mistake. The charterers thought that as the banks were closed on Saturday and Sunday, Monday would do. They were wrong in so thinking. But they were not repudiating the contract. Then does the clause itself give the shipowners the right to withdraw? I think it does, as the <span style="font-style:italic">Tankexpress</span> case shows, provided always that they exercise the right before payment is made or tendered. I think in this clause the words “in default of payment” mean “in default of payment and so long as default continues”. It means that the owners have the option — so long as the charterers are in default — to withdraw the vessel. But, once the charterers remedy their default, by paying the instalment or tendering it, the owners have no right to withdraw.”</p>

The charterparty was on the NYPE 1946 form and clause 5 provided for hire to be paid monthly in advance in cash to Morgan Guarantee Trust (“MGT”) in New York for the credit of the owners’ account and that “failing the punctual and regular payment of the hire . . . or any breach of this charterparty, the owners shall be at liberty to withdraw the vessel . . . without prejudice to any claim they . . . may have on the charterers”.  The dispute which arose concerned the alleged late payment of the monthly instalment of hire payable on 1 April 1970.  The charterers’ bank, Hambros, usually used a method of transferring funds which involved their sending a telex to MGT, with whom they had an account, asking them to pay the hire to the owners’ account, specifying the value date.  On receipt of the telex MGT would carry out a process resulting in Hambros’ account being debited and the owners’ account credited with the relevant dollar amount.  Debit and credit advices would be sent to Hambros and the owners’ London agents respectively.  At the trial before Brandon J it was in dispute between the owners and the charterers when the time of payment was under this method of transfer.  The charterers contended it was the time of receipt on MGT’s telex machine of Hambros’ order to pay or, if the telex came before the value date, when MGT first opened for business on the value date.  The owners contended that the time of payment was later, when MGT took the decision to debit Hambros’ account and credit the owners’ account.  Even on the charterers’ case the 1 April 1970 payment was paid late.  The owners withdrew the vessel. </p>

This involved complex and contested issues of fact and law which were the subject of extensive evidence on both sides at trial.  Brandon J concluded that the time of payment was, as the owners contended, when MGT made the decision to debit Hambros’ account and credit the owners’ account (page 402C) and that the notice of withdrawal was received by the charterers before payment was made (page 406B to D).  He then said at page 406E: “In dealing with the rights of the parties I shall proceed primarily on the basis that the withdrawal was before the payment. I shall, however, consider also what those rights would be if I am wrong about that and either the payment was before the withdrawal or the evidence leaves in doubt which of the two events preceded the other”.</p>

Charterers relied on the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Georgios C</span> in respect of the first and third arguments, contending that it was authority that the term was not a condition, and that the clause was to be construed as applicable only for so long as hire was not paid or tendered. </p>

These were, first, the use in relation to the word ‘payment’ of the epithets ‘punctual’ and ‘regular’, and, secondly, the presence of the words ‘or any breach of this charterparty’. As regards the epithets ‘punctual’ and ‘regular’ he said that these emphasised the importance of the obligation, and he relied, in support of this proposition, on <span style="font-style:italic">Maclaine v Gatty</span> [1921] 1 AC 376 and particularly on the observations of Viscount Finlay, at p 389. As regards the words ‘or any breach of this charterparty’ he said that it was necessary to imply the words ‘in the event of’ between the words ‘or’ and ‘any’, and that what was then meant was that, in the event of a breach of any essential term of the charterparty, other than failure to pay hire punctually, the owners should have the right to withdraw the ship. It followed that failure to pay hire punctually was being treated as being in the same category as breach of any other essential term. Against that Mr Goff contended that the use of the epithets ‘punctual’ and ‘regular’ added nothing or little to the word ‘payment’ standing alone; and that reservation of an express right of withdrawal for failure to pay hire tended to show that the obligation was not otherwise of such a character as to be an essential term. </p>

I agree that the judgments contain nothing to indicate that Mr Evans addressed the condition point as a separate argument.  Nevertheless the repudiation ground was maintained by Mr Evans, even if with little enthusiasm (the report suggests that it was described by Mr Evans in argument as “academic since no damages have been claimed by the owners”) and all three members of the Court must have had in mind the alternative route to common law termination, that of breach of condition, which was separately addressed by Brandon J in the judgment being appealed and expressly adverted to as part of the owners’ pleaded case by Edmund Davies LJ in the passage quoted above.  Even if one were to treat the condition point as conceded by owners in the Court of Appeal, I regard it as significant that no member of the Court expressed any reservation about that aspect of Brandon J’s decision, which if wrong would have rendered the debate on the construction point otiose and meant that the argument on repudiation was conducted and addressed on the false footing that payment of hire was an innominate term.  The decision involves at least implicit approval by a strong Court of Appeal of Brandon J’s decision that payment of hire was not a condition.  </p>

The umpire determined that the charterers’ deduction for the speed claim was excessive, such that there had been a default in payment of hire.

In support of this argument it was contended that the payment of hire was a condition precedent to performance by the owners and that the obligations of the charterers to pay hire in advance and of continued performance were concurrent conditions requiring mutuality.

I think there is much weight in Mr. Pollock’s argument that if the word “withdrawal” bore the construction sought to be placed upon it by Mr. Hallgarten so as to include temporary withdrawal or suspension, this would inevitably have come up for decision in the Courts before now. The Courts seem to have treated the word “withdrawal” as equivalent to “cancellation", an interpretation which, if I may say so with respect, seems to me the natural one.”</p>

Again the market had risen substantially since the date of the charter and the only issue was the owners’ right to withdraw, not any claim for damages.  The arbitrators and Donaldson J held that the owners were entitled to withdraw, the Court of Appeal by a majority that they were not.  Lord Denning, in the majority, gave as one ground that the withdrawal clause was a forfeiture clause and that the law will not enforce such a clause after payment or tender, relying on a previous dictum of his to that effect in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Georgios C</span>.  The House of Lords allowed the appeal, holding that the right to withdraw accrued the moment the charterers were in default of payment and the right to withdraw remained exercisable for a reasonable time thereafter, in the absence of waiver, despite the late tender or payment of hire by the charterers in the meantime.  </p>

The freights are collected by the charterer; the shipowner never sees these profits. The shipowner is not obliged to perform the services on credit; he does so only against advance payment.  He stipulates for and is entitled to advance payment monthly or fortnightly. He is not obliged to provide the services here for a given fortnight until he has had payment in full in respect of it: see <span style="font-style:italic">Tankexpress A/S v.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.01in">To these may be added two further reasons why prompt payment of hire in advance may be of importance to owners. First it is commonplace for vessels to be mortgaged on terms which require punctual payment of instalments to the bank, with any default triggering acceleration of repayment of the loan and the bank’s right to realise its security by selling the mortgaged vessel.  Where the owners are part of a group owning a fleet of vessels there may be cross default provisions, such that any one failure to meet a repayment instalment to one bank in respect of one vessel may have this effect across part or all of the fleet.  Punctual payment of hire is of importance to owners in such circumstances in order to meet their financing obligations.  Secondly, the term must bear the same categorisation where it appears in an intermediate charter in a string of time charters, which are sometimes on back to back terms save as to rates, as it bears in the head charter or where there is no string.  Where hire is due to a disponent owner under an intermediate charter, the disponent owner may be dependent upon punctual receipt to fulfil his own hire obligations to pay hire under the head charterparty.  </p>

The hire clause was in bespoke terms providing for withdrawal “in default of payment”.  The payment of hire for the final instalment was deficient because, as the umpire held, the charterers’ deductions for the length of the final voyage and bunkers on board at redelivery were unreasonable.  Before Kerr J and in the appeals there was no dispute that there was a default in payment of hire and the argument was addressed to whether owners had waived the right to withdraw in reliance on the withdrawal clause.  In the Court of Appeal Lord Denning and Eveleigh LJ held, for different reasons, that they had waived the right, with Geoffrey Lane LJ dissenting.  The House of Lords allowed the appeal.  At pp. 1024H-1025A Lord Diplock criticised Lord Denning’s approach to the whole case as coloured by a view that withdrawal clauses contained the “distasteful characteristics” of a forfeiture clause which would justify the court finding one or other of a variety of excuses for refusing to give effect to it.  Lord Salmon said at p. 1032B-G:</p>

These forms of charter are undoubtedly very strict in relation to the due payment of hire: their meaning, however, is perfectly clear and it is not permissible to put a construction upon them which would depart from that meaning. Unless the full amount of hire is paid by its due date the owners have the undoubted right to withdraw their vessel providing they do so within a reasonable time of the charterers’ default. The only exception is when the parties by their course of conduct (a) have as in the present case accepted that disbursements made by the charterers in respect of the owners’ liabilities may be deducted from the hire subject to vouchers being produced, or e.g., (b) have accepted as in <span style="font-style:italic">Tankexpress A/S v. Compagnie Financière Belge des Petroles S.A.</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"> </span>[1949] A.C. 76 that the amount of hire posted two days before it falls due shall be deemed to have been paid in time. Otherwise, unless the full hire is paid by the time it falls due the charterers are in default and the vessel may be withdrawn. On the appeal to your Lordships’ House in <span style="font-style:italic">The Laconia</span> [1977] A.C. 850 I ventured to point out that the law relating to the owners’ rights under a Baltime form of charter to withdraw their vessel should the charterers fail to pay the hire in time had been clearly stated by your Lordships’ House in the <span style="font-style:italic">Tankexpress</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"> </span>case; but that a great deal of doubt on the subject had since been generated by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">The Georgios C</span> [1971] 1 Q.B. 488 and had troubled the waters ever since. I expressed the hope that those doubts might finally be dispelled by your Lordships’ reversal of the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span style="font-style:italic">The Laconia</span> and overruling its decision in <span style="font-style:italic">The Georgios C</span>. These doubts were, however, temporarily revivified by the decision of the Court of Appeal in the present case but will now, I think, permanently be laid to rest by your Lordships’ decision allowing this appeal; Certainty of meaning is of primary importance in all commercial transactions. Commercial contracts all over the world, having nothing to do with the United Kingdom, have for generations provided that any dispute arising under the contract shall be decided in the English commercial court or by arbitration in London according to English law. This is because of the confidence which exists throughout the commercial world in the administration of English justice. I fear that this confidence will hardly be strengthened should there be any further decisions in the Court of Appeal similar to those in <span style="font-style:italic">The Georgios C, The Laconia</span> and the instant case.”</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.01in">I make two observations about this passage.  First, it emphasises that the terms of a right of withdrawal are a matter for contractual bargain between the parties, and presupposes that payment of hire would not be treated as a condition absent such a contractually negotiated right of termination.  Secondly, Lord Salmon there seems to contemplate that the principal risk to charterers from a stringent clause is losing a profitable charter in a risen market, not an exposure to damages in a fallen market, an approach which assumes that the clause is an option to cancel, rather than conferring on the payment term the status of condition so as to give rise to a common law right of termination and damages.  If payment of hire were a condition entitling owners to terminate at common law and claim damages, charterers’ exposure would be just as great if the market had fallen as if it had risen.  On a risen market the charterers would bear the market difference by having to charter in at a higher rate; in a fallen market charterers would have to pay owners for the fall in the rate as damages for repudiation. </p>

Hire was due on 22 January, at which time the charterers’ bank had made a telex transfer of the instalment to owners’ bank for value on 26 January.  This was held by the House of Lords not to constitute timeous payment under the clause because owners’ access to the funds on 22 January was not unconditional, with the result that owners’ withdrawal of the vessel on 24 January was valid.  Lord Bridge, giving the leading speech, observed that exercises of judicial ingenuity to mitigate the rigours of shipowners’ rights to withdraw vessels for non payment of hire had not had a happy history.  He cited the passage from Lord Wright in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Petrofina</span> which I have quoted above, referring to the importance of advance hire to owners in justifying “the stringency of the right to cancel”, and of Lord Salmon in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Laconia</span> stressing the importance of certainty in commercial transactions (p. 321B-H).  </p>

The last day for payment of hire was 14 June.  On 11 June the charterers instructed their bank to remit the hire due on 14 June to the owners’ bank in London as required by clause 5.  The charterers’ bank purported to comply by sending a telex transfer to the owners’ London bank on 13 June, but in error, the telex was sent to a sand and silica merchant in Reigate.  The owners served a 48 hour notice at 16.40 on 14 June, to which the charterers replied that the hire had been sent by telex transfer.  When payment had still not been received on 18 June, the owners withdrew the vessel.  The error in relation to the telex was only discovered on 19 June.  The dispute concerned whether the 48 hour notice had been given prematurely.  Both the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords held that it had, since at 16.40 on 14 June, the charterers were not yet in breach of clause 5.  Of relevance to the present debate is owners’ argument that the charterers were in anticipatory breach of contract when the notice was served having disabled themselves from paying the hire that day by 16.40, because that was after banking hours.

The first part of the clause imposes upon the respondents as charterers a primary obligation to pay the “said hire” (which by cl. 4 had been fixed at a monthly rate and pro-rata for any part of a month) punctually and regularly in advance by semi-monthly instalments in the manner specified, which would involve the payment of a minimum of 42 and a maximum of 54 instalments, during the period of the charter. Failure to comply with this primary obligation by delay in payment of one instalment is incapable in law of amounting to a “fundamental breach” of contract by the charterers in the sense to which I suggested in <span style="font-style:italic">Photo Production Ltd. v. Securicor Transport Ltd.,</span> [1980] 1 Lloyd’s Rep. 545; [1980] A.C. 827 at pp. 553 and 849, this expression, if used as a term of legal art, ought to be confined. The reason is that such delay in payment of one half-monthly instalment would not have the effect of depriving the owners of substantially the whole benefit which it was the intention of the parties that the owners should obtain from the unexpired period of the time charter extending over a period of between 21 and 27 months.</p>

The owners are to be at liberty to withdraw the vessel from the service of the charterers; in other words they are entitled to treat the breach when it occurs as a breach of condition and so giving them the right to elect to treat it as putting an end to all their own primary obligations under the charter-party then remaining unperformed. But although failure by the charterers in punctual payment of any instalment, however brief the delay involved may be, is made a breach of condition it is not also thereby converted into a fundamental breach; and it is to fundamental breaches alone that the doctrine of anticipatory breach is applicable.”</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.01in">In this passage Lord Diplock uses the expression “fundamental breach” as connoting a repudiatory breach of an innominate term in contradistinction to the species of repudiatory breach comprising breach of condition.  He had recently expressed the view in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Photo Production Ltd v Securicor Transport Ltd</span> [1980] AC 827 at 849D-F that the expression “fundamental breach” should be confined to such use and not extend to breach of condition.  His statement that it is to fundamental breaches alone, in this sense, that the doctrine of anticipatory breach is applicable, is problematic: see the discussion in <span style="font-style:italic">Treitel The Law of Contract</span> 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> edn at 17-083.  I find it difficult to reconcile with the principled explanation of the rationale underlying the doctrine of anticipatory breach in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Universal Carriers v Citati</span>, namely that the innocent party is entitled to assume that there will inevitably happen that which the other party has made clear he intends to happen, and so does not have to wait until the inevitable occurs: see pp. 436-438.

This raises the question whether, as the editors of Wilford on <span style="font-style:italic">Time Charters</span> had suggested as a possible interpretation prior to the decision in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Astra</span>, this passage merely treats the clause as one which gives rise to a contractual right of termination because it confers a right to terminate in the same circumstances as a right to terminate would arise if payment were a condition.  In <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Astra</span> at paragraph [91] Flaux J described the latter argument as an impermissible gloss.  I agree.  Whilst I would have been attracted to such an interpretation solely on a reading of the language used taken in isolation, the passage must be read in the light of Lord Diplock’s clearly stated view in an obiter dictum five years earlier in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">United Scientific Holdings v Burnley Borough Council</span> [1978] AC 904 at 924 that “in a charterparty a stipulated time of payment is of the essence” and his careful use of language distinguishing a fundamental breach from a breach of condition in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Photo Production</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Afovos</span> itself, and again later in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Antaios</span> (see below).

			<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">“All the analogies that ingenuity has suggested may be discovered between a withdrawal clause in a time charter and other classes of contractual provisions in which courts have relieved parties from the rigour of contractual terms into which they have entered can in my view be shown upon juristic analysis to be false. Prima facie parties to a commercial contract bargaining on equal terms can make “time to be of the essence” of the performance of any primary obligation under the contract that they please, whether the obligation be to pay a sum of money or to do something else. When time is made of the essence of a primary obligation, failure to perform it punctually is a breach of a condition of the contract which entitles the party not in breach to elect to treat the breach as putting an end to all primary obligations under the contract that have not already been performed. In <span style="font-style:italic">Tankexpress A/S v. Compagnie Financière Belge des Petroles S.A.</span> [1949] A.C. 76 this House held that time was of the essence of the very clause with which your Lordships are now concerned where it appeared in what was the then current predecessor of the Shelltime 3 charter. As is well-known, there are available on the market a number of so-(mis)called “anti-technicality clauses,” such as that considered in <span style="font-style:italic">The Afovos</span>, which require the shipowner to give a specified period of notice to the charterer in order to make time of the essence of payment of advance hire; but at the expiry of such notice, provided it is validly given, time does become of the essence of the payment.”</p>

Their reasons can be adequately summarised as being (1) that “any other breach of this charter party” in the withdrawal clause means a repudiatory breach - that is to say: a fundamental breach of an innominate term or breach of a term expressly stated to be a condition, such as would entitle the shipowners to elect to treat the contract as wrongfully repudiated by the charterers, a category into which in the arbitrators’ opinion the breaches complained of did not fall, and (2) that even if that were wrong, the word “on” immediately preceding “any other breach” meant “within a reasonable time of” their first knowledge of the breach; and the shipowners, in the arbitrators’ opinion, had not given notice of withdrawal until after such reasonable time had expired.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.01in"> The case does not bear directly on whether payment of hire is a condition, but I mention it for three reasons.  First it is further evidence of Lord Diplock’s terminology using the expression “fundamental breach” as the species of repudiatory breach which is a breach of an innominate term, in contradistinction to breach of a condition.  Secondly, the wording of the NYPE 1993 form clause has been revised to replace “any breach” with “any fundamental breach”.  This might be taken to be a conscious adoption of the effect and language of <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Antaios</span>, including Lord Diplock’s terminology; if so it would suggest that the second half of the clause in the new form is narrower than the interpretation put upon the 1946 form as applying to any repudiatory breach whether a fundamental breach or a breach of condition, a point to which I will return when considering arguments on the language of clause 11.  Thirdly, Rix LJ later referred to <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Antaios</span> as supportive of there being a good argument that payment of hire was a condition.

The latter basis succeeded in the Supreme Court.  Counsel for the owners, Mr Eder QC as he then was, made clear that in arguing the case for damages for non payment of hire he was not arguing that it was a breach of condition.  At first instance ([2010] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 87) Andrew Smith J said at paragraphs [37]-[38]:</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">In presenting this part of the owners’ argument, Mr Eder emphasised that the owners do not contend that it was a repudiation of the charterparty not to pay hire, at least in the case of a failure to pay for as short a period as in this case. The point is not straightforward: as Rix LJ said in <span style="font-style:italic">Stocznia Gdanska SA v Latvian Shipping Co</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"> </span>[2002] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 436 at para 80, there must be a good argument that ‘the express right to withdraw in the case of unpunctual payment under such a clause is a breach of a condition of the contract, breach of which is in itself repudiatory’. However, the general view is, I think, that a failure to pay hire when it is due is a breach of an intermediate term, and not necessarily repudiatory and does not in itself entitle the owner to claim damages for loss resulting from the termination of the charterparty: see <span style="font-style:italic">Time Charters, </span>2008, 6th Edition, at paras 16.128 and 16.132. Even if the owners had argued otherwise and I had been persuaded to award damages for such loss, the damages resulting from the termination of the charterparty would not be based upon the market rate of hire but the contractual rate, and no such claim has been advanced.</p>

I agree with the charterers’ submission that, once the breach is not said to be repudiatory, it is an answer to the claim that the loss was not effectively caused by their failure to pay hire on time because the owners’ decision to withdraw the vessel breaks the chain of causation. This is, I think, why Lord Denning MR said in <span style="font-style:italic">Tropwind AG of Zug v Jade Enterprises Ltd (The Tropwood) (No 2)</span> [1982] I Lloyd’s Rep 232 at page 237 (in a passage to which I refer further below): ‘The damages for such a breach would be trifling’.”</p>

Nevertheless both Lord Sumption and Lord Mance, whose experience in this area of the law is considerable, expressed the view that payment of hire was not a condition.  Lord Phillips and Lord Walker agreed with Lord Sumption (as did Lord Clarke although expressed on more limited grounds).  Lord Sumption said at paragraphs [6]-[7]</p>

That was a decision made at their own election and for their own commercial purposes. The owners, it is said, must bear the adverse as well as the beneficial consequences of an optional decision made in their own interest. It is clear that this consideration influenced both courts below, and that it was decisive in the minds of the Court of Appeal.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">The factual premise of the argument is of course correct. It is axiomatic that a withdrawal clause operates at the election of owners, and not automatically. Two main consequences follow from this. The first is that owners will not exercise their right of withdrawal unless it is in their commercial interest to do so. Usually, this will be because market rates of hire have risen. But it may be in owners’ interest to withdraw the vessel even if they have not risen, for example, where the charterers are insolvent or owners depend on prompt payment to fund payments under a head charter or charterers’ payment record occasions administrative or other difficulties. The second consequence is that any failure on the part of the charterers to pay hire when it falls due will not of itself entitle the owners to damages representing the loss of the bargain or the expenses of termination simply because the owners respond by withdrawing the vessel. This is because the non-payment does not itself destroy the bargain or occasion the expenses, unless in the circumstances it is a repudiation which owners have accepted as such. But the present claim is not a claim for damages, and the non-payment of the June 2008 hire payment in this case was not a repudiation. This, however, is as much as can usefully be said. The fact that rather than perform the contract the owners found it more advantageous to exercise an express right of termination is morally and legally neutral. There are no standards by which the owners’ reasons may be judged, other than those to be found in the contract. There is no legal policy specific to termination rights restricting their availability or the consequences of their exercise more narrowly than does the language of the contract or the general law. More generally, the reasons for any particular withdrawal cannot affect the principle to be applied in resolving an issue like the present one.”</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">The general contractual context in my view also supports a conclusion that the express indemnity clause is inapt to apply to the present situation. Clause 8 of the charterparty gives owners a simple contractual option. It is accepted that the mere late payment of one instalment did not constitute a repudiatory breach (or a breach of a condition in a sense like that used in the Sale of Goods Act 1979) which could entitle the owners to damages for loss of the charter. That loss flowed from the owners’ exercise of their option to withdraw. The phrase in clause 8 “without prejudice to any claim owners may otherwise have on charterers under this charter” does not create a right of action, and looks on its face only to pre-existing claims. So there is no way in which the time spent discharging in Angra dos Reis can be claimed as damages.”</p>

His analysis begins by equating events which are sufficiently serious to bring a contract to an end for breach with those which are sufficiently serious for frustration, and treats the various metaphors used to define such seriousness as encapsulated in a test of whether the event deprives the party of substantially the whole benefit of the contract (p.66).

And such a stipulation, unless the parties have agreed that breach of it shall not entitle the non-defaulting party to treat the contract as repudiated, is a “condition.” So too there may be other simple contractual undertakings of which it can be predicated that no breach can give rise to an event which will deprive the party not in default of substantially the whole benefit which it was intended that he should obtain from the contract; and such a stipulation, unless the parties have agreed that breach of it shall entitle the non- defaulting party to treat the contract as repudiated, is a  “warranty.”</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.01in">This passage identifies that a term is to be categorised as a condition only if any predicated breach would deprive the innocent party of substantially the whole benefit of the contract, in the absence of agreement between the parties that a breach shall entitle the innocent party to treat the contract as repudiated.  This qualification is not to be elevated into a principle that a contractual right of termination on any breach of the term is indicative that it is a condition.  To have such effect it must be an agreement that the breach shall “entitle the defaulting party to treat the contract as repudiated”, in the words of Diplock LJ.  A contractual right to terminate may or may not be such an agreement, depending upon its proper construction; it may be no more than an option to cancel, as Diplock LJ himself made clear in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Financings v Baldock</span> a year later.  I would therefore reject the submission of counsel for the owners in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Astra</span>, recorded at paragraph [39], that the logical corollary of Diplock LJ’s analysis of what constitutes a condition is that if the contract provides for a right to terminate, that is a very strong indication that the term in question is a condition.  This seems to me to turn the passage on its head.  The essential test proposed is whether the term is one any predicated breach of which deprives the innocent party of substantially the whole benefit of the contract.  This may be modified by the agreement of the parties that a breach will entitle the innocent party to treat the contract <span style="font-style:italic">as repudiated</span>.  A contractual termination clause may be one which provides that the agreement is to be treated as repudiated at common law, or may be one which treats the contract as cancelled in futuro as a matter of contractual option.  Which of two consequences is intended is a question which falls to be considered as a matter of interpretation of the termination provision and the other terms of the contract.  The mere existence of a termination provision tells one nothing about the status of the term without discovering the intention of the parties as to the consequences of the contractual right of termination by this process of interpretation.  </p>

Buyers were required to give 15 days notice of readiness of a vessel to lift the shipments at a loading port thereafter to be nominated by the sellers.  The first monthly shipment was extended to June, the last day for shipment by sellers being 30 June, and consequently the last date for notice of readiness of a vessel to be given by buyers, allowing for loading time, was 12 June.  Notice was not given by buyers until 17 June, 5 days late.  Sellers treated the buyers as in default and claimed damages for repudiation on the ground that the notice of readiness term was a condition, a contention which succeeded in the Court of Appeal and House of Lords.  In the Court of Appeal ([1980] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 294) Megaw LJ gave the leading judgment, which was subsequently expressly endorsed by the House of Lords in the speeches of Lord Wilberforce and Lord Roskill.  He took as his starting point (p.303 col 1) that it was an accepted principle of English law that in a contract for the sale of goods the seller’s stipulated time of delivery is prima facie of the essence, citing in support Lord Diplock’s speech in the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">United Scientific Holdings</span> case, and reasoned that since the purpose of the buyers’ notice of readiness was to give the sellers what the parties agreed was a reasonable time in order for them to make arrangements to perform this delivery condition, the giving of timeous notice of readiness by the buyers must be just as much a condition as was the shipment obligation of the sellers (p. 303 col 2).  At p. 305 Col 2 Megaw LJ expressed disagreement with Diplock LJ's formulation of the test in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Hongkong Fir</span> insofar as it suggested that a term could only be a condition if it deprived the other party of substantially the whole benefit of the contract, drawing attention to <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Bowes v.

The fundamental fallacy of the appellants’ argument lies in attempting to apply this analysis to a time clause such as the present in a mercantile contract which is totally different in character. As to such a clause there is only one kind of breach possible, namely, to be late, and the questions which have to be asked are, first, what importance have the parties expressly ascribed to this consequence and secondly, in the absence of expressed agreement, what consequence ought to be attached to it having regard to the contract as a whole. </p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The test suggested by the appellants was a different one. One must consider, they said, the breach actually committed and then decide whether that default would deprive the party not in default of substantially the whole benefit of the contract. They invoked even certain passages in the judgment of Diplock L.J. in the <span style="font-style:italic">Hongkong Fir</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"> </span>case [1962] 2 Q.B. 26 to support it. One may observe in the first place that the introduction of a test of this kind would be commercially most undesirable. It would expose the parties, after a breach of one, two, three, seven and other numbers of days to an argument whether this delay would have left time for the seller to provide the goods. It would make it, at the time, at least difficult, and sometimes impossible, for the supplier to know whether he could do so. It would fatally remove from a vital provision in the contract that certainty which is the most indispensable quality of mercantile contracts and lead to a large increase in arbitrations. It would confine the seller—perhaps after arbitration and reference through the courts—to a remedy in damages which might be extremely difficult to quantify. These are all serious objections in practice. But I am clear that the submission is unacceptable in law. The judgment of Diplock L.J. does not give any support and ought not to give any encouragement to any such proposition; for beyond doubt it recognises that it is open to the parties to agree that, as regards a particular obligation, any breach shall entitle the party not in default to treat the contract as repudiated. Indeed, if he were not doing so he would, in a passage which does not profess to be more than clarificatory, be discrediting a long and uniform series of cases—at least from <span style="font-style:italic">Bowes v. Shand</span> (1877) 2 App. Cas. 455 onwards which have been referred to by my noble and learned friend, Lord Roskill. It remains true, as Lord Roskill has pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic">Cehave N.V. v. Bremer Handelsgesellschaft m.b.H. (The Hansa Nord)</span> [1976] Q.B. 44, that the courts should not be too ready to interpret contractual clauses as conditions. And I have myself commended, and continue to commend, the greater flexibility in the law of contracts to which <span style="font-style:italic">Hongkong Fir</span> points the way (<span style="font-style:italic">Reardon Smith Line Ltd. v. Yngvar Hansen-Tangen (trading as H. E. Hansen-Tangen</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">)</span> [1976] 1 W.L.R. 989, 998). But I do not doubt that, in suitable cases, the courts should not be reluctant, if the intentions of the parties as shown by the contract so indicate, to hold that an obligation has the force of a condition, and that indeed they should usually do so in the case of time clauses in mercantile contracts. To such cases the “gravity of the breach” approach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Hongkong Fir</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"> </span>case [1962] 2 Q.B. 26 would be unsuitable. I need only add on this point that the word “expressly” used by Diplock L.J. at p. 70 of his judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Hongkong Fir</span> should not be read as requiring the actual use of the word “condition”: any term or terms of the contract, which, fairly read, have the effect indicated, are sufficient. Lord Diplock himself has given recognition to this in this House: <span style="font-style:italic">Photo Production Ltd. v. Securicor Transport Ltd</span> [1980] AC. 827, 849. I therefore reject that part of the appellants’ argument which was based upon it, and I must disagree with the judgment of the learned trial judge in so far as he accepted it.

In such circumstances the desideratum of certainty may be fulfilled by the contractual right to put an end to the future performance obligations without the full common law consequences of repudiation attaching.  This was not a matter which fell to be considered on the facts of that case.</p>

Vanden Avenne-Izegem P.V.B.A.</span> [1978] 2 Lloyd’s Rep. 109, which are not to be considered as conditions.

I agree with Mr. Staughton that in a mercantile contract when a term has to be performed by one party as a condition precedent to the ability of the other party to perform another term, especially an essential term such as the nomination of a single loading port, the term as to time for the performance of the former obligation will in general fall to be treated as a condition. Until the 15 consecutive days’ notice had been given, the respondents could not know for certain which loading port they should nominate so as to ensure that the contract goods would be available for loading on the ship’s arrival at that port before the end of the shipment period.”</p>

After some hesitation, I have concluded that the clause was intended as a term, the buyer’s performance of which was the necessary condition to performance by the seller of his obligations. The contract, when made, was, to use the idiom of Diplock LJ. [1962] 2 Q.B. 26, 65 and <span style="font-style:italic">Demosthenes</span> (Oratt. Attici, Reiske 867.11), “synallagmatic,” i.e. a contract of mutual engagements to be performed in the future, or, in the more familiar English/Latin idiom, an “executory” contract. The seller needed sufficient notice to enable him to choose the loading port: the parties were agreed that the notice to be given him was 15 days: this was a mercantile contract in which the parties required to know where they stood not merely later with hindsight but at once as events occurred. Because it makes commercial sense to treat the clause in the context and circumstances of this contract as a condition to be performed before the seller takes his steps to comply with the bargain, I would hold it to be not an innominate term but a condition.”</p>

Bremer Handelsgesellschaft m.b.H.</span> [1976] Q.B. 44, 71A, that contracts are made to be performed and not to be avoided. The treatment of time limits as conditions in mercantile contracts does not appear to me to be justifiable by any presumption of fact or rule of law, but rather to be a practical expedient founded on and dictated by the experience of businessmen, just the kind of thing which Bowen L.J. could have had in mind when framing his classic observations on the implied term in <span style="font-style:italic">The Moorcock</span> (1889) 14 P.D. 64, 68:</p>

			<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.25in">“Now, an implied warranty, or, as it is called, a covenant in law, as distinguished from an express contract or express warranty, really is in all cases founded on the presumed intention of the parties, and upon reason. The implication which the law draws from what must obviously have been the intention of the parties, the law draws with the object of giving efficacy to the transaction and preventing such a failure of consideration as cannot have been within the contemplation of either side: and I believe if one were to take all the cases, and they are many, of implied warranties of covenants in law, it will be found that in all of them the law is raising an implication from the presumed intention of the parties with the object of giving to the transaction such efficacy as both parties must have intended that at all events it should have. In business transactions such as this, what the law desires to effect by the implication is to give such business efficacy to the transaction as must have been intended at all events by both parties who are business men; not to impose on one side all the perils of the transaction, or to emancipate one side from all the chances of failure, but to make each party promise in law as much, at all events, as it must have been in the contemplation of both parties that he should be responsible for in respect of those perils or chances. Now what did each party in a case like this know? For if we are examining into their presumed intention we must examine into their minds as to what the transaction was.”</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.01in">I emphasise three further aspects of the decision.  First, both Lord Wilberforce and Lord Roskill recognised that the court should not be too ready to treat terms as conditions unless the terms of the contract clearly indicated such an intention.  Secondly, <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Bunge v Tradax</span> was a case in which the term in question carried a dependent term: performance of the nomination by the buyers was necessary in order to enable the sellers to fulfil their obligation to nominate the loading port and ship the goods.  It was therefore an example of a case in which performance of the relevant term by one party was a condition precedent to the ability of the other party to perform another term which was itself a condition.  This was treated by Megaw LJ and Lords Wilberforce, Scarman and Roskill as an important feature of the case. That is not a feature of the term requiring payment of hire in the present case.  That this is an important and potentially critical distinction is illustrated by <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Universal Bulk Carriers Ltd v Andre et Cie </span>[2001] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 65, especially per Clarke LJ as he then was at paragraphs [26]-[32].  </p>

The cases footnoted in that paragraph in support of the proposition were <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Reuter v Sala,</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Bowes v Shand</span> and the other authorities considered by Megaw LJ  at [1980] 1 Lloyds Rep  at pp. 306-7.

There is no such presumption in respect of terms providing for payment in commercial contracts, in respect of which generally speaking time is not of the essence unless a contrary intention clearly appears from the terms of the contract, or the surrounding circumstances, as exemplified by s. 10 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979.  The position had recently been analysed by the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">United Scientific Holdings v Burnley Borough Council</span> [1978] AC 904, in which it was held that the time for performance of steps under a rent review clause was not of the essence.

In some stipulations in commercial contracts as to the time when something must be done by one of the parties or some event must occur, time is of the essence; in others it is not. In commercial contracts for the sale of goods prima facie a stipulated time of delivery is of the essence, but prima facie a stipulated time of payment is not (Sale of Goods Act 1893, section 10 (1)); in a charterparty a stipulated time of payment of hire is of the essence. Moreover a contract of tenancy of business premises would not appear to be more of a commercial character than a contract for sale of those premises. Nevertheless, the latter provides a classic example of a contract in which stipulations as to the time when the various steps to complete the purchase are to be taken are not regarded as of the essence of the contract.”</p>

It may be the case that in a withdrawal clause construed to mean “and for so long as default continues” the clause itself does not amount to a condition and thus the breach of non payment does not ipso facto amount to a repudiation. Since the clause only permitted withdrawal if the default was still continuing at the time of withdrawal, any remarks on the subject were in any event necessarily obiter. Our clause, however, is different from that in <span style="font-style:italic">The Georgios C</span>, not because it did not permit late payment as a remedy preventing rescission, for it allowed a period of grace of 21 days (cl. 5.05 first paragraph), but because it stated that those 21 days were the limit of such period of grace. There was in fact no right of rescission immediately Latreefers failed to pay by the due date, but only upon default 21 days after the due date of payment. In a contract where a vessel is to be built with funds provided by the purchaser in stages, an instalment notice is to be given requiring payment within five banking days, and a further 21 days of grace are then allowed,  I do not see why provision for what is then called default entitling rescission should not be regarded as setting a condition of the contract.</p>

The House of Lords held that “any breach” meant any repudiatory breach — “that is to say: a fundamental breach of an innominate term or a breach expressly stated to be a condition, such as would entitle the shipowners to elect to treat the contract as wrongly repudiated by the charterers” (per Lord Diplock at p. 238, col. 1; p. 200F). Although the point has not been decided and is perhaps controversial, there must be a good argument that it follows that the express right to withdraw in the case of unpunctual payment under such a clause is a condition of the contract, breach of which is in itself repudiatory.”</p>

I do not derive any particular assistance from the conclusion that the instalment payment in the shipbuilding contract in that case was a condition.  The position of a yard under such a contract is very different to that of a shipowner under a time charter.  In the latter case the withdrawal clause leaves the owner free to employ his vessel profitably elsewhere and puts an end to any loss continuing to be caused to the owner resulting from the termination, other than the loss of bargain which crystallises on termination.  By contrast a shipbuilder exercising a right to terminate for default in payment by his buyer is left with an unfinished vessel in his yard whose presence will cause continuing damage.  It is easy to see why in such circumstances the shipbuilder and buyer might be thought to have intended that the termination should not merely put an end to future obligations but oblige the buyer to pay for the losses flowing from the termination.  </p>

The Court of Appeal held that they were.  The delay in that case was sufficient to be repudiatory or renunciatory if the term was an innominate term, such that the question whether it was a condition was not in issue.  The argument for the buyers was that the contractual termination provision, clause 10, displaced the common law right to treat the contract as repudiated and/or was a complete code regulating rights flowing from the breach so as to excluded liability for the breach.  The decision is not therefore directly in point.  Nevertheless Moore-Bick LJ, who gave the leading judgment, made various statements which in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Astra</span> Flaux J considered provided support for his conclusion that non payment of hire in a time charter is a breach of condition.

It contains many detailed provisions relating to the specification and performance of the vessel, as well as other matters. In relation to delay in delivery and deficiencies in speed, fuel consumption and deadweight capacity it provided for the payment of liquidated damages by the yard and, if the delay or any of the deficiencies exceeded a certain level, ultimately gave Gearbulk a right to terminate the contract. The contract also gave the yard a right to terminate it if Gearbulk failed to pay an instalment of the price when it became due.”</p>

Accordingly, in a case where one party’s breach is such as, in the words of Diplock LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Hongkong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd</span> [1961] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 478: [1962] 2 QB 26, to deprive the other of substantially the whole benefit which it was intended that he should obtain from the contract, the common law recognises the right of the injured party to treat the contract as discharged and to recover damages for the loss of the bargain. Such a breach is commonly described as “going to the root of the contract”. That is all trite law, but it provides the underpinning, should it be required, for Mr Boyd QC’s submission that parties to a contract of this kind, or indeed to any contract, enter into negotiations in the expectation that if one of them commits a breach which goes to the root of the contract in the sense just described, the other will be entitled to recover damages for the loss of his bargain. The parties may, of course, agree to depart from that position, but that is the point from which they start.</p>

Different words have been used to express that intention.

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">In my view Mr Dunning’s submission fails properly to recognise the true nature of the contract. The primary purpose of article 10 in the present case is to provide an agreed measure of compensation for breaches of contract by way of delay in delivery and deficiencies in capacity and performance which, although important, do not go to the root of the contract. For these the parties have agreed the payment of liquidated damages which are to be deducted from the final instalment of the price and to that extent their agreement displaces the general law, at least as regards the measure of damages recoverable for a breach of that kind. However, they have also agreed that there comes a point at which the delay or deficiency is so serious that it should entitle Gearbulk to terminate the contract. In my view they must be taken to have agreed that at that point the breach is to be treated as going to the root of the contract. In those circumstances the right to terminate the contract cannot sensibly be understood as anything other than embodying the parties’ agreement that Gearbulk has the right to treat the contract as repudiated, with (subject to Mr Dunning’s alternative argument) the usual consequences. The same holds true in relation to the yard’s right to terminate the contract under article 5.7. Although the parties may have agreed to exclude, in whole or in part, Gearbulk’s right to recover damages for a repudiatory breach on the part of the yard, I am unable to accept that they intended to create by their contract a situation which differed in its effect from that which would arise on the acceptance of a repudiation under the general law. Article 5.9 and article 10 simply identify the circumstances in which one or other of the parties is entitled to treat the contract as discharged by the other’s breach. In para 88 of his judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Stocznia Gdanska SA v Latvian Shipping Co</span> [2002] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 436 Rix LJ expressed the view that where contractual and common law rights overlap it would be too harsh to regard the use of a contractual mechanism of termination as ousting the common law mechanism, at any rate against a background of an express reservation of rights. In this case I would go further. In my view it is wrong to treat the right to terminate in accordance with the terms of the contract as different in substance from the right to treat the contract as discharged by reason of repudiation at common law. In those cases where the contract gives a right of termination they are in effect one and the same.”</p>

Off hire events are not confined to breaches of contract by Spar, although such events will commonly be breaches.  It is common ground that clause 77 is directed only to future obligations: if it is triggered by the vessel being off-hire for more than 60 days and GCS elects to terminate the charterparty, both parties are relieved from further performance; but GCS does not thereby gain a right to damages for losses flowing from the termination.  If GCS were to lose the balance of a profitable charter on a rising market, it would have no claim against Spar unless Spar’s conduct was a repudiation or renunciation permitting termination apart from the clause.</p>

It is merely a word of emphasis governing the word “any”, emphasis which is understandable since in the previous NYPE form “any” had been held not to mean any.  Moreover if the new wording introduced into the 1993 NYPE form was consciously intended to reflect <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Antaios</span>, including Lord Diplock’s terminology used there and in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Photo Productions</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Afovos</span>, it is arguable that fundamental breach is not part of a genus to which breach of condition belongs, being a repudiatory breach of an innominate term in contradistinction to a breach of condition.  This may be reading too much into the language, and was not a point advanced in argument before me, which proceeded on both sides on the premise that the second half of the clause applied to repudiatory breaches including breaches of conditions.  I do not think that the position is affected by whether fundamental breach means a repudiatory breach, as was held to be the meaning of any breach in the 1948 form in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Antaios</span>, or is more narrowly confined to breach of an innominate term so as to exclude breach of condition.  As Mr Coburn pointed out, there is no use of the word “other” in the second half of the clause, or anything else directly linking the two halves to a single genus.  There is simply no language connecting the two halves of the clause.  </p>

Those words make clear that accrued rights to debts or damages which have already accrued at the time of termination are not affected; that casts no light on whether the right of termination is to take effect only as a release from future performance as an option to cancel or is a recognition of breach of a condition sounding in damages flowing from the termination itself.  </p>

But the history of withdrawal clauses in time charters generally, and the previous NYPE form, suggests that this was simply intended as an additional remedy and could not by a side wind change the effect of a clause providing for withdrawal simpliciter.  </p>

I cannot accept that such was their intention.  Anti-technicality clauses of this kind arose against the background of the strict construction of withdrawal clauses and the risks of drastic consequences for charterers acting in good faith from errors in the banking system exemplified by the cases in the 1970s and 1980s.  That it was the intention of clause 11(b) merely to mitigate these risks is apparent from the fact that its wording makes it applicable where the failure to make payment is due to oversight, negligence, errors and omissions on the part of the Charterers or their bankers.  It is doubtful whether that provision would prevent owners exercising the right to withdraw immediately if charterers simply decided that they were unwilling to pay until served with a notice.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.01in">There are in any event conceptual difficulties with the analogy between anti-technicality clauses and notices making time of the essence.  There is an important distinction between, on the one hand, a provision in the contract that time is to be of the essence in relation to a particular term, by which the parties accord it the status of a condition, and on the other, a notice making time of the essence.  The former makes the failure to comply a breach of condition when it occurs.  The latter presupposes that the breach is of an innominate term, not a breach of condition, when it occurs, and is not at that stage repudiatory; it seeks to put the innocent party in a position to treat the continuing breach as repudiatory or renunciatory.  A notice to make time of the essence does not convert an innominate term into a condition.  Failure to make payment before the expiry of the notice period is not a breach of condition; on the contrary it is merely of evidential significance in relation to whether the breach of the innominate payment term is thereafter to be treated as repudiatory or renunciatory.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.01in">As is apparent from my review of the authorities, those which expressly address or mention the question whether payment of hire in time charters is a condition do not speak with one voice.  That payment of hire is not a condition is supported by the dicta of Donaldson J and Lord Denning in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Georgios C</span>, in passages not affected by the overruling of the decision in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Laconia</span>; the judgment of Brandon J in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Brimnes</span> and its implicit approval by a strong Court of Appeal (Edmund Davies, Megaw, Cairns LLJ) in that case; the dicta of  Mocatta J in the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Agios Giorgis</span>; and the dicta of Lord Sumption and Lord Mance in  <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Kos</span>, together with the dicta of Andrew Smith J and the concession by Eder J as counsel in that case.  On the other hand authority that payment of hire is to be treated as a condition is to be found in the dicta of Lord Diplock in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">United Scientific Holdings</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Afovos</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Scaptrade</span>; the dicta of Lord Roskill in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Bunge v Tradax</span>; the concession by Lord Steyn as counsel in the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Scaptrade</span>; the dicta of Rix LJ in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Stocznia Gdanska v Latvia</span> (although not expressed as a concluded view); and not least the reasoned judgment of Flaux J in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Astra</span>.  </p>

In this case dicta come from judges on each side with great experience in this area of commercial law and practice, who command the very greatest respect.  It would be invidious to seek to ascribe relative weight to the professional reputations of each of those identified.  The solution to this issue is not to be found by a judicial game of cards, allocating to the authors of the views the status of colour cards or trumps so as to assess which is the stronger hand.  </p>

On the contrary, the language of clause 11, providing for a liberty to withdraw the vessel from service, addresses itself solely towards future performance.  Save in relation to future performance the clause neither expands nor restricts the rights of the parties.  It does not purport to confer a right to damages where none would otherwise exist, nor to remove a right to damages where such right would otherwise exist.  In short it is neutral as to the common law rights of the parties apart from the clause.  </p>

Moreover if it had been intended to introduce a provision to make clear that payment of hire was a condition, one would expect it to be framed by reference to the term requiring payment, stating that it was to be treated as a condition or that time of payment was to be of the essence, which was the formula used in the bareboat charter in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Parbulk II A/S v Heritage Maritime Ltd SA (The Mahakan)</span><span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>[2012] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 87.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.01in">First, there is force in the point which formed part of the successful argument of Mr Robert Goff QC, as he then was, on behalf of charterers in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Brimnes</span>, that provision for an express right of withdrawal for failure to pay hire tends to show that the obligation was not otherwise of such a character as to be a condition.  The very inclusion of the contractual right of withdrawal for non payment of hire suggests that in its absence there would be no such right.  Such a provision would be otiose if the owner had the right at common law to put an end to the contract for any default in payment of hire as a breach of condition.  It is clear from Lord Diplock’s speech in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Afovos</span> that he would have regarded the term as an innominate one in the absence of a withdrawal clause.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.01in">Thirdly, predicated breaches of the term may range from the trivial to the serious.  Default in punctual payment may consist in being marginally late, by accident, causing no loss to owners or loss which is insignificant in the context of the long term charter as a whole.  In this respect the payment term carries the hallmarks of an innominate term.  <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Bunge v Tradax</span> establishes that this is not determinative, but nor is it irrelevant.  Absent considerations of commercial certainty which dictate a different result, the general approach should be that where predicated breaches of a term may have consequences ranging from the trivial to the serious, that is a strong indication that it is to be treated as an innominate term.  This applies as much to a time charter as any other form of contract (see for example <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Federal Commerce &amp; Navigation Co Ltd v Molena Alpha Inc (The Nanfri)</span> [1979] AC 757 per Lord Wilberforce at p. 778F). </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.01in">Fourthly I cannot conceive that in the absence of a contractual withdrawal clause, owners and charterers should be taken to have intended that a payment of hire a few minutes late would entitle the owners to throw up a five year charter.  It would not satisfy the test for an implied term which Lord Lowry suggested in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Bunge v Tradax</span> as a useful guide.  I do not regard that conclusion as put in doubt by what was said in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Petrofina,</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Laconia</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Mihalios Xilas</span> and other cases emphasising the importance to owners of punctual advance payment.  Those are good reasons for giving a stringent interpretation to a contractual option to cancel where that is what the parties have bargained for in clear terms; they provide no warrant for supposing that the parties would have had such an intention if they had not contracted for a right of withdrawal in such circumstances.  Although they may also colour the approach to the factual inquiry whether the default deprives the shipowner of substantially the whole benefit of the contract, and may justify setting the bar at which non payment is repudiatory or renunciatory at a lower level than would be the case in relation to payment obligations under contracts of a different nature, I cannot regard them as sufficient to justify <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> failure to pay hire punctually being treated as allowing owners to put an end to a long term time charter in the absence of express agreement.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.01in"> Fifthly, I do not regard considerations of commercial certainty as pointing to a different conclusion.  As Lord Roskill observed in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Bunge v Tradax </span>certainty is a desideratum which must be counterbalanced with the need not to impose liability for a trivial breach in undeserving cases.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.01in">Moreover a very considerable measure of certainty is conferred by the withdrawal clause itself as an option to cancel.  There is no uncertainty over the ability to put an end to future performance.  It is true that if payment of hire is an innominate term and the right to terminate only entitles owners to termination damages if the breach is repudiatory, the owners will not have absolute certainty in a fallen market in determining when the exact moment comes at which exercising the right will enable them to recover damages for the loss of bargain.  But that is an uncertainty regularly faced by commercial parties whose contracts commonly contain innominate terms, and charterparties contain many such terms (for example as to seaworthiness).  I see no reason why shipowners should be treated more favourably in this respect than others; owners of vessels are not unique in the commercial world in relying on prompt payment by their contractual counterparty to finance their performance of the contract.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.01in">In this context it is significant that until <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Astra</span>, Brandon J’s conclusion in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Brimnes</span> on this point was generally accepted in the shipping community, as the editors of <span style="font-style:italic">Time Charters</span> 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> edn observe at paragraph 6.129, although the point was not regarded as free from controversy.  In the 40 years since, owners and charterers have conducted business, and resolved disputes, on the footing that the payment of hire is not a condition, or at the very least may not be.  The NYPE, Baltime and Shelltime forms of time charter have not been altered to make clear that payment of hire is a condition; nor so far as I am aware have any other standard time charterparty forms.  Nor has there grown up any regular practice of including bespoke terms to that effect in time charters (cf the term that payment of hire should be of the essence in a bareboat charter in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Mahakan</span>).  Markets have not been on an uninterrupted rise throughout this period but have risen and fallen in cycles. There have been many disputes in arbitration in which the conduct of charterers has fallen to be examined to see whether failures to pay hire are sufficiently serious to be repudiatory or renunciatory.  None of this suggests that the shipping community considers the desideratum of commercial certainty to be such as to require payment of hire to be treated as a condition.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.01in">In <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Astra</span> Flaux J gave four reasons for concluding that payment of hire was a condition.  The first, at paragraph [109], is that because the withdrawal clause makes clear that there is a right to terminate for any failure to make punctual payment, it makes clear that any non payment is sufficiently serious to justify termination, which is a strong indication that it was intended that a failure to pay hire promptly would go to the root of the contract and thus that the provision was a condition.  This is in essence an acceptance of the argument of counsel for the owners recorded at paragraph [39], that the logical corollary of Diplock LJ’s analysis of what constitutes a condition is that if the contract provides for a right to terminate, that is a very strong indication that the term in question is a condition.  I have endeavoured to explain why I believe this turns the passage on its head.  Moreover its reasoning is difficult to reconcile with <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Financings v Baldock</span> (which it is not apparent from the report was cited to Flaux J).  Once it is recognised that a clause providing for termination on any breach of a term, however trivial, may constitute an option to cancel, the fact that the clause is triggered by such a breach tells one nothing about whether the term breached is to be characterised as a condition.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.01in">Flaux J’s second reason, at paragraph [110], is that the general rule in mercantile contracts where there is a time provision requiring something to be done is that time is of the essence, subject to payment of the price in sale of goods which is not here relevant; and that the dicta in the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Petrofina</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Mihailis Xilas</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">United Scientific Holdings, Bunge v Tradax</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Afovos</span> all indicate that the obligation to pay hire punctually is such a provision where time is of the essence and hence a condition.  As to this the presumption in commercial contracts is that stipulations as to time of payment are <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> of the essence in the absence of a clear indication to the contrary.  The dicta in the cases about the owners’ commercial interest in prompt and punctual advance payment provide good reason for approaching a contractual option to terminate with the stringency which its unqualified terms require, but no reason additionally to treat the term as a condition conferring a right to terminate at common law with its different financial consequences: once the owner is able to invoke his option to cancel to put an end to future performance he is no longer obliged to fund the operation of the vessel for the benefit of the charterer.  His interest in the prompt and punctual payment of hire for so long as he has to provide the services of the master and crew to the charterers disappears when he withdraws the vessel from service.  Insofar as the dicta go beyond this and state in terms that payment of hire is a condition, as those of Lord Diplock and Lord Roskill undoubtedly do, they were not made after argument on the point and are counterbalanced by other judicial dicta and the decision of Brandon J in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Brimnes</span> to the contrary.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.01in">Flaux J gave four reasons for declining to follow the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Brimnes</span>.  The first (paragraph [111]) was that in that case the charter contained no anti-technicality clause.  That seems to me to afford no real ground of distinction.  The clause in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Astra, </span>clause 31, was in materially similar terms to clause 11(b) of the SPAR charters save that it provided two banking days grace.  It too was expressed in terms which only covered accidental lateness.  I have sought to explain why the anti-technicality clause does not in my view indicate that time was intended to be of the essence and drawn attention to the fact that the 10 day grace period in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Financings v Baldock</span> was not treated as having that effect.  Flaux J’s second reason for not following <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Brimnes</span> (paragraph [114]) was that the decision is inconsistent with the dicta in the House of Lords to which he referred.  That would be good reason if the dicta undermined the reasoning, but again for reasons I have sought to explain I do not believe they do so, and in any event the decision also has the support of other dicta at the highest level.  Flaux J’s third reason (paragraph [114]) was that Brandon J relied heavily on the dicta of Donaldson J and Lord Denning in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Georgios C</span>, which was subsequently overruled in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Laconia</span>.  It was, however, overruled on a different point, not that for which Brandon J treated it as authoritative support.  Flaux J’s fourth reason is that the speeches in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Laconia</span> falsified the argument on behalf of charterers by Mr Robert Goff QC, as he then was, in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Brimnes</span> that “punctual” added nothing to “payment” so as not to afford a ground for distinguishing <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Georgios C</span>.  I do not regard anything said by the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Laconia</span> as undermining Mr Goff’s argument: the relevant passages served to reaffirm the considerable commercial importance of payment of hire to owners, which exists irrespective of a reference to punctuality in the clause.  On the contrary, Mr Goff’s submission that there was no relevant distinction between the forms of wording was supported by what Lord Wright had said at p. 94 of <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Petrofina</span> in the passage I have quoted above.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.01in">The third of Flaux J’s reasons for concluding that payment of hire was a condition (at paragraph [115]) was the need for commercial certainty: if the right to withdraw the vessel for non payment left the owners with no remedy in damages on a falling market, save in cases where charterers’ conduct was repudiatory, that would leave owners in a position of uncertainty whether to soldier on with a recalcitrant charterer until such time as the owners were in a position to say that the charterers were in repudiatory breach.  Insofar as having to “soldier on” is a disadvantage, it is no more than any commercial party faces as a result of the law that it is only breaches of innominate terms which are of a repudiatory character which allow a party to put an end to contractual obligations; whether that gives rise to uncertainty depends upon the application of settled law to common facts.  I would endorse the view of the editor of Treitel on <span style="font-style:italic">The Law of Contract</span> 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> edn at paragraph 18-069 that the principal function of both conditions and express contractual termination provisions is to ensure certainty so far as the right to terminate is concerned.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.01in">It follows from these principles that conduct comprising a breach or breaches of obligations which have fallen due may be insufficient to be a repudiation but nevertheless be conduct which is a renunciation because it would lead the reasonable observer to conclude that there was an intention not to perform in the future, and the past and threatened future breaches taken together would be repudiatory.  Such conduct is not infrequently referred to in the cases simply as a repudiation, but is more accurately described as a renunciation in the nomenclature I have adopted.  The reason why a defaulting party commits an actual breach is generally irrelevant to whether it constitutes a breach, or whether the breach is a repudiation.  But the reason may be highly relevant to what such breach would lead the reasonable observer to conclude about the defaulting party’s intentions in relation to future performance, and therefore to the issue of renunciation.  Often the question whether conduct is a renunciation falls to be judged by reference to the defaulting party’s intention which is objectively evinced both by past breaches and by other words and conduct.</p>

It sought to excuse non payment of a SPAR DRACO instalment by saying that sub-charterers had not paid the sub-hire, suggesting that it would only (part) perform its hire obligations on each vessel if timeously paid the (insufficient) sub hire, an approach aptly described by Spar as hand to mouth.  </p>

The avowed expectation that the position would be remedied by capital and cash flow injection from GCL in October would properly have been discounted by a reasonable owner in Spar’s position in the light of the past history of broken promises and confounded “expectations”, and by the lack of any specific assurance from GCL or HNA of how much it would provide or when, or as to how GCS would allocate it between competing creditor shipowners.  It is telling that GCS’ own characterisation, set out in its submissions in the arbitrations, was that “Charterers were willing to pay hire at the agreed rate, albeit not in advance due to the temporary cash flow problems and the internal restructuring”.

So, he submitted by way of example, for a charterer to pay late for one month throughout the course of the charter would not be repudiatory.  Looked at in this way, the benefit which Spar was intended to receive under the two five year charters was a total amount of hire of over US$30 million and under the three year charter a total of over US$18 million.  Against this background falling into arrears by a few instalments constituting a small proportion of the total could not be said to be depriving Spar of substantially the whole benefit of the charters.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.01in">I am unable to accept this submission.  There are here relevant the many judicial pronouncements as to the importance to owners of punctual payment of hire in advance to which I have referred, and an important further consideration.  If the charterer pays not in advance, but in arrears, even in full, he is performing a substantially different bargain from that which is contained in the charterparty.  In assessing repudiation stricto sensu, ie past breach, late payment or non payment of several instalments may well not be repudiatory of a long term charter if, and it will usually be a big if, it casts no doubt on the ability and willingness of the charterer to pay off the arrears promptly and perform prompt payment in full in the future.  In those circumstances a mathematical comparison of the missed payments and the total hire over the course of the charter may be appropriate.  Where, however, such conduct evinces an intention not to make regular and punctual payments in the future the position is different.  Occasional and brief delays in payment will not be repudiatory, but where the hire is due semi monthly in advance, regular delays measured in weeks often will be, because in those circumstances performance is substantially different from what has been bargained for, which is a charterparty under which the owner is to meet his obligations from the hire which has already been provided.  Mr Coburn suggested that if a charterer paid punctually one month in arrears, that could equally well be characterised as paying promptly throughout the currency of the charter save that the first month’s debt is not paid off until the end of the charter.  Quite apart from the rule that a creditor may choose how to allocate payments to outstanding debts, the flaw in this approach is that the charterer is still treating the owner as obliged to perform when he is a month out of pocket for the expenses needed to perform throughout the period of the charter.  However described, in substance the position is that throughout the whole of the charter the charterer is getting the services on credit, without paying interest, when the bargain is that owners should be funded in advance.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.01in">The starting point for the analysis is that where there is an available market for a replacement time charter, damages are to be assessed by reference to the market rate because the owner is able to replace his loss of bargain in specie.  He can replace the broken charter with exactly what he bargained for by entering into a replacement charter for the unexpired term on materially equivalent terms save as to hire.  He is not bound to do so.  But if he does not, it is his independent decision not to replace exactly what he has lost which is treated as the cause of the financial consequences of that chosen course, rather than the charterer’s renunciation.  As Robert Goff J put it in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Elena D’Amico</span>, “the decision not to take advantage of the available market is the independent decision of the innocent party, independent of the wrongdoing which has taken place” (p. 89 col 1).  So if the owner chooses not to take advantage of an available market to replace his lost bargain, any loss he suffers from market fluctuations is irrelevant.  The charterer’s breach is treated merely as the trigger or occasion for such loss, not the cause of the loss in law.  The contractual rights whose loss is caused by the breach are easily valued because the cost of replacing them is readily identifiable by reference to an available substitute charter.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.01in">Where at the date of termination there is no market available for a replacement charter for the full length of the unexpired term, there is no “available market”.  This is because a time charter for a particular period reflects the appetite for risk which the owner and charterer are willing to take for that period.  The agreed rate of hire is fixed for the period of the charter, during which market rates, whether on the spot market or for shorter term time charters, may vary up or down.  Each party takes the risk that the hire locked in for the fixed term will prove more beneficial or burdensome than would have been the case had they fixed for a shorter period and been free, or required, to go into the market before the end of the fixed term.  The length of the period for which each party is willing to take this risk is an essential element of the bargain.  One element in determining the rate of hire will be a reflection of that risk.  For these reasons the length of charters available in the market is an essential element in determining whether there is an available market for a replacement charter.  A six month time charter represents a different bargain from a two year charter because of the different nature of the risk each party is willing to run.  If the unexpired term is two years and there is no appetite in the market to fix for longer than six months, the owner cannot replace what he has lost in specie.  Four successive six month charters are not a like for like replacement for a two year charter.  His lost contractual rights cannot therefore be valued by reference to a market in which he can replace them.</p>

He cannot replace the bargain he has lost.  He has to choose to mitigate his loss by employing the vessel in a different kind of revenue earning contract.  It follows that absent any argument of failure to mitigate, the owner’s loss in such a situation is to be calculated by reference to his actual earnings, irrespective of the availability of a market for two or more successive charters for the unexpired term. The availability of a market for shorter charters does not constitute an available market in which he can replace his lost bargain.  Shorter time charters are merely one of a number of forms of substitute employment by which the owner may mitigate the loss caused by the charterer’s breach in circumstances where there is no ability to replace the lost bargain with a like for like replacement. </p>

Neither reflects an ability to replace the lost bargain in specie.  Provided the course taken by the owner is reasonable, his actual earnings from the subsequent employment of the vessel in either manner, or a combination of the two, or any other combination of reasonable methods of earning revenue from the vessel, are legally caused by the charterer’s breach; and the amount by which actual earnings in such employment fall short of the hire which would have been earned under the broken charter is the measure of loss naturally arising out of the charterer’s breach.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.01in">In support of this conclusion one may posit an unexpired term of five years in which there is always an available market for a replacement charter of two years but no longer.  If there were some rule that damages are to be measured by reference to a series of successive time charters, is it by reference to a two year charter, followed by a two year charter, followed by a one year charter?  Or one year, then two, then two?  Or by five successive one year charters? Or by some other combination?  Mr Coburn submitted that it was the first of these: that the owner was bound to let the vessel on the longest time charters he could get (or that damages should be assessed on the hypothesis that he had, if he chose not to do so).  It is difficult to see any rational basis on which this should be so.  What if the market rate of hire at the date of termination for a two year charter seems too low to the owner for the risk being run of a market increase in rates?  Why should he not let the vessel for five one year charters for the unexpired term?  And if he does so, why should he not agree a variable rate tracking a market index, as Spar did for the first year, rather than fixing a flat rate?  Where there is an available market for a five year charter at a fixed rate, the answer is that he can replace his lost bargain with a like for like replacement, the bargain with the charterer having been to lock in a fixed rate to the end of the five years.  But in the absence of such an available market, when the charterer’s breach has forced the owner into a succession of charters which do not involve being locked in for the full period, I see no reason why any particular form or combination of shorter employments should be deemed to be that in which the vessel must be engaged, or the yardstick by which the owner’s loss is to be calculated if he chooses a reasonable alternative.</p>

That is not so: if actual earnings are to be taken into account, the charterer will get the benefit of a favourable “speculation” by the owner.  But in any event it is misleading to talk of the owner’s “speculation”.  His need to make a decision as between different potential forms of employment for the vessel is the result of the charterer’s breach and the lack of an available market.  It is subject to the duty to act reasonably to mitigate loss.  Within that constraint, there is nothing unjust or contrary to principle in the charterer bearing the true loss which the owner has been caused by the charterer’s breach.</p>

In that case a seller claimed that a buyer had repudiated a contract for the sale of 10,000 tonnes of gasoline.  Colman J held that the buyer had not repudiated the contract and dismissed the claim, but considered obiter what damages would have been recoverable had the buyer been in breach.  There was an available market for the seller to resell the goods, but the market could not absorb a single sale of the entire amount immediately; the 10,000 tonnes could have been sold in separate parcels of between 1,000 and 3,000 tonnes over a period of two weeks.  Colman J held that this constituted an available market by reference to which the seller’s damages would have fallen to be assessed, and the seller would not have been entitled to recover its actual losses from holding onto the cargo for longer in the belief that it would generate a greater return.  I detect nothing in this decision which supports GCL’s case.  A market for the sale of goods in separate instalments over a period of two weeks is not materially different in kind from a market for a single sale of the whole, which was the bargain the seller had lost.  He could replace his lost bargain by resorting to that market, and his independent decision not to do so broke the chain of causation.  By contrast, an owner who loses a long term time charter does not replace his lost bargain by a succession of two or more shorter charters, which are not a like for like replacement.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.01in">This issue is irrelevant in the light of my earlier conclusions.  I can state my findings on the evidence briefly.  There were very few reported time charter fixtures of supramax vessels throughout the relevant period on which the experts could base a view as to the available market.  The expert evidence was primarily addressed to GCL’s contention that a 30 month charter would have been available, followed by a 20 month charter.  Although the evidence included reported fixtures at other dates, it may not have been complete over the whole period, and the witnesses did not address all permutations in their evidence.  There are certain periods for which I therefore feel unable to make any findings.</p>

I reject GCL’s case that there was a market for a 30 month charter.  It was based on a single fixture reported on 5 September 2011 for a newbuild, which may therefore have been agreed somewhat earlier.  It was for only 2 years and was for forward delivery in December 2011.  It was the only reported fixture of that length.  It is not therefore representative of a market in which Spar could have let the two vessels here being considered.  </p>

GCL contends that these should be reduced by $6,755.16 in respect of a speed and consumption claim for the SPAR CAPELLA and $7,617.32 in respect of a speed and consumption claim for the SPAR DRACO.  I find that GCL has failed to discharge the burden which falls on it of establishing the validity of these speed and consumption claims and accordingly Spar’s figures represent the amount due from GCS at the date of termination.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.01in">It was agreed that an allowance should be made for off-hire.  Spar’s expert had used actual off hire figures prior to 31.12.14 and then used a figure of 10 days per annum applied pro rata for the future.  On behalf of GCL it was contended that 10 days per annum was an appropriate figure for off-hire contingencies, but that it should be applied from start to finish, as per its expert’s calculations; GCL referred in this context to clause 80 of the charters contemplating drydocking during the period of the charters.  The approach of Spar’s expert is to be preferred.  There is no reason to think that there would have been any drydocking in the remaining unexpired period of the charters so as to make a 10 day pro rata allowance for the remaining period inappropriate.  Special Survey is required every five years.  The vessels were newbuildings and would not require drydocking for Special Survey until after expiry of the minimum term of the charters, 59 months, which is the period by reference to which damages are to be assessed.  The natural time for owners to schedule drydocking for Special Survey would have been following the expiry of the minimum 59 month term of the charters.  This conclusion is not affected by the fact that clause 80 of the charters contemplated and made provision for the possibility of drydocking during the course of the charters. </p>

No such allowance is appropriate in the present case.  So far as the bankruptcy of GCS is concerned, the contingency has arisen: bankruptcy has occurred.  But it is not suggested on behalf of GCL that any losses thereafter should be entirely disregarded on the footing that they would have been irrecoverable from GCS, and rightly so because Spar have the benefit of the Guarantees from GCL.  So far as the possibility of catastrophic loss between now and December 2015 is concerned, the possibility is sufficiently unlikely as not to warrant any discount on future earnings.  </p>

That may be so, but it is not in my view an answer to this element of Spar’s claim.  Irrespective of whether such costs would be recoverable from GCS as damages, they were incurred “as a result and arising out of” GCS’s defaults and therefore fall within the scope of that which GCL expressly undertook to pay, to the extent that such costs were reasonably incurred.  They are therefore recoverable from GCL subject to that qualification.  </p>
