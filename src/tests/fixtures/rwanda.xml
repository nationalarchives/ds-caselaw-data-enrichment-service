In broad terms, under those paragraphs an asylum claim can be ruled inadmissible, with the consequence that the merits of the claim need not be considered, where the asylum seeker had the opportunity to apply for asylum in a safe third country but did not do so. If it is decided that an asylum claim is inadmissible, the asylum seeker can be removed either to the safe third country where the opportunity to make the asylum claim arose, if that country is willing to accept the asylum seeker, or to any other safe third country which agrees to accept him or her. The policy proceeds on the basis that the asylum seekers who are to be removed to Rwanda had the opportunity to apply for asylum in a safe third country (in most cases, France) but did not do so, and that Rwanda is another safe third country which has agreed to accept them, and to which they can therefore be removed.</span></p></content></paragraph><paragraph eId="para_4"><num style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-decoration-line:none;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:13pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">4.</num><intro><p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The criteria for designation as a safe third country are set out in paragraph 345B:</span></p></intro><subparagraph><content><p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">“A country is a safe third country for a particular applicant, if:</span></p></content></subparagraph><subparagraph><num style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">(i)</num><content><p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">the applicant’s life and liberty will not be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion in that country;</span></p></content></subparagraph><subparagraph><num style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">(ii)</num><content><p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">the principle of non-refoulement will be respected in that country in accordance with the Refugee Convention;</span></p></content></subparagraph><subparagraph><num style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">(iii)</num><content><p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">the prohibition of removal, in violation of the right to freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment as laid down in international law, is respected in that country; and</span></p></content></subparagraph><subparagraph><num style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">(iv)</num><content><p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">the possibility exists to request refugee status and, if found to be a refugee, to receive protection in accordance with the Refugee Convention in that country.”  </span></p></content></subparagraph></paragraph><paragraph eId="para_5"><num style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-decoration-line:none;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:13pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">5.</num><content><p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The principle of non-refoulement, to which paragraph 345B(ii) refers, is guaranteed by the United Nations 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (Cmd 9171) and its 1967 Protocol (Cmnd 3906) (“the Refugee Convention”), to which the United Kingdom is a party. As explained below, it requires that refugees are not returned to a country where their life or freedom would be threatened on account of their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. In order to qualify as a safe third country under paragraph 345B(ii), Rwanda must accordingly be a country in which the principle of non-refoulement will be respected, ie a country which will not return refugees to another country where their life or freedom would be threatened. As we shall explain, refoulement is also prohibited under a number of other international conventions which the United Kingdom has ratified.

A CPIN entitled “Inadmissibility - Safe Third Country Cases”, published by the Secretary of State on 9 May 2022, explains arrangements for the transfer and processing of asylum seekers which have been entered into by the governments of the United Kingdom and Rwanda, known as the Migration and Economic Development Partnership (“MEDP”), and advises that certain categories of asylum seeker can be removed to Rwanda in accordance with paragraphs 345A and 345B of the Immigration Rules. Another CPIN published on the same date, entitled “Review of asylum processing – Rwanda: assessment”, considers the processing of claims for asylum in Rwanda, and advises that there are no substantial grounds for believing that a person, if relocated to Rwanda, would face a real risk of treatment that is likely to be contrary to article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (“the ECHR”) by virtue inter alia of refoulement or shortcomings in the asylum process. Article 3 prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.

Several of the factors mentioned are, however, relevant to the present case: for example, the disclosure of the terms of the assurances to the court, the general human rights situation in the receiving state, the receiving state’s laws and practices, its record in abiding by similar assurances, the existence of monitoring mechanisms, and the examination of the reliability of the assurances by the domestic courts of the sending state. </span></p></content></paragraph><paragraph eId="para_49"><num style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-decoration-line:none;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:13pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">49.</num><intro><p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The approach to be adopted where diplomatic assurances are relied on was discussed by this court more recently in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Zabolotnyi v Mateszalka District Court, Hungary </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"><ref uk:type="case" href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2021/14" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:canonical="[2021] UKSC 14" uk:year="2021" uk:origin="TNA">[2021] UKSC 14</ref>; <ref uk:type="case" href="#" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:canonical="[2021] 1 WLR 2569" uk:year="2021" uk:origin="TNA">[2021] 1 WLR 2569</ref>.

It was held that the court was required to undertake a free evaluation of the assurance, which required the court to examine and assess all relevant evidence (para 50). In particular, past breaches of similar assurances by the requesting state, whether provided to the United Kingdom or to a third state, were relevant to the question whether the requesting state could be relied upon to comply with its assurance on the present occasion (ibid).

Secondly, the terms of the MEDP were specific and detailed (para 65). Thirdly, a senior official at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (“the FCDO”) stated in a witness statement that the government was confident that Rwanda would honour its obligations under the MEDP (para 66).

Of course, the court will attach weight to the government’s view as to the value of assurances given by another country, particularly where its view reflects the advice of officials with relevant experience and expertise. The FCDO in particular has long experience of diplomatic relations with other countries, and the advice of its officials can assist ministers to reach an informed view as to the likelihood of the country in question complying with assurances.

Its evidence in the present case concerns matters falling within its remit and about which it has undoubted expertise. As the Lord Chief Justice observed in the present case, UNHCR “has unrivalled practical experience of the working of the asylum system in Rwanda through long years of engagement” (para 467). It has been operating permanently in Rwanda since 1993, and had 332 staff there at the time of its evidence in these proceedings. Its </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">role in Rwanda includes assisting asylum seekers and refugees, funding and training non-governmental organisations working with the Rwandan asylum system, dealing with officials responsible for asylum decision-making, and engaging with the relevant department of the Rwandan government over the management of refugee camps. Although UNHCR has no official role in Rwanda’s asylum system, the Rwandan authorities have, albeit intermittently, sent it copies of asylum decisions, and UNHCR receives information from asylum-seekers and NGOs, and through communications with relevant officials. UNHCR is therefore able to collate data and gain insight into the practical realities of Rwanda’s asylum system. Its </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">experience was recognised by Home Office officials. They reported that the Rwandan government depended heavily on UNHCR and other non-governmental organisations for delivering its asylum and refugee processes, and that UNHCR had undoubted expertise and experience of managing part of the refugee process, as well as knowledge of the Rwandan system more generally. </span></p></content></paragraph><paragraph eId="para_69"><num style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-decoration-line:none;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:13pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">69.</num><content><p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">As the Lord Chief Justice noted at para 467, UNHCR can be said to have an institutional interest in the outcome of these proceedings, since it has adopted the position (set out in its Guidance Note on bilateral and/or multilateral arrangements of asylum-seekers) that asylum seekers and refugees should ordinarily be processed in the territory of the state where they arrive or which otherwise has jurisdiction over them. The fact that UNHCR has adopted that position is a factor to be taken into account when assessing its evidence. However, its evidence and submissions were presented with moderation, and did not appear to reflect a partisan assessment.

In the circumstances of the present case, however, its evidence on significant matters of fact is essentially uncontradicted by any cogent evidence to the contrary, as the Court of Appeal explained (eg at para 136).

At the United Nations Human Rights Council’s Universal Periodic Review of Rwanda in Geneva in January 2021, the United Kingdom government criticised Rwanda for “extrajudicial killings, deaths in custody, enforced disappearances and torture”. Advice provided by officials to ministers later in 2021, during the process of selecting a partner country for the removal of asylum seekers, advised that Rwanda had a poor human rights record. Most human rights violations were said to be linked to criticism of the Rwandan government. There were also said to be constraints on media freedom and political activities. Refugees had not been generally ill-treated, but there had been exceptions when they had expressed criticism of the government. The most serious incident occurred in 2018, when the Rwandan police fired live ammunition at refugees protesting over cuts to food rations, killing at least 12 people. As the Lord Chief Justice noted in the present case (para 511), there remain “profound human rights concerns”.

Once in Rwanda, their claims are processed by UNHCR, and the claimants have been resettled by UNHCR in third countries. By contrast, the Rwandan authorities have handled only a small number of individual claims for asylum.

The initial stage in the process is the responsibility of the Directorate General of Immigration and Emigration in Rwanda (“the DGIE”), which is an entity within the National Intelligence and Security Service. Under Rwandan law, its role is to undertake the necessary preparation of asylum claims for determination by another body, the Refugee Status Determination Committee (“the RSDC”). The main function of the DGIE under the law is to conduct interviews with asylum claimants. However, although it is not authorised by law to reject asylum claims, it is said that the DGIE summarily rejected 8% of the asylum claims of which UNHCR was aware between 2020 and June 2022. UNHCR’s evidence is that the true number of rejections by the DGIE is likely to be higher. Where this has occurred, no written reasons have been provided, and there is no right of appeal (since the law makes provision for appeals only against decisions taken by the RSDC). RSDC has the power to consider a claim which the DGIE has failed to refer to it, but UNHCR has no experience of this ever occurring.</span></p></content></paragraph><paragraph eId="para_80"><num style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-decoration-line:none;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:13pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">80.</num><content><p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The next stage in the process is the consideration of claims by the RSDC. That committee comprises senior representatives of the principal government departments and agencies, including the Prime Minister’s Office and the National Intelligence and Security Service. They sit part-time on the RSDC and are non-specialist. Where the RSDC provides written reasons for its decisions, they are often perfunctory: the evidence includes RSDC decision letters, including several issued after the conclusion of the MEDP, which rejected asylum claims either without reasons, or with reasons which were merely formulaic. For example, a standard response from the RSDC in July 2022 was that “Refugee Status requested was not granted because you don’t meet the eligibility criteria, and the reasons you provided during the interview were not pertinent”.</span></p></content></paragraph><paragraph eId="para_81"><num style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-decoration-line:none;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:13pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">81.</num><content><p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The next stage in the process is the possibility of an internal administrative appeal to the responsible minister.

The reliability of the safeguards in the Rwandan asylum system ultimately depends on this right of appeal: it is the only stage in the process at which claims can be considered by anyone other than government officials or ministers. Although a right of appeal has existed since 2018, there has never been such an appeal in practice. The system is therefore untested, and there is no evidence as to how the right of appeal would work in practice. There are, however, concerns about the willingness of the judiciary to find against the Rwandan government. In </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Government of Rwanda v. Nteziryayo </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">(para 76 above), the Divisional Court considered the independence of the Rwandan judiciary in the context of an application for the extradition of a number of individuals to face charges arising out of the 1994 genocide. It concluded at para 374 that “the evidence points to some risk, depending on the evidence before them and the safeguards in play, that judges might yield to pressure from the Rwandan authorities”. It is apparent from the evidence that that view is essentially accepted by the FCDO, as the Lord Chief Justice noted (para 515). </span></p></content></paragraph><paragraph eId="para_83"><num style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-decoration-line:none;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:13pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">83.</num><content><p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The risk of a lack of independence in politically sensitive cases is not confined to the judiciary. In its comments on the draft CPIN report on asylum processing in Rwanda, mentioned in para 6 above, the FCDO commented, in relation to a statement that “independent legal support and advice is available”, that legal support was likely to be independent unless the matter became political. This issue is relevant because, in an appeal, the High Court would be asked to overturn the decision of a minister and, indirectly, the decision of a committee of senior representatives of the principal government bodies. The implication of the evidence is that the legal profession and the courts might not operate independently in such cases.</span></p></content></paragraph><paragraph eId="para_84"><num style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-decoration-line:none;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:13pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">84.</num><content><p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">It appears that the process before the DGIE (which, as explained, conducts an interview of the asylum seeker), the RSDC (which considers the file prepared by the DGIE and may conduct a further interview), and the responsible minister (to whom an appeal lies against the decision of the RSDC) is marked by an absence of legal representation. The MEDP seeks to address this. However, during the negotiation of the MEDP, representatives of the Rwandan government indicated that the contemplated arrangements might not be straightforward to implement in practice. That seems to us to be a realistic view. The introduction of such a significant change of practice is liable to raise a number of issues, for example as to the role of the claimant’s lawyer at each stage of the process, which may require time to resolve. </span></p></content></paragraph><paragraph eId="para_85"><num style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-decoration-line:none;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:13pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">85.</num><content><p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">A second concern relates to the outcome of the asylum process, ie the decisions themselves. UNHCR’s evidence shows 100% rejection rates at RSDC level during 2020-2022 for nationals of Afghanistan, Syria and Yemen, from which asylum seekers removed from the United Kingdom may well emanate. This is a surprisingly high rejection rate for claimants from known conflict zones. By comparison, Home Office statistics for the same period show that asylum claims in the United Kingdom were granted in 74% of cases from Afghanistan, 98% of cases from Syria, and 40% of cases from Yemen. UNHCR attributes the refusal of such claims by the Rwandan authorities to a view that persons from the Middle East and Afghanistan should claim asylum in their own region.</span></p></content></paragraph><paragraph eId="para_86"><num style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-decoration-line:none;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:13pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">86.</num><content><p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">UNHCR has also produced evidence that a number of recent asylum seekers from a non-African country with close bilateral relations with Rwanda were denied access by the DGIE to the Rwandan asylum system.

This evidence is not addressed in the responses of the Rwandan or United Kingdom governments. It raises a concern not simply that the DGIE has failed to comply with obligations imposed under the Refugee Convention, but that it has done so in the interests of the Rwandan government’s foreign relations.</span></p></content></paragraph><paragraph eId="para_87"><num style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-decoration-line:none;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:13pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">87.</num><content><p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">A third concern, related to the last point, is Rwanda’s practice of refoulement. In addition to the cases of threatened refoulement mentioned in the previous paragraph, UNHCR reported six recent cases of expulsion of persons who claimed asylum on arrival at Kigali airport, some of which resulted in refoulement or would have done so if UNHCR had not intervened. Two Libyans were removed from the airport in February 2021 and sent to Egypt; a person from Yemen was removed from the airport in September 2021 and sent to Ethiopia, where UNHCR intervened to prevent his onward refoulement to Yemen; two Afghans were refouled to Afghanistan (via Dubai) on 24 March 2022, while the MEDP was being negotiated; and a Syrian was refouled to Syria (via Turkey) on 19 April 2022, after the MEDP had been concluded. There may be other cases: UNHCR does not maintain a presence at the airport, and only learns of such occurrences if they are contacted. This evidence is uncontested, although the Rwandan government disputes the description of these cases as constituting refoulement, as explained below. </span></p></content></paragraph><paragraph eId="para_88"><num style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-decoration-line:none;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:13pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">88.</num><content><p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The cases of airport refoulement do not establish that there would be a risk of similar refoulement under the MEDP, since asylum seekers arriving in Rwanda under the MEDP would have been pre-approved by the government of Rwanda and would arrive on planned flights. Nevertheless, these instances illustrate what Underhill LJ described at para 156 as “a culture of, at best, insufficient appreciation by DGIE officials of Rwanda’s obligations under the Refugee Convention, and at worst a deliberate disregard for those obligations”.

For example, its response to UNHCR’s evidence demonstrates a misunderstanding of the meaning of the concept of refoulement. It maintains, first, that asylum seekers must apply for asylum immediately upon arrival in Rwanda, and that claimants who apply for asylum only after failing to satisfy immigration requirements can properly be expelled. Secondly, it maintains that asylum seekers who use forged documents (as bona fide refugees not uncommonly do) do not meet immigration requirements, and their expulsion does not constitute refoulement. These contentions reveal an imperfect understanding of the requirements of the Refugee Convention. UNHCR also reported that the Rwandan officials who participated in training which it had organised had very limited or no understanding of how to assess refugee status.

Having regard also to the Rwandan government’s misunderstanding of its obligations under the Refugee Convention, there is reason to apprehend that there is a real risk that the practices described above will not change, at least in the short term. The Secretary of State points out that resources are provided under the MEDP. However, the provision of resources does not mean that the problems which we have described can be resolved in the short term. The Secretary of State points to the monitoring arrangements under the MEDP as a safeguard. Such arrangements may be capable of detecting failures in the asylum system, and over time may result in the introduction of improvements, but that will come too late to eliminate the risk of refoulement currently faced by asylum seekers removed to Rwanda. Furthermore, the suppression of criticism of the government by lawyers and others is liable to discourage the reporting of problems, and so undermine the effectiveness of monitoring. It is also unclear whether the monitoring arrangements could provide a solution to problems emanating from the Rwandan government’s interpretation of its obligations under the Refugee Convention, or from a lack of independence in the legal system in politically sensitive cases. </span></p></content></paragraph><paragraph eId="para_94"><num style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-decoration-line:none;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:13pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">94.</num><content><p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The Secretary of State advances a somewhat surprising argument to the effect that it does not matter if asylum claims are not processed correctly, because asylum seekers will not be subject to refoulement in any event. In relation to that argument, we note that if an asylum claim is wrongly rejected, and the asylum seeker does not have some other entitlement to remain in Rwanda, the government of Rwanda undertakes under paragraph 10.4 of the MOU (set out at para 9 above) to remove the person only “to a country in which they have a right to reside”. That country will normally be the country of which the asylum seeker is a national or citizen: that is to say, the country which he has fled, and in which (ex hypothesi) he faces persecution. It is said in response that Rwanda does not have agreements with other countries under which unsuccessful asylum seekers could be removed. However, it would not be necessary for Rwanda to have such agreements in place before being able to return individuals to countries in which they have a right to reside. The absence of such agreements has not prevented refoulement, direct or indirect, from occurring in practice, as we have explained.</span></p></content></paragraph><paragraph><num style="text-decoration-line:none;font-family:'Times New Roman'">(iii)</num><content><p class="ParaSubHeading2" style="text-indent:0.5in"><span style="text-decoration-line:none;font-family:'Times New Roman'">The Israel/Rwanda arrangements</span></p></content></paragraph><paragraph eId="para_95"><num style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-decoration-line:none;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:13pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">95.</num><content><p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Israel entered into an agreement with Rwanda at the end of 2013, under which persons from Eritrea and Sudan who sought asylum in Israel were removed to Rwanda in order for their claims to be processed there.

A predictive evaluation is required, and the MEDP provides assurances that the necessary improvements to the system will be implemented.

The central issue in the present case is therefore not the good faith of the government of Rwanda at the political level, but its practical ability to fulfil its assurances, at least in the short term, in the light of the present deficiencies of the Rwandan asylum system, the past and continuing practice of refoulement (including in the context of an analogous arrangement with Israel), and the scale of the changes in procedure, understanding and culture which are required.</span></p></content></paragraph><paragraph eId="para_103"><num style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-decoration-line:none;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:13pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">103.</num><content><p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In agreement with the Court of Appeal, we consider that the past and the present cannot be effectively ignored or sidelined as the Secretary of State suggests.

However, an express requirement that there be a sufficient degree of connection between an asylum seeker and a third country on the basis of which it would be reasonable for that person to go to that country was introduced only on 24 November 2016 by the insertion into the Immigration Rules of paragraphs 345A-345D (Statement of Change HC 667).</span></p></content></paragraph><paragraph><num style="text-decoration-line:none;font-family:'Times New Roman'">(ii)</num><content><p class="ParaSubHeading2" style="text-indent:0.5in"><span style="text-decoration-line:none;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><ref uk:type="legislation" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2018/16" uk:canonical="2018 c. 16" uk:origin="TNA">European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018</ref>  </span></p></content></paragraph><paragraph eId="para_113"><num style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-decoration-line:none;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:13pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">113.</num><intro><p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Section 4 of the 2018 Act (as amended by the <ref uk:type="legislation" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2020/1" uk:canonical="2020 c. 1" uk:origin="TNA">European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020</ref>) provides in relevant part:</span></p></intro><subparagraph><num style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">“4</num><content><p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Saving for rights etc under section 2(1) of the ECA</span></p></content></subparagraph><subparagraph><num style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">(1)</num><content><p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Any rights, powers, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, remedies and procedures which, immediately before IP completion day –</span></p></content></subparagraph><subparagraph><num style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">(a)</num><content><p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">are recognised and available in domestic law by virtue of section 2(1) of the <ref uk:type="legislation" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1972/68" uk:canonical="1972 c. 68" uk:origin="TNA">European Communities Act 1972</ref>, and</span></p></content></subparagraph><subparagraph><num style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">(b)</num><content><p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">are enforced, allowed and followed accordingly,</span></p></content></subparagraph><subparagraph><content><p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">continue on and after IP completion day to be recognised and available in domestic law (and to be enforced, allowed and followed accordingly).</span></p></content></subparagraph><subparagraph><num style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">(2)</num><content><p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Subsection (1) does not apply to any rights, powers, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, remedies or procedures so far as they –</span></p></content></subparagraph><subparagraph><content><p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">… (b) arise under an EU directive … and are not of a kind recognised by the European Court or any court or tribunal in the United Kingdom in a case decided before IP completion day (whether or not as an essential part of the decision in the case). …”</span></p></content></subparagraph></paragraph><paragraph eId="para_114"><num style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-decoration-line:none;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:13pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">114.</num><content><p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">It is common ground on this appeal that the relevant provisions of the Procedures Directive were retained EU law within section 4 of the 2018 Act.

He submits that when the 2020 Act is read in its context it is clear that section 1 and paragraph 6 of Schedule 1 are directed to the repeal only of retained EU law relating to free movement and not to asylum provisions such as those in articles 25 and 27 of the Procedures Directive. References in the statute to “immigration”, he submits, must be read as limited to immigration in this narrow sense which excludes asylum.

The heading to section 1 in the 2020 Act refers only to free movement and not to asylum. Section 1 itself introduces Schedule 1 as making provision to end rights to free movement under retained EU law and to end other EU-derived rights and repeal other retained EU law “relating to immigration”. Furthermore, Schedule 1 does not refer to asylum. Part 1 of the Schedule makes changes to domestic legislation which reflect the ending of free movement rights.  Part 2 revokes the Workers Regulation, again reflecting the ending of free movement rights. In Part 3, paragraph 5 revokes rights relating to the Swiss free movement agreement.

In this regard, he is able to point to the Immigration, Nationality and Asylum (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/745), (“the 2019 Regulations”), made pursuant to section 8 of the 2018 Act, which provide for revocations of retained direct EU legislation. Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the 2019 Regulations provides for “revocations related to immigration and nationality” and Part 2 provides for “revocations related to asylum”. To the extent that this may reflect a usage in EU legislation, it cannot be assumed that the 2020 Act similarly reflects such a usage.  Moreover, the point can be made that the scheme of the 2019 Regulations differs fundamentally in this regard from that of the 2020 Act, which unlike the 2019 Regulations does not list those EU laws to be excluded from retained EU law but describes them by their characteristics.

The grant of asylum status in the United Kingdom generally leads under paragraphs 330 and 335 of the Immigration Rules to the grant of limited leave to remain in the United Kingdom despite the lack of any other right to remain. In the present appeal, ASM seeks to limit the power of the Secretary of State to remove him to Rwanda. Asylum and immigration in the narrower sense are closely integrated subject matters. As Underhill LJ observed in the Court of Appeal in the present proceedings (at para 361), the broader use of the term “immigration” to include asylum is not loose or illogical.

In this instance, section 1(b) does not define the content of Schedule 1; on the contrary, the meaning of section 1(b) is explained by Schedule 1. It does so in very broad terms. In particular, paragraph 6(1)(a) makes clear that “any other EU-derived rights” are to cease to be available in domestic law so far as they are inconsistent with, or are otherwise capable of affecting the interpretation, application or operation of, any provision made by or under the Immigration Acts. As we have explained, the Immigration Rules, Part 11 of which governs asylum applications, are made under the 1971 Act, which falls within the statutory definition of “the Immigration Acts”. Paragraph 6(1)(b) explains that “any other EU-derived rights” are to cease to be available in domestic law so far as they are otherwise capable of affecting the exercise of functions in connection with immigration.

In that case, which concerned a statutory procedure for registration by which a person can acquire British citizenship, Lord Hodge considered that, notwithstanding the importance to an individual of the possession of British citizenship, the court was not dealing with an interference with a fundamental or constitutional right. As a result, the normal canons of statutory construction applied. In the same way, in the present case the relevant protection afforded by articles 25 and 27(2)(a) of the Procedures Directive, despite its importance, does not bring the principle of legality into play.</span></p></content></paragraph><paragraph eId="para_143"><num style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-decoration-line:none;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:13pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">143.</num><content><p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Secondly, the purpose of the 2020 Act is to end the application within domestic law in the United Kingdom of parts of retained EU law.
