	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">Inter alia</span>
	      <span style="font-size:11pt">, Mr H requires surgery on his knees; he has cancelled a number of visits by professionals because of ill-health, and has requested six hours per day carer‚Äôs respite. On 8 September 2010, Dr K and Dr Y concluded that Mr H was providing an adequate level of care and giving (sporadic) access to professionals, and it was in her best interests to remain in her own home. After this, Mr H wanted to change his GP, and the District Nurses found it difficult to gain access despite arriving at the correct time. Indeed, over the past two years, District Nurses have experienced continual problems gaining access, partly because of delays in arriving at Mrs H‚Äôs home caused by their other clinical priorities and unanticipated problems. Mr H ‚Äúwas not able to adapt to this and would not permit the District Nurses access if they did not arrive between his preferred period of 1-2pm.‚Äù ‚ÄúA joint visit involving the police, social services and district nursing, requested by the district nurses, took place on 1 December 2010 because there was a period of nearly two weeks when access to Mrs H was not permitted by Mr H. It has ‚Äúnot been possible, despite many discussions with Mr H by all involved professionals, to persuade Mr H to compromise on his request for a very large carers support plan.‚Äù Because of ‚Äúthe failure despite considerable effort to maintain a sustainable support plan all professionals involved in community support now agree that placement is the only option, because all alternatives have now been explored.‚Äù</span>

On 28 August 2009, Mrs H was admitted to UCH. It was agreed with Mr H that the District Nurses would be able to visit on Tuesday and Friday, between 12 noon and 1pm. However, the arrangement was ‚Äúdifficult for the District Nursing Team to sustain because of clinical priorities ‚Ä¶ On numerous occasions in the past year this arrangement has not worked, sometimes because of District Nurse delays and difficulty contacting Mr H to arrange an alternative ‚Ä¶ or because no answer was obtained.‚Äù When professionals visited with police officers on 1 December 2010, initially Mr H refused to let anyone in and the police threatened him with arrest.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">The first is that the statute lays down no hierarchy as between the various factors which have to be borne in mind, beyond the overarching principle that what is determinative is the judicial evaluation of what is in P's ‚Äúbest interests‚Äù.</span>

One cannot, as it were, attribute any particular a priori weight or importance to P's wishes and feelings; it all depends, it must depend, upon the individual circumstances of the particular case. And even if one is dealing with a particular individual, the weight to be attached to their wishes and feelings must depend upon the particular context; in relation to one topic P's wishes and feelings may carry great weight whilst at the same time carrying much less weight in relation to another topic. Just as the test of incapacity under the 2005 Act is, as under the common law, 'issue specific', so in a similar way the weight to be attached to P's wishes and feelings will likewise be issue specific.</span>

But respect for our human condition, regard for the realities of our society and the common sense to which Lord Oliver of Aylmerton referred in In re KD ‚Ä¶, surely indicate that the starting point should be the normal assumption that mentally incapacitated adults will be better off if they live with a family rather than in an institution ‚Äì however benign and enlightened the institution may be, and however well integrated into the community ‚Äì and that mentally incapacitated adults who have been looked after within their family will be better off if they continue to be looked after within the family rather than by the State.</span>

We need to be careful not to embark upon 'social engineering'. And we should not lightly interfere with family life. If the State ‚Äì typically, as here, in the guise of a local authority ‚Äì is to say that it is the more appropriate person to look after a mentally incapacitated adult than her own partner or family, it assumes, as it seems to me, the burden ‚Äì not the legal burden but the practical and evidential burden ‚Äì of establishing that this is indeed so. And common sense surely indicates that the longer a vulnerable adult's partner, family or carer have looked after her without the State having perceived the need for its intervention, the more carefully must any proposals for intervention be scrutinised and the more cautious the court should be before accepting too readily the assertion that the State can do better than the partner, family or carer. </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">[117] At the end of the day, the simple point, surely, is this: the quality of public care must be at least as good as that from which the child or vulnerable adult has been rescued. Indeed that sets the requirement too low. If the State is to justify removing children from their parents or vulnerable adults from their relatives, partners, friends or carers it can only be on the basis that the State is going to provide a better quality of care than that which they have hitherto been receiving: see Re F, F v Lambeth London Borough Council [2002] 1 FLR 217 at para [43]. </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">[118] The fact is that in this type of case the court is exercising an essentially protective jurisdiction. The court should intervene only where there is a need to protect a vulnerable adult from abuse or the real possibility of abuse: see Re K, A Local Authority v N and others [2005] EWHC 2956 (Fam), [2007] 1 FLR 399, at paras [90]-[92], and X City Council v MB, NB and MAB (by his litigation friend the Official Solicitor) [2006] EWHC 168 (Fam), [2006] 2 FLR 968, at para [27]. The jurisdiction is to be invoked if, but only if, there is a demonstrated need to protect a vulnerable adult. And the court must be careful to ensure that in rescuing a vulnerable adult from one type of abuse it does not expose her to the risk of treatment at the hands of the State which, however well intentioned, can itself end up being abusive of her dignity, her happiness and indeed of her human rights. That said, the law must always be astute to protect the weak and helpless, not least in circumstances where, as often happens in such cases, the very people they need to be protected from are their own relatives, partners or friends: NS v MI [2006] EWHC 1646 (Fam), [2007] 1 FLR 444, at para [8]. </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">[119] There is one final point to be made. The court, as I have said, is entitled to intervene to protect a vulnerable adult from the risk of future harm ‚Äì the risk of future abuse or future exploitation ‚Äì so long as there is a real possibility, rather than a merely fanciful risk, of such harm. But the court must adopt a pragmatic, common sense and robust approach to the identification, evaluation and management of perceived risk.‚Äù</span>

	      <span style="font-size:11pt">The approach to take concerning risks has assisted me in this case. Risk cannot be avoided and even a very low risk from time to time becomes an actuality. Small differences in one key variable can result in vastly different behaviours and outcomes, just as a sudden change in the physical state of water into steam or ice occurs with the rise or fall of temperature beyond a critical level. All decisions that involve deprivation of liberty or compulsion involve balancing competing risks, of which the risk that others may suffer physical harm is but one. For example, detention and compulsory care or treatment may risk loss of employment, family contact, self-esteem and dignity; unnecessary or unjustified deprivation of liberty; institutionalisation; and the unwanted side-effects of treatment.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:11pt">The underlying rationale of the legislative framework is that it is a protective scheme. Anyone who is deprived of their liberty, that is who is under another person‚Äôs complete and effective control and is not free to leave, is vulnerable to abuse. This risk is multiplied if the person is unable to make decisions about whether to reside there or to leave. Children and adults with mental health problems are particularly at risk, and the law has usually afforded them special protection. This protection involves imposing legal duties on those with power, conferring legal rights on those in their power, and independent scrutiny of how these powers and duties are exercised. The effectiveness of such schemes depends on whether, and to what extent, they are observed. In this case, the DOLs scheme ensures that there is at least an annual assessment by two suitably qualified and independent professionals, who can ensure that the arrangement is necessary to protect them from harm, really is in their best interests, is proportionate and so forth.</span>

The decision is one of critical importance to Mrs H (and her husband), which will or may well have profound implications for her future happiness, her contact with her husband, her health and security, and her liberty.

This desire to determine one‚Äôs own interests is common to almost all human beings. Society is made up of individuals, and each individual wills certain ends for themselves and their loved ones, and not others, and has distinctive feelings, personal goals, traits, habits and experiences. Because this is so, most individuals wish to determine and develop their own interests and course in life, and their happiness often depends on this. The existence of a private sphere of action, free from public coercion or restraint, is indispensable to that independence which everyone needs to develop their individuality, even where their individuality is diminished, but not extinguished, by illness.

Mrs H has spent most of her time in bed since being admitted to hospital. Most days she refuses to be hoisted from bed to chair. When Mr C gave oral evidence, he conceded that nursing home staff would not force her to leave her bed if she resisted being hoisted and told them to leave her alone. The likelihood is that she would be confined to bed for most of the time in a nursing home, and eat and drink in bed. It may be that only a mobile hoist will be available.</span>

When discussing their needs with people who have mental health problems and their carers, establishing agreement and a therapeutic rapport through a reasonable compromise of different perspectives is an important aspect of responding to the patient‚Äôs needs.

This carries a risk of institutionalisation and relatively few people return home after being placed in a nursing home. In any case, for the reasons given, I believe that it is in Mrs H‚Äôs best interests for her to return home at this point, on the terms set out below. I hope that Mr H and local services will work constructively together to make this work and to maximise the time that Mrs H can spend at home with her husband within what remains of her life.</span>

The professionals involved have come into our lives and instead of trying to understand us they have tried to impose their thoughts about JH‚Äôs care on us. These people will come and go, there will be different carers, social workers and district nurses that will come and go from our lives, but we are each others constants. We are husband and wife and this is our life, this is not work, not something we will be involved in for a few months here and there before we move onto a new client but it is our life and the outcome of theses proceedings have the ability to break up a loving family because we are considered to be difficult. I am made out to be causing harm to my wife, this is simply not true. The care I provide to my wife stems from the love and respect I have for her and the wish for her to be happy. The care I give her is not because I am being paid to do it. When I give her care I am not restrained in the time I can dedicate to her because I have several other service users that need my attention as would be the case if she were placed in a nursing home. The level of care I can provide for my wife will always be superior to that provided by people employed to provide it.</span>

Secondly I have approached this case on the basis that his primary need is for emotional warmth, emotional security and the commitment of human relationship. That has been a huge feature of his life to date and one that is not readily to be set aside. Next it seems to me that for the elderly there is often an importance in place which is not generally recognised by others; not only physical place but also the relational structure that is associated with a place ....‚Äù</span>

In both settings it is likely that she will receive less than optimal care, at home because realistically not all of the past disagreements will be resolved overnight and simply evaporate into thin air, at the nursing home because she will resist and resent care and the disagreements remain.</span>

Any significant breakdown in the care package will no doubt be identified immediately and followed by appropriate action, including if necessary an application to this court.
