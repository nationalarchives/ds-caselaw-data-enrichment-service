	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In 2009 WA claimed asylum in the United Kingdom. Notwithstanding a substantial and compelling body of evidence in support of his application, it was initially refused. However, an appeal to the First Tier Tribunal reversed the decision and WA was permitted to remain, initially as a refugee, for 5 years. Thereafter, he was granted indefinite leave to remain (23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> July 2009).  WA had escaped from his native Palestine where he reports having suffered sustained physical abuse by members of Hamas in consequence of his refusal to act as a suicide bomber. It is said that his Grandmother had been able to provide a bribe to a Hamas soldier to facilitate WA’s escape. His Grandmother was also able to finance and arrange for WA to leave the country. He travelled to Italy, where he initially claimed asylum. In Italy, WA and one other boy were allocated a foster carer. That proved to be a disastrous placement, both boys were physically and sexually abused and the other boy was ultimately killed, having been kicked to death by the foster carer. There is a good deal of corroborative material to support these accounts, not least evidence of extensive injury, including stab wounds and a crudely amputated index finger. WA has suffered post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. It is important that I record that I find his account of his early life substantially reliable. To the extent that there may be any inconsistences I do not consider that is a consequence of any dishonesty. I find WA to be open, sensitive and honest. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In 2009 WA was placed with foster carers in the United Kingdom. The carers, Mr and Mrs DT are a West Indian couple in their mid-fifties. It seems to me that they bonded almost immediately with WA and welcomed him to their family as a member of their family. WA still lives with them, now eleven years later. He refers to them as “Mum” and “Dad.” Their own birth children he regards as his siblings and his two Grandmothers take obvious delight in him. They are a close and supportive family and the love, commitment and patience shown by Mr and Mrs DT is both impressive and humbling. During the course of evidence Mr DT described an incident which plainly remains vivid to him, though it occurred shortly after WA joined the family. He told me how WA had been a little slow to come to the dinner table when called. Mr DT used a stronger voice than his usual one to call WA again. He was not shouting or angry, but firm. Nonetheless, this was sufficient to cause WA to dive under a coffee table, curl into a foetal position and urinate. Though he had no real cause to, I sensed Mr DT still felt guilty about this incident. The couple told me that it was a turning point for them. They realised that they would have to treat WA with heightened sensitivity and care. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">WA believed that he was 14 when he was placed with his carers. An initial age assessment undertaken by Gloucestershire County Council confirmed this. However, it was considered that the assessment had not been sufficiently rigorous and two further age assessments were commissioned. WA had been told by his Grandmother before he left Palestine that his date of birth was 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 1994. The subsequent age assessments concluded that WA was five years older than he believed himself to be. The Home Office determined that WA’s date of birth should be 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 1989. It is this date that now appears on WA’s biometric records. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">From one perspective it might be thought that the impact of this bureaucratic decision might have diminished in WA’s thoughts over the last decade and perhaps become little more than a frustrating and upsetting irritation. That has not happened. For WA the removal of his date of birth is perceived as a fundamental violation of his own rights and an assault on his identity. As a prisoner in Palestine and a victim of physical and sexual abuse in Italy, WA experienced the complete negation of his autonomy at a stage in his childhood and adolescence where he might otherwise have started to explore it. Having listened to him, his parents, the psychiatrists and psychologists, during the course of this hearing, it is clear that WA experienced the change of his date of birth as effectively abusive. It triggered, I have been told, the vivid memory of his powerlessness in the instances of childhood trauma that I have summarised above.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Professor Jennifer Wild, whose evidence I will consider below, was of the strong view that the child sexual abuse is the prevailing trauma for WA. She told me that in the context of his life in Gaza, WA knew and understood Hamas to be his enemy who might oppress and torture him. By contrast, the physical and sexual abuse in Italy was perpetrated by somebody who had been trusted to nurture and protect him. The violation in these circumstances was compounded by the breach of trust. WA was entirely powerless. Paradigmatically for victims of such abuse, WA coped by disassociating himself from his circumstances. The psychological trauma which though abated still continues, does not centre upon violent assault or the physical pain which WA undoubtedly suffered and which the scars on his body are ever present reminders, it is his sense of powerlessness and loss of autonomy in the face of forces which he could do nothing about and which continue to compromise his psychological wellbeing. All the psychologists agree with this analysis.  </p>

Each in their different ways emphasised WA’s challenges when he confronts controlling individuals or bureaucratic institutions which are, perhaps necessarily, inflexible. When she began her evidence in chief Mrs DT asked if she might read a short statement she had prepared. She told me that she wanted me to understand WA <span style="font-style:italic">“as a person.”</span> I consider it appropriate to set this short statement out in full: </p>

Manifestly, it does not have the power to review the fairness or rationality of decisions taken by public bodies. During the course of this hearing, a significant number of members of the public have been sitting in, remotely. By this I mean they have applied and been granted entrance to the video conferencing platform on which this court now conducts its daily business. It is important therefore that I emphasise that I have not investigated in anyway the circumstances in which the decision was taken in relation to determining WA’s date of birth. The objectives at this hearing are to identify whether WA has the capacity to take decisions relating to his medical treatment and, if he does not, what treatment plan is in his best interests.  </p>

From what she said and as others have commented, the use of it is experienced by him as some kind of a betrayal. This is, in part, rooted in the fact that it was his Grandmother who gave him written confirmation of his date of birth. She was a very significant person in WA’s life. WA continues to grieve for her. Perhaps even more significantly, he believes that using the date of birth is corrosive of both his integrity and his humanity. WA reverts, I have noticed, to comparing this forced identity, as he believes it to be, to the treatment of animals. “<span style="font-style:italic">This would not happen to a puppy”</span>, he told me.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mrs DT considers that WA will not allow himself to remember his assigned date of birth. Whenever he is asked for it, he gives the date of birth he believes to be true. Though he is an intelligent and articulate man, Mrs DT tells me that WA does not do this to be obstructive or to make a point, he does it because it is his verification of his own identity which he simply cannot let go. It causes endless practical bureaucratic problems and a great deal of distress, not only to WA but to Mr and Mrs DT, particularly Mrs DT. There are countless examples of this distress over the years but a recent incident illustrates the challenges faced. WA applied to help out in the Nightingale Hospital. It is easy to see from his temperament and personality that he would have been able to make a real contribution. His calm and sensitive nature could have been harnessed in all manner of different circumstances. On the application form he did not give his biometric birth date. His application was rejected and Mrs DT, who recognised immediately what had happened had to explain to him why he was rejected. Whenever WA is asked for his date of birth on the telephone, he simply hands the telephone to Mrs DT. In a very real sense this percolates through every aspect of WA’s life and has gradually become intolerable to him.  </p>

At this hearing there has not been time, nor would it have been appropriate, to consider whether that order was properly made. There is no doubt that WA was extremely distressed. An NG tube was inserted on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2020 but WA found it to be intolerable and removed it after the feed had been given.  The evidence of the doctors at this hearing highlights how this process might easily have been retraumatising for WA. An attempt to replace the tube was made on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2020 but it could not be sited satisfactorily and so it was removed.  Eventually, it was replaced but it was then then removed again by WA on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2020. Thereafter, he refused to have it replaced.  </p>

Whether he has the capacity to take decisions regarding his nutrition and hydration has, however, proved to be an extremely difficult question. Before I turn to the evidence on this issue it is helpful to contextualise it in the context of the many assessments of WA’s capacity that have been undertaken and which have reached differing conclusions. Ms Sutton has prepared an extremely helpful chronology which is accepted by all as being entirely accurate and complete. I adopt it:  </p>

The MCA provides a specific statutory definition of mental capacity which is termed to be “decision specific”, predicated on a “functional approach”, evaluated in the framework of a “diagnostic threshold”. Thus, at the core of the Act is a central distinction between the inability to make a decision and the making of a decision which, objectively, would be regarded by others as unwise. Fundamentally, the Act emphasises the right of the individual, in exercising his or her personal autonomy, to make bad decisions even extending to those with potentially catastrophic consequences (see <span style="font-weight:bold">Barnsley Hospital NHS Foundation Trust v MSP [2020] EWCOP 26</span>).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The presumption of capacity, Section 1(2), is the bench mark for decision makers in this sphere. The Act reinforces this by requiring that a person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision unless <span style="font-style:italic">“all practicable steps to help him to do so have been taken without success.” </span> The scope of these unambiguous provisions must be fully recognised and vigilantly guarded. The philosophy informing the legal framework illuminates the point that this case highlights, namely ‘<span style="font-style:italic">a person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision merely because he makes an unwise decision.’</span> This statutory imperative reflected extensive common law jurisprudence, prior to the Mental Capacity Act, recognising that the law does not insist that a person behaves “<span style="font-style:italic">in such a manner as to deserve approbation from the prudent, the wise or the good”</span>: <span style="font-weight:bold">Bird v Luckie (1850) 8 Hare 301.</span> It is the ability to take the decision, not the outcome of it which is in focus: <span style="font-weight:bold">CC v KK and STCC [2012] EWHC 2136 (COP); Kings College Hospital NHS Trust v C &amp; V [2015] EWCOP 80. </span></p>

The purpose of the best interests test is to consider matters from the patient's point of view. That is not to say that his wishes must prevail, any more than those of a fully capable patient must prevail. We cannot always have what we want. Nor will it always be possible to ascertain what an incapable patient's wishes are. Even if it is possible to determine what his views were in the past, they might well have changed in the light of the stresses and strains of his current predicament. In this case, the highest it could be put was, as counsel had agreed, that "It was likely that Mr James would want treatment up to the point where it became hopeless". But insofar as it is possible to ascertain the patient's wishes and feelings, his beliefs and values or the things which were important to him, it is those which should be taken into account because they are a component in making the choice which is right for him as an individual human being.” </span>

Sometimes it will be right to do so, sometimes it will not.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">There is, I consider, no disagreement amongst the professionals that WA can understand the information relevant to the decision and retain it. There is equally no doubt that he can weigh individual facets of the treatment plan. For example, he recognises that the nasal bridle has the advantage of keeping the NG tubes more securely in place and generally restricts the ease with which he could pull them out. He goes so far as to see the advantage in this as preventing him pulling them out in frustration. The real issue, when it is honed down, is whether WA has the capacity to “weigh information” relevant to nutrition and hydration when considering the decision globally rather than in individual components. Dr C said, in evidence, that she found this case, on this point as well as others, <span style="font-style:italic">“extremely difficult”</span>. She described her opinion relating to capacity as <span style="font-style:italic">“on a knife edge”</span>. She candidly volunteered that her thinking had been dragged both ways. She was entirely alert to contrary interpretations which she regarded as valid and frequently accepted. Nonetheless, she considered the rigidity of thinking and preoccupation in relation to his date of birth occluded WA’s capacity to weigh and use the overall information relevant to a decision to accept nutrition and hydration.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Dr C, as I understand her evidence, does not consider that WA’s rejection of food and hydration is motivated to bring pressure on the Home Office. I agree with her. I detect, as she does, a sense of resignation in WA’s manner. The distress caused by the date of birth has regularly intruded into WA’s life and provokes a very powerful emotional resistance. DT not only understands it, she has come to experience it herself. As she told me she suffers with him. In her evidence she concentrated on this pain. She is plainly motivated to encourage the Home Secretary not to resist the Judicial Review on entirely compassionate or public interest grounds. Though DT is a powerful voice for WA she is cautious when responding to questions concerning capacity. That said, she has expressed a view, in her oral evidence, that she considers WA has capacity to take this decision. The emphasis however, of her evidence is to highlight WA’s determination, courage and single mindedness.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">WA’s parents and the doctors, have all noted that WA will sometimes behave in a manner which can best be described as passively acquiescent. This does not always or necessarily signal agreement. It is more accurately characterised as submission or resignation. All the doctors consider this reflects a coping strategy developed by WA when powerless in the face of his extensive abuse.  Whilst there is very much about his life that WA loves, WA told Dr C that he would be <span style="font-style:italic">“lying to himself”</span> if he said he could live without his identity. As I have, with the help of the psychiatrists, drilled down more deeply into WA’s thought processes, I have come to the clear conclusion that, it would be entirely wrong to describe his actions as being on “hunger strike”. As a judge who sometimes sits in the Administrative Court, I have seen a number of hunger strike cases in the context of applications for asylum. They are predominately motivated to achieve one, entirely understandable objective i.e. leave to remain. WA’s situation is different, not least because he already has citizenship. He has partially relented from the full rigour of his refusal to eat and drink at present because, as I see it, he has identified a ray of hope in the Directions made by the judge in the Judicial Review proceedings. Evaluating his response in the context of Dr C’s analysis, I now recognise that WA’s actions are responsive not proactive. Additionally, I note that WA has protected his own privacy at this hearing and he has indicated, through his Counsel, that he does not want his name to be in the public domain. He is intelligent enough to know that this reduces the profile of his case and would, objectively, diminish the impact of a protest. He has listened to the exchanges with the advocates regarding publicity where this point was touched upon. WA is not, in truth, protesting. He has all but given up, save for this small window of hope.  </p>

It is difficult to determine how these impacts could be minimised since there would be a potential perception of a loss of control over what happens to him, which overlaps with past trauma.

In trauma-focused treatment, a tool called stimulus discrimination is used to help patients break the link between triggers in the present and the past trauma.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I turn finally to the evidence of Dr Cahill, a Consultant Psychiatrist. He is the clinical lead for the Cheshire and Wirral Partnership NHS Foundation Trust Eating Disorder Service. He is a member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, Faculty of Eating Disorders Executive Committee. Dr Cahill was asked, on behalf of AWP to offer an opinion, specifically on WA’s capacity to accept treatment, mainly in the form of nutrition and hydration. He has reviewed the medical records extensively and interviewed WA. On the 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2020 WA summarised his current situation to Dr Cahill in these terms: <span style="font-style:italic">“they want to take something from me, my date of birth, everything is on my birth certificate. The Home Office says it’s copied. I am on hunger strike for my right.” </span>For the reasons I have analysed above I do not consider that WA was truly describing a hunger strike. I note the following in Dr Cahill’s report: </p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“3.12 </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic">I asked him about the previous times he had been on hunger strike. He described the time when his grandmother died, and he stopped eating for around two weeks. He said that the reason that the hunger strike stopped was that he realised his parents loved him and when they told him that he ‘came back to life’. I asked him why that was different now given that his mum and dad clearly still love him. [WA’s] response was rather tangential as he began discussing his date of birth and the Home Office and I was not able get an answer for this question.” </span>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It seems to me that, when analysed more closely, two very different concepts have elided here; a “maladaptive relationship with food” and “hunger strike.” WA’s refusal to eat for approximately two weeks following the death of his much loved Grandmother, I regard as a manifestation of his grief and profound emotional distress. On Dr Wild’s analysis, which I accept, this is more likely a strategy for gaining some control in circumstances where, in reality, there could be none. WA told Dr Cahill that it was the realisation of how much he was loved by his English parents that brought him back to life. Later in his discussion with Dr Cahill he said <span style="font-style:italic">“enough is enough. I don’t want to have to keep pretending every day I will give my life for my right. If I die, mum will put my real date of birth on my stone and that is important to me.” </span></p>

With candour and great professional integrity, he told me that when he concluded his meeting with WA he was greatly challenged as to the appropriate conclusion but inclined to think WA was capacitous. Following the meeting Dr Cahill discussed WA with Dr G, the Consultant Liaison Psychiatrist with whom WA clearly has a positive relationship. Dr G told Dr Cahill that her relationship with WA has grown because they have found joint interests, and when discussing these he become positive, animated and has positive views for the future.  She said that there had been a number of occasions where WA has shown humour and that his mental state improves when his needs are met or when he perceives people taking his side. She considered that he displayed <span style="font-style:italic">“learnt behaviours”</span> with <span style="font-style:italic">“underling maladaptive behaviours”</span> when his needs are not met. I should state that nobody has suggested these behaviours are intended to manipulate events they are maladaptive strategies to achieve emotional respite.  </p>

She refined this <span style="font-style:italic">“when there are gestures of love and kindness he is more amenable to treatment. In contrast, when he perceives someone is persecuting him it has the opposite effect.” </span>Dr G also said that sometimes WA just gets himself in to a <span style="font-style:italic">“muddle”.  </span></p>

Though he can comprehend individual facets of the decision very clearly, the ultimate balancing of the key facts is compromised by the weight WA gives to his assigned date of birth, which he perceives to be the only way that his identity is validated. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Dr Cahill, like Dr C, engages fully with Dr Wild’s differing perspectives. He acknowledges that even if WA has difficulties with his identity it could be argued that there was no link between this and his decision to refuse nutrition. The reasoning linking these two factors, Dr Cahill also recognised, might well be perceived as too logically structured or calculated to support a conclusion that WA lacked capacity. Indeed, their very complexity might indicate precisely the opposite.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Having reflected on this alternative hypothesis, Dr Cahill nonetheless concluded that WA’s traumatic past and childhood had severely affected his personality, the way he perceives the world, his self-esteem and his sense of self-worth. He was of the view that WA has become fixated with the assigned date of birth to a degree which overwhelms him and to a point where it dominates his thinking and becomes a conductor for past trauma. Ultimately, he concluded this occludes WA’s ability to weigh the relevant information in the context of a global decision as opposed to individual facets of it. Thus, Dr Cahill reasons, this constitutes an impairment of the mind and prevents WA from taking the decision. Dr Cahill plainly considered that Dr G’s account of WA, based on her close and comfortable relationship with him, reinforced his view as to WA’s fragility and heightened sensitivity to perceived injustice. Dr Cahill would not expect this behaviour in someone of WA’s age (whichever might be accurate) and he considers it to be rooted in trauma and the consequent complex PTSD. In response to a question from Ms Scott, on behalf of WA, Dr Cahill agreed that he had reached his conclusion on a fine balance and accepted Dr C’s phrase, “knife edge” decision as apposite. Though I was greatly impressed by Dr Wild’s powerful analysis of those features of WA’s thought processes which point towards his having capacity, I have ultimately come to the conclusion that the view of the clinical team and Dr Cahill is more persuasive.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Ms Scott, submitted that in circumstances where the evidence was so finely balanced as to be on a “knife edge”, it could not easily be said properly to have rebutted the presumption of capacity enshrined within the framework of the MCA. Though that submission is superficially attractive, Ms Scott agreed, in the course of exchanges, that it did not absolve the court from its duty rigorously to analyse the evidence. The presumption of capacity serves to place the burden of proving incapacity squarely on the shoulders of the applicants. The burden of proof remains the balance of probabilities, nothing more northing less (see <span style="font-weight:bold">Re: B [2008] UKHL 35</span>). In some cases, the evidence will tip the balance significantly in one direction. In other cases, such as this, the balance will be more delicately poised, though still identifiably weighted to one side.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Subsection 6, above, is in concentrated focus in this case. WA has expressed himself in language which not only conveys the depth of his wishes and feelings but also communicates them in terms which permit of absolutely no ambiguity. He has consistently maintained that he has <span style="font-style:italic">“had enough”</span> and does not wish to live with his identity compromised by his bureaucratically assigned date of birth. I have concluded that the rigidity of his thinking in this regard has occluded his capacity, in the sense that its overwhelming importance to him inhibits his ability to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of his decision to reject CANH. This does not mean that I regard WA’s reasoning as delusional or even as flawed. On the contrary, I have little difficulty in understanding how important a date of birth is to a young man deracinated from his family and homeland and whose autonomy was, during the course of his childhood and adolescence, crushed by sadistic torture and subsequent sexual abuse. The fact that this aspect of WA’s thinking overwhelms all else does not mean that it does not weigh heavily in the balance when determining where his best interests lie. I consider a decision such as this that is, of itself, entirely coherent, clearly articulated and consistently expressed, requires to be given very great weight. In many circumstances such a decision, even where P is incapacitous, would nonetheless be determinative. It is also important to emphasise that all the evidence indicates that the question of capacity is finely balanced. This serves to reinforce the weight to be given to WA’s consistently expressed views.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In this case there are other factors which also require to be addressed. Firstly, WA has, as discussed above, developed a pattern of passive submission in circumstances where, intellectually and emotionally, he may be profoundly resistant. This strategy was the only way he could survive his abuse. Were he to articulate opposition to Option 3 of the treatment plan i.e. to say “no”, there is a very real danger that any failure to resist on his part might be interpreted as tacit acquiescence. Options 3 specifically contemplates the delivery of nutrition and hydration in the face of verbal refusal but perceived compliance. If WA’s failure actively to resist was not, in truth, consent, there is, as I have been told, a real risk of reigniting the trauma of past abuse.      </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In some circumstances a plan predicated on compliance without actual agreement may be entirely legitimate. I think, for example, of transfusion cases where Jehovah’s witnesses will often indicate that they will submit to an order of the Court in the face of their religious beliefs. Ms Sutton has collated the various phrases that have been used to try to capture the essence of the Treatment Plan which is intended to communicate with clarity what is expected of those charged with providing treatment. She identifies: “gentle persuasion”; “tacitly compliant”; “passive acceptance”; “tacit cooperation” and “acquiescence”. Set out in this way they illustrate the complexity of the challenge to the treating clinicians and nurses, particularly to having regard to WA’s background. Moreover, looked at collectively, the phrases reveal themselves to be that which they are i.e. euphemisms for force feeding. A plan which stated specifically that WA will be force fed unless he actively resists would, I suspect, </p>

I am not intending to be critical in any way, quite the reverse. I recognise that intense effort is being directed towards the preservation of a life which is recognised to be ripe with promise. I have already noted the degree to which this well-mannered, urbane and humorous young man has embedded himself in the affections of the nurses who treat him. But, it must be emphasised that loss of capacity does not override respect for personal autonomy. Protecting the autonomy of the incapacitous is every bit as important as protecting the autonomy of the capacitous. </p>

In fact, I noted in that judgment that feelings can sometimes be communicated, in contra distinction to what is actually said. DT told me in her evidence that there can be times when she considers that WA demonstrates to her both that he understands a proposed treatment and that he does not actively resist it. I took this to mean that this was absent expressed agreement. The reassuring and kindly presence and encouragement of his parents, particularly DT has, I am sure, resulted in WA receiving treatment in which there has been real and nonverbally expressed consent. It is this that the plan has tried to capture.  </p>

DT has told me that her son has strong beliefs, sometimes yielding to the countervailing opinions of others but also steadfast and strong when he is convinced that he is in the right. I have no doubt that whilst there is some identifiable hope of his preferred date of birth being restored, DT will be able to encourage him to take on board nutrition in some way. Equally, were hope to fade, I consider that she knows there would be nothing she could do.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Accommodating this within a treatment plan is, I have concluded, in the circumstances of this case, an unachievable goal. I found Dr Wild’s evidence on the question of WA’s best interests to be logically irresistible. The <span style="font-style:italic">“narrative therapy”</span> she recommends is not only intrinsic to achieving improved psychological health for WA, it is also constructs a pathway to capacity, the promotion of which is imposed by the MCA. Given WA’s lack of enthusiasm for further therapy, the prospects of his engagement cannot be said to be encouraging. The provision of CANH in the absence of the therapeutic support was described by Dr Cahill as treating the symptoms and not the cause and thus ultimately futile. Dr C went even further, stating that feeding WA against his will, with no psychological therapy, would in fact be antitherapeutic. In other words, it would most likely be harmful. I accept both Dr C’s view and Dr Cahill’s graphic but, in my judgement accurate, analogy. All this highlights just how important this package of therapeutic care is. If the psychotherapy were to be offered at a time when WA was being fed against his will, I consider that the prospect of his engaging with it is vanishingly remote.  </p>

She reiterates that what she terms the <span style="font-style:italic">“mental defeat”</span> WA has experienced in the past, may cause him to interpret coercion, persuasion or imposed treatment against his will as effectively abusive. She highlights the ever-present risk of triggering re-traumatisation. She further posits a situation where WA may not have the insight to recognise that his trauma has been triggered and that even if he did, he may not be able to raise it with the clinicians and communicate his experience.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">One further factor must be identified.

It is fraught with unmanageable and significant risk. Ultimately, it cannot be reconciled, in my judgement, with the protection of WA’s autonomy. I consider that every effort should be made, with the parents at the centre of the process, to persuade, cajole and encourage WA to accept nutrition and hydration. Attempts to deploy these techniques should be permitted with far greater persistence than would be considered appropriate in the case of a capacitous adult. I have no doubt that the attempts of persuasion will be delivered in the kindly and sensitive way that is most likely to persuade WA. I make no apologies for repeating that I consider WA has a great deal to offer the world as well as much to receive from it. No effort should be spared in encouraging him to choose life. This said, I have come to the clear view that when WA says no to CANH his refusal should be respected. No must mean no!. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In his childhood and adolescence WA encountered the suppression of his autonomy and the corrosion of his identity. If he will forgive me further ad hominem remarks, I would wish to point out to him that he has his very proud Palestinian name, his rich and beautiful language, a faith which sustains and supports him and a family who loves him and claim him as their own. DT told me that there were times when she was not sure whether she was looking after WA or he after her. I also noticed that Mr DT unconsciously used an Arabic expression that he later told me he had learnt from his son. They are manifestly a close and loving family. I am not in a position to reinforce WA’s sense of identity in any way, only engagement in the identified psychological therapy will achieve that. I, am, however, able to protect WA’s autonomy. In effect, to restore it to him. For all involved in this case the decisions have been difficult and painful. From this point on the decisions will ultimately be taken by WA with the advice and encouragement of his family and the clinicians, but no more than that. </p>
