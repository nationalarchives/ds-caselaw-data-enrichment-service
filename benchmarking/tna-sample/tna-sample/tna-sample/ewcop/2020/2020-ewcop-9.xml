Expenses enough had been already incurred improvidently without adding to them the further costs of a reference.

Various dictionaries define ‘general’ as ‘common,’ ‘widespread’, ‘not specialised’, and ‘applying to or participated in by all or most of the members of a group.’ The purpose of the ‘general’ authority is to enable a property and affairs deputy to do on behalf of P those myriad tasks too numerous to identify individually which are commonly required to manage an individual’s financial affairs efficiently.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.08in;text-indent:0.5in">I am not convinced that Practice Direction 19B provides any basis for determining the extent of ‘general’ authority. In respect of conveyancing, the wording of the relevant provision (paragraph 14) clearly links to a deputy’s authority to sell or purchase property, which nowadays is expressly included in or excluded from a deputy’s authority in a standard order, and not to the ‘general’ authority. Irrespective of whether any party to the process has or lacks the relevant capacity, conveyancing is a necessary part of purchase or sale of property. A deputy’s authority to purchase or sell property on behalf of P can therefore only be effective if it incorporates authority to complete the conveyancing process on P’s behalf. That the process is unlikely to be administered by the deputy personally is within the ordinary understanding of permitted delegation.      </p>

To that extent, characterising any requirement to “draft and advise in relation to employment contracts relating to a business belonging to P” as “unexceptional” is something of a stretch. Moreover, it is the experience of the central registry that applicants for deputyship in such circumstances generally seek specific authority to deal with the business, and the authorisations granted are individually framed for the needs of the particular case. In my judgment, dealing with employment contracts relating to P’s business is better seen as part of such authorisation than as part of “general management.” </p>

This expectation is obviously motivated by the need to meet the best interests of P by ensuring that he is not charged more than is reasonable (as opposed to meeting the business interests of a professional deputy by ensuring that he can charge his client at a higher than reasonable rate.) I am not persuaded that it suggests anything about what tasks a deputy is authorised to do on behalf of P. Moreover, obtaining advice is not delegating a ministerial task; it is seeking a professional service.  </p>

This is what I understand the Official Solicitor to be saying when she takes the position that obtaining advice on behalf of P will sometimes be within the “general” authority, and will sometimes require specific authority. The effect is the same. In respect of non-contentious matters, the deputy’s approach should be to ask themselves if the subject of the advice is within their authority ie will their existing authority be sufficient to act on the advice if taken? If it is, then seeking advice is likely to be an ‘ordinary’ part of that function. If it is not, seeking advice is likely to be outside their authority.  </p>

Moreover, the deputy will be required as part of the normal best interests decision making process to consider whether the cost of the advice/work is proportionate to P’s estate and the importance of the issue to P; and to evidence that decisionmaking process. Any costs will be either limited to fixed rates or subject to SCCO assessment. In my judgment, those requirements are a proportionate means of protecting P’s interests. It is not helpful for me to ‘fix’ a financial limit to the non-contentious legal tasks within a deputy’s authority (subject to conflict of interest considerations below).

I acknowledge that a ‘standard’ approach has the attraction of clarity but the current concern is to address the risks of conflict of interest. Perversely, a ‘standard’ authority may act as an incentive for a deputy to find occasions to instruct his own firm to ‘use up’ this sanctioned source of business. Moreover, once the early stages of advice have been obtained, that fact in itself is likely to have an impact on any later consideration of whether it is in P’s best interests for advice/tasks to be obtained from a different source. As Ms. Clement put it, “it is almost always in P’s best interests to avoid duplication.” In my judgment, the concerns about standardised authority of a threshold for instructing a deputy’s own firm outweigh its merits. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.08in;text-indent:0.5in">Plainly there is a conflict of interest in Ms. Waite instructing Irwin Mitchell LLP. The Official Solicitor points out that there is a conditional fee agreement in place in respect of HPP’s damages proceedings. The original agreement was signed by the original litigation friend – HPP’s then partner. However, an amended CFA was subsequently entered into by the next litigation friend, Michael Knott. This second (current) version included an increased success fee (20%) [<span style="font-weight:bold">D79</span>] even though by then liability had been admitted. The Official Solicitor points out that the <span style="font-style:italic">only</span> person able to decide whether or not to enter into this new agreement on behalf of HPP was Michael Knott, who was at the time a partner in Irwin Mitchell LLP and a Director of Irwin Mitchell Trust Corporation. With no external control at all, the conflict of interest could not be clearer. The Official Solicitor considers that, if she were acting as litigation friend for HPP, it is “certainly possible that she could obtain terms for [him] which are better than those presently being  offered to him by Irwin Mitchell” [<span style="font-weight:bold">position statement paragraph 31</span>].     </p>

He explained that the original CFA in HPP’s damages case was the Irwin Mitchell minimum at the time; and the second one became necessary when Irwin Mitchell varied its minimum requirement in the light of statutory changes to public funding arrangements.    </p>
