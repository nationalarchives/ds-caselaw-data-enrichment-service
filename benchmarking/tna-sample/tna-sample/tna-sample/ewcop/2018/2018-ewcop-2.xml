	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">These complex and difficult proceedings in the Court of Protection concern a 37-year-old woman, hereafter referred to as M, who (as I have found, for reasons set out below) at present lacks capacity by virtue of a combination of psychotic illness and acquired brain injury. The parties to the proceedings are the applicant, M’s father, hereafter referred to as AB; her aunt, hereafter referred to as HT; the local authority for the area where HT, and currently M, live, namely the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham; and a man hereafter referred to as MS, with whom M went through a religious ceremony of marriage in 2013. A dispute has arisen concerning a number of issues about her past, present and future which has necessitated a lengthy and unusual fact-finding hearing. This judgment sets out my conclusions on the disputed matters of fact, together with an analysis as to her capacity, and orders made following my findings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">M was born in Somalia in 1980, the oldest of seven children. She lived in that country with her extended family until she was 7. She attended a local school but it was noted that she was unable to perform as well academically as her siblings. Reports in her medical records indicate that she witnessed many violent incidents during her childhood. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Subsequently, although the precise dates are unclear, M spent time with her family in Italy and Holland. As a teenager, she attended night school, undertaking a business apprenticeship. She then left home and supported herself for some time, working in offices and warehouses on an agency basis and sleeping on friends’ floors. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In 2002, she moved with her younger sister to Australia where she married an Ethiopian man. According to her medical records, her husband was physically and verbally abusive to her and the marriage broke down. In June 2004, she moved to this country to live with her father, AB, who had settled here some years earlier. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In 2005, she was referred for psychiatric examination because of concerns about her behaviour including social isolation, sitting and doing nothing for hours, and wandering aimlessly. The initial diagnosis was that she was suffering from either schizophrenia or psychotic depression. Treatment with an antipsychotic drug and anti-depressant medication was started and she was noted to show a positive response over the following weeks.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In November 2005, however, M was physically attacked and raped and subsequently admitted to hospital with a severe head injury for which she required surgery, together with a number of fractures to her facial bones. She underwent a left temporal craniotomy and was in hospital for some weeks. An assessment by Mr Badwan, consultant in rehabilitation medicine, noted she was suffering from amnesia, disorientation in time and space, and absence of spontaneous speech. Subsequently, her behaviour gave rise for further concern when she wandered off the ward. A further review by Dr Badwan noted persistent memory deficits. In March 2006, a neuro-psychiatrist concluded that her underlying condition was hebephrenic schizophrenia. In March 2006, she was admitted under s.3 of the Mental Health Act 1983 and treated with risperidone and other antipsychotic antidepressant medication. After three months, she showed an improvement and was discharged into the care of her father, AB, with community care follow up by the mental health team.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is plain from the contemporaneous medical records and other documents that M suffered severely as a result of this attack, both physically and psychologically. In his oral evidence before me, however, her father AB asserted that he did not think she had suffered any or any significant psychological damage.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In 2008, M underwent further neurosurgery for the insertion of a titanium plate in her head. In August 2009, her father was appointed her deputy for property and affairs due to her lack of capacity to make decisions concerning those matters. Thereafter, M attended a rehabilitation facility at St Andrews Hospital in Northampton and also a women’s day centre to assist with her rehabilitation and socialisation. Staff at the centre reported concerns about her safety and well being. She was noted to be distressed and preoccupied, and reported that her father was crazy and had threatened to kill her and take her out of the country. She also alleged that ladies from the Muslim community hit her and shouted at her to make her wear a hijab which she said made her unhappy. The safeguarding team, however, concluded that there was no evidence that she was being abused by her father. In 2011, she made an allegation to her community psychiatric nurse that her father had assaulted her after an argument. Subsequently, however, she said that that had not happened. In 2012, a psychiatrist reviewing her condition described her as coherent but noted that she had ongoing hallucinations. A further psychiatric review in February 2013 concluded that she was mentally stable and she was discharged back to the care of her GP. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On 15 August 2013, M took part in a religious marriage ceremony with MS, the fourth respondent in these proceedings, at the Northampton Islamic Centre. The circumstances of this ceremony are a central feature in this case and I shall consider the evidence about it below. For the next few weeks, M lived with her father and her putative husband. In October 2013, M underwent further surgery at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford to trim the titanium plate and reclose the wound. At or around the same time, her father, AB, went to Switzerland to visit his wife, leaving M at his home in Northampton with MS.</p>

It is HT’s case that she found the property in an unsatisfactory and dirty condition, with M in poor health, and that she witnessed MS speaking aggressively towards her. HT asserts that M asked her not to leave without her and HT therefore decided to take her to London with her. Prior to leaving Northampton, HT reported her concerns and allegations of forced marriage to the police. </p>

On admission she was found to have disordered thoughts and incoherent speech, and to be agitated, irritable, and unaware of the risks from her wandering behaviour. She was again diagnosed as suffering from hebephrenic schizophrenia and treated with antipsychotic medication. Gradually her mental state improved and her symptoms diminished. In July 2014, she was discharged into the community into the care of HT and was allocated a community psychiatric nurse.</p>

Prior to that point neither he nor MS had apparently taken any active steps to bring about M’s return to Northampton. In November 2014, a social worker undertook a capacity assessment and concluded that M did not have the capacity to make decisions about where she should live. On 17 April 2015, M’s father filed an application in the Court of Protection asking the court to decide whether M was capable of deciding where she should live, and seeking an order that she should reside with him and that he be appointed her personal welfare deputy, to make decisions in respect of where she should live and as to her medical treatment, in addition to the property and affairs deputyship he already held. </p>

On 9 July 2015, District Judge Marin joined MS as the fourth respondent. He further declared that in the interim it was in M’s best interests to reside with HT and to have no contact with her father or MS. He further suspended the father’s deputyship for property and affairs and directed that M’s treating psychiatrist, Dr O’Halloran, prepare a report under s.49 of the Mental Capacity Act 2005. In her report dated 28 August 2015, Dr O’Halloran confirmed the diagnosis of hebephrenic schizophrenia. She described M’s condition as enduring and thought it unlikely that she would recover significantly. It was Dr O’Halloran’s opinion that M’s mental disorder was of a nature and degree sufficient to impair her cognitive function including language, comprehension, communication and memory, and her emotional functioning. She noted that M had also suffered the traumatic brain injury in 2005 from which she had a number of sequelae primarily relating to memory, judgment and other cognitive skills which together represent a severe cognitive impairment. In addition, she noted that M’s father had raised the possibility that M had a pre-existing mild learning difficulty. At a further interim hearing in September 2015, District Judge Marin ordered a supplemental report from Dr O’Halloran involving a review of M’s GP records. In her supplemental report dated 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> September, Dr O’Halloran reported that the review of the GP records for 2013/2014 had not altered her opinion. She noted that a GP entry of 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> August 2013, “albeit using a lay description, suggests a presentation similar to that which has been recorded in the subsequent mental health notes and to that noted by me in subsequent reviews. It fits with the essentially enduring nature of her hebephrenic schizophrenia and the sequelae of her traumatic brain injury.” In October 2015, Dr O’Halloran filed a third report responding to questions raised by some of the parties. </p>

After hearing argument, I decided that it was in M’s best interests to have indirect contact with her father by way of cards, letter and pre-recorded video message, and that direct contact may take place between M and her father should all parties (except MS) agree that it was in her best interests, having regard to her wishes and feelings. I ordered that it was not in M’s best interests to have any interim contact with MS. As <br/>Dr O’Halloran was unable to complete the capacity assessment previously ordered, I expanded the scope of Dr Grace’s instruction as requested. I further ordered MS to disclose documents relating to his immigration status.

At a hearing on 6 April, I adjourned the hearing on AB’s assurance that he intended to instruct lawyers and to be fully represented at the contested hearing which was relisted for seven days at the end of June. I made a further declaration that it was in M’s best interests to have indirect contact with her father. No application for interim contact was made on behalf of MS at that stage. I also made further case management directions, including that MS should file a further schedule of allegations of financial misconduct in the event that he wished to pursue an argument that HT had misappropriated funds belonging to M.

Six days had been allocated for the taking of oral evidence, in the hope that submissions could be delivered on day seven.

He described this profile as characteristic of the received diagnosis of hebephrenic schizophrenia. He described her illness thereafter as having pursued a chronically disabling and treatment refractory course. It had been difficult for her to maintain adherence to treatment and multiple interruptions had resulted in a series of relapses. The subsequent physical assault in 2005, resulting in a subarachnoid haemorrhage requiring neurosurgery followed by lengthy rehabilitation, had exacerbated her problems. She has therefore experienced significant deficits in cognitive functioning to which both the chronic psychosis and traumatic brain injury have contributed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As at March 2017, M continued to present with significant residual manifestations of her psychotic illness. Serial assessments had demonstrated her mental state to vacillate markedly. On occasion she presented as relaxed, spontaneous and able to offer moments of social reciprocity and dialogue. For the most part, however, such positive findings were subsumed by significant degrees of perplexity and fretful occupation when she presents as highly distracted by hallucinations. Dr Andrews advised that her affect remained blunted and sometimes incongruous, and her thinking significantly impoverished and profoundly disorganised. Such fragmentary accounts as she is able to articulate of her residual persecutory delusions and auditory hallucinations appear highly distressing to her. It is not unusual, however, for M to assert that she feels well and there is “nothing wrong”. As a result, over the years, her commitment to maintaining treatment programmes has been erratic.</p>

Although there had been some improvement in her condition, the manifestations of mental disorder were still very much present and she continued to require a great deal of support. Her insight into her condition was limited – given the choice, she would leave hospital and cease treatment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As stated above, M has now been started on clozapine. Dr Andrews described this as a critical point in her psychiatric treatment, representing the best available strategy for dealing with treatment-resistant psychosis in terms of centre control, cognition, daily functioning and global well-being. He advised that it would take some time to establish an adequate and therapeutic dose. Once achieved, a minimum period of at least six months, probably longer, would be required to determine her optimal response. When her psychosis is more controlled, a more detailed neuropsychological assessment is proposed to determine the extent of her cognitive deficits, and preserved functioning and strengths, to inform future management strategy and goals.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Dr Andrews concluded his first report in March 2017 by giving a “guarded prognosis” reflecting the combined impact of the likely period of untreated illness in the past, the limited response and interruptions to previous treatment strategies, and the additional impact of M’s acquired brain injury. He thought it likely that she would continue to suffer enduring psychotic symptoms, and deficits in cognition and psychosocial functioning. In March 2017, he anticipated a further period of between eighteen and thirty-six months in-patient care. It was too early to determine what sort of care environment would be appropriate following discharge, although Dr Andrew thought it very likely that she would continue to require a highly supported specialist placement providing twenty-four hour care and a high level of psychiatric after-care.</p>

Whilst still liable to show marked social isolation, there had been some improvement in her participation in and tolerance of structured therapies. The focus at that stage was on plans to address problems with her titanium cranioplasty plate which was causing her pain and at some points protruding through the skin. As a result, further surgery was under consideration.</p>

He expressed concern that, if contact with her father were to be ordered at that stage, there might be an aggravation of symptoms. He was also concerned about the need to keep M engaged with the current treatment programme and the proposed further surgical intervention. It was his view that there was only so much she could cope with at that point. Although there may be some improvement as a result of the treatment, his conclusion was that “in any event, this is a poor prognosis patient … We may not get rid of all the symptoms [of the psychosis] and certainly won’t get rid of the injury, but may improve her well-being and improve those elements of her cognitive impairment that are affected by psychosis”. He thought she would continue to require access to 24-hour support, perhaps in the community. Decisions about her long-term placement would have to be taken “much further down the line when we have a clearer picture of her response to treatment”.</p>

At examination on 28 March 2017, the mental state findings of schizophrenia, plus the likely additional impact of cognitive deficits secondary to an acquired brain injury, satisfied the requirement of s.2 of the 2005 Act for “an impairment of, or disturbance in, the functioning of the mind or brain”. The diagnostic test for lack of capacity was therefore satisfied.</p>

She offered various views, including that “it had been great” to move with her aunt to London but without being able to say why, other than she felt “supported by her”. M acknowledged that she had once lived with AB but that she was “finished with Northampton” and did not wish to return there. She struggled to describe the relationship with AB beyond stating, after considerable mental effort, that he was her father. She also repeatedly indicated that she considered that she had no home, stating at various points that she wished to return to Somalia, or Nairobi, or to her aunt in Fulham, without giving reasons.

She repeatedly asserted that this was not choice but something expected of women from her background. When invited to consider some very basic information about the nature of a marriage contract, including an agreement between two people for which each had a choice to live together and share a loving relationship, a home and responsibilities towards each other, she became distressed and too thought-disordered to indicate any further response, so that it was not considered appropriate to continue the dialogue.</p>

Asked for further comment in March 2017 following receipt of Dr Andrews’ report, Dr Grace remained of the view that assessment of capacity at that stage will be affected by her schizophrenia and would not reflect her at her best in terms of making long-term decisions. She also expressed concern that repeated assessments would cause M distress and impinge negatively on her engagement with the treatment programme. She therefore advised leaving complex capacity assessments until the treatment had stabilised. She thought it likely that this would take at least a year but possibly significantly longer. In oral evidence at the end of June 2017, Dr Grace stated that she thought it would be twelve months before the schizophrenia had abated to a level at which it would be appropriate to consider whether a further capacity assessment should be carried out.

The evidence on which the local authority relied was that of Dr O’Halloran. Neither Dr Andrews not Dr Grace was willing to express an opinion as to whether historically M had lacked capacity, principally because of the reports of fluctuating psychotic symptoms.

She thought it likely that the cognitive deficits in 2013 had therefore been the same as they were at the time of her examination in 2015. As to the capacity to consent to sexual relations, Dr O’Halloran added that, as with the capacity to marry, it was difficult to comment on her capacity in July 2013, but her mental capacity was enduring, and in Dr O’Halloran’s opinion would not have been significantly different at the time of the marriage ceremony.</p>

I endorse the local authority’s position not to pursue this aspect. As Mr Bagchi observed in closing submissions, there is very little contemporaneous evidence as to M’s mental state in 2013 and, given the reported fluctuations in her symptoms, it is not appropriate to speculate as to the effect of her underlying difficulties on her cognitive functioning at that time. The Official Solicitor invites the court to conclude that the totality of evidence as to her functioning in 2013 does not displace the statutory presumption that she probably had the capacity to marry on 15 August 2013, and the capacity to have sexual relations, when she went through the ceremony of marriage to MS. On behalf of AB, Mr O’Brien voiced concerns that Dr O’Halloran’s erroneous approach to the assessment of these capacities may have had an adverse influence on best interests decisions, including as to M’s contact with her father.</p>

He recognised the cogency of the current evidence but ultimately left the decision to the court.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On behalf of AB, Mr O’Brien submits that the court should not make final declarations as to capacity in the light of the evidence of Dr Andrews that there are signs that M’s psychotic symptoms are improving under the present clozapine treatment, and that a further assessment of capacity would be appropriate once the outcome of that treatment programme is known. Mr O’Brien submits that the course for which he contends is consistent with s.1(3) of the Act – “a person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision unless all practicable steps to help him to do so have been taken without success”. His position is supported by Mr Simblet on behalf of MS who draws attention to the obligation imposed on the court by s.4(3), when determining what is in M’s best interests, to consider whether it is likely that she will at some time have capacity in relation to the matter in question and, if so, when that is likely to be. In response, Mr Bhose for the local authority submits that those representing AB and MS may have misunderstood Dr Andrews’ evidence. Dr. Andrews did not say that a reassessment of M’s capacity might be made in December 2017 but, rather, that at that point a re-evaluation of M’s rehabilitation and treatment might be possible so as to indicate when in the future a reassessment of capacity might be undertaken. In addition, Mr Bhose drew attention to Dr Andrews’ overall pessimism as to M’s prognosis and the likelihood of her regaining capacity. On behalf of the Official Solicitor for M, Mr Bagchi submitted that, taken as a whole, the oral evidence of Dr Andrews and Dr Grace suggested a much longer timescale for recovery than the period of six months suggested on behalf of other parties. For those reasons, the local authority and Official Solicitor submitted that there is no justification in delaying a final declaration as to capacity or the ending of these proceedings. </p>

I specifically agree with Mr Bagchi’s observation that there is very little contemporaneous evidence as to M’s mental state in 2013 and, given the reported fluctuations in her symptoms, it is not appropriate to speculate as to the effect of her underlying difficulties on her cognitive functioning at that time. I reached this conclusion having regard, in particular, to (1) the fundamental principles underpinning the MCA 2005, especially the presumption of capacity in s.1(2); (2) the complexities involved in any assessment of capacity, both as a matter of law under s.2 and 3 of the MCA and the associated provisions of the Code of Practice, and, as a matter of general clinical and professional practice, and (3) the specific complexities of M’s own condition, comprising as it does a mingling of two elements – a fluctuating psychotic condition and permanent brain damage resulting from the infected head injury – and the difficulties at any specific point of carrying out an assessment of her capacity, both in terms of process and analysis.</p>

In reaching that conclusion, I have applied the principles identified above to the evidence carefully provided by Dr Andrews and supported by others. Accordingly, this court now has the power to make decisions concerning disputed issues as to what is in M’s best interests.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, so far as future capacity is concerned, I conclude that it is neither appropriate nor possible for this court to reach a conclusion about whether, and, if so, when, M might regain capacity. In making decisions as to her best interests, I must, as Mr Simblet reminds me, consider inter alia whether it is likely that she will at some time have capacity in relation to the matter in question and, if so, when that is likely to be. Having considered the evidence concerning those matters, I conclude that I cannot say whether, and, if so, when, it is likely that M will recover capacity in all or any of the six areas identified above. What is clear, however, is that, unlike many persons lacking capacity whose cases come before this Court, it is possible that M may recover capacity in respect of at least some of those areas. Dr Andrews is pessimistic concerning her overall prognosis but, on the other hand, is hopeful that the clozapine treatment will lead to an improvement in her condition to a stage where a reassessment of capacity will be possible at some point. It is impossible to predict when that point will arise, but, on the basis of the evidence of Dr Andrews and Dr Grace, I conclude that it is unlikely that it will occur until the second half of 2018 at the earliest. The importance of this is that the Court of Protection’s power to make decisions concerning M’s best interests in any particular area only continues for as long as M lacks capacity in that area. If and when she recovers capacity in any one of the six areas identified above, decisions concerning that area will be a matter for her and her alone. The fact that there is at least a possibility that M may recover capacity in one or more area in the future is plainly relevant to the best interests decisions to be made in the light of my findings below and to the question whether these proceedings should continue. I shall return to that issue at the end of the judgment.</p>

In particular, it is asserted that HT told AB on the day of the wedding ceremony that M did not want to marry MS and that AB responded “I’ll make her”. This allegation is denied by AB. MS’s response is that he does not believe that AB coerced M into marrying him but rather believes that M married him of her own free will.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Linked to these first two allegations are findings sought by HT alone.  HT alleges that AB and MS failed to take any or any reasonable or proper steps to ascertain whether M had capacity to marry and/or concealed her mental health and/or her marriage from those who may have been concerned to ascertain her capacity. She further alleges that AB failed to take any or any proper steps to assist M to make a capacitous decision whether to marry. AB’s response, in summary, is that it is not possible to either accept or deny that steps were not taken to ascertain whether M had capacity to marry, as AB considered at the time that she did have capacity. He asserts that, as he is neither a mental health professional nor a lawyer, he would have consulted professionals had he had any concerns about her welfare, but he did not. He denies that he ever concealed either her mental health or her marriage. MS’s response is that he had no reason to believe, before or at the time of the marriage to M, that she lacked capacity. He believed, and continues to believe, that she had capacity to enter into an Islamic marriage. He was aware of her diagnosis of schizophrenia in 2005/6 from which it was said she had recovered and, having consulted his friend Dr Sheikh, concluded that she had no symptoms of any mental health conditions and “therefore… strongly believed that [she] had capacity to marry”. In the schedule, HT’s and AB’s respective legal representatives set out in some detail specific matters on which they rely in respect of these allegations. In so far as is relevant for my decision, I shall consider those matters further below.</p>

AB responds that the money was paid to M by MS. For his part, MS denies that he paid M £1000 for the marriage. The sum of £1000 was agreed as the dowry. On the day the marriage, he gave her the money in cash “which she told him to return but to which she had access as required by her”.</p>

In the light of the evidence given by Dr O’Halloran, however, these allegations were withdrawn during the hearing.</p>

During dinner that evening, MS shouted at M. MS denies these allegations. AB’s response is that he can neither accept or deny the allegation as he was not present but asserts in general terms that M often chose to spend time alone in the house, and that, when he left the property, her self-care was not poor and the property was neither dirty nor unclean.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The local authority asserts that, as at 15 November 2013, M’s Santander account, comprising her benefits, had a credit balance of £5469.21. Two further benefit payments were credited to the account at a later stage. By 21 October 2014, the balance was reduced to £1. In the intervening period, there had been approximately twenty-eight cash withdrawals by AB in various locations in Sweden and Switzerland. None of that money had been spent on M. The local authority makes a similar allegation in respect of M’s other account, with HSBC, comprising her compensatory monies from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board in respect of her assault and rape in 2005. Between October 2013 and June 2015, over £6000 of that money was removed by AB in a series of cash withdrawals. The local authority asserts that AB dishonestly deprived M of the money with the intention of permanently depriving her of it or, alternatively that, in breach of his duties as her deputy, he spent the money on himself and third parties and not in M’s best interests.</p>

AB continues: “with the benefit of hindsight, AB realises that his doing so would not appear objectively to be in the best interests of his daughter. However, he considered at the time that M would support the decisions he made in this situation, given in particular the close bond that she had with her grandmother. In spending this money, his intention was never to permanently deprive M. He had the genuine held belief that the situation he found himself in was an emergency … In addition he always intended to repay any funds that were spent in full. He did not know that he would not see his daughter for almost 3 years, and so had no opportunity to do so. In addition, when spending these funds, he did so in the knowledge that he had previously spent a number of years (between 2004 and 2006) before M was in receipt of her welfare benefits… supporting his daughter single-handed. It is not accepted that AB acted dishonestly or with an intention to permanently deprive M of these funds.” It is his case that, “were she capacitous, M would have agreed to his using the money in fulfilling his duties to the rest of his (and her) family as a matter of last resort.” He adds that he always intended to seek further employment so that he could continue to support M. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The local authority further asserts that, at an earlier stage, between June 2011 and September 2013, AB spent over £2600 of M’s money on flights and other travel expenses for himself and third parties, on some occasions when accompanied by M but on other occasions when not. The local authority again asserts that, in doing so, AB dishonestly deprived M of the money with the intention of permanently depriving her of it or, alternatively that, in breach of his duties as her deputy, he spent the money on himself and third parties and not in M’s best interests. AB accepts (“with deep regret”) that he used the money as alleged, but states that he spent the money “with no dishonest agenda but rather as a matter of last resort” and reiterates that he acted in the knowledge that he has supported M throughout her adult life, that he believed she would support his reasons for spending the money, that he never intended to deprive her permanently of the money, but always intended to find employment so he could continue to support her.</p>

AB again accepts (“with deep regret”) that he transferred the money to his daughter-in-law for urgent repairs to her home. He asserts that his daughter-in-law subsequently repaid £1700 to AB and paid the balance of £300 to a charity at AB’s direction on M’s behalf to fulfil religious obligations to give a proportion of annual income to charity. The sum of £1700 was retained by AB to cover household expenses up to March 2015 “as he had no other funds coming in at this time, and from his point of view he and M were at risk of losing their home”. AB does not accept that in doing so he was acting dishonestly. </p>

AB denies breaking his assurance to the OPG but accepts that he spent M’s money as described above. He accepts that he continued to claim her carer’s allowance for some months after she left his home, believing and intending that she would return to live with him.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">AB seeks a finding that, until the filing of her witness statement in July 2015, HT never alleged that M had told her that she did not want to get married or that she had told AB, who had responded “I’ll make her”, or that, in her view, AB coerced M into marrying MS, despite having had ample opportunity to do so. In response, HT states that these allegations are factually inaccurate and are denied. In the schedule, HT’s representatives draw attention to documents in which, it is asserted, HT did raise these matters at an earlier stage. AB seeks a further finding that, until she removed M from AB’s home, HT had not expressed to AB or anyone that she did not consider that AB had acted in M’s best interests while she resided with him. In response, HT again states that these allegations are factually inaccurate and are denied. AB further seeks a finding that HT did not tell M that returning to live with him was an option open to her. HT agrees that she did not advise her of this, adding that it would have been distressing to M to make such a suggestion. AB also seeks a finding that, after removing M from AB’s home and until the position was regularised by the court, HT prevented contact between M and AB and other family members and discouraged M from seeing her father. In response, HT asserts that she neither discouraged nor prevented such contact, but adds that, since living in London, M has said that she does not want to see her father, that HT had been advised by the police not to have any contact with AB, and that, until October 2014, AB was out of the country and did not seek contact. AB also seeks a finding that, as long ago as 2011, HT had told AB’s mother and siblings that she wanted to care for M in future. This is denied by HT. AB seeks a finding that HT has influenced M to say that she did not want to be married to a man of Indian origin. This is again denied by HT. She agrees that she was not happy about the marriage, but denies that this was because of MS’s background, pointing out that she has numerous close relatives married to persons of different cultures. AB seeks a finding that HT did not visit M in hospital in 2005. HT accepts that she did not visit her immediately because she was unaware of the assault or M’s hospitalisation for some time. Finally, AB asserts that HT has made false allegations against him, in particular that, when she told him that M had said she did not want to be married, he had replied “I’ll make her”. HT denies that any of the allegations made against AB were false.</p>

Further possibilities include faulty recollection or confusion at times of stress, or when the importance and accuracy are not fully appreciated, or there may be inaccuracy or mistake in the recordkeeping or recollection of the person hearing and relaying the account.  The possible effects of delay and repeated questioning upon memory should also be considered, as should the effect on one person of hearing accounts given by others.

But, having taken those matters carefully into account, I formed the firm conclusion that his evidence was unsatisfactory and in many respects unreliable. He failed to answer a number of questions posed by Mr Bhose behalf of the local authority in a simple or straightforward way – for example, in relation to the circumstances of the Islamic marriage in 2013, M’s financial affairs, and his own travelling in the period 2013 to 2014. His explanations for previous inconsistent statements were unconvincing. As Mr Bhose observes in closing submissions, AB displayed a marked greater ability or willingness to answer questions subsequently put by Mr Simblet on behalf of MS. For those reasons, it is submitted that AB was not a truthful witness and that is evidence cannot be relied upon in the absence of corroboration.</p>

Mr Bhose points out that, in contrast to AB and HT, MS has benefited from a high level of education, who on his own evidence has spent a number of years studying for a Masters degree in law, and was plainly more at ease with the court process than the other two witnesses. He demonstrated an ability to recall details of the case but only, it is submitted, when those details supported his argument. On other occasions, he avoided answering the question. One example, relied on by the local authority, is when he was asked by Mr Bhose to explain how other witnesses could have known for some time before Eid that the wedding was taking place a few days later on 15 August when, on his case, he had not been introduced to M until 8 August. MS did not answer this question, choosing instead to give a long and irrelevant speech to the effect that nothing was certain until it happened. This was not the only occasion when MS conducted his evidence in that fashion.

MS failed to comply with this order but instead made an application for permission to withhold his immigration documents on grounds that: (1) the documents contain sensitive personal data coming under the Data Protection Act; (2) because to disclose the documents would tend to expose him to criminal proceedings and as a result he claimed privilege against self-incrimination under section 14(a) of the Civil Evidence Act 1968; (3) because to disclose the documents would further tend to expose M to criminal proceedings, and (4) such disclosure was an infringement of his right under article 8 of ECHR. His application was refused by Peter Jackson J (as he then was). Mr Bhose submits that this was a deliberate ploy by MS to conceal the truth about his immigration status and its relevance to his wish to marry M.

The most striking example of this on which Mr O’Brien relies is an allegation made by HT in June 2015 that M had made statements to her a few weeks after moving to London indicating that she had been sexually abused by her father. Mr O’Brien draws attention to the fact that HT did not tell any professional about this for 18 months after the allegation was allegedly made, that she never mentioned it to the police, and that the allegation has not been pursued in these proceedings.

The submission made on her behalf is that this confusion was “as a result of the pressure she believed she was under while giving evidence”. Like AB, HT gave evidence through an interpreter. In the initial stages of her oral evidence, it was difficult for her counsel to establish exactly what documents had been translated for her. Miss Bretherton further conceded that her client speaks in what Miss Bretherton described as “sweeping terms”, by which, as I understand it, she meant that her client tended to exaggerate and make statements that are not literally correct. Miss Bretherton submitted that, although this may undermine the reliability of her evidence to some extent, it should not be interpreted as indicative of dishonesty. She also conceded that her client held a sincere belief that M never wish to be married to MS and that it would be open to the court to take the view that HT’s recollection of events has been coloured by her firm beliefs in support of what she believed to be a just cause.

I hasten to reassure Mr Simblet that the court has experience of many such cases in the family jurisdiction. Indeed, it is a submission which is made in nearly every substantial child abuse case.

This issue took up a considerable amount of time during the preparation for the hearing but ultimately is not a matter which has any bearing on my decisions in this case. No party now seeks to rely on the statement concerned and the account given by a senior social worker as to the circumstances in which the statement came to be made (as summarised in a witness statement from the local authority solicitor) has been accepted by the other parties. On behalf of MS, Mr Simblet made some criticism about the way in which the statement had been prepared by the local authority, asserting that it had pitched the evidence provided by the witness in much higher terms than she would herself have chosen to do. As a result, he submits that the court should be somewhat sceptical of the local authority’s approach, founded as it has been on unreliable evidence from HT and from Dr O’Halloran and in a context where other evidence adverse to its case has been, in Mr Simblet’s phrase, “gingered up”. Looking at the local authority’s evidence as a whole, however, I do not see any grounds for believing there has been a systemic failure to present the case fairly.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The local authority asserts that AB has appropriated money belonging to M, and acted in flagrant breach of his obligations as her property and affairs deputy. The evidence upon which the local authority relies can be summarised as follows. At 15 November 2013, M’s Santander account, comprising her benefits, had a credit balance of £5469.21. Two further credits, comprising further benefit payments, were made to the account of the sum of £636.30. By 21 October 2014, all the funds in the account had been withdrawn. In the period between those two dates, there were twenty-eight cash withdrawals in various locations in Sweden and Switzerland, made, it is asserted, by AB. It is the local authority’s case that none of this money was spent on M who was at all material times during this period living in London with HT. In addition, at 27 October 2013, M’s HSBC account, comprising her CICB compensation following her criminal assault, had a credit balance of £6071.33. By 27 June 2015, the balance had been reduced to £18.69. In the intervening period, there had been a large number of cash withdrawals made by AB at various locations. Again, it is the local authority’s case that none of this money was spent on M in London with HT. The local authority further asserts that, at earlier stages, from 2011 onwards, AB drew on the money in M’s accounts to pay for his own expenses, including travelling expenses to and from Switzerland, which did not benefit M at all. A sum of £2000 was withdrawn from the Santander account in September 2013. It is the local authority’s case that no satisfactory expression for this withdrawal has been given at all.</p>

First, the local authority accepts that it is unlikely that AB would be able to repay the money and therefore such an order would have no benefit for M. Secondly, the local authority recognises that it will need to work with AB in future and does not believe it would be in M’s interests for a financial order to be made which might set him against his daughter.</p>

He asserted that M would have supported the use of her money to fund his flights to Sweden to see his mother on the grounds that she had a close bond with her grandmother. He further asserted that the travel was in a number of respects necessary because of medical emergencies involving his wife and mother. He has also stated that he has always intended to repay the money, although to date he has not done so. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">AB also asserted that he was justified in spending M’s money in this way because he had previously supported M entirely from his own resources at an earlier stage before she was in receipt of any benefits. In his oral evidence, he stated that, when M first came to the UK, she did not have any money and he was responsible for her needs. She had not received a penny for two years and thereafter there were difficulties when she started receiving benefits. For a period of several years, therefore, he was taking care of her and was financially supporting her while trying to appeal against the decisions about her benefits. His oral evidence was that subsequently, the government paid backdated benefits which he left in the account to use in the event that anything happened to his daughter or himself. Asked about his assurance that he would repay the money he had taken, he said that he would pay it back when the local authority paid him back for the money he had spent on M in the past. He said that M was aware that, if anyone needed help in the family, the money could be used for that purpose. When Mr Bhose suggested to him in cross-examination that he had taken the money dishonestly, AB responded that he was not a dishonest person but a father who has cared for his daughter since birth. If the local authority was accusing him of dishonesty, he wanted them to give back the money they owed him. He asserted that the local authority should give him the same treatment as they had given to HT. They had paid money to her and should therefore pay money back to him.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On AB’s behalf, Mr O’Brien submits in his closing presentation that the court should consider the use of M’s money by AB within the cultural and religious context of this family.  AB had provided for his daughter for many years, at a time when she was not receiving benefits and he was exclusively responsible for her care.  He further invites the court to accept AB’s contention that, if M had had capacity, she would have approved of his use of the money to support other members of the family. Mr O’Brien submits that, in taking the decision to use M’s money to support other family members, AB was acting consistently with s.4(6)(b) of the MCA 2005 which provides that a person making a best interests decision for an incapacitated adult must “consider, so far as reasonably ascertainable …. the beliefs and values that would be likely to influence his decision if he had capacity.”<span style="font-style:italic">  </span>The strong cultural value would be that M should assist her father to provide for his mother and wife, reinforced by the care and assistance that he had provided for his daughter.  For these reasons, Mr O’Brien submits that AB did not act dishonestly in using M’s money in this way and that his credibility and his honesty should not be diminished by the appropriation of the money.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Bhose’s response is that none of the various explanations provided by AB is in the slightest degree credible. In respect of the assertion that M would have supported the expenditure, given her close bond with her grandmother, he points out that in fact AB was only in Sweden (where the grandmother lives) for four months from February 2014. Furthermore, the amount he spent there amounted to under £4000 – less than one third of the total sum taken from M’s accounts during this period. In respect of the assertion that AB believed that taking the money was justified because the situation amounted to an emergency, Mr Bhose points out that the period in question spanned almost a year and covered three countries. He submits that the circumstances manifestly could not be characterised as an emergency. AB’s suggestion that he only resorted to using M’s funds when those in his own account were exhausted, saying that he only acted in this way “as a matter of last resort”, is contradicted by the evidence of his bank statements which demonstrate an ongoing balance of several hundred pounds between October 2013 and June 2014. Mr Bhose further suggests that AB’s promise to repay the money is hollow, bearing in mind his failure to date to pay back a penny of it. The fact that he has not seen M for three years is no reason for his failure to repay the money. Mr Bhose submits that there is no merit in AB’s excuse that he was, in effect, setting off the money he was taking against the expenditure he had himself incurred some seven years previously when M first came to live with him. He was M’s property and affairs deputy and in that office he was not permitted to use her money in that way.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The history of MS’s immigration applications can be summarised as follows. He first entered this country in 2010 under a visa endorsed as “Tier 4 (General) Student” having been offered a place at Northampton University. The visa permitted him to work for a maximum of twenty hours per week during term time. The documents eventually produced by MS, after a series of court orders, included the visa which was described as starting on 13 September 2010 and ending on 27 May 2012. On the day after the visa expired, 28 May 2012, MS applied for further leave to remain in this country in order to complete his studies. In the application, he stated that he was working and that his net income was £552.50. In a covering letter, he told the UK Border Agency that the university had terminated studies, but subsequently agreed that he could restart the course on payment of an additional fee. He further complained that the university had failed to provide him with a Confirmation of Acceptance of Studies letter to verify his status as a student. He asserted that the university had victimised him and that its action amounted to discrimination. On 18 July 2013, his application for further leave to remain was refused. The letter of refusal informed him that the Secretary of State had decided that he should be removed from the country and that the deadline for an appeal was 5 August 2013. It was, of course, in July/August 2013 that the possibility of a marriage between MS and M was first raised. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">MS’s letter appealing against the refusal of his application for further leave to remain was received by the First Tier Tribunal on 8 August 2013, although the letter was dated 5 August. On 29 November 2013, his appeal was rejected on the grounds that it was out of time. It seems that no immediate steps were taken to deport MS. He made no further application for a period of some eighteen months. On 1 July 2015, he applied for a residence card as “the extended family member of a European Economic Area (EEA) or Swiss national”. The application names both M and AB as sponsors. In answer to questions about M, he stated that he had first met her in June 2013 at “Eid festival at racecourse Northampton” and that the relationship had begun on 15 August 2013 when “we religiously got married”. He ticked the box indicating (wrongly) that he and his sponsor had children together. On 21 December 2015, his application for a residence card was refused on the grounds that the UK authorities do not recognise Islamic marriage ceremonies and that, as a result, the Home Office was unable to accept his relationship with M, or with AB as his “father-in-law”. On 29 December 2015, MS appealed against the refusal of the residence card. In his notice of appeal, he asserted that the decision was “contrary to law, and against the evidence and human rights of the appellant”. He further stated that “the Court of Protection has acknowledged Islamic marriage of the appellant and the matter has been referred to the High Court for the observation”. In the event, MS withdrew the appeal on 19 September 2016, but then made a fresh application for a residence card seven days later, naming AB as his father-in-law and sponsor. That application was again refused and MS has appealed that decision.</p>

On behalf of HT, Miss Bretherton submits that it is manifestly clear that MS has repeatedly used his Islamic marriage to M to support his immigration application. It is therefore submitted that MS’s wish to secure a right of residence in this country was the motivation for his marriage to M in August 2013. After the expiry of his visa in May 2012, and the refusal of his application for further leave to remain as a student on 18 July 2013, his only chance of remaining in this country was to find an EEA national to marry. Four weeks later, he married M in the religious marriage at the Northampton Mosque. A few days later, he went to the registration office to give notice of the marriage, although the marriage was, of course, not recognisable as a matter of English law.</p>

He denies having used his marriage to M to remain in this country. On his behalf, Mr Simblet submits that, whatever might be thought to have been the potential motivation, or part of the actual motivation, the indisputable facts are that MS wanted to be involved in M’s life and family in a positive way and showed that he was. Mr Simblet contends that, even if his primary motivation for going through the religious ceremony of marriage with M was a mistaken belief that this would improve his immigration status, that is not the point because his deeds have shown that he wishes to care for M and support her. If the immigration uncertainties account for the marriage being arranged at short notice, then so what? In any event, Mr Simblet submits that there is no conclusive evidence that MS does indeed have any immigration difficulties, save that his application has been refused by the Home Office.</p>

Unsurprisingly, other parties objected to this unconventional step, and it would in my judgment have been wrong to admit them at such a late stage, but in any event, the documents did not seem to me to be of any relevance to the issues I have to determine.</p>

AB’s evidence, however, was that there was no discussion with MS about his immigration status prior to the ceremony. On his behalf, Mr O’Brien submits that there is no credible or cogent evidence that AB’s agenda for marriage was guided or influenced by MS’s immigration application. Mr O’Brien points out that the religious marriage, by itself, could not have assisted in easing MS’s immigration problems.  He submits that the fact that, after the religious marriage, AB supported MS’s immigration application does not support the allegation that the marriage was a sham designed to improve the prospects of MS’s immigration application.</p>

A further witness, Abdul Nakeeb, who was apparently one of the organisers of the Eid celebrations, described in his statement that “this was not a hidden marriage, it was a well talked marriage weeks before the ceremony itself.” In oral evidence, he described how he had known for weeks before the wedding that it was going to take place because both MS and AB told him so on a number of occasions during Ramadan. A third witness, Muhammed Miah, who provided a statement in which he provided a very positive assessment of MS’s qualities, described a telephone call he received from MS informing him “the joyous news of his marriage being confirmed”.

He submits, however, this cannot be true if it is correct that the formal introduction took place at the Eid celebration because, in 2013, Eid occurred on 8 August. Mr Bhose submits that AB and MS, when preparing their statements, overlooked the fact that Eid occurred on that date in that year, and draws attention to the fact that, in his application for a residence card, MS had stated that the Eid celebrations took place in June 2013. Mr Bhose submits that, whilst a relatively short period of time between formal introduction and marriage is unexceptional within the Muslim community, the period of seven days in this case, which is said to encompass the introduction, three further meetings and the wedding, is exceptional, particularly given M’s disabilities. He therefore submits that the reason why AB and MS have been at pains to suggest a longer time between the first meeting and the wedding is to give the impression, which the local authority says is false, that M had a proper opportunity to get to know MS and gave her agreement to the marriage. It is submitted on behalf of the local authority and HT that, as a result of the discovery that Eid took place on 8 August in 2013, both men then changed their story in the witness box in an effort to reinforce their case that M had a proper opportunity to get to know her future husband.</p>

Mr Miah’s account of receiving a telephone call from MS on 8 August informing him of the pending marriage is inconsistent with the assertion in the written statements of both AB and MS that no decision to marry was taken until after three further meetings following the introduction at the Eid celebrations on that date.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ultimately, the local authority’s case is that the decision that M would marry MS was taken at some point before Eid 2013 by AB and MS alone without reference to M. MS’s motive was, as stated above, to buttress his immigration status. So far as AB was concerned, he considered that it was both his duty and his right to marry M to MS, and the fact of the marriage would enable him to spend more time abroad with his wife. Little, if any, consideration was given to M’s wishes and feelings. It is the local authority’s case that the meeting of M and MS at the Eid festival – if it took place at all – was of no relevance to the decision-making process.</p>

Her wishes as to the choice of a marital partner did not feature prominently in his thinking. M herself was not in any position to make much of an informed choice because she was only introduced to MS a few days before the wedding. Although AB may have been satisfied that MS was an appropriate husband for his daughter in terms of culture and religion, Mr Bagchi submits that he gave little thought as to how his vulnerable daughter would be supported by her new husband.</p>

How MS’s evidence is evaluated is a matter for the court, but Mr O’Brien submits that his evidence that he had not mentioned to AB his immigration problems prior to the marriage is clearly consistent with the majority of witnesses who attend the Northampton Mosque, who confirmed that they were not aware before the marriage that MS had been refused leave to remain.  </p>

A number of potential steps that could have been taken to regard are particularised in the schedule. It is pointed out that AB must have realised that there was reason to doubt M’s capacity to marry because he was himself her property and affairs deputy, appointed because she lacked capacity to manage her financial affairs. There is ample evidence that AB was aware that his daughter was vulnerable and in need of assistance. It is submitted that these omissions are relevant, first because they demonstrate that AB and MS cannot be trusted to recognise whether a capacity assessment is required were M to reside with either of them in future, or in the event that they were to be involved in decisions about her welfare and care, and, secondly, because they are consistent with the principal case advanced by the local authority and HT that M was coerced into the marriage.</p>

In his statement, he said that, to the best of his knowledge, the marriage was performed in accordance with all requirements of Islamic law. He said that he made sure to the best of his ability that there was no coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation or mistake. It is his practice personally to approach the bride along with witnesses and take her free consent for solemnising the marriage. In oral evidence, the Imam stated that he officiates at about 7 to 10 weddings every year and recalled this wedding clearly because it was one of the first weddings that had taken place at the mosque. He recalled asking M if she gave her consent and that she replied yes. It was put to him, as alleged by HT, that, when he asked the question, M had replied “it’s my father’s wish”. The Imam could not recall this being said and said that, if she had said it, he would have been concerned. He added that he had known for roughly a week that the wedding was going to take place.</p>

In the event, there is little challenge to his expert opinion as to the law, and, whilst I note the comments about community reaction in his report, I do not think that those comments are ultimately of great relevance to the issues I have to decide.</p>

It was held openly, in the mosque in Northampton, with both invited family guests (including HT) and members of the community in attendance. The Imam considers that to be a genuine <span style="font-style:italic">nikkah</span> and none of the witnesses had any concerns. Relatively short notice was given of the ceremony, which is not unusual in this community. MS showed an interest and concern in M prior to the ceremony – for example, travelling with her and her father to medical appointments in Oxford. After the ceremony, he remained living with her at her father’s home, and still lives there to this day. Mr Simblet suggest that this conduct is inconsistent with the marriage having been merely, to use his words, an immigration scam. There are, he submits, many different reasons for getting married, both within the Muslim community, in other religions or in secular society. It would be wrong to judge MS’s motivation as being improper merely because certain consequences might result from the <span style="font-style:italic">nikkah</span>. It is his case that he loves M and wants to help look after her, which, Mr Simblet submits, is the essence of any marriage.</p>

Even if it is correct, as HT maintains, that she told AB that M did not want to get married and that he replied “I’ll make her”, there is no evidence that he forced her to go through with the marriage. There is no evidence of threats of force having been used against M to ensure that, when asked whether she wished to marry MS, she replied yes. Mr Simblet submits that, even if it is correct that M said “it is my father’s wish”, that would not be suggestive of pressure in a culture with the tradition of arranged marriages. All the subsequent statements allegedly made by M relied on as evidence of coercion were made many months after she was removed from AB’s home and have been living with HT.</p>

M said that, since her father had left, she had only been outside with her husband shopping on a few occasions. The only food she was eating was fish fingers and roast potatoes. HT described M as having put on a lot of weight, and that her self-care was very poor and she was wearing old clothes. She had been locked in the house from 9 am to 9 pm while her husband was working. When they ate a meal, M choked on her food and vomited. She had a bad cough and would bring up a lot of sputum. HT was very concerned about her general overall health as well as the squalid state of the house. For that reason, she decided to stay for a few days to tidy and clean the house. When MS arrived home in the evening, he was surprised to see her and did not welcome her at all.

He further submits that the additional explanation given by MS in his oral evidence - that AB told him at various points that M was about to return from London – is implausible and uncorroborated by any other evidence, including anything said by AB. Mr Bhose submits that the reality is that MS kept his head down, for immigration reasons. He also submits that the fact that MS has failed to take any active steps to restore relations with his wife is an indication that the marriage of 15 August 2013 was not genuine.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The financial motive features prominently in the allegations against HT. In her statement, HT described how in January 2014 she was appointed as M’s appointee. Until that point, M’s money had been going into her bank account to which only AB had access. Thereafter, M’s benefits, amounting to about £950 per month, were paid into HT’s Barclays Bank account. HT said in a further statement that she had been told by the Department for Work and Pensions that it was not possible to pay M’s benefits directly into an account in her name. At a later date, a separate account was opened for M at Barclays Bank, and thereafter the benefits were paid into HT’s account and immediately transferred over to M’s account. She added, however, that is, since she had been managing M’s benefits, she had transferred approximately £300 per month back from M’s account into HT’s account as her contribution towards the household expenditure, shopping and utility bills. The amount varied from month to month but averaged out at £300 per month. It is HT’s evidence that she has ensured that M had £100 per week from her money so that she could buy things for herself. HT added that she had also used M’s funds to pay for certain one-off items for her use. Over time, M accumulated savings amounting to over £2400 which HT subsequently placed in a new separate Barclays account in M’s name.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">HT asserts that she has managed the money at all times in accordance with M’s best interests. She says that she has never spent M’s money on anything from which M did not benefit. She denied ever misusing M’s money. She rejected the allegation that she had encouraged M to move to London so she could take advantage of her welfare benefits. It is HT’s case that, if M had not moved to London to live with her, HT would have returned to her studies to complete her nursing diploma.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">HT was closely questioned about her management of M’s money by Mr Simblet in cross-examination. In closing submissions, Mr Simblet contended that, on any view, HT had been quite quick off the mark in getting control of M’s money after she moved to London, being made her appointee in early January 2014. Thereafter, M’s income went directly to HT, with no efforts at that stage to separate the bank account or provide proper documentary evidence of how the money was being spent. It was only after social workers raised concerns that a separate bank account was set up, but even then difficulties continue to arise. Mr Simblet points to a number of disparities and inconsistencies in the accounts and submits that it is exceedingly rare to see any objective records of expenditure. He submits that it is significant that the account is being heavily used with cash withdrawals which are difficult to track. He notes that HT continues to take £300 a month from M’s money in respect of living expenses, even though M is in hospital. He submits that this goes beyond merely failing to keep M’s money separate. Rather, she has used much of it for own purposes so that it is no longer available to M.</p>

Mr Simblet comments that the fact that the local authority has allowed this to continue does not reflect very well on it. In response, it was submitted on behalf of HT that the local authority had carried out a review of M’s financial position in August 2016 and concluded that, in fact, HT had been owed money for payments she had made for M herself.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in"> On behalf of HT, Miss Bretherton submits that there is no evidence that HT’s conduct has been based on anything other than her dedication to her niece. She accepts that difficulties have arisen over some aspects of M’s finances. HT’s mathematical skills are limited. But the local authority has fully investigated the matter and concluded that all of HT’s expenditure was reasonable. In addition, Miss Bretherton relies on the fact that HT voluntary gave up control of M’s finances, accepting that her record-keeping was inadequate, and suggesting that the money is paid direct to M in hospital. She submits that this is inconsistent with the characterisation of HT put forward on behalf of AB and MS of a woman who is keen to retain control. Miss Bretherton contrasts HT’s attitude with that of AB who still maintains that he should continue as M’s deputy. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The local authority through Mr Bhose supports HT in defending the allegations of a financial motive. In closing submissions, he argued that the suggestion that HT went to Northampton in November 2013 with the plan of bringing M back to London to get her hands on M’s benefits is unsustainable, in the light of the fact that AB was the court-appointed deputy with access to all of M’s money and it was uncertain at that date how long he would be away. The local authority invites the court to look at HT’s dedication and caring conduct towards her niece, both before she was admitted to hospital and subsequently, when she has continued to visit her most days.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The other principal allegation levelled at HT is that she has been motivated by hostility towards AB and MS and has alienated M from them. It is also said that she has fabricated allegations, including an allegation (not subsequently pursued) that M had been sexually abused while living at AB’s home. In oral evidence, HT strongly denied behaving in the way alleged. It was her evidence that M’s strongly-expressed aversion to seeing AB and MS arose from her own wishes and feelings. She accepted, however, that it was right that she had said that she did not think it was a good idea for M to see them again. She explained that the reason for this was that, whenever their names were mentioned, M would become frightened. In closing submissions, Miss Bretherton invites the court to dismiss the allegation that HT has fabricated allegations of abusive conduct on the part of AB and MS. She points out that M lived with HT for a sufficiently long time that it would have been very easy for a whole raft of false allegations to be made, but this has not happened.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In his closing submissions, Mr Bagchi included a schedule of evidence relating to M’s statements about her wishes and feelings following her move to London. He identified nineteen occasions when M has told professionals words to indicate that she does not want to be married to MS; that she does not want to have contact with AB or MS, and that she is happy living with HT. Mr Bagchi submits that there is scant evidence of brainwashing or coaching by HT. He accepts that it is undoubtedly the case that HT holds very strong views about AB and MS but contends that there is simply no evidential basis beyond suspicion that, when M has made comments about her experiences with AB and MS, she is not relating own feelings rather than those instilled in her by her aunt.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On the other hand, it is undoubtedly the case that HT harbours strong feelings about the conduct of both AB and MS, and is a strong character who is not slow to express her views and feelings. It is to my mind significant that all save one of the nineteen occasions identified in Mr Bagchi’s schedule occurred at least a year after M moved to live with HT, and in the majority of cases over two years later.</p>

In his response to the allegations set out in the schedule, he accepted that he had acted in this way and expressed regret for his actions, explaining how he had used the money as a last resort, and for purposes which M would have supported had she been consulted and able to express a view – for example, to support his mother, her grandmother. AB relies also on the fact that, at an earlier stage, he supported M out of his own resources. In the circumstances, he denies that he acted dishonestly.</p>

I find that AB acted dishonestly and in breach of his obligations as her property and affairs deputy. I therefore make the findings sought by the local authority in the supplementary schedule concerning financial allegations (numbers 10 to 17).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have already indicated that I accept Mr Bagchi’s characterisation of MS’s evidence as extraordinarily one-eyed. MS has a high opinion of himself and is focused almost exclusively on his own rights and the injustices which he considers have been perpetrated upon him. To my mind, the coincidence of the refusal of his immigration appeal in July 2013 and the very hurried arrangement of the marriage ceremony is glaring. I conclude that MS’s primary motive for marrying M was to improve his prospects of being allowed to remain in this country. I do not consider that this was his only motive. It is notable that, after the wedding, he moved into AB’s house. It seems likely that the plan agreed between the two men was that MS would look after M at AB’s house while AB travelled abroad visiting his wife. I do not accept, however, that there is much reliable evidence that MS harboured warm feelings of affection for M. Had he done so, he would surely have made at least some effort to try to secure her return to Northampton after she left in November 2013. In fact, I find that it suited him far more to live alone in AB’s house without the responsibility of looking after her.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">My conclusion, therefore, is that MS’s primary motive for marrying M was to achieve an improved immigration status. I further find that AB knew that this was his primary motive. AB’s own motives are more difficult to discern, but overall I conclude that he acted partly to assist MS in his immigration application but also because he thought it would be right for M, and the family as a whole, for her to be married. In closing submissions, Mr Bagchi submitted that M’s welfare in the widest sense was not at the centre of the thinking of either man. I agree with his submission and also with his conclusion that this is relevant to the consequential issues of residence, contact and the role that each may play in M’s life in future, whenever those considerations might arise.</p>

But in the light of their respective characters, and HT’s undoubted influence over M, it is in my judgment overwhelmingly likely that HT’s views have affected and influenced M’s various statements about the marriage.</p>

In the light of the evidence of Prof Rehman, I do not consider it necessary, appropriate or proportionate for this court to analyse further the lengthy allegations made on HT’s behalf concerning AB’s failure to address this issue or seek the advice of any professional about it. It is undoubtedly correct that AB did not tell the Imam about M’s mental health difficulties, or consult anyone about whether M had the capacity to enter an Islamic marriage. In view of the evidence of Prof Rehman, it seems that this matter simply did not arise as a matter of Islamic social practice. It is inappropriate for this court to pass judgment on this practice unless necessary for the purposes of making decisions about M’s best interests. In my judgment, that necessity does not arise, at least at this stage.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I turn next to findings about the events from November 2013 onwards. On these matters, I prefer the evidence of HT to that given by MS. I accept HT’s allegations that, when she visited AB’s house at the beginning of November 2013, she found M in a distressed state and in a poor physical condition, and the property also dirty and in a poor condition. I also accept that M asked HT to take her back to London, although, given my overall findings concerning M’s vulnerability and impressionable nature, I am cautious about drawing any conclusions as to her true wishes and feelings. Mr Simblet described HT’s account of the circumstances in which M was removed to London as making no sense and a “cock and bull story”. I disagree. I find her account detailed and plausible. Mr Simblet submits that it is significant that she took no photographs, or contacted anyone about the condition of the property. The fact that she failed to take those steps does not seem to me to undermine the credibility of her account. Mr Simblet further submits that, if M had really been living in conditions as described by HT, it is very surprising that HT was planning to go back to London alone until M begged her to take her with her. To my mind, however, the fact that HT did not decide to take M with her until she begged to do so is unsurprising, given that M was married to MS and living in AB’s house. It is true, as Mr Simblet submits, that there is no other evidence – for example, from anyone who saw M after she arrived in London – to corroborate HT’s allegation about M’s condition. I have thought carefully about the absence of corroboration but, having done so, I have reached the conclusion that this does not undermine the credibility of HT’s allegations about the events of November 2013. In considering this important aspect of the case, I have thought carefully about my concerns about HT’s reliability as a witness as particularised above. Having done so, however, I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that her account of the events of November 2013 is true.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is to my mind very significant that neither MS nor AB took any or any material action in response to HT’s removal of M to London. Their explanations for failing to take any such steps are in my judgment revealing. MS’s explanation that he left the matter to AB who said he would handle it, and his failure to take any steps himself when it became clear that AB was in fact doing nothing about it, are a clear indication in my judgment that he did not see the need to take any steps to secure the return of his wife. Mr Simblet submitted in closing there is no evidence that MS does not genuinely care about M and that his conduct towards her has been entirely consistent with a genuine relationship. I disagree. If MS genuinely cared about M, he would surely have taken active steps to secure her return to the family home. In my judgment, MS’s conduct after November 2013 reinforces the view that his principal motive in marrying M was to achieve an improved immigration status. In closing submissions, Mr Bhose for the local authority submitted that the marriage of convenience MS had entered into had ended up being extremely inconvenient and had not brought in the resolution of his immigration problems. I agree with Mr Bhose’s analysis. </p>

It invited the court make a declaration of non-marriage in relation to the Islamic marriage of 15 August 2013 and to consider whether it is necessary to make a Forced Marriage Protection Order. The local authority also seeks the discharge AB’s property and affairs deputyship. The local authority further invites declarations and orders that it would not be in M’s best interests to live with either AB or MS, and further that the local authority should be under no obligation to consult them about future best interests decisions. As to future contact, the local authority seeks findings that it is in M’s best interests (1) for contact with HT to continue in accordance with M’s wishes and feelings; (2) if M expresses a clear wish to see AB, such contact should be arranged in line with her wishes and feelings, unless to do so would put her health and safety at risk; (3) there should be no contact between M and MS unless M expresses a clear wish for such contact. Finally, the local authority urges the court to bring the proceedings to an end by making final declarations as to capacity. It is the local authority’s case that, with clear findings, it will be possible for the local authority to manage M’s affairs and personal welfare without the necessity of ongoing proceedings.</p>

Where there has been a failure to comply with the legal formalities of the Marriage Acts, the court has the power under the inherent jurisdiction to make a declaration that the ceremony did not create the status of marriage under English law. In contrast, this court has no power to affect the religious status of the marriage. Mr Bagchi confirms that it is no part of the Official Solicitor’s case that there should be any declaration in respect of the Islamic marriage. The declaration proposed as to the status of the marriage as a matter of English law does not affect the religious status of the marriage and as a result does not violate the parties’ human rights under article 9. Just as the legal status of the marriage was irrelevant to the religious significance at the date of the marriage, the mere formal indication of its legal status now should be of no material effect to how it is perceived in religious terms. He submits that the declaration sought should follow on as a matter of course, given the failure to comply with the essential legal formalities. Not to make a declaration runs the risk that the court is seen to sanction a wholly defective process and risks undermining the integrity of the statutory requirements of England and Wales.</p>

Before the ceremony, social workers had attempted to undertake a capacity assessment but the woman, SY, had refused to cooperate.

He submits that there is no point in keeping these proceedings alive in circumstances where the evidence indicates that M will not recover capacity in the short or medium term. When the time arises to consider M’s future placement and the arrangements for her care, the local authority and health authority should be left to undertake a best interests analysis informed by the findings of this court. It is only if a further dispute arises at that stage that a further application to the Court of Protection should be made. Although the issues listed for determination at this hearing did not include final orders, there are in fact no welfare issues which call for a decision at this stage. With an eye to the overriding objective of the Court of Protection Rules, Mr Bagchi makes the forceful submission that these proceedings have spanned over 2 ½ years and have cost a very considerable amount of public money over a number of hearings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Official Solicitor’s argument is supported by the local authority and HT. The local authority seeks final orders at this stage that it would not be in M’s best interests to live with or be cared for by AB or MS, and further that it is not appropriate for the local authority either to consult with MS, or take into account his views, about future best interests decision in relation to M. The local authority also invites the court to consider making a forced marriage protection order and also to discharge AB as M’s property and affairs deputy.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The making of final orders and the determination of these proceedings is strongly opposed by those representing AB and MS. Mr Simblet on behalf of MS submits that such a course would be inappropriate in circumstances where it may well be that M regains capacity in the near future at which point she will be better able to express her true wishes and feelings. For that reason, it was inappropriate for indefinite best interests decisions to be made at this stage. The case was listed only for a fact-finding hearing and it would be wrong for final orders to be made as proposed by the local authority. Mr O’Brien on behalf of AB adopts a similar position. He states that he had understood from the advocates’ meeting that this hearing was essentially to determine issues of past and current capacity and disputes of fact, and that it had therefore come as a surprise to him that the court was being invited to make a final order and declarations as to best interests. Instead, AB invited the court make only interim best interests orders at this stage. In particular, it was submitted on behalf of AB that it was not appropriate to leave the issue of contact to be determined solely by professionals, in circumstances where there had been no critical analysis of the extent of HT’s influence on M. In response, Mr Bagchi pointed out that the original order identifying the issues to be determined at this hearing included “any future directions in respect of M’s best interests in terms of residence, should there be a dispute”. He submitted that there can be no dispute about M’s residence at this stage or in the foreseeable future.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have considered carefully whether to bring proceedings to an end at this stage. I acknowledge the arguments advanced cogently by Mr Bagchi, in particular his concerns about the proportionality of these proceedings. Ultimately, however, I have concluded that it would not be right to end the proceedings at this point, for the following reasons.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First, although Dr Andrews was pessimistic overall about M’s long-term prognosis, it was clear from his evidence, and endorsed by Dr Grace, that it would be appropriate to undertake a further assessment of M’s capacity when the effects of the clozapine treatment have been established. It is unclear how long it will be before it is known whether the treatment has led to an improvement in her psychotic condition so that a further capacity assessment can be undertaken, but it is at least possible in my judgment, having regard to all the evidence, that the picture may be clearer by the middle of 2018.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, the issues concerning M’s long-term placement and contact with members of her family are not straightforward. I recognise, of course, that the Court of Protection should only be used as a last resort to make best interests decisions, but given the history of this case and the complexities of the issues, I think it almost inevitable that the court will be required to determine such issues, possibly in the second half of this year.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, there is the question of the involvement of AB and MS in the decision-making process. The local authority asked the court to make an order excluding MS from the process altogether. I do not agree that such an order would be appropriate, at least at this stage. S.4(7) requires any person or body making decisions as to the best interests of an incapacitated adult to take into account, if it is practicable and appropriate to consult them, the views of anyone interested in her welfare. Both AB and MS state they are interested in M’s welfare. Despite the criticism of their conduct, and the findings I have made, I do not think it can be said that they are not interested in her welfare. They are not, in my judgment, interested in her welfare to the extent they now profess, but they are undoubtedly interested to some extent. As her father, and the man to whom she is married under Islamic law, they have an interest in her welfare. The question therefore is whether it is appropriate to consult them. On that issue, the local authority, supported as I understand it by HT, contends that it is, or may be, appropriate to consult AB but not MS. On behalf of the Official Solicitor, Mr Bagchi submits that AB’s evidence that, on discharge from hospital, M could simply return to live with him and MS, or even perhaps return to live with MS in India, demonstrates a total lack of insight into M’s needs. Similarly, it is submitted on behalf the Official Solicitor that MS’s focus on his “rights” in relation to M bears no relation to reality and that he would manifestly not be motivated to work with professionals constructively when planning for M’s future.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It seems to me, however, that this engages difficult and sensitive issues. MS is not married to M as a matter of English law but is married to her according to Islamic law. It would normally be appropriate to consult the spouse or partner of the adult concerned, although not necessarily where the spouse or partner is estranged or has been abusive towards adult. In my judgment, the question whether to seek the views of MS when making future best interests decisions concerning M and, if he is consulted, the weight to be attached to his (and AB’s) views are sensitive and difficult issues and, furthermore are issues about which the parties will almost inevitably disagree, leading to further proceedings before this court.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For those reasons, and notwithstanding the very considerable length and expense of these proceedings to date, I conclude that it would be premature to bring them to an end at this stage. I propose, therefore, to direct the local authority to file a further report from Dr Andrews in July 2018 and give the parties liberty to apply upon receipt of that report. It may be that, at that stage, final orders may be appropriate, depending on the evidence as to M’s condition.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Bagchi submits that M’s wishes and feelings about contact with her father and MS have been fairly consistent over a long period of time. She has expressed antipathy towards MS and appears to want nothing to do with him, although, for reasons set out above, it is not possible for this court to make findings about her true wishes and feelings in this regard. Indeed, there is some evidence that she does not now recall who he is. She is equally clear in saying that she does not want to live with or see AB but is content to continue to receive written material from him, although she no longer wishes to receive any video messages. It is the Official Solicitor’s position that, unless and until M expresses a clear wish to have any form of contact with MS, the court should order that there should be no such contact in her best interests. As for contact with her father, the Official Solicitor submits that, if M expresses a desire to see him, such contact should be arranged in line with her wishes and feelings, unless to do so would put her health and safety at risk. Unless and until she expresses such a wish, no direct contact should be arranged. Indirect contact should continue in the form of cards or letters with the assistance of hospital staff and the social worker, provided M expresses no distress on receiving such communications.</p>

He submits that hitherto the approach of the professional parties to M’s contact with her father has been coloured partly by the belief that M had been coerced into the marriage at a time when she could not consent to sexual relations and partly by the strong views held by HT. Mr O’Brien points out that the relationship between M and her father was close for many years and relies on an observation made by the social worker that such contact may have a positive impact on M in view of her limited contact with other family members apart from HT and her cousins. </p>

Dr Andrews added, however, that M became significantly distressed, thought-disordered and preoccupied when invited to consider whether she might wish to respond to the letters that she had received from her father. In oral evidence, Dr Andrews expressed the view that, were contact to be ordered now, he would be very concerned about the risk of aggravation of M’s psychosis, and also about the difficulties of keeping her engaged with the treatment programme and any future surgery. There was, he said, only so much M could cope with at this point in time.</p>

It is plainly something which she enjoys and is of benefit to her. Her limited indirect contact with her father AB in the form of cards and letters (but not videos) should continue, provided it is something that does not cause her distress. For the time being, there should be no direct contact with her father, although this is a matter which should be kept under review. There should at this stage be no contact with MS. </p>

The purpose of such an order, it is submitted, would be to guard against any risk of an attempt being made to force M to go through a civil ceremony of marriage with MS. Having regard to the declarations and orders which I have already indicated will be made at the conclusion of that hearing, however, I do not consider a forced marriage protection order to be necessary at this stage. M is at present in hospital and unlikely to be discharged for some time. She is unlikely to have any direct contact with either AB or MS for the foreseeable future. If the local authority wishes to pursue its application for a forced marriage protection order in due course, this can be considered at a further hearing.</p>
