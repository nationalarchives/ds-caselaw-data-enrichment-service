The other case relates to C, an adult who was born on 17 July 1987 and who lacks capacity. They are not related. Both suffer from Smith Magenis Syndrome. Both live in the area of the same local authority. Both live at home in the devoted and exemplary care of their parents: in A’s case in the care of her mother, B (A’s father does not have parental responsibility); in C’s case in the care of her mother, D, and her father, E.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Although the legal context differs between the two cases, reflecting the different statutory (and, more generally, the different legal) regimes which apply to children and to incapacitated adults, both cases raise essentially the same important issue: Do the circumstances of their domestic care by their families in the family home involve a deprivation of liberty engaging the protection of Article 5 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms? And what, if any, role does the local authority have in such cases?</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Before going any further there are two things I wish to emphasise. As I have said, both A and C live at home in the devoted and exemplary care of their parents. No one has suggested, or could possibly suggest, any criticism of the loving, caring and devoted care they receive at home. No one has suggested, or could possibly suggest, that their domestic regime should be significantly altered, let alone that they should be removed from home. There is, in my judgment, nothing which even begins to suggest any proper basis for compulsory intervention in the lives of these families, whether by the local authority or by the court. The fact is, as Mr Joseph O’Brien put it on behalf of B, but the same in my judgment goes for both these families, that A and C benefit from an excellent level of care from their families in circumstances where the local authority does not suggest, and cannot sensibly suggest, that it, or any other public authority, could do any better. That is the first thing, and it requires to be borne firmly in mind throughout. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The other thing is this. As will shortly become apparent, I am concerned at this stage only with the question, as I have said, of whether the circumstances of their domestic care by their families in the family home involve a deprivation of liberty engaging the protection of Article 5. I am not at this stage concerned with the question of whether, if they do, that state of affairs is justifiable in accordance with the Convention and in law. But everything I have read and heard would suggest that, realistically, there could be only one answer to that question: that this deprivation of liberty (if that is what it is – in fact, as will appear, I am quite satisfied that it is not) is quite plainly in the best interests of both A and C and justifiable in accordance with the Convention and in law.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, as I shall explain in due course, these proceedings were properly brought. But they have now achieved their purpose. And I am quite satisfied that there is no need for the court to be any further involved in any aspect of the family life of either of these two families.</p>

These can be short lived but extremely intense at the time. During such aggression, people can get seriously assaulted and objects thrown and broken.

The self injury is often a response to frustration or anger and can be extreme, possibly due to the decreased sensation in the extremities and relative insensibility to pain that is a characteristic of affected individuals. Boredom or habit may be other reasons for self- injurious behaviours. C displays self-harming behaviours in the form of nail pulling, wound picking and head-banging …</p>

The problems described include difficulties falling asleep, shortened sleep cycles, frequent and prolonged night awakenings, early morning waking, excessive daytime sleepiness and daytime napping. Evidence suggests that there is an underlying problem in the biological clock in the syndrome. C displays all the characteristic features of sleep disturbance seen in Smith Magenis Syndrome.</p>

The most distinctive features of Smith Magenis Syndrome are the behavioural problems. These include self-injurious behaviour such as hand biting, self picking or scratching, picking at sores, hitting the head or body, tearing or picking fingernails or the skin round the nails, physical and verbal aggression, frequent temper tantrums, destructive behaviour, hyperactivity, restlessness, excitability, distractibility, removal of clothes and severe sleep disturbances including difficulty falling asleep, shortened sleep cycles, frequent and prolonged night waking and early morning waking. Autistic type behaviours such as resistance to change, repetitive questioning and pre-occupation with particular topics are also common.”</p>

If the door is not locked A will frequently leave her bedroom and at these times can put herself and others at risk. During the night, A is at risk of falling down the stairs. In the past, she has gone downstairs and eaten food from the freezer. B reports that she has found A with her head in the oven and there have been times when there have been concerns that A could be at risk of starting a fire in the family home during the night. On one occasion, A placed a tub of salt in the microwave. She has also been observed lifting her baby brother out of his cot and thereby putting him at risk. B is also concerned that, should A leave her bedroom during the night, she could vacate the home and, as she has a history of approaching non-familiar adults, would be at risk.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“It is my view that having a carer in the room would not be appropriate, as it would be over-stimulating for A and would result in a deterioration in her sleep pattern. </p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">It is my view therefore that the only way of keeping A safe at night is to confine her in one space within her home. This could be done in one of two ways. Either continue with the current arrangements of locking A in her bedroom and making modifications to make the room as safe as possible. A does not resist this, she appears to enjoy being in her bedroom at night and has access to her toys and slide. The disadvantages to this option would be that, as A grows and increases in size, then opportunities to hurt herself from objects in her bedroom may increase. However, if regular assessment could be undertaken by an occupational therapist and necessary alterations undertaken, then these risks could be minimised.</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">In my view, the other alternative would be the provision of a safe space, which provides an alternative to wall padding and is best described as a ‘room within a room’. Safe spaces are made with industrial strength PVC walls, which are positioned away from the walls of a room, the PVC is pulled taut on a steel frame and flexes to absorb impact. The flexible walls and thick soft padded floor reduce the risk of the person inside being able to harm themselves on walls, floors and other hard surfaces. A safe space has the advantages of protecting A from objects in her room, but she would still need to be confined in one space.</p>

Her parents advise that should C shout for them they do go and attend to her immediately.

Due to the open plan layout of the home there are no internal doors downstairs which can be locked to prevent C accessing rooms. Once downstairs C has access to kitchen, dining room and living room. As well as the risk of harming herself she would also destroy the fixtures and fittings. There is no cure for C’s condition and therefore these behaviours will continue throughout her life. As the erratic sleep pattern is also part of her condition this will also continue. If C is not locked in her bedroom overnight then her parents would have to be up with her every time she was awake during the night in order to provide constant supervision, as in place during the day. This is not a practical solution as both parents would quickly become exhausted and E has to go out work. They would then struggle with their caring role and it would become increasingly difficult for them to continue caring for C at home. This would not be a good outcome for either them or C. The family have very strong bonds and her parents are committed to providing C with as many positive opportunities as possible.”</p>

Almost inevitable therefore C’s carer would act in a sense as a form of ‘barrier’ to C leaving her bedroom, encouraging her to return to bed.

This is particularly the case when the person being locked up is incapable of taking personal responsibility, and the person with responsibility is making the decision as to the manner of restraint. The Commission can see no justification as to why such individuals should not be considered as being at risk of being deprived of their liberty and be excluded from the safeguard procedures which apply for those being locked in rooms in accommodation elsewhere.

I stress this because it should not be assumed that the position he sets out in fact represents the position, let alone the views and assumptions, of the local authority with which I am here involved. So the criticisms of that position which I voice are not to be understood as directed in any way at the local authority in this case which, to repeat, supports both A and C in their placements, does not criticise the devoted and exemplary care they receive from their parents and, as I have already acknowledged, acted properly in bringing these proceedings. Nor, of course, is any of my criticism directed at Mr Sherman, whose submissions, though in no way reflective of the views of this local authority are, as experience unhappily indicates, a fair reflection and summary of views and attitudes shared by too many other local authorities. In articulating his submissions as devil’s advocate he has performed a most valuable service.</p>

It needs to be said in the plainest possible terms that this suggestion, however formulated – and worryingly some local authorities seem almost to assume and take it for granted – is simply wrong in law. A local authority does not exercise “control”, it lacks the legal power to exercise control, over people in the situation of A or C or their carers. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Moreover, the assertion or assumption, however formulated, betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of the relationship between a local authority and those, like A and C and their carers, who it is tasked to support – a fundamental misunderstanding of the relationship between the State and the citizen. People in the situation of A and C, together with their carers, look to the State – to a local authority – for the support, the assistance and the provision of the services to which the law, giving effect to the underlying principles of the Welfare State, entitles them. They do not seek to be “controlled” by the State or by the local authority. And it is not for the State in the guise of a local authority to seek to exercise such control. The State, the local authority, is the servant of those in need of its support and assistance, not their master. As Ms Ball put it on behalf of the Official Solicitor in relation to someone in C’s position, and in my judgment the same applies to someone like A, while the local authority performs important monitoring and safeguarding roles, its major function in relation to C and others like her is to assess needs and provide services.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This attitude is perhaps best exemplified by the proposition that “in the event that the parents were to disagree with the <span style="font-style:italic">decisions</span> of the local authority (which will always be based upon the opinion of relevant professionals) it would seek to <span style="font-style:italic">enforce its decisions </span>through appropriate proceedings if necessary” (emphasis added). This approach, which to repeat is not the approach of the local authority in this case, though reflecting what I have come across elsewhere, reflects an attitude of mind which is not merely unsound in law but hardly best calculated to encourage proper effect being given to a local authority’s procedural obligations under Article 8 of the Convention (as to which see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">Re G (Care: Challenge to Local Authority’s Decision) </span>[2003] EWHC 551 (Fam), [2003] 2 FLR 42, and <span style="font-style:italic">G v E and others </span>[2010] EWHC 621 (Fam) at para [88]). Moreover, it is likely to be nothing but counter-productive when it comes to a local authority ‘working together’, as it must, with family carers. ‘Working together’ involves something more – much more – than merely requiring carers to agree with a local authority’s ‘decision’ even if, let alone just because, it may be backed by professional opinion. As Ms Ball comments, with what might be thought studied moderation, the use of the word “enforce” may belie an overstated understanding of the degree of control which the local authority has in situations such as this. </p>

More recently one has found, too frequently for comfort, examples of the same mindset – the same erroneous beliefs by local authorities – in the context of the removal of incapacitated adults from the care of their relatives into residential accommodation, without the sanction of the court and, therefore, without any legal authority. In one such case which came to my attention not very long ago, a local authority had behaved so high-handedly that another judge of the Family Division characterised its conduct as tantamount almost to kidnapping. In another such case which came before me the local authority did not get round to issuing proceedings until more than six months after it had intervened. Most recently of all there is <span style="font-style:italic">G v E and others </span>[2010] EWHC 621 (Fam), where Baker J was extremely critical of a local authority which had removed an incapacitated adult, from a placement where he had been for many years, in circumstances breaching his rights under both Article 8 and Article 5. </p>

Section 44 enables a local authority to apply to the Family Proceedings Court in certain circumstances for an emergency protection order. Section 46 enables a constable, without judicial authority, to remove a child in certain circumstances and keep the child in police protection for no more than 72 hours.

A local authority does not have parental responsibility for a child, like A, who is merely a ‘child in need’ being provided with services and assistance in accordance with section Part III. Nor does a local authority have parental responsibility for a child who is in its voluntary care as a ‘looked after’ child under Part III – that is, a child accommodated by it in accordance with section 20. Indeed, such a child may at any time be removed from the local authority’s accommodation (see section 20(8)), and thus from the local authority’s care, by anyone with parental responsibility.</p>

So it is B, and B alone, who has (and I quote the definition of “parental responsibility” in section 3(1) of the 1989 Act) “all the rights, duties, powers, responsibilities and authority which by law a parent of a child has in relation to the child and his property.” And the local authority does not have or exercise “control” over A, let alone “complete and effective control”.</p>

According to the <span style="font-style:italic">Scoping Report </span>(para 2.1) it “remains a confusing patchwork of conflicting statutes enacted over a period of 60 years.” It is characterised by the sheer volume of legislation (Appendix A to the <span style="font-style:italic">Scoping Report </span>lists 34 statutes which deal, to varying degrees, with adult social care), with much overlap and duplication. It is noted for its “baffling” and “tortuous” complexity – requiring “a detailed knowledge of the inter-relationship between the various statutes, secondary legislation and relevant guidance” and for its perpetuation of “outdated concepts”. (I gratefully adopt these observations and much of the language from Chapter 2 of the <span style="font-style:italic">Scoping Report</span>.) The <span style="font-style:italic">Scoping Report </span>concluded (para 2.57) that “Adult social care law is in urgent need of reform” and identified (para 5.13) “the general need to establish a coherent and comprehensive legal framework.” The practitioner, whether social worker, legal professional or judge, is driven to agree.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="3">

They showed the film to Pamela several times without, as Ms Morris puts it, any consultation with those responsible for her as to the effect the film might have on her.

She submits that ‘there is a positive obligation on the court under Art 8 not to establish a precedent which allows filmmakers or other media to benefit from commencing filming children or incapable adults without notice to or consultation with those concerned with their care’.”</p>

Consequently, the Court has expressly found that Art 2, Art 3 and Art 8 of the Convention enjoin the State not only to refrain from an active infringement by its representatives of the rights in question, but also to take appropriate steps to provide protection against an interference with those rights either by state agents or private parties.  </p>

Any conclusion to the effect that this was not the case would not only be inconsistent with the Court’s case law, notably under Arts 2, 3 and 8 of the Convention. It would, moreover, leave a sizeable gap in the protection from arbitrary detention, which would be inconsistent with the importance of personal liberty in a democratic society. The State is, therefore, obliged to take measures providing effective protection of vulnerable persons, including reasonable steps to prevent a deprivation of liberty of which the authorities have or ought to have knowledge.”<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="8">

Thus, says Mr Bowen, the Commission endorses the local authority’s approach as being not only a reasonable and responsible exercise of its powers and duties but also the lawful exercise of its positive obligations under Article 5.</p>

At the end of the day, the question with which I am here concerned is whether, if there is any deprivation of liberty in these cases, that is something for which the State – the local authority – is responsible. It is in that context that, as I readily accept, I need to explore the ambit of the positive obligations attaching to local authorities by virtue of Article 5. But it is not necessary for me to embark upon any more general analysis of the possible reach of Article 5, and it is in fact undesirable that I do so. That exercise raises issues which are not before me and which are properly to be explored as and when the occasion arises. Moreover, it is not the function of judges to draft practice manuals for public authorities.

The Commission here raises an important issue, but this is not an appropriate case in which to decide it, for the point simply does not arise here, the interests of A and C being fully represented, in the one case by Cafcass Legal and in the other by the Official Solicitor.</p>

In essence, its duties are threefold: a duty in appropriate circumstances to investigate; a duty in appropriate circumstances to provide supporting services; and a duty in appropriate circumstances to refer the matter to the court. But, and this is a key message, whatever the positive obligations of a local authority under Article 5 may be, they do not clothe it with any power to regulate, control, compel, restrain, confine or coerce. A local authority which seeks to do so must either point to specific statutory authority for what it is doing – and, as I have pointed out, such statutory powers are, by and large, lacking in cases such as this – or obtain the appropriate sanction of the court. Of course if there is immediate threat to life or limb a local authority will be justified in taking protective (including compulsory) steps: <span style="font-style:italic">R (G) v Nottingham City Council </span>[2008] EWHC 152 (Admin), [2008] 1 FLR 1660, at para [21].

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Before passing from this part of the case there are two final points which I should emphasise. In the first place, it is vital that local authorities embark upon the kind of investigations that Hedley J and I have described with sensitivity and with a proper appreciation of the limited extent of their powers. Social workers need to keep their eyes open and their professional antennae alert when meeting or visiting their clients. And if there is real cause for concern they must act quickly and decisively. But they must guard against being seen as prying or snooping on the families who they are there to help and support. Nothing is more destructive of the ‘working together’ relationship which in this kind of context, as in others, is so vitally important than a perception by family carers that the local authority is being heavy-handed or worse. I repeat in this context what I have already said in paragraphs [51]-[53] above.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The other point relates to how local authority applications to the court should be made. Too often, in my experience, local authorities seeking the assistance of the court in removing an incapacitated or vulnerable adult from their home against their wishes or against the wishes of the relatives or friends caring for them, apply ex parte (without notice) and, I have to say, too often such orders have been made by the court without any prior warning to those affected and in circumstances where such seeming heavy-handedness is not easy to justify and can too often turn out to be completely counter-productive: cf <span style="font-style:italic">X Council v B (Emergency Protection Orders) </span>[2004] EWHC 2015 (Fam), [2005] 1 FLR 341, at para [93]. I agree in every respect and would wish to associate myself with what Charles J said in <span style="font-style:italic">B Borough Council v S (By the Official Solicitor) </span>[2006] EWHC 2584 (Fam), [2007] 1 FLR 1600, at paras [37]-[42]. And although I accept that the analogy is not exact, it seems to me that, generally speaking, a local authority will only be justified in seeking a without notice order for the removal of an incapacitated or vulnerable adult in the kind of circumstances which in the case of a child would justify a without notice application for an emergency protection order; as to which see <span style="font-style:italic">X Council v B (Emergency Protection Orders) </span>[2004] EWHC 2015 (Fam), [2005] 1 FLR 341, and <span style="font-style:italic">Re X (Emergency Protection Orders) </span>[2006] EWHC 510 (Fam), [2006] 2 FLR 701. That said, there will, of course, be cases in the adult jurisdiction where, just as in the corresponding children jurisdiction, a without notice application will be justified; indeed (see para [81]), <span style="font-style:italic">B Borough Council</span> was just such a case.</p>

Referring to <span style="font-style:italic">Storck v Germany</span> (2005) 43 EHRR 96 at para [89], Mr Bowen submits, and I agree, that this may happen in one of three ways:</p>

No other additional care or support is provided, apart from respite care which has recently been offered, and the local authority is not involved in the provision of any care for A during the period she is locked in her bedroom. And the decision to lock A in her bedroom was taken by B alone. Ms Ball on behalf of C says much the same. The local authority is not directly involved in the way in which C is restricted at home. The local authority may have endorsed her home arrangements but they have not caused them.

There is no deprivation of liberty if a person gives a valid consent to their confinement. But a person may give a valid consent to their confinement only if they have capacity to do so: <span style="font-style:italic">Storck v Germany </span>(2005) 43 EHRR 96 at paras [76]-[77]. Express refusal of consent by a person who has capacity will be determinative of this aspect of deprivation of liberty: <span style="font-style:italic">Storck v Germany</span> at para [77]). But the same cannot be said of a person who lacks capacity, although his objections to remaining where he is may be a factor indicative of a deprivation of liberty, as in <span style="font-style:italic">JE v DE (By his Litigation Friend the Official Solicitor), Surrey County Council and EW</span> [2006] EWHC 3459 (Fam), [2007] 2 FLR 1150, esp at paras [124]-[125]. Where a person has capacity, consent to their confinement may be inferred from the fact that the person does not object: <span style="font-style:italic">HL v United Kingdom</span> (2004) 40 EHRR 761 at para [93] and <span style="font-style:italic">Storck v Germany</span> at para [77] explaining <span style="font-style:italic">HM v Switzerland</span> (2002) 38 EHRR 314 at para [46].

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“In my judgment the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Austin</span> cannot be divorced from its context. The question of purpose or intention in <span style="font-style:italic">Austin</span> was intimately bound up in the evaluation of all the circumstances, namely that the police had a duty to maintain public order and where the interests of the public had to be considered. It was pre-eminently a “balance” case. It also seems to me that although the words “purpose” and “intention” are used synonymously in certain passages in <span style="font-style:italic">Austin</span>, the word “intention” is not used in the same sense as in <span style="font-style:italic">HL v United Kingdom</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">JE v DE</span>. In <span style="font-style:italic">HL v United Kingdom</span> and in <span style="font-style:italic">DE v JE</span> the word “<span style="font-style:italic">intention</span>” is used in the sense of the mental attitude with which a person acts, whereas “<span style="font-style:italic">purpose</span>” in the sense that it is used in <span style="font-style:italic">Austin</span> is more akin to motive, the motive of the police being to exercise crowd control, rather than to confine the demonstrators. Lord Scott however in stating at [39] that “<span style="font-style:italic">the intention of the police was to maintain the cordon so long as was reasonably thought necessary</span>” uses the word “<span style="font-style:italic">intention</span>” in the sense of mental attitude, whilst Lord Hope in saying at [24] “<span style="font-style:italic">detention in the paradigm sense was not in the minds of anyone</span>”, seems to be referring to “<span style="font-style:italic">motive</span>”. The heart of the case lies in the passage in the speech of Lord Walker “<span style="font-style:italic">what were the police doing …? What were they about? The answer is … that they were engaged in an unusually difficult exercise in crowd control …</span>” [47]. The question of purpose posed at the outset is in the end answered only in the qualified ways set out above.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">I accept that the question of intention in the sense of mental attitude is irrelevant to the question of whether a person is deprived of their liberty. A person’s belief that they are not depriving another of their liberty is likely to be irrelevant and may be inaccurate. In <span style="font-style:italic">HL v United Kingdom</span> the hospital representatives denied that it was in their minds to confine HL because he was free to leave at any time, a concept which Lord Steyn in the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Bournewood</span> described as a “<span style="font-style:italic">fairytale</span>”. So I treat with extreme caution the suggestion that purpose is relevant in this type of case, save that it does seem to me to be realistic to put into the equation when trying to discern the factual matrix and whether these girls are objectively deprived of their liberty, that both girls were placed in their respective placements as children in need, because they need homes, rather than because they require restraint, or treatment. It is also relevant in my view to consider the reasons why they are under continuous supervision and control.</p>

And typically in the kind of context with which I am here concerned – care of children or vulnerable adults by their parents in the family home – there will not, in my judgment, be any deprivation of liberty, whether that phrase is used in the Article 5 sense or in the context of the common law tort and crime of false imprisonment.

The children in the present case are not in secure accommodation (whether in the sense in which that expression is used in s 25 of the Children Act 1989 or in any other sense). They are not being detained. They are simply living with foster parents in exactly the same type of domestic setting as any other children of their ages would be, whether living at home with their parents or staying with friends or relatives. Habeas corpus does not lie because a parent, or other person in loco parentis, makes it a rule that a child of tender years is not to leave the house unless accompanied by some suitable person or because an exasperated parent has sent a naughty child to his room and told him to stay there for 2 hours or because a rebellious teenager has been ‘grounded’ or subjected to a parentally enforced curfew, any more than habeas corpus lies if the headmaster of a boarding school forbids his charges to leave the school premises except at permitted times and for permitted purposes. And it makes no difference for this purpose that the domestic rule is actually enforced by the turning of a key in a lock.”</p>

E had been living for over ten years with F, initially as a foster carer and subsequently under an adult placement, until he was removed by the local authority in circumstances of which Baker J was extremely critical and which he found had breached E’s Article 8 rights. The local authority then placed E at successive units without any prior judicial sanction and in circumstances which Baker J found involved an unlawful deprivation by the local authority of E’s liberty constituting a breach of his Article 5 rights. </p>

Counsel for F, supported by counsel for E’s sister, G, submitted that the argument was fallacious. Baker J summarised the submission of counsel for F as follows (para [116]):</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“To return E to his home and family would not constitute a deprivation of liberty. The concrete situation will be the familiar surroundings of home and family life to which he is accustomed. Other members of his family could visit whenever they wished. In F’s home, E has his own bedroom which is always kept open due to the risks presented by his epilepsy. [Counsel for G] submits that the suggestion that E’s lack of capacity was so extreme that he would always be deprived of his liberty, wherever he was, and even if returned to F, demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of Article 5.  The “core element” is confinement, per <span style="font-style:italic">Secretary of State for the Home Department v E</span> [2008] AC 499 per Baroness Hale of Richmond at paragraph 25. She submits that the suggestion that F’s home constituted a particular restricted space is untenable.  Nor is there any evidence that E was confined to that home for a significant length of time. On the contrary, she submits, E was entirely free to leave, (and frequently did leave) subject only to proportionate safeguards which, at most, would be a restriction on, rather than deprivation of, liberty. There were no restrictions imposed on any person having access to him. The Official Solicitor also disagrees with the local authority, contending that if E were to return to F he would probably not be deprived of his liberty within the meaning of Article 5. But he submits that it is unnecessary and undesirable for the Court to rule on this point.”</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“There is a valid distinction in my judgment between a confinement within the home: equivalent to house arrest, as in the control orders cases, and the mere fact of being placed in a foster home. As Collins J said in <span style="font-style:italic">GG</span>, it is the effect of the restrictions and the extent of the confinement which matters. And Lord Bingham in <span style="font-style:italic">JJ</span> stressed the need to examine what the person’s life would have been like had they not been placed in the location where they are said to be confined. I do not accept that mere placement in a residential or domestic setting can be construed as creating confinement of itself just because the person cannot legally decide whether to remain there or not. In my judgment, if a person is living what is for them a normal life in a family home, and would not be living any different life in any other setting including in their own family home, then it is very difficult to see how they can objectively be confined, simply because they lack the capacity to consent to that placement. </p>

C’s parents, she say, are <span style="font-style:italic">looking after</span> her, not punishing her; <span style="font-style:italic">promoting</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">improving</span> her autonomy and dignity, not restricting them; and in supporting her as they do they are <span style="font-style:italic">giving</span> to her, not taking away. Such arrangements, she submits, are not even on the borderline between a deprivation and a mere restriction of liberty; the caring restrictions imposed by C’s parents in the context of their home and family life together clearly fall, she says, outside the category of cases which Article 5 is intended to regulate. The restrictions upon C, imposed in the context of her family life, are, says Ms Ball, as ‘normal’ as they could conceivably be for someone with C’s condition. They are not arbitrary at all but, rather, tailored to her needs, proportionate and imposed in good faith. Moreover, she says, it has to be remembered that A and C are inherently restricted by the manifestations of their genetic condition. The ‘restrictions’ imposed upon them do not in fact, she says, restrict their liberty in any meaningful sense of the word. Rather, in the context of their restrictive condition, they maximise their opportunities and help them to live their lives to the full.</p>

Given the expert opinion I have referred to, B, in my judgment, is fully entitled to adopt this stance. Moreover, I agree with Ms Freeborn that this is something that can properly be entrusted to B in the continuing discharge of her parental responsibility. In my judgment it should be left to her.
