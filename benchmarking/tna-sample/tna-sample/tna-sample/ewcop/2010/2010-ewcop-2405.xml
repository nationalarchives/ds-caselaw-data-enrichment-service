	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The question before the court on this application is whether Mr S, as I will call him, has the necessary mental capacity to decide whether an action in the Chancery Division of the High Court, started in his name and on his behalf by his younger daughter and deputy R, should be discontinued or compromised. The principal relief sought in the action is a declaration that gifts of money totalling £549,141 odd, which were made by Mr S to the first defendant, Mrs D, on fifteen separate occasions between 19 January 2006 and 11 April 2007, were procured by the undue influence of Mrs D and should be set aside.  The second and third defendants are the adult children of Mrs D, to each of whom she transferred £30,000 out of the money given to her by Mr S.  The action has now been settled as against the second and third defendants by a consent order dated 17 June 2010, whereby they agreed to pay £40,000 to R’s solicitors.  Unless it is discontinued or compromised in the meantime, the action to recover the remaining £509,141 from Mrs D will continue and is listed for hearing in November. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The application which is now before me, and which I am hearing as a nominated judge of the Court of Protection, was issued in that court by Mrs D on 6 July 2009.  In her application form she described herself as a friend of Mr S, and stated the matters which she wanted the court to decide as follows:</p>

The order appointed R “to make decisions on behalf of [Mr S] that he is unable to make for himself in relation to his property and affairs”, subject to the conditions and restrictions set out in the order. Paragraph 2(a) of the order then conferred on R</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">R commenced the High Court action against Mrs D and her children (“the Chancery proceedings”) by a claim form under Part 7 of the CPR issued on 27 January 2009. She did not need to obtain the prior authorisation of the Court of Protection to take this initial step, and did not do so: see CPR rule 21.3(2)(b)(i).  She did, however, need to obtain the authority of the court before taking any further steps in the proceedings, because the order of 9 October 2007 did not expressly authorise her to conduct proceedings on her father’s behalf: see CPR rules 21.3(3) and 21.4(2). An application for this purpose was therefore made by her to the Court of Protection, and by an order dated 27 April 2009 Senior Judge Lush expressly authorised her to take and conduct the Chancery proceedings on her father’s behalf.  </p>

	  <num style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-size:12pt;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:-0.50in">5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Despite the grant of this authority, however, it is common ground that R’s entitlement to conduct the Chancery proceedings is dependent on her father’s lacking the capacity to do so himself. This follows from the basic principle that her only right as his deputy is to take decisions that he is unable to take for himself.  It is also common ground that it is Mr S’s consistently repeated, deeply felt and clearly expressed wish that the Chancery proceedings should never have been begun, and that they should not now be continued.  Nobody disputes that it is his fervent desire that Mrs D should be able to keep the very substantial sums which he gave to her, and that he is appalled at the prospect of legal proceedings being taken in his name to recover them.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It will already be apparent that the question which I have to resolve is one of great sensitivity.  My task is also one of considerable difficulty, as will be evident from two further matters which I have not yet mentioned.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The first of those matters is that Mr S is agreed to have had testamentary capacity on 13 April 2008 when he executed a will leaving his residuary estate in equal shares to his two daughters, R and A.  On 8 April 2008 a psychiatric report had been obtained from an eminent expert, Professor Robert Howard, who was then (and still is) professor of old age psychiatry and psychopathology at the Institute of Psychiatry and a consultant old age psychiatrist at the Maudsley Hospital in London. In that report he expressed the clear view that Mr S had testamentary capacity when he examined him at his home on 3 April 2008.  It might be thought to follow from this undisputed evidence that, if Mr S then had capacity to make a will, he would equally have had capacity to include in the will a provision confirming the gifts which he had made to Mrs D in 2006 and 2007, and directing his executors (who were R and an unspecified partner in Judkins Solicitors, who have at all material times acted for R) to take no steps to recover or set aside the gifts.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second matter is that I have had the assistance of expert evidence on both sides, and of a report prepared for the court by a Special Visitor, Dr Andrew Barker, appointed pursuant to an order which I made on 20 October 2009.  Unfortunately, however, there is an unbridgeable division of opinion between the experts.  Professor Howard, instructed as before on behalf of Mrs D, is of the firm opinion that Mr S does indeed have sufficient capacity to decide whether the Chancery proceedings should have been begun, and whether they should be continued.  The equally eminent expert instructed by R’s solicitors, Professor John Graham Beaumont, who specialises in clinical psychology and neuropsychology and is head of the department of clinical psychology at the Royal Hospital for Neuro-Disability, honorary professor at Roehampton University and a Fellow of the British Psychological Society, disagrees. So does Dr Barker, a consultant in old age psychiatry, who visited Mr S at his home on 21 November 2009 and prepared a report dated 2 December 2009.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Resolution of this case will ultimately depend on my analysis and evaluation of the conflicting expert evidence (a term which I use to include Dr Barker’s report). All three experts gave oral evidence and were cross-examined on the first and second days of the hearing before me. Before I come on to the expert evidence, however, I will first set out the undisputed background facts and provide a description of the Chancery proceedings.  I will also set out the relevant provisions of the Mental Capacity Act 2005, and discuss the legal principles which I have to apply.  </p>

His parents were ethnic Indians from Uttar Pradesh.  He was formerly a managing clerk with J E Baring &amp; Co, solicitors.  In 1963 he married, but after 19 years of marriage he and his wife separated in August 1982, and they divorced in 1985.  They had two children: A, who was born on 19 September 1963 and lives in St Albans, Hertfordshire, and R, who was born on 9 January 1965, and is a school teacher. She too lives in St Albans.</p>

She contended (a) that the proposed appointment of R was against the express wishes of Mr S; (b) that R was an unsuitable person to take charge of his finances; (c) that the appointment was unnecessary, because Mrs D already had a power of attorney and she had been looking after his personal and financial needs for some time; and (d) that no working relationship could exist between her and R, if R was appointed as receiver.  Shortly afterwards, Redferns applied to register the enduring power of attorney that Mr S had signed on 28 February 2006.  This application, in its turn, was met by an objection from R on the grounds that fraud or undue pressure had been used to induce Mr S to create the power, and that in all the circumstances the attorneys were unsuitable to fulfil that role.</p>

In the judgment which he gave on 28 September, he decided that Mrs D was unsuitable to be Mr S’s attorney, because the transactions in her favour called for an explanation and it would be presumed that they were procured by undue influence unless she could provide a satisfactory explanation to the contrary.  The transactions needed to be investigated, and it would be impossible for Mrs D, as attorney, to carry out an investigation into her own dealings.  On the receivership application, he exercised the discretion which was then contained in section 99 of the Mental Health Act 1983 and decided that R, rather than a panel receiver, should be appointed for reasons which he explained as follows:</p>

In a case of this kind, with the investigation that needs to be carried out, I would be surprised if a panel receiver would charge less than £15,000 a year. This would be entirely disproportionate, given that [Mr S’s] estate, excluding the value of his house and any sums that may be recoverable from [Mrs D], amounts to only £80,000. By contrast, [R] will act gratuitously, and will thereby manage his assets more economically.</p>

Of course, his wishes and feelings are of considerable importance, and I would not dream of overriding them unless I considered it was absolutely necessary to do so. His wish is that [Mrs D] should manage his affairs, but, for the reasons stated above, that would be inappropriate and would not be in his best interests.  When enacting the Mental Capacity Act 2005, which comes fully into force on 1 October 2007, Parliament required decision makers, including the court, to act in an incapacitated person’s best interests, rather than engage in an act of pure substituted judgment. This means that the patient’s wishes do not automatically determine the outcome.”</p>

It is then pleaded that the gift of these sums was so large as not to be reasonably accounted for on the ground of friendship or other ordinary motives; that they were paid in circumstances in which there existed a relationship of dependence by Mr S upon Mrs D and trust and confidence reposed by him in her, including in connection with his financial affairs; and that at no time did he exercise his independent and informed judgment about the nature of the gifts, whether individually or cumulatively, nor with regard to the proportion of his assets that they represented or their effect upon his overall financial position.  Nor did he receive any independent advice in connection with the gifts.  In the premises, it is alleged that the payments are presumed to have been procured by undue influence and they are liable to be set aside accordingly. </p>

It is further said that his decisions to make the various gifts “were made by him after full, free and informed thought”.  It is also denied that Mr S’s mental health was adversely affected by the stroke which he suffered in 2005, or that he became progressively incapacitated during the period when he made the gifts, or that he ever drank excessively until just before Christmas 2006 when he began to drink about one or one and a half bottles of whiskey a week.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is unnecessary for me to say anything more about the Chancery proceedings, and I emphasise that nothing in this judgment should be read as expressing any concluded view on the merits of the claim.  That remains to be determined, if at all, in the forthcoming trial, when the pleaded cases on each side will be tested in the light of the full oral and documentary evidence then before the court.  I do, however, think it appropriate to say that the claim, as pleaded, is a serious and substantial one, which prima facie gives rise to a strong case for Mrs D to answer.  At the simplest level, the making of cash gifts of nearly £550,000, by an elderly man in his seventies, living alone and in poor health, in favour of a lady who was a legal secretary employed by his solicitors, is a transaction which calls out for an explanation, and which would set alarm bells ringing in the mind of any experienced equity lawyer. To make the same point another way, it is certainly not the kind of case which can be dismissed as a speculative one with little more than nuisance value. It is the kind of case, I would venture to add, which cries out for mediation and a realistic settlement.  It is most unfortunate that efforts to settle the case by mediation have so far failed to bear fruit. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“36. The 2005 Act marks a radical change in the treatment of persons lacking capacity. First it brings together under one common framework the former powers of the court to make decisions both about a person’s property and his personal welfare.  It thus applies to all manner of decisions from the relatively minor to the most important.  Second, it applies not only to decisions that the court might make, but also to decisions that others (carers, doctors, deputies) might make.  Third, the test of incapacity is finely calibrated.  The Act recognises that the test of capacity is issue specific.  A person (“P”) may well have capacity in relation to some matters (e.g. what to wear or what to eat), while lacking capacity as regards others (e.g. what to do with his savings or whether to undergo an operation).  A person’s capacity may also vary from time to time.  At this point I should comment on one aspect of the statutory test of incapacity.  One of the ingredients in the test is to ask whether P is able to “use or weigh” information in making a decision: section 3(1)(c).  In their report the Law Commission explained the thinking behind this: para 3.17. They said: </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">“There are cases where the person concerned can understand information but where the effects of a mental disability prevent him or her from using that information in the decision-making process. We explained in Consultation Paper No. 128 that certain compulsive conditions cause people who are quite able to absorb information to arrive, inevitably, at decisions which are unconnected to the information or their understanding of it. An example is the anorexic who always decides not to eat … We originally suggested that such cases could be described as cases where incapacity resulted from inability to make a true choice.  Common to all these cases is the fact that the person’s eventual decision is divorced from his or her ability to understand the relevant information. Emphasising that the person must be able to use the information which he or she has successfully understood in the decision-making process deflects the complications of asking whether a person needs to “appreciate” information as well as understand it. A decision based on compulsion, the overpowering will of a third party or any other inability to act on relevant information as a result of mental disability is not a decision made by a person with decision-making capacity.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I would add that it is important not to confuse the structured and relatively objective “best interests” test, which applies where a person lacks the capacity to take a decision for himself, with the prior question whether the person has the requisite capacity to do so.  That question has to be determined in accordance with the principles in sections 1 to 3 of the 2005 Act. It is clear that the test of capacity is both issue and time-specific, and that failure to satisfy any one of the four criteria in section 3(1) in relation to the particular decision in question, if established to the satisfaction of the court on the balance of probabilities (see section 2(4)), will be fatal. On the other hand, all practicable steps must be taken to assist the person to make the decision for himself (section 1(3)), and full regard must be had to the principles in subsections 3(2) and (3), which further explain and qualify the meaning of the criteria in subsection (1)(a) and (b) (understanding and retention of the information relevant to the decision). Thus, the information relevant to the decision (which includes, by virtue of section 3(4), information about the reasonably foreseeable consequences of deciding one way or another, or failing to make the decision), will be sufficiently understood if the person is able to understand “an explanation of it given to him in a way that is appropriate to his circumstances”. Moreover, the fact that he is able to retain the relevant information for a short period only does not, in itself, prevent him from being regarded as able to make the decision: section 3(3).  It follows that even profound loss or impairment of memory may be compatible with capacity to make the decision. It will be enough, so far as criterion (b) is concerned, if the person’s short term memory enables him to retain the relevant information, once it has been supplied to him, for long enough for him to understand and evaluate it and to form and communicate his decision.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Two further important provisions reflect the basic principles of personal autonomy and freedom of action which seem to me to inform and illuminate the new statutory regime. First, a person must be assumed to have capacity unless the contrary is established: section 1(2). Thus the burden of proof in the present case lies on R to establish that Mr S lacks capacity to discontinue or settle the Chancery proceedings.  If the burden is not discharged, it must be assumed that he has the necessary capacity and the court has no right to interfere with his decision. Secondly, the fact that the decision is an unwise one does not, of itself, justify a conclusion of lack of capacity: see section 1(4). Just as a testator has always had the freedom (subject now to the constraints of the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975) to make testamentary dispositions which are unreasonable, foolish or contrary to generally accepted standards of morality, so too a person in his lifetime has the freedom to act in a manner which is (for example) unwise, capricious, or designed to spite his relations.  The pages of English fiction and of the law reports alike bear ample testimony to the exercise of this basic human right, even if it is not one enshrined in so many words in the European Convention on Human Rights (although Articles 8, 9 and 10 are, of course, all relevant in this context). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The significance of section 1(4) must not, however, be exaggerated.  The fact that a decision is unwise or foolish may not, without more, be treated as conclusive, but it remains in my judgment a relevant consideration for the court to take into account in considering whether the criteria of inability to make a decision for oneself in section 3(1) are satisfied. This will particularly be the case where there is a marked contrast between the unwise nature of the impugned decision and the person’s former attitude to the conduct of his affairs at a time when his capacity was not in question. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Before moving on, I should record that it is common ground that what is sometimes called the diagnostic test in section 2(1) is satisfied in the present case, namely that Mr S suffers from “an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain”. The existence of such an impairment or disturbance is not in issue, although its precise nature has not been established because Mr S has never undergone a full neurological examination. In particular, it is not disputed that Mr S suffers from a severe impairment of his long term (or semantic) memory, although his short term memory is only moderately impaired and falls within the lower part of the average range for a man of his age. One of the main areas of disagreement between the experts is whether, and if so how far, his mental impairment or disturbance extends beyond the severe impairment of his long term memory. The other, and closely related, main area of dispute is whether the effect of his mental impairment or disturbance is such that he is unable to decide for himself (within the meaning of section 3) whether or not to continue with the Chancery proceedings.</p>

But that decision cannot be taken, it seems to me, without at least a basic understanding of the nature of the claim, of the legal issues involved, and of the circumstances which have given rise to the claim.  It would be an over-simplification to say that the claim is just a claim to set aside or reverse the gifts which Mr S made to Mrs D, because in the ordinary way a gift is irrevocable once it has been made and perfected by delivery or transfer of the relevant assets.  If a gift is to be set aside or recovered, some vitiating factor such as fraud, misrepresentation or undue influence has to be established; and if the donor is to decide whether or not to pursue a claim, he needs to understand, at least in general terms, the nature of the vitiating factor upon which he may be able to rely, and to weigh up the arguments for and against pursuing the claim. Provided that the donor is equipped with this information, and provided that he understands it and takes it into account in reaching his decision, it will not matter if his decision is an imprudent one, or one which would fail to satisfy the “best interests” test in section 4.  But if the donor is unable to assimilate, retain and evaluate the relevant information, he lacks the capacity to make the decision, however clearly he may articulate it.  </p>

Furthermore, where (as in the present case) the relationship with the donee which gave rise to the potential claim is apparently still subsisting, the court will in my judgment need to scrutinise with particular care whether the donor can stand back from the impugned transactions with sufficient detachment truly to understand the nature of the claim.  By way of contrast, the necessary degree of understanding is likely to be far easier to establish where the donor was under an influence at the time of the gift (e.g. by a religious sect or guru) which has subsequently come to an end.  </p>

Mr Staunton suggested that if Mr S had that limited degree of understanding, no more was necessary, because if he wished Mrs D to retain the gifts even on the assumption that he had a good claim to recover them, the same must be true <span style="font-style:italic">a fortiori</span> if he were able to understand the actual complexities of the Chancery proceedings. The submission is a beguiling one, but I am unable to accept it. As I have tried to explain, a good (or any) claim to recover a gift must be based on the existence of some vitiating factor, and without an understanding of the relevant factor, and of the circumstances which arguably engage it, the donor cannot in my judgment be said to understand the information relevant to the decision whether or not to pursue the claim. </p>

If the immediate question were not whether the Chancery proceedings should be continued at all, but rather whether an offer of settlement should be accepted, it would in my view plainly be necessary for Mr S to have a basic understanding of the nature of the claim, of its legal basis, and of the evidential hurdles facing each side, before he could form an opinion on the merits of the offer. He might then decide to disregard that opinion for other reasons (for example, an overriding wish that Mrs D should keep the gifts, even if she had taken advantage of him and they were improperly obtained); but the formation of the opinion would still be a necessary step in the decision-making process, and if Mr S lacked the capacity to form the opinion, his overriding wish that Mrs D should in any event keep the gifts would not, in itself, be enough. If, as I think, this approach would be correct if the question were whether to settle the Chancery proceedings, the same must in my view be true where the question is whether to continue them at all.  It cannot be enough for Mr S simply to say that he wishes Mrs D to keep the money which he gave her, and that no action of any kind should be taken to recover it.</p>

He made good eye contact and we enjoyed a good rapport.  … His affect was rather depressed.  There seemed to be no psychotic or obsessive-compulsive features.</p>

He had difficulty with attention and concentration, scoring only 2/5 on spelling WORLD backwards and he had difficulty naming unusual items, such as the clasp on my watch.  He had difficulty repeating a short phrase and showed ideational and constructional dyspraxia … There was evidence of perseveration (such as in repeatedly using 1930 as his siblings’ dates of birth). On the Mini Mental State Examination on 21 May, he scored 20/30 and on the Clock Drawing Test, 1/5. On 1 June 2007 these scores were 17/30 and 1/5 respectively.”</p>

He concluded that Mr S was suffering from “a dementia of moderate severity”, and that in addition his heavy alcohol use might have caused brain damage.  He recognised that his growing dependence on Mrs D would have made him “susceptible to exploitation by others and [Mrs D] in particular”, but he added that, apart from the circumstantial evidence of large sums having passed between them, he was not aware of any evidence that she had attempted to coerce him during the last two years.  On balance, he doubted whether Mr S had testamentary capacity at the time of their interview. He also thought that Mr S was probably no longer able to manage his affairs independently, and had become vulnerable to exploitation.  He therefore recommended that Mr S should be referred as soon as possible to become a patient under the Court of Protection.</p>

The questions on which he was asked to give his opinion included whether Mr S was able to look after his own affairs, and whether he currently had testamentary capacity.  This report, too, seems to me a thorough and professional piece of work.  Dr Briscoe set out the information available to him, including conversations with R, A and Mrs D and with a number of people who had been involved in Mr S’s medical and social care. He had also seen a copy of Dr Powell’s report. His visit to Mr S took place at Charing Cross Hospital, and lasted for one hour.  The comments which Mr S made to him about Mrs D appear to be broadly similar to those recorded by Dr Powell, although he was unable to say how much money he had given her, whether as a lump sum or instalments, or for what particular purposes. A little later, however, he said that his purpose had been to make provision for her old age, and he had advised her about how to invest money he gave her. Even if she offered to return it, he would not take it back.  </p>

One is seeing him now at his best after rehabilitation at Hammersmith Hospital and Charing Cross Hospital. His present condition would not be nearly so good were he to be living alone in a bungalow. He is limited in mobility. His blindness would be a serious handicap if he tried to cook or if he were alone at night when he could easily become disorientated.  He has fallen in [Mrs D’s] house. I do not think one could separate [his] mental ability from his physical ability. He is simply an elderly, frail, vulnerable person with a deteriorating mental state.  He would not be able to read documents or know what he was signing.  Unless bills or letters were read to him he would not know what they were.

He would however be capable of understanding the extent of his assets if they were explained to him at the time of making a Will now.  He has been punctilious in the past about finances, advising [R] about her finances and he would understand his own once explained.  He knows that he had dependants, [R and A] and perhaps one or more of his brothers, but he does not want to make a Will in their favour, apparently possibly he is still angry at what he thinks was their rejection of him at a time of need. I think it is likely therefore that if he were to make another Will now it would be much the same as the Will he made a year ago, and that it would be in favour of [Mrs D] … I would say that he had testamentary capacity now.”</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“[Mr S] was sitting upright in his bed and was fully co-operative with my interview and remained mostly focussed throughout the hour long assessment.  Significantly he was aware that as he put it “I have a tendency to forget”.  He also expressed his understandable frustration that he cannot walk unaided and can no longer read his books which were his main expenditure before his health failed. He told me that although he accepted his current situation, he prayed and yearned for a quick and painless death every day his head hit the pillow.  On formal cognitive testing it was not possible to administer the Mini-Mental State Examination in full on account of his visual impairments and motor disabilities. However, he was fully orientated in time and place giving his correct post-code.  He recalled my name after 15 and 30 minutes along with 2 out of 3 other new words.  Thus his short-term recall is still functional. He was conversant with current world events through listening to Radio 4 he claimed but he could not give me the Christian name of the Prime Minister but immediately recognised it from 3 given possibilities.  This pattern of cognitive impairment is in keeping with the original diagnosis of Multi-Infarct Dementia and appears not to have progressed beyond the moderate range of severity as yet.</p>

We explained that she would but if there was not enough money for her to pay for these needs (because he had given his money to [Mrs D]) she would not be able to.

He could recall that his house and his pension contributed the bulk of his estate.  Although he could not recall the market value of his bungalow, once he had been reminded of this he was able to weigh the figure against the amount of money that he had already given to [Mrs D] and come to an understandable decision that he could logically defend about the relative amounts of money that he had already, or would want to give to [Mrs D] and his two daughters. He was able to recall the names and dates of birth of his daughters and could recall his grandchildren and that he had surviving siblings in Fiji.  He was able to give cogent reasons as to why he now wants to make his daughters sole beneficiaries of his Will and not make any further dispositions to [Mrs D].”</p>

He was instructed on behalf of R to prepare a report on Mr S, based on the following written materials: the judgment of Senior Judge Lush dated 28 September 2007; the reports of Dr Powell, Dr Briscoe, Dr Cook and Professor Howard; the statements of case in the Chancery proceedings; and Mrs D’s application to the Court of Protection issued on 6 July 2009, together with her witness statement in support. Dr Falkowski was not instructed to examine Mr S, and did not do so. His report was based solely on the information contained in the papers made available to him.  His conclusion, based on a brief summary of the material before him, was that Mr S did not understand why the Chancery proceedings were being brought, that he did not have the capacity to understand the information involved, or to consider it, and that he did not understand the impact the sums of money involved could have on his future care or needs. Since this report was not based on any first-hand knowledge of the case, and since Dr Falkowski never met Mr S, the weight that I can attach to it is inevitably very limited, and neither side sought to rely upon it at the hearing. </p>

Among my concerns in making this order were, first, that Mr S should be examined by an expert who was independent of the parties, and, secondly, that when the examination took place Mr S should be free from immediate influence by either Mrs D or R.  The order therefore contained provisions that for 14 clear days before the examination took place Mrs D should not contact Mr S in any form or manner, and that during the same period R should not speak to him about the Chancery proceedings or any of the issues relating to them.

These included all of the earlier reports which I have mentioned and the witness statements in the Chancery proceedings. In view of the adversarial nature of the case, Dr Barker wisely said that he had taken little information from the witness statements. He did, however, refer to some handwritten letters from Mr S dating from 2000 and 1998 which R had exhibited to one of her statements. He recorded that one of these letters, to R herself, indicated Mr S’s “strong views on his daughter’s financial prudence”.  In this letter Mr S had given his opinion on a mortgage that R appeared to have taken out, commenting that in his view she had paid too much for it and advising her to shop around on the web for cheaper alternatives. He had advised her about pension payments and national insurance contributions, and recommended her to “fill the pension pot to the brim for your old age security”.  He had expressed strong views that she should be self-reliant and look out for herself and her son.</p>

I told him that I thought I had read that he might have had a rift or been estranged, or had a disagreement with one or more of his daughters.

On further questioning, he estimated that he had an income of £40 per week … I asked him what his estate was worth, checking to see he understood this concept.  He thought he had savings of approximately £15 - £20,000, and that [R] would know.

He said, yes he did remember, and that it was unsolicited, voluntary, commenting that she was reluctant to accept it.  He told me that he had given her money on no more than two occasions, to express his gratitude. He said the money had been given for the care and kindness which she had shown him and continues to show him.  He thought the last time he had given her any money was 3 or 4 years previously, that he didn’t know whether she needed it, and spontaneously said that she did not ask for it.  He thought in total between the two occasions he might have given her between £300 and £400. I told him that one of the concerns the Court had was that he might have given her substantially more than that. He denied this: “In fact it could be less”. He felt that the money was a small amount.  When I again said that the Court thought that he might have given her half of his wealth, he seemed unperturbed by this, saying “oh yes, that could be right”.  I pointed out that if he thought he had given [Mrs D] £400 and his house was worth £40,000 then that seemed a big difference in proportion to giving her half of his estate.  He found it difficult to follow my “proportion” line of reasoning, or percentages.  He denied that it would be of any concern to him if he had given her half of his estate, though could not recall having done so. </p>

He said that he would need money if he went into a care home, and that his daughter would come to his aid in every way possible.  He said he had not made provision himself for his future care and that it would be his daughter’s responsibility. She would take care of it. “She will see to it. Whatever money I have she will use it, and if there is any shortfall, she will see to it”. He insisted that she would be happy to use her own money as they had a very good relationship. I queried the potential unfairness in this if he had given a large proportion of his wealth to [Mrs D] and then his daughter [R], had to find money out of her own purse to pay for his future care. He did not appear to understand the point I was making, again reiterating “Whatever I have given to Jane, I have given to Jane”. He also reiterated that his daughter was his life and support, and that he relied on her, seeing to his needs and requests.</p>

When I told him that earlier in the conversation he had told me he had given her £300 - £400, he denied this, saying that the most he had given her was £200 - £300.  He told me that he thought the house was worth £35,000.  He told me on this occasion that he had given [Mrs D] sums of money on 3 or 4 occasions, and that he hadn’t given her a lump sum – “it was bits and pieces, here and there”. He reiterated “Whatever I gave Jane, was from my own volition, no constraint and with no compulsion”. He repeated that it wasn’t a large amount of money that he had given.”</p>

Dr Barker considered that Mr S was unable to remember and to weigh up the true value of money; that he had no, or inconsistent, understanding of the circumstances in which he made the gifts to Mrs D; that he had limited and inconsistent understanding of the effects of the gifts on his overall financial position; that he was aware that he might have financial needs in the future, but had limited ability to plan for such needs; and that he did not have a full understanding of the consequences of recovering sums paid, due to his limited ability to understand the true value of the money.

They are sometimes called frontal lobe functions because they are impaired in patients who have evidence of structural damage to their frontal lobes and because functional brain imaging experiments have demonstrated that healthy individuals activate areas within the frontal lobes while they are performing cognitive tasks that involve them. Although there are formal testing protocols that have been validated for the assessment of frontal lobe functioning and which are usually administered by psychologists who have been trained in their delivery and scoring, there are a number of bedside clinical tests which are routinely used by psychiatrists and neurologists to assess patients with possible frontal lobe damage. These tests include verbal fluency, proverb interpretation, questions about the similarities and differences that exist between objects, and cognitive estimates. An examination of the function of the frontal lobes may also involve an assessment of a patient’s capacity for abstract thought and reasoning and their ability to reflect upon their situation and that of others.”</p>

His performance on the verbal fluency tests, which Professor Howard administered last and during which Mr S repeatedly complained of tiredness, was “less than would be expected from a man with his level of educational attainment”, and although his performance on one test was in the impaired range his performance on another was within the average range for an older person.  On interpretation of proverbs (a test of reasoning ability, although recognised to be influenced by educational ability and cultural background), Mr S’s ability was in the normal range “and demonstrated a preservation of his reasoning skills that would not be expected in a patient with severe frontal lobe damage”. For example, he had explained the proverb “a stitch in time saves nine” by saying “Procrastination is no good.  A job that should be done must be done now to save headaches”. On similarities and differences (a test used to assess inferential reasoning) Mr S’s performance was again normal, as was his performance on cognitive estimates (i.e. questions that require a patient to make estimations of the number or size of some parameter).

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">[Mr S] has a profound impairment of his memory functions but has well-preserved reasoning and language abilities and remains highly articulate. His overall cognitive impairment, as assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination appears to have been non-progressive during the 20 month period over which I have been able to examine him and this would argue against a contribution from Alzheimer’s disease pathology to his memory difficulties. My testing of the functioning of his frontal lobes revealed that while his verbal fluency was poorer than would have been expected from an individual with his educational background, he was still able to perform this function at close to the normal level.  When I tested other functions of his frontal lobes which are directly relevant to his ability to reason and reflect, he performed within the normal range on these tests.  I continue to hold the opinion, given in my second psychiatric report dated 10 June 2009, that [he] does have capacity to make the decision as to whether or not the Chancery proceedings should continue.  In order to make such a decision he will need to be initially reminded of the facts of the situation.  He is able to retain the necessary information for a period of a few minutes and has sufficiently preserved reasoning abilities to be able to use and weight this information in order to make valid decisions.  Finally, his language skills are well preserved and he has no difficulty in articulating decisions that he has made.”</p>

Professor Howard’s instructions were given to him at a further conference with counsel on 3 March, and were confirmed in an email from Mr O’Halloran dated 4 March. It appears from the email that Mr O’Halloran had been asked to inform Professor Howard about Mr S’s finances, which he did in the following terms:</p>

As a result of a number of factors, including his poor orientation, his poor ability to reason about novel situations, his severely impaired memory, and the fact that he does not recognise inconsistencies in his own reasoning and does not have an appreciation of the present value of money, then I do not consider that [Mr S] is able to exercise mental capacity with respect to the relevant decisions.  He also has a severe deficit in his ability to perform mental arithmetic, even with quite small amounts. I note that a broad range of opinions have previously been reported with respect to [his] mental capacity, but with respect to the opposing views of Professor Howard and Dr Barker as expressed in their Joint Statement of April 2010, I find my opinion close to the opinion expressed by Dr Barker, but in disagreement with the opinion of Professor Howard.  The reasons for my opinion are stated in this report.”</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“I administered a number of formal psychometric tests to [Mr S], relevant to my opinion with respect to his current capacity. I note that the Mini-Mental State Examination has been previously employed on a number of occasions to assess [Mr S] and while this is a useful brief screening test, it is not specifically designed for the purposes of assessing capacity, and cannot be regarded as more than a rather rough and ready screen. I do not feel that it satisfactorily addresses the issues currently under consideration. I first administered three subtests from the WAIS-III with interesting results.  It is difficult to infer [Mr S’s] premorbid general cognitive ability as he was born in Fiji, although he is an ethnic Indian, and came to the UK in February 1962. I am not entirely clear about his occupational history, but I understand that he was a civil servant. It seems reasonable to conclude that [his] abilities in adult life were at least above the average for the population of his age, and it is likely that his abilities were in fact in the High Average range or better. His current level of Comprehension as assessed by the WAIS-III is consistent with this inference. [He] obtained a result on this test of everyday reasoning ability which places him in the High Average range and at the 91<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> percentile for the normal population of his age.  There appears to be no deficit in this area of his abilities. However, this should be contrasted with the other subtests which I administered to him. On the Similarities subtest which is similarly a test of verbal reasoning [his] result was at the borderline for frank abnormality and at only the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> percentile.  His Arithmetic subtest placed him in the borderline range and at only the 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> percentile.  Both these results are severely impaired with respect to his inferred premorbid level of ability. The contrast is instructive.  When [he] is relying upon previously learned knowledge about the world, as for example in understanding why laws are needed about the employment of children, or why people should pay taxes, then he is able to rely upon his previously acquired knowledge and so perform at a satisfactory level.  However, presented with novel problems which require him to reason as in being asked to say how steam and fog are alike, then he is unable to do so.  He is also unable to perform more than the most elementary mental arithmetic.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">I also administered selected subtests from the RBANS, principally to provide a brief assessment of [his] memory abilities. Again there is an interesting contrast.  The Digit Span subtest, which [he] performed within the Average range (44<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> percentile) demonstrates that while there is a moderate degree of impairment in his working memory, this is not grossly abnormal. However, the other tests of [his] verbal memory function were all within the abnormal level, and his delayed recall and recognition were all extremely poor … these results clearly confirm what has been previously understood which is that [he] has a severe impairment of his auditory verbal memory.  This is, however, in the context of only a moderate impairment in his verbal working memory. I also took the opportunity to administer the Semantic Fluency subtest which was also severely impaired and within the borderline range further suggesting that [he] has difficulties of reasoning and response control, possibly associated with some abnormality of his frontal lobes.  It is only possible to calculate one of the indices on the RBANS, from the selection of subtests administered, and this is Immediate Memory.  This index is in the abnormal range and at only the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> percentile for the normal population of [his] age. </p>

[Mr S] grossly failed this test, gaining an “impaired” score and demonstrated a severe inability to inhibit salient responses and to demonstrate normal response control.  This is a further sign that there may be some frontal lobe disturbance in [Mr S] and that he has difficulty in controlling his behaviour including the verbal responses which he produces, if these are not relatively routine and strongly contextualised.”</p>

He continued:</p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“However, this is part of the difficulty in reaching an opinion in this case.  From the evidence in my examination, and in the other opinions which I have reviewed, it seems that [Mr S] does have an adequate level of auditory comprehension.  He may require a little assistance in the way of the explanation of matters but he essentially has the ability to understand what is said to him within the normal range.  With respect to his ability to retain relevant information, it is clear that [he] has a severe impairment of his verbal memory.  It has generally been accepted, as the present examination provides clear evidence, that [his] memory abilities are very impaired.  Without assistance [his] memory problems would be sufficient to result in an inability to exercise mental capacity, but if [he] were to be given an adequate level of assistance such as having information recorded in a way which would enable him to read it, or listen to it, then his memory deficit might not be a bar to his being able to exercise capacity.  Nevertheless, this is a difficult area and should be carefully borne in mind in allowing [Mr S] to exercise capacity on his own behalf. Unless very effective supports were provided to him to circumvent his memory deficit, then he would not be effectively able to exercise capacity. [Mr S] is clearly able to express a decision which he has reached. The problem therefore centres around whether [he] is able to weigh matters in the balance and reach a decision.  This is usually the most contentious element of the functional test. Because an individual is not required to make a prudent decision, or one which others would regard as in his best interests, then it can be very difficult to decide whether relevant information has been weighed in the balance in reaching a decision.  This is a source of frequent disagreement amongst psychiatrists, neuropsychiatrists, and psychologists. In general terms, it is my conclusion that [Mr S] is not able to weigh matters in the balance normally in order to reach a decision.  The evidence for this is his lack of orientation, and his inability to reason about novel questions even in an everyday context, such as is demonstrated by his Similarities and CET test results. He also has difficulties in control of his thinking as evidenced by Rule Shift and a problem in reasoning about quantities, and especially numerical quantities as evidenced by Arithmetic and also by the CET.  Although whether [he] can exercise mental capacity will be dependent upon a specific type of decision, in general the test results indicate that he lacks the cognitive abilities which enable him to weigh matters in the balance in a normal manner in order to reach a decision.  Even though [he] might receive all the possible assistance in enabling him to have the relevant information at hand, the fact that he is unable to normally engage in the process of reasoning about a decision results in the fact that in general he is likely to lack mental capacity.”</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">It is my opinion that [Mr S] does not have the capacity to make this decision.  This is for two reasons.  The first is that he has only an incomplete, partially incorrect, and limited understanding of the nature of the current proceedings. I asked him to tell me what the case was about and he told me that he thinks that his daughter has made a complaint, about the fact that [Mr S] was receiving too much attention from [Mrs D] and spending too much time with her.  He also told me that she is “not here for my money”. [Mr S] was unable to tell me any more about the current case. I then specifically asked him if he had made any gifts of money and the values of these gifts. He told me that he thought he might have made gifts to a total of “£200”. I asked [him] if he would be surprised to learn that he had made gifts totalling hundreds of thousands of pounds. He responded “yes, it would surprise me”. As will be discussed below, [he] was unable to demonstrate an adequate understanding of the effect of the current proceedings for himself, [Mrs D], or his daughters, whether the proceedings were to be continued, or not. It might be argued that [his] understanding of the proceedings could be assisted by extensive support being provided to him, so as to enable him to exercise capacity in this regard, but as will be already clear I do not consider that [he] retains the cognitive ability to reason about these matters even if he were given every possible support. </p>

If he is told that he has gifted all his assets but his bungalow and his pensions then he simply accepts this information without any apparent concern.  Specifically asked about the effect upon himself, [he] responded “Nothing. I just like doing it and I did it. I am neither depressed nor elated”. Asked upon his understanding of the likely effect upon [Mrs D] he told me that “I expect that she would be elated”.  Asked about the effect upon his daughters, [he] responded “They have accepted it”. [He] gave no evidence of understanding the wider consequences of transferring substantial sums of money either in terms of its effect upon his own future security and welfare, the likely impact it might have upon [Mrs D’s] life, or the impact which it could have for the future of his daughters.

He explained how he has his bungalow to live in and his retirement and state pensions and believes these are sufficient for his future needs.  I explained to [Mr S] the likely cost of residence in a care home, of a reasonable standard, and asked him how he could meet these charges.  He told me “I will just take pot luck”. I explained to him that the consequence might be that he found himself in very unsatisfactory accommodation which might not adequately meet his needs and he responded “I would accept it, even if it is not so good for myself”. [He] expressed the importance of having a “caring and sharing attitude” and his ambition that everyone should “live in amity and concord”. While no one could disagree with these ambitions, I am aware that before his recent medical difficulties, [he] showed very considerable concern about the provision for his future and that his daughters should equally provide for their own futures, and also that he currently constantly telephones his daughter with complaints about his care and concerns about whether his care is being effectively provided. There does seem to be evidence that his current actual behaviour does not match his current expressed beliefs. In my view this is further evidence that [he] is unable to reason about his situation in a normal fashion and therefore not capable of weighing matters in the balance to reach a decision and that he therefore lacks mental capacity with regard to relevant decisions.</p>

Mr Marshall suggested at one stage in his cross-examination of Professor Howard that, once he had formed his original clinical judgment of Mr S’s capacity and expressed it in his second report, he did not consider the question afresh in his third and fourth reports, and they were almost bound to be consistent with his first judgment.  Professor Howard disagreed, and said that he would have been ready to change his view if, for example, he had found that Mr S’s frontal lobe functions were seriously impaired.

Thus he accepted that it would have been helpful if he had somewhere made specific reference to the four requirements in section 3(1) of the 2005 Act.  He agreed that the question of capacity is both decision specific and time specific, and accepted, with an apology to the court, that he had nowhere identified the specific decision by Mr S which he was being asked to evaluate.  Although he was familiar with giving expert evidence, having done so about eight or nine times before, he had taken no steps to seek fuller instructions for his second report than the brief email sent to him by Hunters.  This meant, for example, that he had never read the particulars of claim in the Chancery proceedings, or (I infer) the defence.  Indeed, it turned out that he had never read the particulars of claim before they were shown to him in the witness box.  Under some pressure from counsel, Professor Howard agreed that his understanding of the nature of the claim was very limited when he saw Mr S in June 2009.  He did not know the number of cheques which had been written by Mr S in favour of Mrs D, nor (at that stage) did he know the amount of the largest single cheque.  All that he had established in his discussion with Mr S on that occasion was that the gifts had amounted to “several hundred thousand pounds”, which he agreed could have meant little more than £200,000. </p>

That may be so, but it seems clear to me that Professor Howard’s understanding of the nature of the case and the sums involved was necessarily vague and imprecise when he interviewed Mr S and subsequently prepared his second report.  It must be remembered, in this context, that his first report in April 2008 had been prepared some nine months before the Chancery proceedings were begun in January 2009. He knew, because Hunters had told him, that the claim was one to recover the gifts on grounds of undue influence, but he accepted that in his conversation with Mr S he did not discuss the question of undue influence, and what it might mean, at all.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the next section of his cross-examination, Professor Howard accepted that he did not know in June 2009 what proportion of his assets Mr S had given away.  All he knew was that Mr S had disposed of practically all his liquid assets, and that the assets which he continued to own were his home and his pensions.  He therefore did not know that the total amount of the gifts was almost exactly double the value of his home.  Thus, when he asked Mr S how he would divide a fortune of £1 million between Mrs D and his daughters, and was told that he would want to leave Mrs D £500,000, he did not appreciate the significant difference between this example (where Mrs D would receive twice the amount each daughter received) and what actually happened (where Mrs D was given approximately four times the amount he will be able to leave to each daughter).

He said a little later that another way of testing a patient’s capacity is to make a more general assessment of his ability to reason in discussions and arguments with him about other things.  Professor Howard had made such an assessment on the basis of his discussions with Mr S about such matters as the progress of his career, his relationship with his wife, and ethnic tensions in Fiji.  These discussions showed, in his view, that “the hardware for reasoning” was present.</p>

More generally, he agreed that his approach was “pretty broad brush”, and acknowledged that Professor Beaumont was the expert in the administration of standardised tests.

I comment that this is correct, but there is still no indication in Professor Howard’s second report that he supplied this information to Mr S, or ensured that he understood it.  On the subject of memory, Professor Howard agreed that there is a distinction between working or short-term memory on the one hand and longer term or semantic memory on the other hand.  He said that Mr S’s semantic memory was “very, very poor”, and that this could result from difficulty either in posting information to the semantic memory or in its retrieval, or from a combination of both causes. He said that in his opinion Mr S could hold information in his working memory “for a period of up to a couple of minutes”, but beyond then he would lose it because of inability to put it into his semantic memory.  In addition, if he was distracted by being given other things to hold in his working memory, that would displace the information he was already holding.  </p>

At an early stage, Mr Staunton asked him whether, on the assumption that all of the factual observations in Professor Howard’s third report were accurate, this would show that Mr S’s ability to reason was well preserved.  Professor Beaumont disagreed, for two reasons.  First, there was further and more valid evidence about Mr S’s reasoning which was relevant to the issue, and was not taken into account in this report, and, secondly, Professor Howard had failed to appreciate the degree to which Mr S “gives relatively automatic answers in a social context”.  Enlarging on this second point, Professor Beaumont said this:</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“I think that with respect to the capacity for reflection, when you ask certain questions of [Mr S] he has fairly routine answers which spring from him rather readily.  In fact he is rather repetitive in the statements that he makes. You cannot necessarily accept uncritically the idea that this represents high level reasoning on [his] part.  It is in some sense an automatic habitual response which he is able to produce.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.50in">Professor Beaumont went on to say that recognition of this tendency is a matter of clinical judgment, but Mr S was extremely repetitive in the limited set of responses which he gave under questioning or in general conversation.

He did not seek to disagree in any way with Professor Howard’s clinical opinion, but pointed out that in one of the tests administered by Professor Howard (letter fluency) he had allowed proper nouns as valid responses, although it was normal to disallow them, and if the proper nouns were disregarded Mr S’s response would no longer fall within the normal range. With regard to the impact of severe memory impairment on the tests applied by psychologists, he said that it could not be entirely eliminated, but the tests were constructed in a way which either minimised its impact on performance, or else specifically recognised and incorporated it.  So, for example, within the WAIS test there were a number of separate indices, one of which was for working memory, which could be scored separately, and would allow performance in other areas of intellectual ability to be assessed without contamination by memory loss. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In relation to the “similarities and differences” test, Professor Beaumont thought, rather unfairly in my view, that the answers given by Mr S to Professor Howard had been “concrete” responses describing the objects rather than linking them at a higher level of abstraction.  However, he did not question Professor Howard’s findings or his clinical ability. Professor Beaumont attributed the difference between his conclusions and those of Professor Howard mainly to the different nature of the tests that they carried out, but also to the rather different ways in which they interpreted Mr S’s “natural discourse and his natural interaction”.  Unsurprisingly, Professor Beaumont preferred the tests used by his own profession, which he felt provided “a more valid way” to determine the issues.  In relation to the second difference, Professor Beaumont very fairly noted that Professor Howard had had the opportunity to discuss a wide range of topics with Mr S, over a long period, whereas his own priority had been to administer a number of formal tests, which very much restricted the time available for more general conversation.  Nevertheless, when he did discuss general matters with Mr S, and in particular when he put to him the same questions that Mr S had considered with Professor Howard, he found that Mr S provided a much more restricted range of answers than when Professor Howard had interviewed him.  At this point, Professor Beaumont returned to the theme that Mr S has a number of set phrases which he tends to use habitually, such as “I did what I did and that’s an end of it”, which Mr S had said to him a number of times.  When asked what he concluded from this, Professor Beaumont replied:</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“What I conclude is that, as with many patients who have these kinds of executive disorders and problems with reasoning, is that they fall back on relatively stereotyped social speech and interaction. In fact my view may be partly coloured by the fact that in my hospital job I work with clients who have extremely severe and profound brain injury … Now, I am not suggesting that is the case for [Mr S], but he is on the road to that which is what one commonly sees in dementias of the kind that [he] has.  Because he has difficulties with his cognition he falls back on a relatively restricted range of comments and remarks and responses which he makes, which are acceptable in the situation but are not … freely reasoned in the way that a normal intact individual would do.”</p>

It may be a symptom of such damage that a person becomes indifferent about his own future, and becomes “relatively emotionally flat”. When it was put to him that this might simply reflect Mr S’s established character, Professor Beaumont replied that it would if there were a lifetime history of Mr S acting in this way, but in the absence of any clear evidence about his previous character and personality the probability was, in his view, that this behaviour should be attributed to an abnormality of the frontal lobes.  It was, however, impossible to know which aspects of the frontal lobes had been affected, because there had been no physical imaging or accurate neurological examination of Mr S in the recent past. </p>

Professor Beaumont had two answers to this.  First, he made it clear that his reference to a severe degree of disability reflected the fact that Mr S had started off as a very able individual.  So a person of superior ability, like Mr S, would only have to fall to low average to have a severe deficit.  Secondly, however, Mr S’s performance was in some respects not merely in the low average range, but actually abnormal. In this context Professor Beaumont drew a distinction between Mr S’s preserved skills, which he could still employ to good effect, and his reasoning about novel situations, in which he was in Professor Beaumont’s view severely impaired.  In this connection, he did not think that there was anything novel about Mr S’s consideration of the role of God in the Haiti earthquake.  His reflections were of a commonplace nature, and probably drew on his premorbid experience.  In relation to the three scenarios which Mr S had discussed with Professor Howard, Professor Beaumont again disagreed that these were truly novel situations, because Mr S had already discussed the issues with Professor Howard before the specific scenarios were put to him.  In other words, he had been primed about the topic.</p>

A little later, he said that in his view the results obtained by psychologists and neuropsychologists constituted scientific data and were not merely matters of opinion.

The first rule, written in large print on a card to which the patient can refer, is: “Say yes to red and no to black”. They then go through the booklet, as slowly as the patient wishes.  On this first test, Mr S made no mistakes at all.  The rule is then changed, and another card is placed before the patient which now says: “If the card is the same colour as the last one say “yes”, if not say “no”.”  On this second test, Mr S made 10 mistakes, whereas a normal performance would allow only 2 or 3.  Professor Beaumont was asked whether he was satisfied that Mr S had been able to read the print on the second card.  Although Mr Staunton pressed him on this point at some length, I am satisfied that Mr S was able to read the card, and that somebody of Professor Beaumont’s clinical experience would have noticed if he was not.</p>

Professor Beaumont disagreed, and said that a person with severe frontal lobe damage would often make consistent decisions based upon quite trivial criteria.  He then gave a hypothetical example related to the present case.  If the only thing that made sense to Mr S was that he did not want the embarrassment of Mrs D losing the money, that would always lead him to produce the same response.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Dr Barker accepted that some reasoning was to be found in the views expressed by Mr S, but remained firmly of the view that he lacked capacity to decide whether the Chancery proceedings should be continued.  He naturally placed considerable emphasis on the wildly conflicting, and contradictory, statements that Mr S had made during their interview about the amounts which he had given to Mrs D and the value of his assets. He also stressed his apparent inability to understand simple fractions or proportions, and the way in which Mr S appeared to react with equanimity whether he thought that the amount he had given was a matter of a few hundred pounds or between £150,000 and £200,000. He added that Mr S sometimes said he was surprised about figures, but it never really seemed to register with him. He described the self-contradictions by Mr S within the space of a few minutes, or even seconds, as astonishing, and thought that there was evidence of impairment in his working memory as well as his long term memory.</p>

The picture was not black and white, and a balanced overall assessment had to be made.  </p>

He agreed that the letters exhibited to R’s witness statement were incomplete, and that apart from the letter addressed to R it was unclear who the recipients were; but he stood by the view which he had expressed, and took the view (reasonably in my opinion) that the keen interest which he then took in his daughter’s financial affairs naturally suggested that he would then have taken a similar attitude to his own affairs. </p>

Dr Barker said that he met many old people who thought like that, and religious views of this nature were often the product of long-embedded beliefs rather than a conscious process of reasoning.  With regard to his possible future needs for care, Dr Barker doubted whether Mr S was really able to evaluate the position, and whether he was really aware quite how basic the level of care was in some homes that he (Dr Barker) had seen.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Marshall also explored with Dr Barker certain other inconsistencies in the views which Mr S had expressed.  For example, Mr S had said to Dr Barker that it would be R’s responsibility to make provision for his future care, and if there was any shortfall she would see to it.  By way of contrast, Mr S told Professor Beaumont six months later that he would just take pot luck, and that he would accept it even if he found himself in very unsatisfactory accommodation.  Dr Barker agreed that there was an inconsistency, although he thought that one could not conclude very much from it.  He also agreed that there was an apparent inconsistency between Mr S’s statement to Professor Beaumont (recorded in his notes, not his report) that he was “not a religious man” and the discussion which he had had with Professor Howard in January 2010.  Dr Barker commented that this was curious, because religious beliefs tend to persist over time. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In conclusion, Mr Marshall referred Dr Barker to section 3 of the 2005 Act and asked whether his conclusion was based more on lack of understanding of the relevant information or on inability to use or weigh that information as part of the decision-making process. Dr Barker replied that he was satisfied that Mr S lacked capacity on the latter ground.  He was uncertain whether he also lacked capacity on the former ground, although he thought that his understanding was also impaired.  Mr Staunton explored this point a little further with Dr Barker in re-examination, which led him to express the view that, on balance, he considered that Mr S was probably unable to understand the relevant information.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I begin with the question whether Mr S is able to understand the information relevant to the decision which has to be made.  I have already discussed the nature of that decision in paragraphs 42 to 47 above, and concluded that Mr S must be able to understand, as a minimum, the nature and extent of the relationship of trust and confidence which he arguably reposed in Mrs D, the extent to which it may be said that his gifts to her cannot readily be accounted for by ordinary motives, and the general nature of the evidential burden resting on her to rebut any presumption of undue influence which might have arisen. I have also held that, since her relationship with him is still subsisting, the court will need to scrutinise with particular care whether Mr S is able to stand back from the impugned transactions with sufficient detachment truly to understand the nature of the claim.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">If I have correctly identified the nature of the decision to be made, and the information that Mr S would need to understand in order to make it, it seems clear to me that he lacks the necessary capacity to do so.  I agree with Professor Beaumont’s assessment in paragraph 4.4A of his report that Mr S “has only an incomplete, partially incorrect, and limited understanding of the nature of the current proceedings”. In particular, he has little understanding of the value of money, and without prompting he has no idea at all of the size of the gifts which he made to Mrs D. At times he will hazard the view that he gave her only  a few hundred pounds, but at other times he will suggest a figure ten or even a hundred times larger, and he is also prone to contradict himself within a very short space of time about the amount of the gifts, without any apparent awareness of the disparity or any recollection of what he has just said: see, for example, Dr Powell’s report  (paragraphs 51-2 above) and Dr Barker’s report at paragraphs 2.2.9 and 2.2.14. In cross-examination Dr Barker described these disparities and contradictions as “staggering” and “remarkable”. I agree.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus at the most basic level Mr S has no understanding of the amounts of money at stake unless he is told what they are. Nor can he explain, except in the most general terms, why he wished to make the gifts, or why he thinks that there might be a valid claim to recover them.  In principle, these deficiencies could be made good by the provision of the necessary information to him in simple language; but even then I do not think that he could retain the information in his mind for long enough to assimilate and make use of it. In view of the profound impairment of his semantic memory, the retention would have to be in his short term memory alone.  But in the light of the tendency to self-contradiction which I have already noted, and Dr Barker’s opinion that there may also be a clinical impairment of Mr S’s short term memory, I have no confidence that he would be able to retain the necessary information for long enough to understand it in any meaningful sense.  As I have already said, the decision is a complex one which requires a good deal of detailed information and self-awareness.  I was struck in this context by a comment made by Professor Howard in re-examination, when he said he thought Mr S could “hold information in his working memory for a period of up to a couple of minutes, but beyond that period, because he is not able to put it in to his semantic memory, he loses it”. In my judgment a period of two minutes at the most cannot possibly be long enough for a proper understanding of all the information relevant to the decision, let alone for an evaluation of the issues in the Chancery proceedings.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A related issue is whether Mr S’s mental impairment is confined to his severe memory loss, or whether it extends more widely.  In my judgment Dr Barker performed a valuable service by drawing attention to the possibility that Mr S may be suffering from damage to the frontal lobe of his brain, and pointing out that symptoms of such damage “are often clinically overlooked because they are more complex to elicit”.  The relatively simple tests which he administered clearly indicated to him a significant degree of frontal lobe abnormality: see in particular paragraph 3.9 of his report.  This indication was then reinforced by some of the tests performed by Professor Beaumont: see paragraph 4.2 of his report, where he says that Mr S’s performance on the Semantic Fluency subtest of RBANS was “possibly associated with some abnormality of his frontal lobes”, and that his performance on the Rule Shift test was “a further sign that there may be some frontal lobe disturbance”.  Against this I must set the evidence of Professor Howard’s third report, where he concluded that Mr S’s frontal lobe functioning fell within the normal range.  The evidence is inconclusive, but on balance I incline to the view that Mr S does suffer from a significant frontal lobe impairment in addition to his profound memory loss. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Before I leave the question of Mr S’s understanding of the relevant information, I need to say a little more about Professor Howard’s reports.  In his second report, he addressed the question whether the Chancery proceedings should have been issued.  As a preliminary comment, it should be noted that this is not quite the same as the question whether they should now be continued, although rather surprisingly Professor Howard seemed unable to appreciate the distinction between the two questions when it was put to him in cross-examination.  In that report, he expressed the opinion that, although Mr S’s memory was extremely poor, if prompted “he quickly recognises the facts and issues involved”.  Professor Howard went on to say that, with prompting, Mr S could recall the gifts and his reasons for making them, the fact that R was trying to recover the money, and the existence of the Chancery proceedings. However, it emerged from Mr Marshall’s skilful cross-examination that this opinion was based on only a superficial acquaintance with the case on the part of Professor Howard, which he readily acknowledged. I have already referred to the relevant passages in his cross-examination, and I will not repeat them.  It is, in my judgment, a fair criticism to say that Professor Howard should not have expressed a clear opinion in these terms without also making clear the limited nature of his own understanding of the facts and issues, and the precise steps which he had taken to remind or inform Mr S about them.  A related, and equally valid, criticism is that he failed to comply with the mandatory requirement in the Practice Direction to Part 15 of the Court of Protection Rules 2005 to include in his report “a statement setting out the substance of all facts and instructions given to [him] which are material to the opinions expressed in the report or upon which those opinions are based”.  An acceptable alternative, as the Practice Direction makes clear, would have been to annex his instructions in so far as they were in writing. None of these elementary steps was taken, and the result (unintended I am sure, but nevertheless potentially very worrying) is that the report rests on a much flimsier foundation than a reading of it would naturally suggest.  The rules are there for a good reason, and if they are not complied with a report, even from the most eminent of experts, is likely to lack the transparency and objectivity which the court rightly insists upon in expert evidence.  I do not wish to be too critical, because the report appears to have been produced under some time pressure (although I must say it is not clear to me what the urgency was), and because Professor Howard and Hunters may have thought of it essentially as a supplement to the first report which he had produced in April 2008.  Nevertheless, I have to say that there is substance in at least some of the severe criticisms of this report which Mr Marshall advanced in his closing submissions. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I am afraid that Professor Howard’s third and fourth reports are also open to some criticisms of a similar nature.  I have already referred to the unsatisfactory way in which they were produced, apparently on the basis of oral instructions given at conferences with counsel, and without prior authority from the court. As before, there is only a most perfunctory statement of the nature of those instructions in the body of the reports, and no proper statement of the materials upon which they were based.  The overall result of these deficiencies is that I have had to treat Professor Howard’s evidence with considerably more reserve than would normally be the case. I make it clear, however, that I do not question his personal integrity or good faith in any way, I fully accept the accuracy of his record of what Mr S said to him during their interviews, and I have the greatest respect for his skill and experience as a clinical psychiatrist.  It is precisely for those reasons that I have found this a difficult and worrying case.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I now turn to the question whether Mr S is able to use or weigh the relevant information.  In view of the conclusion which I have already reached about his inability to understand the information, I can deal with this question comparatively briefly.  All of the matters which I have already mentioned on the issue of understanding apply, with equal or greater force, to the question whether he is able to use or weigh the relevant information as part of the decision-making process.  In addition, I have the clear and firm evidence of both Professor Beaumont and Dr Barker that Mr S cannot satisfy this requirement, even on the assumption that he does understand the relevant information.  Their evidence on this part of the case was not significantly shaken in cross-examination, and I have the added comfort of knowing that they agree in their conclusion although they approach it from the perspective of their different disciplines as a psychologist and a psychiatrist. I do not wish to express any view on the question whether the avowedly scientific tests administered by a psychologist have intrinsically greater value than the bedside tests and clinical insights of a psychiatrist.  Both professions have much to contribute when the subject matter is something as profound and mysterious as the workings of the human brain.  For present purposes, the important point is that both Professor Beaumont and Dr Barker are in agreement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The high-water mark of the case for Mrs D is, I think, to be found in Professor Howard’s fourth report, and in his record of Mr S’s responses to the three scenarios which Professor Howard put to him.  There is no doubt that these responses show at least some ability to reason and some appreciation of the likely consequences for the three protagonists in each situation.  This impression is reinforced by the clarity with which Mr S is still able to express himself and his sophisticated use of language.  Moreover, it is a record of an interview which took place as recently as 10 March of this year.  In his closing submissions Mr Staunton rightly emphasised these passages, and submitted that they provide cogent evidence of Mr S’s ability to consider and make decisions and thus provide a solid foundation for Professor Howard’s conclusion. Furthermore, some of the deficiencies which I have noted in Professor Howard’s second report had by now been made good, because Hunters had provided him with an accurate summary of Mr S’s financial position and Professor Howard expressly says that he explained this to Mr S. Nevertheless, it should be noted that even at this stage Professor Howard had still not read the statements of case, and his appreciation of the issues in the Chancery proceedings may therefore still have been as limited as he acknowledges it to have been the previous June.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">If this were the only evidence in the case, it might have been sufficient to persuade me that the challenge to Mr S’s capacity should fail.  However, it is only part of the total evidence, albeit a very important part, and I have to reach my conclusion on the basis of an evaluation of the evidence as a whole. For the reasons which I have already given, I consider that there are strong reasons for concluding that Mr S lacks the requisite capacity to use or weigh the relevant information.  Although Professor Howard’s fourth report has caused me to think long and hard about the soundness of that conclusion, it has not caused me to change my mind.  There are a number of reasons for this. First, and perhaps most importantly, although Professor Howard gave Mr S details of his finances, there is no indication that he gave him any new or fuller explanation of the issues involved in the Chancery proceedings. Indeed, it is most unlikely that he did so, because the body of the report is confined to dealing with the five specific questions listed in my order of 20 October 2009, and at the end of the report Professor Howard describes the assistance which he gave to Mr S as “reminding him of the size of the gifts made to [Mrs D] and the presence and extent of his other assets and sources of income”.  This strongly suggests that the assistance was confined to financial matters, in which case Mr S still lacked much of the basic information which he needed to evaluate. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, I am struck, like Dr Barker and Professor Beaumont, by the stark contrast between the resigned and fatalistic attitude shown in Mr S’s responses to Professor Howard and the keen and well-informed interest in financial matters which he had shown when writing to his daughter in 2000.  It is possible that his attitudes to money and financial security have changed over the last decade, but it seems to me far more likely that his current fatalism is a reflection of his mental deterioration. In particular, I am very doubtful whether he has any true understanding of the difference that £550,000 might make to his ability to end his life in reasonable comfort and congenial surroundings if he needs to go into a care home. It is one thing to accept, in the abstract, that he would take things as they came with equanimity. It is another thing to appreciate the true cost of future care, the period for which it might be necessary, and the contrast between first class care homes and the type of inferior accommodation with which Dr Barker, for one, is all too familiar.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, I think there is force in Professor Beaumont’s observation that Mr S tends to have recourse to stock responses, that he often fails to offer an explanation for his stated position, and that his reactions are not those of a person of ordinary prudence.  None of these points is more than an indicator, and I am of course well aware of the statutory principle that a decision is not necessarily made without capacity merely because it is an unwise one (see paragraph 39 above).  Nevertheless, in the context of all the other evidence in the case I think that the probable explanation for these features of Mr S’s current behaviour is that the deterioration in his mental faculties has left him unable to reason his way to a conclusion in a novel situation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For all these reasons I am satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that Mr S is unable to make the decision whether or not to continue the Chancery proceedings (or, if it becomes relevant, to settle them), because in terms of section 3(1) of the 2005 Act he is unable (a) to understand the information relevant to the decision, (b) to retain that information, or (c) to use or weigh the information as part of the process of making the decision.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This is not a conclusion which I reach with any pleasure.  The philosophy of the 2005 Act is clearly that patients should, as far as possible, be able to make decisions for themselves; and I have little doubt that my decision will, at least in the short term, bring nothing but unhappiness to Mr S.  I end by expressing the hope that, in deciding on the future conduct of the Chancery proceedings, R will have full regard to her father’s wishes and feelings, and to the comfort and support that Mrs D provided to him at a time when he was still estranged from both his daughters. A trial of the action is likely to be a painful and damaging experience for all concerned, and I repeat my hope that the parties will, even now, be able to come to a settlement. I would add that, if the settlement were one that were relatively generous to Mrs D, that would surely accord with Mr S’s wishes, and the court would probably need little persuasion to approve it on his behalf.</p>
