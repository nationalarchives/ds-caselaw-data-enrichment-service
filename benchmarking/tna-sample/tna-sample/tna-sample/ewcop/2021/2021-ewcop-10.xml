	    <p style="margin-left:0.52in;margin-right:0.03in">UR was born in Poland in February 1952. She has had a rich and interesting life, but that has been lived, for some time now, in the shadow of a persistent delusional disorder and what is described as a comorbid depression. One aspect of URâs general psychological presentation is a somatoform pain disorder which means that sometimes UR believes she has serious pain in her limbs for which there is no actual pathology. Sometimes, in consequence of this condition, she refuses to eat and drink. There have been periods where she has declined to make any effort to walk, believing her legs require amputation. It is often necessary, to maintain her general health, for nutrition, hydration and medication to be provided by way of a PEG tube. It was this issue that first led to the case coming before me.  </p>

It is unnecessary to burden this judgment with those declarations. The case came before me again, however, in relation to questions concerning where UR should live and, specifically as to whether UR should remain in her care home or return to live with and be cared for by her family in Poland. The application proceeded as a challenge to the standard authorisation granted by the Local Authority pursuant to section 21A of the MCA 2005 as regards the best interests qualifying requirement, and specifically, whether that qualifying requirement was met.  </p>

The unwavering consistency of those wishes are striking and unambiguous. At a hearing in November 2020, the real issue identified by the Court and the parties became whether it was possible and in URâs best interests to achieve that which she plainly wanted. UR has a family who are  important to her. Perhaps most important is her sister, G. She is just a few years younger than UR. </p>

She was born in a large village called Ziezowice and has a manifestly strong sense of her identity as Polish. She studied Economics and achieved a diploma and worked in a bank. She  came to the UK in 1972 age 20, working as it happened in a nursing home and also as an au pair. There, and in the years that followed, she became a fluent English speaker, but she remains equally fluent in Polish and enjoys speaking in her own language.  </p>

The papers identify that UR settled in Derby because she had a relative there. I note that her relative was an uncle who became a Roman Catholic priest. That adds to the picture of a family whose faith is important to them. Although she and her husband have lived separately, they have not divorced, I suspect (though I cannot know) that that may be for religious reasons. It was between December 2002 â April 2020 that UR was admitted intermittently to hospital, something in the region of 11 times, exhibiting signs of severe depression and psychotic or somatic symptomology. Her presentation was alarming and frightening to those who observed it and also, I should add, to her.  </p>

The fact is that all life involves risk, and the young, the elderly and the vulnerable, are exposed to additional risks and to risks they are less well equipped than others to cope with.

She has chosen not to receive the vaccination. That is her right. As I observed, during the course of exchanges with counsel, she has survived in a care home throughout the course of the pandemic. Her health, her age and the circumstances in which she lives and, indeed, the country in which she lives has placed her at a very high risk at contracting the virus. Happily, she has not succumbed. It would be very sad if, in pursuance of this plan, she was exposed to and contracted the virus and in circumstances where she has been offered the vaccine. I am told by Miss Whittington that the social worker and the care home manager will undertake a sensitive piece of work with UR to help her better to understand how the vaccine could make her life so much safer and more secure. Whilst the work should concentrate on the very considerable benefits the vaccine offers, it should also scrutinise, with very great care, whether UR is truly capacitous on this issue.  </p>

Miss Sutton emphasises that UR plainly has a strong sense of her Polish identity. She has a very heightened sense of âfamilyâ but she no longer has any family in the UK. She has maintained her fluency in Polish. URâs strong Roman Catholic faith has a Polish facet to it. She has described how she enjoys the food from her home region. She plainly seeks the company of her family.  </p>

In the care home where she presently lives, she does not find much sustenance for those appetites. She considers, and this may well be correct, that most of the people with whom she shares the home suffer so profoundly from dementia that she feels unable to engage socially with them. The consequence of that is that she has retreated into a very confined world, driven by necessity rather than by design. That is not an environment that promotes her </p>

In making those observations I intend no criticism of the Local Authority or the CCG, both of whom have, I emphasise, gone to the most impressive lengths in this case to put a package of care together that enables UR to travel to Poland. None of the above should be taken as a criticism of the care home either. On the contrary, it is manifest that UR has received consistent and good quality care. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.52in;margin-right:0.03in">There were a number of issues that required to be addressed if the transition to Poland were to be possible. I say at once and for the avoidance of any ambiguity, I am satisfied that it is possible and in URâs best interests to move to live in Poland. I am extremely pleased that the professionals in this case, have been able to put a plan together which enables UR to fulfil her wish to return to where she regards as home. The remaining issues which need to be addressed include: an application to the Voivode (local governor); an application for an identity card; registration with health services. There is also a  sensible, practical plan to update URâs banking arrangements. The plans record the need to obtain a wheelchair for her journey; travel insurance; air fare etc. There have also been discussions with the family to provide a hospital style bed with suitable mattress. Careful and well thought through plans have been put in place to provide for URâs medication and supplements. I identify these small but important practical measures to illustrate the extent of thought and care that has been given to URâs plan.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.52in;margin-right:0.03in">One further issue that has arisen, as foreshadowed above, has been whether UR could leave this country to travel to Poland under the present regulations (Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (All Tiers) (England) Regulations 2020/1374). I have carefully considered schedule 3A(1) of the January 2021 Regulations. I have come to the clear and, I believe, uncontroversial conclusion that this move from the care home to her family in Poland, is not only incorporated within the identified âexceptionsâ specified in paragraph 2(2)(f)(iv) of the Regulations (see paras 30,31 and 33 above), but reflects both the spirt and objectives of the Regulations as a whole and in particular paragraph (5)(c) and (e), paragraph (7) and/or paragraph 13 of schedule 3A(1). It also requires to be emphasised that the exemptions set out in paragraph 2 of schedule 3A(1) are not intended to be exhaustive, nor could they be. Additionally, and for the avoidance of doubt, I consider that URâs carers have a âreasonable excuseâ to accompany her and are therefore validly âexemptâ from the regulations. In assisting UR to move to Poland her carers are operating âin a work capacityâ and are providing physical assistance to her as contemplated by paragraph 5(c). The care home manager and a nurse have indicated that they are prepared to travel with UR and to accompany her all the way home. They are also content to self-isolate or perhaps quarantine, if required, on their return. Their selfless and dedicated professionalism is profoundly impressive.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.52in;margin-right:0.03in">Although there are a number of outstanding practical matters, as I have highlighted above, I have very little hesitation in reaching the conclusion that, whilst the plan is not free from risk, it offers distinct and obvious advantages to UR. It broadens URâs social horizons, it returns her to her family, it relocates her to her homeland. Perhaps most importantly, as it is consistent with her clear and frequently expressed wishes, it guards her autonomy in the proactive way the MCA prescribes. It is not possible here, or in life generally to eradicate all risk. Perhaps a life without risk is not even desirable. Exercising personal autonomy frequently requires making choices.
