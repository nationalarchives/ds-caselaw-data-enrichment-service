	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">This application concerns C, who is a 27-year-old man with a wide range of interests. He enjoys participating in sports, he listens to music, particularly rap music and he is interested in history. I have been told that he regularly visits museums with his carers. C has been diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome (XXY syndrome). This is a genetic disorder that occurs in 1 in 660 men where the male has an additional X chromosome. Though men with XXY syndrome can live healthy lives, there are features of the syndrome which may impact on development. In C’s case, developmental delay and other social communication difficulties were noted when he was two years of age. The records show that C, as a child, preferred spending time on his own and avoided physical contact. C was first noted to speak at around 4 years of age. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">C’s parents were plainly assiduous in pursuing assessment for him. In 1998, he was assessed for an autistic spectrum condition at Alder Hey Hospital. The assessment took place over a period of six weeks, C was aged 4 at this point. Dr Peter Gerome, Consultant Paediatrician, diagnosed C with autistic spectrum disorder. It is an understatement to say that in the years that followed, C could be extremely challenging; his behaviour was sometimes aggressive and dangerous. In 2011, it was necessary for C to move out of his family home. I have no doubt at all, having read all the papers, that the move was unavoidable and in the best interests of both C and his family. The consequence, however, has been that C needs significant assistance with independent living and is likely to continue to do so. The package of support C receives requires the deprivation of his liberty and, since 2017, the Court of Protection has authorised the deprivation (see para 178 Schedule A1 Mental Capacity Act 2005, ‘MCA’). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">Between 2014 and 2017, C was detained in hospital, pursuant to the Mental Health Act 1983. C’s admission had become necessary as a result of a deterioration in his mental health and threats that he was articulating which were of a sexual nature. For accuracy, it is important that I record that the threats were never acted upon. Throughout the period of his admission, C received a range of medication, including antipsychotic treatment. He also participated in psychosexual, psychological, occupational and psychiatric therapies.  </p>

This is not a care home but a house suitable for three occupants and their carers. An agency is commissioned to provide a package of support to meet C’s needs. At C’s request, I met with him (remotely), and it struck me that C was happy and well- supported. Those who support C all agree.  </p>

He said that he wanted to be able to have sex and wished to know whether he could have contact with a sex worker. It was obvious that he had given this issue some thought. AB raised the matter with C’s social worker, and, in due course, these proceedings were commenced, by the Local Authority, to address the lawfulness of such contact.  </p>

Ms Chantler is a panel deputy and a solicitor, specialising in Court of Protection cases. The Professional Deputies Forum is a not for profit organisation, representing professional (solicitor) deputies and their support staff.  Members of the organisation currently represent approximately 50% of all property and affairs solicitor-appointed deputyships, an estimated 4,500 matters in total.  Ms Chantler was asked by Ms Philippa Curran, solicitor, and Ms Butler-Cole QC to obtain the views of its members regarding payment for sex services by property and affairs deputies on behalf of clients.  The purpose of this was to obtain an understanding of current practice. Although the matter may be considered a personal welfare issue, these services require payment and, as such, fall within the authority of a property and affairs deputy.  </p>

The focus here must be the protection of individual autonomy and an accompanying vigilance to ensure that the vulnerable are not exploited or placed at risk of harm.

If you are already a member of The Outsiders then this also qualifies you. You might wish to purchase a sexual service, but you don’t know what to expect or how to ask for things. Think – plan – then contact to book. Please treat the service providers advertising on this site with the same respect you would any other professional. They experience a lot of people wasting their time and can have a decreased tolerance if they think you are messing them around. Think how you would book a hair appointment and do this the same way. Read their profile thoroughly before making any initial contact. Check that they offer the services that you would like to try and that they are happy to work with the illness/disability/symptoms that you have. Check if they are happy to travel or not. There is no point contacting a provider and asking a load of questions that they have spent time and effort putting into their advert. They will probably consider you a timewaster and not engage. If you do not have a profile, then give the service provider information they need to know such as your living situation, where you would like to meet, your disability/symptoms etc. Do not talk or act in an abusive or threatening manner to service providers or other members. Do not talk sexually to a potential provider until you have met them and paid for a service. They are not there to talk to you for free. There are telephone sex chat or text lines available for that.

In this they are supported by Mr Allen, on behalf of the Local Authority. Ms Paterson, acting on behalf of the Secretary of State for Justice, who was joined as a party to the proceedings, contends that a construction of Section 39 which rendered lawful a carer’s assistance to C in securing the services of a sex worker, would be to go beyond the wording of the legislation and <span style="font-style:italic">“would amount to an amendment to the law, as opposed to an interpretation, be it purposive or Convention compliant”</span>. This, it is submitted, would be to <span style="font-style:italic">“encroach upon the role of the legislature or Parliamentary sovereignty”</span>. The CCG submit that the lawfulness of the care plan must be determined by the Court. Mr Karim QC and Ms Campbell, on behalf of the Clinical Commissioning Group, properly highlight that whilst every step should be taken to promote C’s personal autonomy, it is also important to protect him and those providing his care. Further, they emphasise that <span style="font-style:italic">“it is imperative any package of care is lawful so as not to place any carers liable to criminal prosecution”</span>.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">It is important to consider the philosophy and legislative purpose of the SOA 2003. Central to its objectives is a determination to establish a criminal legal framework which incorporated changes in society, and which reflected the reality that protection was required against crimes which either did not exist generations ago or were not sufficiently understood. The legislation seeks properly to emphasise the paramountcy of consent when sexual acts occur between adults. It emphasises the vulnerability of those in relationships predicated on trust, where the imbalance of power can be so stark as to render any sexual element inappropriate and, dependent on the circumstances, sufficient in and of itself to justify criminal sanction.  </p>

Though I have emphasised, in exchanges with counsel, the fundamental errors and dangers inherent in conflating the circumstances of vulnerable adults with children, it is notable for interpretive purposes only, that s 17 (which applies to children) uses identical wording, namely “intentionally causing” or “inciting” B to engage in sexual activity. Though only the latter provision, concerning children, is amended by the Bill, there is a clear continuity of legislative objective i.e. to protect those in relationships where there is an obvious imbalance of power. Whilst I note the thematic continuity here between the SOA 2003 and the Bill, I do not draw upon it as a tool for statutory construction.  </p>

Though this was undoubtedly, historically, motivated by a paternalistic desire to protect them, it had the countervailing consequence of dismantling their autonomy and failing to respect their fundamental human rights. In this sphere the legislation marks a significant shift. It is no longer the objective of the law to prevent people with mental disorders from having sexual relationships, rather it is to criminalise the exploitation and abuse of such adults by those with whom they are in a relationship of trust. As I have stated above, there is a similar regime, recognising the different but equal vulnerability of children, which seeks to afford them strengthened protection. </p>

There are many loving and dedicated people working in care; others, however, find the provision of care provides a unique opportunity to use those in their charge for their sexual gratification with little chance of discovery or effective redress.

We already have law in place that deals with certain caring relationships – those with mental patients. Many other countries have adopted law that criminalises inappropriate sexual relationships between carers and recipients of care. The Sexual Offences (Amendment) Bill 2000 applies this principle to 16 and 17-year-old children and certain adults in positions of trust and responsibility. In Chapter 5 we suggest that some family relationships should not be sexual. We thought that it should be possible to identify those relationships of care where any sexual element would be so wrong and in appropriate as to justify a criminal sanction.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">I was referred to the relevant case law. To use Ms Grahame’s own phrase, the approach of the criminal courts can properly be described as “robust”. Any <span style="color:#231F20">statutory offence which contemplates “causing” another person to commit an act, prohibited in law, emphasises that it should be done on express or implied authority and/or as a result of the exertion of control or influence over the person acting, see:</span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20"> Att Gen of Hong Kong v Tse Hung-lit [1986] A.C. 876, PC</span><span style="color:#231F20">. The criminal law is inclined, as Ms Grahame recognises, to regard “causation” as a “question of fact” to be addressed on the basis that the term should be given “its common sense meaning”, see: </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20">Price v Cromack [1975] 1 WLR 958; Alphacell Ltd v Woodward [1972] A.C. 824 HL</span><span style="color:#231F20">.</span> It follows that an overly legalistic insistence on a line of causation predicated on a “but for” test, is inconsistent with the far more pragmatic approach of the criminal law. I therefore approach the questions of causation and incitement, within s.39, as essentially a question of fact in which the words are given their common sense construction.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">In her skeleton argument, Ms Paterson traverses the evolution of the SOA 2003, both in the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee’s report and in the House of Lords. She notes that the ‘Explanatory Notes to the Act’ offer little assistance in respect of the interpretation of s. 39 generally and none in relation to “causing or inciting sexual activity”. It is argued that s. 39 when read in conjunction with the notes for section 10 (causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity) and section 17 (abuse of position of trust: causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity), reveal the identified mischief which the legislation is seeking to remedy. This, says Ms Paterson, requires <span style="font-style:italic">“the terms of the SOA 2003 to be interpreted through the prism of the protected aims of the legislation towards children and vulnerable adults, borne out of a recognition that the then existing law had failed to provide sufficient safeguards”</span>. This is really a general statement of policy. It is not, properly analysed, a direct engagement in the exercise of statutory construction. Indeed, Ms Paterson goes on to draw upon the Crown Prosecution Service’s guidance: Prostitution and Exploitation of Prostitutes, contending that this too might cast a light on what Parliament must have intended in selecting the wording of s. 39 SOA 2003.    </p>

Whilst it is no doubt desirable to encourage “routes out of prostitution” as a central tenet of CPS guidance, that is entirely different to asserting that prostitution is contrary to public policy. Parliament has chosen not to criminalise prostitution. In any event, none of this illuminates the proper construction of s. 39 SOA.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">The explanatory notes to Section 10 contain the words <span style="font-style:italic">“the incitement constitutes an offence whether or not the activity incited actually takes place. Whether or not the child consented to the activity caused or incited, or responds to the incitement, is irrelevant.”  </span>The explanatory notes contain no commentary on s. 39. Section 39 is concerned with adults with mental disorders, not with children. The two groups are entirely different and should always be recognised as such. To fail to do so would be to corrode our evolved and evolving understanding of the importance of respecting the autonomy of adults with learning disabilities. As Ms Paterson recognises, the above wording (from the explanatory notes to s. 10) if applied to s. 39 would suggest that “any action” by a carer which “in any way” prompts or triggers or might prompt or trigger sexual behaviour in a learning-disabled adult would fall within the contemplated ambit of s. 39. Moreover, s. 39 would apply whether the sexual behaviour in fact took place and irrespective of capacitous consent. The rigorous approach to s. 10 is intended to protect children. To superimpose it on adults who are assessed as having capacity to consent to sexual relations is actively to unpick the central objectives of the legislation. It is a reversion to paternalism.  </p>

It also delivers an outcome which is, as I have said, regressive. Additionally, it must be noted that it would deliver an unworkable result and thus could not be what Parliament intended. In circumstances where an established or married couple, as often happens, are assisted by carers to spend “private time” together, the carer would, on Ms Paterson’s construction, be guilty of a criminal offence. These arrangements are routinely and sensitively put in place and, where required, approved by the Court. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">Moreover, for the reasons that Ms Grahame analysed, if a carer is prosecuted in these circumstances for an offence deemed to be contrary to s. 39, it lets in the possibility that others who assist or participate with the carer (e.g. administrative staff, legal advisers, perhaps even the sex worker) might themselves commit an offence under the <span style="font-weight:bold">Serious Crimes Act 2007</span>, which is constructed to capture those intentionally encouraging or assisting crime. Thus, the outcome would be that legislation intending to protect the safety and promote the autonomy of the vulnerable would have become an instrument by which those very objectives would be subverted and in circumstances which could only be regarded as discriminatory. </p>

At its heart lies a realistic recognition of what is termed <span style="font-style:italic">“the diverse nature of prostitution and the different challenges in responding”</span>.

The permissive and enlightened approach both in the Code and in the ethos of the approach to policing has been pursued for circa 20 years. It is to be noted that a similar approach is deployed e.g. in Spain, Italy, Austria, Germany, Greece, and many other countries. The nature and extent of the regulations may vary in each jurisdiction, but, as in the UK, sex work or prostitution is not, in itself, illegal. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">Thus, properly analysed the position of the Secretary of State on this point becomes logically unsustainable. Whilst it is entirely understandable that he would not wish to be seen to act in a way which might be perceived as encouraging prostitution, the fact remains that the act is legal. The Secretary of State may not obstruct those who wish to participate in lawful transactions nor, logically those who wish to help them be they carers or otherwise. The progressive approach of either the CPS or the Police to the prosecution of sex workers, whose activities may take them outside the law, has no real bearing on what is, ultimately, a matter of statutory construction. The argument, on behalf of the Secretary of State, though it raises challenging ethical and moral issues, does not engage with what I must decide. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">Whilst it is entirely right to encourage policing and prosecuting in a way which is driven by a desire to protect the vulnerable and pursue those who exploit others, the Code goes no further. Neither, in my view, should this court. The Secretary of State adopts the philosophy of the Code, by parity of analysis, to extrapolate a moral obligation actively to discourage prostitution in all circumstances. Such an approach fails to recognise the autonomy of those involved in the sexual transaction and the fact that prostitution has not been criminalised. Neither the Secretary of State nor I have been charged with the responsibility of resolving the moral and ethical issues that are raised. Those are issues for the individuals themselves. Parliament has recognised that the State should retreat from this sexual arena. Both the Court and the Secretary of State are bound by the expressed will of Parliament. The only question, as I have set out above, is whether Parliament has expressed itself with sufficient clarity.  </p>

While the essential object of Article 8 is to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by the public authorities, it does not merely compel the State to abstain from such interference: in addition to this negative undertaking, there may be positive obligations inherent in effective respect for private or family life. These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves (see the X and Y v. the Netherlands judgment of 26 March 1985, Series A no. 91, p. 11, § 23, and the Stjerna v.

First, the circumstances must fall within the ambit of a Convention right. Secondly, the difference in treatment must have been on the ground of one of the characteristics listed in article 14 or “other status”. Thirdly, the claimant and the person who has been treated differently must be in analogous situations. Fourthly, objective justification for the different treatment will be lacking. It is not always easy to keep the third and the fourth elements entirely separate, and it is not uncommon to see judgments concentrate upon the question of justification, rather than upon whether the people in question are in analogous situations. Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead captured the point at para 3 of R (Carson) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2005] UKHL 37; [2006] 1 AC 173.

As Ms Butler-Cole points out, an individual who has physical disabilities and who needs assistance of carers to arrange access to sexual activity is likely to be treated differently.

Two sisters, who had lived together for many years, complained that when one of them died, the survivor would be required to pay inheritance tax on their home, whereas a surviving spouse or civil partner would not. A Chamber of the Strasbourg Court found, by four votes to three, that the difference in treatment was justified. A Grand Chamber found, by fifteen votes to two, that the siblings were not in an analogous situation to spouses or civil partners, first because consanguinity and affinity are different kinds of relationship, and secondly because of the legal consequences which the latter brings. But Judges Bratza and Björgvinsson, who concurred in the result, would have preferred the approach of the Chamber; and the two dissenting judges thought that the two sorts of couple were in an analogous situation. This suggests that, unless there are very obvious relevant differences between the two situations, it is better to concentrate on the reasons for the difference in treatment and whether they amount to an objective and reasonable justification. </span>

As I have foreshadowed above, I consider that the words of the statute, when given their obvious meaning and considered in the context of the objectives of the statute as a whole, reveal their purpose in a way which does not compromise C’s Article 8 rights. Accordingly, I am not required to enlist the aid of Section 3. Were it necessary to do so, I would have little difficulty in interpreting Section 39 SOA 2003 in a Convention compliant way. I consider the grain of the legislation would assist that exercise, for all the reasons I have set out above. In passing, it is instructive to note that where the Convention requires language to be construed in a particular way to achieve an identified purpose, the obligation is not displaced by the fact that the same phrases may have another meaning in a different statute, see: <span style="font-weight:bold">R (on the application of Hurst) v Northern District of London Coroner [2007] UKHL 13</span> at [52],<span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;color:#333333"> </span><span style="color:#333333">per Lord Brown of Eaton-Under-Heywood:</span></p>

The answer to it in my judgment is to be found, as the intervener argues, in the analogous field of European Community law where, pursuant to Marleasing SA v La Comercial Internacional de Alimentacion SA [1990] ECR I-4135, a similarly strong interpretive obligation is imposed on member states to construe domestic legislation whenever possible so as to produce compatibility with European Community law. The closeness of this analogy has been recognised by the House in Ghaidan v GodinMendoza [2004] 2 AC 557—see particularly Lord Steyn's opinion at para 45. Where the Marleasing approach applies, the interpretative effect it produces upon domestic legislation is strictly confined to those cases where, on their particular facts, the application of the domestic legislation in its ordinary meaning would produce a result incompatible with the relevant European Community legislation. In cases where no European Community rights would be infringed, the domestic legislation is to be construed and applied in the ordinary way. Thus in R v Secretary of State for Transport, Ex p Factortame Ltd [1990] 2 AC 85, Part II of the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 was to be disapplied in those cases where its operation would infringe directly effective European Community rights; but not otherwise. Similarly in Imperial Chemical Industries plc v Colmer (Inspector of Taxes)(No 2) [1999] 1 WLR 2035 the House, following a reference to the Court of Justice of the European Communities (Imperial Chemical Industries plc v Colmer [1999] 1 WLR 108), held that ICI remained bound by domestic legislation upon its ordinary meaning notwithstanding that in certain circumstances such a construction would be incompatible with European Community rights. This principle was again applied by the Court of Appeal in Gingi v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2002] 1 CMLR 587 where Arden LJ expressly approved the following passage from Bennion, Statutory Interpretation, 4th ed (2002), p1117: </span>

That decision will be for another day when a comprehensive risk assessment has been undertaken and a care plan devised which will illuminate whether and if so, how such a visit may be arranged. As is recognised, the matrix of risk in C’s present situation is likely to be very different from that which obtained in a psychotic episode he experienced as a young person.

That is something of a rarity in the Court of Protection and particularly in the past twelve months. Since I heard the arguments, the UK has been engaged in a further period of what has become known as ‘lockdown’. In this global public health crisis, human contact has been restricted to an unprecedented degree. It is self-evident that the nationally imposed prohibitions must extend to sexual contact, commercially arranged, between strangers. This has given me the luxury of being able to consider the matters raised by this application at greater length than would ordinarily have been available to me. Moreover, it struck a dissonant note, to my mind, to hand down a judgment such as this at the height of a protracted period of national social isolation.  </p>

I have taken some time in the above passages to set out some of the options and agencies that would be available to C. I have done this to give context to the application and in order that the submissions I have been hearing do not become artificially separated from the reality of the available options.

This essentially progressive legislation has been careful, in my judgement, to avoid constricting the life opportunities of those with learning disabilities or mental disorders. In contrast to earlier legislation it seeks to achieve protection of the vulnerable without resort to paternalism. The ambition of the Act is to empower, liberate and promote the autonomy of those with mental disorders. It signals a shift away from a regime which was recognised to be overly restrictive and not sufficiently understanding of the rights and liberties of those confronting life with mental disorders. Both the SOA and the Code for Crown Prosecutors (considered above at para 63) plainly take account of the UK’s obligations arising from international conventions. </p>

As such the Act is both promoting free and independent decision taking by adults with mental disabilities, whilst protecting them from harm in relationships where independent choices are occluded by an imbalance of power. It is tailored to promoting the right to enjoy a private life, it is not structured in a way that is intended to curtail it. In the past legislation endeavoured to prevent those with mental disorders from engaging in sexual relations. The SOA plots a different course. At risk of repetition, I would emphasise the duality of approach in the SOA, in effect striking a balance between protecting those with mental disorders whilst enabling independent choices, in this most important sphere of human interaction. It follows, of course, that such choices are not confined to those which might be characterised as good or virtuous but extend to those which may be regarded, by some, as morally distasteful or dubious. Protection from discrimination facilitates informed decision taking. Those decisions may be bad ones as well as good. This is the essence of autonomy.  </p>

He lacks capacity to make the practical arrangements involved in identifying a suitable and safe sex worker and is unable to negotiate the financial transaction. What is proposed is that C will be assisted in these arrangements by carers who are sympathetic and content to help him.

He reasons that his overall presentation, the challenges he faces in his general functioning (into which he has some insight) and the circumstances in which he lives, all strongly militate against his being able to find a girlfriend. He lacks the capacity to make informed decisions in his use of the internet. His use of the internet is therefore restricted and monitored. This too closes opportunities for social interaction. C makes the utilitarian calculation that if he is to experience sex, which he strongly wishes to do, he will have to pay for it. C has repeated his wishes to his carers consistently and cogently over the course of the last 3 years. I met with him, via a video conferencing platform. He understands that I am considering what the law permits and that should I come to a conclusion that the law will not stand in the way of carers who are willing and able to help C achieve his wishes, any plans will have to await greater progress in the battle against the pandemic. </p>

The provision is perhaps not drafted with pellucid clarity, but its objectives are identifiable. It is intended to signal unambiguous disapprobation of people employed in caring roles (i.e. care workers) who cause or incite sexual activity by a person for whom they are professionally responsible. The legislative objective is to criminalise a serious breach of trust and, as I have commented, attracts a significant custodial sentence. The words of the statute need to be given their natural and obvious meaning. They are intending to criminalise those in a position of authority and trust whose actions are calculated to repress the autonomy of those with a mental disorder, in the sphere of sexual relations. Section 39 is structured to protect vulnerable adults from others, not from themselves. It is concerned to reduce the risk of sexual exploitation, not to repress autonomous sexual expression.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">Though at risk of repetition, I reiterate that the proposals contemplated here strike me as being far removed from the identified mischief of the relevant provisions. To interpret them as encompassing the proposed actions of the care workers, requires both a distortion of the plain language of the statute and a subversion of the consistently reiterated objectives of the SOA itself. Indeed, given that the Act embraced an evolved understanding of the rights of people with learning disabilities and mental disorder, the more restrictive interpretation, suggested by Ms Paterson, would run entirely counter to its central philosophy. Ms Paterson, sensibly to my mind, recognises the force of the above. Instead, she concentrates her argument on general policy grounds, as I have set out. There is a logical paradox in the reasoning of the Secretary of State. He wishes to discourage prostitution, which many would think to be a laudable objective. Parliament, however, has recognised the futility of seeking to criminalise prostitution and, accordingly, it remains legal. Thus, the Secretary of State, in this instance, finds himself in the invidious position of trying to discourage, by guidelines and policy, that which the law allows. Where that discouragement has equal impact on society generally it may be a reasonable objective. Where it operates to restrict the autonomy of a particular group, as here, it cannot be justified. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">It follows that, having applied the primary principles of statutory construction to arrive at the above interpretation, it is entirely unnecessary for me to deploy Section 3 HRA 1998 in order to construe a legal meaning which is compatible with Convention rights, see:<span style="font-style:italic;color:#333333"> </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#333333">Ghaidan v Godin-Mendoza [2004] 2 AC 557</span><span style="color:#333333">. These domestic provisions are entirely consistent with the fundamental rights and freedoms protected by the ECHR. However, it is important to record I consider that had I been required to have recourse to Section 3, I would have had little hesitation in concluding that the Convention required the construction that I had already arrived at. Any other interpretation would, in my judgment, go entirely ‘against the grain’ of the SOA. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">Following the case of <span style="font-weight:bold">London Borough of Tower Hamlets v NB (consent to sex) [2019] EWCOP 27 </span>there was a good deal of misinformed commentary. That case also involved the rights of people with disorders of the mind to enjoy a sex life, where capacity to consent remained. Judges develop a phlegmatic response to inaccurate reporting but the impact on families can be profound and pervasive. At the heart of this case is a young man who faces many challenges in life and whose emotional security remains fragile. In due course I will have to consider whether it is in his best interests to pursue the course that he has set his mind on. As part of that evaluative exercise, I will have in mind that it will never be in C’s interest to put himself or others at risk. </p>
