	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The Court is concerned with EOA. EOA was born on 5 August 2001 and is therefore 19 years old. EOA and his twin brother D were removed from the care of their parents in December 2015 and were made the subject of full care orders on 21 June 2016, together with their two other siblings. They were removed from their parents' care as a result of ongoing concerns about the parents' treatment of the children, which included keeping them isolated from the rest of society, not allowing them to attend school or receive any medical treatment and subjecting them to extreme religious and anti-social indoctrination as well as emotional and physical abuse. Their parents played no part in the care proceedings and did not seek to have any contact with them; effectively they abandoned them. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">EOA and D were both placed together in a Local Authority foster placement. During the care proceedings psychological assessments of the brothers were undertaken and concluded that EOA might have a learning disability, autistic spectrum disorder and that he was very much under the influence of DOA. The assessments were tentative because EOA declined to engage to any great extent and that has remained a feature of his presentation ever since. On reaching his 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday DOA who was assessed to have capacity, unlike EOA left the foster placement on 5 August 2019 at 6.30am without EOA and his whereabouts are still currently unknown, although there has periodically been reports of sightings of him in the Bromley area. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In anticipation of EOA reaching the age of 18 on the 5 August 2019 on 23 July 2019 the Royal Borough of Greenwich ("the Local Authority") applied to the Family Division under the inherent Jurisdiction and to the Court of Protection for a personal welfare order in respect of EOA. The Local Authority initially sought the following declarations; (a) That EOA lacks capacity to litigate; (b) That EOA lacks capacity to make decisions about his care and treatment (c) That EOA lacks capacity to decide where he should live; (d) That it is in EOA's best interests for him to reside at a supported living placement identified by the Local Authority; (e) That the placement and care plan proposed by the Local Authority are lawful and in EOA's best interests. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Following the commencement of proceedings various Judges made interim orders in respect of EOA including interim declarations as to capacity. EOA case first came before me on 16 October 2019. He attended and spoke of his very strong desire to be free of court proceedings and his wish to make his own choices in relation to where he lived and with whom he spent his time, in particular his brother but also his wider family. On that occasion I decided that EOA should move to live from his foster placement in a residential placement. The nature of EOA’s life at that placement was such that it would amount to a deprivation of his liberty and I made further interim declarations and a deprivation of liberty order. </p>

An assessment early in 2020 concluded that EOA was unlikely to meet the diagnostic criteria for an autistic spectrum disorder rather than having a complex attachment history and learning difficulties which led to his local ASD service not agreeing to provide treatment.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">At that stage there were some concerns about EOA’s placement and in particular there was considerable uncertainty as to the nature of the care and treatment that would best this meet EOA’s welfare needs given the complex interweaving of issues relating to the impact of his upbringing, his possible learning disability and his possible autism. Although the issue of EOA’s capacity to make decisions about his care and support and where he should live had been made, the determination of what was in his best interests and in particular whether a deprivation of liberty order should be authorised made remained very much alive. There has been some debate in the course of these proceedings as to how one should characterise or describe EOA’s experience of life in his family up until his removal into care. Neglect, radicalisation, coercion and control, undue influence and duress have all featured, but it seems to me that the phrase proposed by Dr Layton and adopted most recently by Dr Dubrow- Marshall, namely indoctrination seems the best fit for the totality of EOA’s experience in the family environment provided by mother and father. </p>

In relation to T &amp; P who were not aligned to the doctrine but rather were hostile to it they also accepted that he lacked capacity due to his fixed thinking in relation to them and his inability to weigh information. Finally, in relation to strangers they accepted Dr Layton’s formulation that currently EOA was unable to weigh information relevant to the risk of interactions with strangers and his lack of recognition that they may have interest adverse to his or that they were seeking to take advantage.

It was accepted by the Local Authority that any deprivation of liberty order did not need to authorise any physical restraint of EOA as not having been required over the 15 months old that he had resided at TOA. An unexpected emergency which arose which might require the use of physical restraint would be covered by the provisions of the Mental Capacity Act without express incorporation into the order. The Local Authority submit this order should be made for a period of 12 months running from the date that the court finally approves the finalised care, support and treatment plan. They submit that those around EOA and importantly EOA himself needs to be free of the prospect of further court hearings in order for the implementation of the plan to gain the best foothold. Imminent court proceedings are a distraction both for those caring for EOA and for EOA. The process is likely to be a slow one in any event and so a review in 12 months would provide a timescale which both enabled those concerned to focus on the work and also for the work to have a reasonable period within which to take effect. </p>

Mr Brownhill submitted that on the facts of this particular case, such an approach is permitted by the decision of the Court of Appeal in PC &amp; Anor v City of York Council [2013] EWCA Civ 478 at paragraph 35 which supports the court focussing (where the facts permit it) on the actual decision to be made rather than a notional or generic decision . The declarations it was submitted should be tailored to reflect the particular issues with decision-making in relation to each of the three categories. In relation to family members who subscribe to the doctrine the official solicitor accepted that it to enable EOA to make a competitor's decision he would need to understand and to weigh the fact that he would be subject to undue influence, the pernicious effects of exposure to the doctrine and the fact that his family members might have adverse interests to his. In relation to family members who did not subscribe to the doctrine he would need to be able to understand the issues relating to the family dynamic and the doctrinal differences. In relation to strangers the classic formulation set out in the Jurisprudence would be appropriate, and, in this regard, he would need to be able to recognise the risk of third parties posed and the fact they may have their own adverse interests. In this regard the Official Solicitor submitted that the effect of section 1 (3) was relevant because the work in order to give him capacity in relation to strangers has not been undertaken and so all practicable steps to help him to make a capacitous decision had not been taken and thus the appropriate declaration is an interim order rather than a final declaration.  </p>

Their position also adapted to recognise that whilst generic issues of internet usage and social media could properly be fitted within the jurisprudence in this field that if one considered the particular decision in relation to use of social media and the Internet in relation to contact with family members it could not properly be distinguished from the issues of EOA's capacity to have contact with them. The Official Solicitor thus submitted that an interim declaration was appropriate in relation to generic Internet and social media issues to enable support to be given to EOA to enable him to make capacitors decisions in this regard by giving him information as to the risks of exploitation by third parties via the Internet. In relation to issues of internet and social media use for the purposes of contact they accepted that a final declaration could properly be made but that it should be made in the domain of contact making specific reference to social media and Internet in that regard.  </p>

It now required to be reduced to writing in or following the professionals meeting. On the basis that this judgement would set out my conclusions in relation to what was required and that this should then via the prism of the professionals meeting find its way into a concrete treatment plan The Official Solicitor was satisfied that the overall package proposed both in terms of care and support and treatment was in EOA's best interests.

Then, once the overall plan is choate, the court could determine the length of the authorisation and who acts as r.1.2 representative for that authorisation period.  The Official Solicitor initially pressed for a six-month deprivation of liberty order on the basis that the care and treatment plan was so inchoate and its implementation so uncertain that the court should be in a position to review progress but also that the prospect of a further hearing would provide a stimulus to ensure that good intentions were acted upon. However my indication that I would not finally approve an order until after the professionals meeting proposed by Ms Meehan my confirmation that I would reserve all further applications relating to EOA to myself satisfied the official solicitor that there was a sufficient mechanism in place to ensure both that the plan became choate and that stumbles in the implementation could be addressed in a swift resort to the court satisfied The Official Solicitor that period free of litigation justified the making of a deprivation of liberty order for 12 months. </p>

The OS accepted that the principal responsibility for a failure to progress EOA’s education might lie with children services rather than with the current team but still maintained that the issue had been these proceedings and had not been adequately addressed.  </p>

Mr Fulwood on behalf of the CCG did not advocate for any particular outcome but emphasised the framework within which the CCG operated and emphasised that whilst it could commission services it could not determine precisely how they were delivered. Those were clinical judgements not commissioning decisions. The CCG accepted that an appropriate order should not emerge until the professionals meeting had been undertaken and produced a plan. One of Miss Meehan’s colleagues would be delegated the task of coordinating the meeting and the provision of services. </p>

Continuous does not mean 24-hour presence of a person but is in the nature of the conditions. The difference between restriction and deprivation of liberty is ‘nonetheless merely one of degree or intensity, and not one of nature or substance. Although the process of classification into one or other of these categories sometimes proves to be no easy task in that some borderline cases are a matter of pure opinion, the Court cannot avoid making the selection upon which the applicability or inapplicability of Article 5 depends. In determining whether a decision within section 16 MCA should be made by the court with the consequent effect that it will deprive P of his liberty the court must only do so where it is necessary and proportionate. A conclusion that a care package is in P’s best interests and which incorporates within it provisions which amount to a deprivation of liberty will meet this test although the court will of course scrutinise such a plan with great care and in particular those elements which take the plan over the threshold from restricting P’s liberty to depriving him of his liberty.  </p>

They have not been involved properly with medical services, community services, and educational services. They have moved around from county to county, to Ireland as well and to Nigeria at times, without any thought for the children in terms of continuity of education or medical care. 8. I was very distressed as well on seeing the children to understand how bad their education had been. Indications that the parents have given to the Local Authority, with regard to homecare being done in a proper and organised way, were manifestly and clearly exaggerated and overblown.  These children are, educationally, at a very young age, many years younger than they should be. The only education, if you like, or element of education which they have had of any note is that of Bible studies. Quite clearly, they have been brought up in an environment, which really revolves around purely Bible studies and church issues to the exclusion of nearly every other aspect of their education. It is pleasing to see that they are now coming round, that POA, particularly, is embracing with enthusiasm the educational opportunities that have been put his way and pleasing to hear that the other three are beginning to follow suit. 10. In terms of the threshold document which has been placed before the court on behalf of the Local Authority, quite clearly every aspect of that is made out and I have no difficulty in finding threshold criteria, and that the children have manifestly suffered harm, significant harm, as a result of the neglectful parenting provided by the parents…. The only parents they have, Mr and Mrs A, have failed to work with the court in any way whatsoever. They have failed to work with the social services. They have failed to work with the guardian and, indeed, it appears that they have left the country and certainly taken no steps to follow up a very reasonable and limited requirement to speak to the social worker to try and arrange contact. In other words, it appears that they have given up on their children, which is sad indeed.</span>

	      <span> </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic">EOA has had an eligibility assessment for learning disability services. These have looked at his cognitive and practical functioning. EOA's IQ has been measured to be outside of the learning disability range. (b) His functional ability has also been assessed as outside the learning disability range. Both assessors recognise that the validity of their assessments is limited by EOA's non-engagement with formal assessment and his unusual overall presentation. (c) I have review Dr Joel Parker's report in detail and find his logic compelling and his conclusions consistent with this. (d) In addition to the points that DR Parker raises, most of the factors that I can identify within support the view that EOA functions just above the learning disability range, and that there may be other reasons for this than an intrinsic impairment of cognitive functioning: 1. Whilst EOA clearly has a wide range of skills deficits, many of them may be explained by lack of educational or practical opportunity, or by his Autism.</span>
	      <span> </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic">In spite of his qualitative communication difficulties, EOA is said to be bilingual which suggests a significant level of baseline cognitive function 3. In spite of his entrenched opposition to any form of (re)- habilitation, EOA shows good evidence of skills acquisition which appears slowed by a combination of impaired theory of mind and rigid thinking due to autism, alongside an entrenched reluctance to work with staff to do things that professionals think are beneficial for him. </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">EOA's overall presentation since coming into care is not consistent with an intrinsic psychotic illness….exposure to staff and professionals has diminished his paranoia towards them. This suggests to me that his paranoid and conspiratorial views, whilst extreme and unusual, are not delusional36, as they are gradually eroded by positive experiences of particular people. The slow rate of change probably reflects a number of factors related to autism: 1. Rigid thinking 2. Lack of theory of mind leading to difficulties understanding social rules and social context 3. A subgroup of individual with ASD are also predisposed to a more paranoid world view because of their problems with theory of mind. I suspect this has been further reinforced in EOA by his father's extreme views.</span>

This period would seek to lessen EOA’s rigid thinking and opposition to ideas or experiences which do not conform to his current worldview which remains largely fixed in that which he was indoctrinated into in his family.

Dr Layton surveyed a broad landscape encompassing historic assessments of EOA, the views of his current carer’s and EOA himself and given his degree of expertise in the area I accept his opinion. The particular feature of that condition which bears upon EOA’s ability to make decisions is his fixed thinking which prevents him using or weighing information which is different to his preconceived and fixed ideas. This at the moment dominates his thinking in relation to very many important decisions that have to be made. That is not to say that there are not areas where he does show an ability to weigh and use information and where is thinking is not rigid but for the purposes of the decisions which have been put before me for adjudication it is this aspect of his condition which also in some contexts renders EOA unable to understand relevant information but most importantly prevents him using or weighing it as part of the decision-making process. I am therefore satisfied that EOA has an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of the mind or brain within section 2 (1) MCA. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">Although I do not need to decide the issue as I  am satisfied that EOA has an autistic spectrum disorder and that he lacks capacity in the relevant domains as a consequence of the fixed thinking associated with his autism and his consequent inability to weigh information it does seem to me that there is an issue which may at some stage need determining as to the role that other features of EOA's psychological condition may be playing in relation to questions of capacity and jurisdiction. Both Dr Jansen and Dr Halari identified that EOAs experiences had impacted on his psychological functioning or development. The definition of harm in the Children Act 1989 means ill-treatment or the impairment of health or development. Development means physical, intellectual, emotional, social or behavioural development and health means physical or mental health. District Judge Alderson accepted that EOA had suffered significant harm as a result of the abusive parenting he had experienced, and in particular the indoctrination into a way of life and belief system well beyond any norms in society; even giving due allowance for the very wide margins acceptable in a modern liberal society. It is well established that emotional abuse and neglect can have both physiological/neurological consequences in terms of brain development and psychological consequences. The absence of any specific diagnosis in relation to EOA of the effects of his neglectful and abusive childhood does not mean that they may not still be present and playing a part in his current functioning. In theory at least it seems to me possible that even if it were not possible to fit those consequences into any known diagnostic category that they would be capable of having caused an impairment of or a disturbance in the functioning of the mind or brain which would potentially bring them within the ambit of section 2(1) of the Mental Capacity Act. Of course, EOA's case is as a I have said far beyond any broad societal norms and within the spectrum where it can properly be characterised as indoctrination. Thus, even where the causes of incapacity caused by autism resolved that might still leave issues to be determined as to whether the consequences of his abusive indoctrination had consequences in terms of his capacity. Self-evidently it might also engage the protective Jurisdiction of the court in relation to vulnerable adults even if the consequences did not sound in capacity issues. However, given the evidence of Dr Layton that the autism itself is either substantially or entirely the source of EOA’s inability to use or weigh information those are questions I do not need to resolve today. As Dr Layton said in evidence it is not possible to disentangle the effect of autism and the effects of the indoctrination in any way so as to quantify them but the fixed thinking which is a well-recognised aspect of autism, (but would also be consistent with indoctrination) establishes the causal nexus required by section 2(1) </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">In relation to the question of contact with others it seems to me that this issue does have to be broken down into separate compartments. First of all, there are issues of capacity relating to family members; those who maintain the doctrine including the mother, father, DOA and JOA and those who have left the doctrine behind covering POA and TOA. Secondly there are issues of capacity relating to third parties or strangers. I agree with the Local Authority and with the Official Solicitor that it is appropriate to apply a different approach to questions of contact with family members to that which should apply to the generic issue of capacity to have contact with strangers or third parties. In relation to his capacity to make decisions about contact with family members who remain within the doctrine the evidence establishes that EOA understands the contact with family he does not understand the risk they pose to him and is unable to weigh that in any decisions about contact with him. This rigidity of thinking arises from his autism although may also be impacted by indoctrination. He thus lacks capacity to make decisions in relation to those family members. In relation to family members who are outside the doctrine EOA expresses no interest in seeing them. This may be because to do so he sees them in large groups which she does not like because of his autism but it may also be because they call into question his beliefs about the family. When POA attended court with EOA, he expressed his reluctance to see EOA because EOA’s view of the family tended to undermine POA’s separation from them. It seems to me that EOA lacks capacity in relation to these family members principally because he does not understand the benefits of seeing those who are outside the doctrine and he might be able to help him to understand the harm is indoctrination has done to him. As Mr Brownhill put it, he would need to understand something about the family dynamics and the differences that exist in order to make a capacitor’s decision. Achieving this is part and parcel of the longterm three-pronged care and treatment plan. Thus, I am satisfied that EOA lacks capacity to make decisions in relation to contact with his family members. I’m satisfied that it is appropriate to make a separate declaration in respect of this aspect of contact with others because it is a fact specific decision which arises in this case and which has to be addressed. I will make declarations in this regard and am satisfied that they should address the issue of social media and Internet usage for the reasons set out below. </p>

Dr Layton identified EOA’s lack of understanding of his own vulnerability arising from his lack of social awareness, social naïveté and autism which make him vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. His fixed thinking and unwillingness to consider these issues prevent him weighing issues relating to his vulnerability and he thus lacks capacity to make decisions about contact with strangers.  There is an argument that in relation to contact with strangers that EOA might with the provision of information and support capacity to make decisions about contact with strangers in the way that he might with support regain be able to make capacitors decisions in relation to general social media and Internet use. However, I think there is a distinction. The issues of lack of understanding of his vulnerability and his susceptibility to exploitation by strangers in relation to contact our more profound than those which bear upon social media and Internet usage. There is some link in that one can lead to the other but the progress that EOA would need to make in understanding his vulnerability in face-to-face relationships with third parties or strangers are far more deep rooted and are likely only to be addressed through the three-pronged, long-term care and treatment plan.

This in Dr Layton’s view amounted to a lack of understanding which meant he lacked capacity.

In this regard the issue is far more closely aligned with the approach to contact with other named individuals where the courts evaluation should be decision specific. The use of the Internet or social media is merely one vehicle by which EOA might seek or have contact with family members who pose a risk to him and in respect of whom he lacks capacity to make decisions as to contact. Social media and the Internet today are the modern equivalent of a telephone directory or a letter of a previous era; they are simply a means of gathering information or communicating and in this case where there are clearly identified individuals whom EOA lacks capacity to make decisions in relation to contact seems to me that this should be recognised. The danger of not dividing these domains into more specific identifiable decisions would be to either apply an approach which was too restrictive in that it would apply a high bar in relation to strangers which in fact was only relevant to family members or alternatively it would apply too low a  bar relevant to strangers to issues of contact with high risk family. I am satisfied that the statutory scheme and the jurisprudence does not require such an approach but requires a tailored and decision specific approach where that is appropriate on the facts. Thus, the order in relation to general internet and social media use should be an interim order which reflects the fact that further practicable steps to enable EOA to make capacious decisions in this regard. In relation to social media and Internet usage in the context of contact with family members that should be incorporated in the declarations addressing contact. </p>

This was noted during the care proceedings in 2016 and has endured down the years to his recent refusals to engage with the GP. As with other aspects of EOA's behaviour it seems probable that is refusal to engage with the GP is a complex interweaving of views derived from his upbringing and an inability to weigh information arising from that and from his autism. In relation to matters such as vaccination given to this. EOA is likely to refuse the vaccination as that has been his express position in relation to all forms of immunisation. It may be concluded at the relevant time that he lacks capacity in relation to vaccination but in welfare terms  the issue of forcing a vaccination upon him would raise very sensitive issues of the balance between his physical health and the psychological impact which might be profound and would almost certainly have a significant impact on his trust in those around him and their ability to engage him in </p>

The complex interplay between the psychological consequences of EOA's upbringing and the impact of autism requires a bespoke approach which has now been identified. Approaches which might be well established for individuals with autism have to be re-evaluated in the light of the indoctrination elements of EOA's psychological make up. It is clear that ABA is inappropriate, and that PBS needs to be tailored specifically to EOA as an individual; dynamic PBS as suggested by the Official Solicitor. The care and support plan drafted by the Local Authority subject to the amendments outlined by Ms Hendrick provides an appropriate for EOA’s medium to long term care. He has settled into that placement and has begun to develop relationships with some of the staff. It is important that the stability and security that brings EOA continues and that he is able to regard it as a home. The proposals that have been made in relation to the treatment plan with its three psychological components now provides an appropriate foundation for the treatment element of EOA’s future care. </p>

I wonder whether EOA himself recognises or has some awareness of the benefits to him of his current living arrangements but is unable to express those because of the his indoctrination which have a firmer hold on him than they have for instance on POA or TOA. The other issue which bears upon the decision as to whether it is in EOA’s best interests to approve the care support and treatment plan is whether it is likely to achieve its goals and thus whether it is necessary and proportionate for the court to make the order is sought. EOA has been in care for five years and there is only modest evidence of change. Thus, is it proportionate to keep EOA from his family against his wishes if there is only modest prospects of success. For reasons which have not been fully explored it seems that EOA has not been able to access the sort of treatment that is envisaged under the three-pronged treatment plan now proposed. It seems from reading about EOA as he was in 2016 and now that there have been modest changes in his presentation and that his experience of life with his foster carer and in his placement have had some beneficial impact. It therefore seems probable that the bespoke care support and treatment plan proposed is likely to have a beneficial impact albeit over an extended period measured in years not months. Given the length of time EOA was exposed to indoctrination and the length of time that his autism has been untreated it may be that the changes that will be affected may be hard to predict and modest in extent but it is clear that the prognosis is positive if uncertain. That being so I am satisfied that and that it is a necessary and proportionate response to his situation. No lesser measure could be put in place to achieve the same ends. </p>

They are imputable to the state and EOA cannot consent to them. Although the risk of EOA absconding appears to be low the consequences of him being reunited with his family are extremely serious the risks to EOA in the community given his lack of capacity relating to contact with strangers also create considerable risks for him. I am therefore satisfied that the deprivation of liberty that the care plan represents is necessary and proportionate. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">I agree that it is unnecessary to make express provision in the deprivation of liberty order authorising EOA's restraint. Although he expresses a firm wish to be reunited with his family so far as anyone is aware, he has not made any attempt to leave TOA or even to search for his family. When he has left the GP surgery unaccompanied, he returned to the house and did not abscond. Nor is his behaviour in the home such as to have required the staff to use any form of restraint. Although he may be assertive in expressing himself, he is not violent and is generally compliant with the rules of the placement. It is therefore neither necessary or proportionate to authorise the use of physical restraint. Given the difficulties that have been encountered during the course of these proceedings in tracking down EOA's mother and father for the purposes of notifying them of these proceedings it seems clear that were EOA to locate them and to that if he were successful it might prove impossible to find him again. The frequency with which the family move and their ability to evade detection would mean that the consequences were EOA to abscond would be likely long term and thus serious. The placement needs to be aware of this, as I'm sure they are, and to be vigilant to any sign that EOA might be seeking to locate them or even more seriously that he might have located them and was seeking to leave to Join them. However, as Mr Brownhill submits the statutory framework would permit the staff to take steps to prevent EOA absconding even without express to restrain him. </p>

However, the Local Authority accept that EOA looks forward to his contact with JOA and that much of the content is appropriate as between brothers. EOA shares his drawings and the boys talk about cars and other day-to-day subjects.

The official solicitor did not take a firm position on this but remained willing to act as EOA's litigation friend. Given that T is regarded as an outsider by EOA it seems to me that appointing someone close to him, even if there is no overt conflict-of-interest, would find it difficult to engage with EOA who would be likely to reject him as tainted by association with T.

It emerged that unknown to EOA's current team that the children's team had in fact developed a pathway plan via his children social worker and they had monitored it. Although for a period of in excess of six months the pathway plan had not been reviewed as a result of the absence of the social worker seems to me that in reality this almost certainly had no impact on the ground. At present the benefit of a pathway plan is that if as a consequence of the treatment plan EOA expresses an interest in education or training that a pathway plan will mean there is a vehicle by which steps can be taken very rapidly to implement such a willingness to access education or training. Historically the evidence makes clear that EOA had almost no formal education. When he was received into care the educational psychologist suggested a special school for children with severe learning disabilities. I have not been able to unpick precisely what happened in relation to EOA's education between the making of the care order and his reaching his 18th birthday although it seems clear that home-schooling was attempted but was withdrawn when EOA did not engage. I entirely accept that for an individual in EOA's position nonengagement (as for autism itself) should not lead to the immediate conclusion that nothing can be done, and services be withdrawn. However, in EOA's case is nonengagement is not an aspect of his behaviour that is readily addressed; it permeates his whole personality and relates to far more than just education, but extends to health, engagement with almost any authority figure whether a social worker, a pathway adviser, his legal representatives or any other emanation of authority. Those who EOA engages with tend to be those he knows and has developed some trust in. A pathway plan and pathway adviser whether actively promoted or desultory promoted over the last 18 months would have gained no traction but would have represented another individual who EOA would have declined to engage with. I very much hope that the tripartite approach contained within the proposed care and treatment plan will open a window in EOA's mind to the potential benefits of education or training. Thus, the existence of a pathway plan which will allow rapid advantage to be taken of any such opening that the care and treatment plan creates in </p>
