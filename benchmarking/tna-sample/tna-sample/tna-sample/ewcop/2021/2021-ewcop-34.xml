On a number of occasions the carers found YC on the floor when they arrived. Between July 2019 and February 2020, YC had ten admissions to hospital, varying in length from one to eleven days. The hospital records [<span style="font-weight:bold">G32</span>] refer to “behavioural issues – will put herself on the floor when she knows carers are coming to get back into hospital.

Neary</span> [2011] EWCOP 1377. The Court of Protection was invited to make a declaration that Hillingdon acted unlawfully in breach of Articles 5 and 8 of the Convention in keeping Steven Neary in a support unit between January and December 2010. Hillingdon contended that for a part of that period, from April to December 2010, a series of authorisations granted under the DOLS regime clothed its arrangements for Steven with legal entitlement.  </p>

Instead, he first considered the question of whether there had been a breach of Steven’s right to respect for his private and family life under Article 8 of the Convention. He acknowledged that the mere fact that a local authority’s view of best interests is not subsequently upheld by a court does not show that Article 8 rights have been infringed, but he concluded that there had been such an infringement in respect of Steven Neary (paragraph 155).  </p>

Although the framework of the Act requires the supervising body to commission a number of paper assessments before granting a standard authorisation, the best interests assessment is anything but a routine piece of paperwork. Properly viewed, it should be seen as a cornerstone of the protection that the DOL safeguards offer to people facing deprivation of liberty if they are to be effective as safeguards at all. 175. The corollary of this, in my view, is that the supervisory body that receives the best interests assessment must actively <span style="font-style:italic">supervise</span> the process by scrutinising the assessment with independence and with a degree of care that is appropriate to the seriousness of the decision and the circumstances of the individual case that are or should be known to it. </p>

In that case, a best interest assessor had conscientiously concluded that the best interests requirement was not met in the case of an elderly lady in a residential home, even where there was no practical alternative accommodation for her to go to. At paragraph 19, the judge described the assessor’s reasoning as flawed because she did not compare and contrast viable and practically available alternative placements. This is an example of the kind of scrutiny that can be carried out by a supervisory body as well as by a court. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.60in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.50in">I also rely on the obvious fact that the intention of paragraph 50 cannot be to require a supervisory body to give an authorisation simply because the best interests assessment makes a positive recommendation, whatever the quality of the work disclosed in the assessment. On behalf of Hillingdon, it was accepted for the sake of argument that it would not be bound by an assessment that was in effect so poor as to be “a joke”, so it follows that paragraph 50 cannot be read as if it simply required a positive answer without cogent reasoning. Hillingdon has however suggested that a supervisory body is bound to act upon any best interests assessment that is not grossly and obviously defective.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.60in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.50in">Against this, the EHRC and the Official Solicitor argue that where a supervisory body knows or ought to know that a best interests assessment is inadequate, it is not obliged to follow the recommendation. On the contrary, it is obliged to take all necessary steps to remedy the inadequacy, and if necessary bring the deprivation of liberty to an end, including by conducting a review under Part 8 or by applying to the court. This is in my view a correct statement of the law. The suggestion that the supervisory body is bound to act on any assessment that is not grossly and obviously defective sets the standard too low. It supposes an essentially passive supervisory body. This would not meet the objectives of the Act and would not provide effective protection against breaches of Article 5. </p>

An application to the Administrative Court in respect of paperwork errors would have no traction without an underlying error of law in the decision-making process, and would probably fail the “highly likely” test of section 31(2)(A) of the Senior Courts Act 1981, even if such an application was possible from the point of view of costs.

YC’s case is put on the basis of there being nineteen errors in the Form 5. As Mr Paget says, it could equally be described as a single error, repeated many times. The impression is indeed created that standardised phrases have been used in the administrative process of writing up a decision – which, I would suggest, is very poor practice – but overall, the frequency with which the same error appears points much more clearly to administrative, than substantive, inadequacy.  </p>
