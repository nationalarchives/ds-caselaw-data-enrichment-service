	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The appeal is against an order made by a Tier 2 Court of Protection Judge (the COP judge) authorising the execution of a will for JKS (P) who is an 86 year old widow.  It is clear and common ground that she now lacks capacity to make a will and to litigate.  Her husband died in 2009.  They had a long marriage and both came to live in this country from India.  They had two sons the Appellant (ADS) and the First Respondent (DSM).  In her judgment the COP judge referred to them as respectively A and D.  I shall do the same.  Both sons (A and D) are married and they both have adult or near adult children.</p>

MH is JKS’s property and affairs deputy and was her litigation friend in proceedings in the Chancery Division that were settled.  MH made the application for a statutory will dividing JKS’s estate 50/50 between A and D.  The COP judge did not authorise such a will but authorised one that divided the estate 25/75 between A and D.  In doing so the COP judge accepted and closely followed the arguments advanced by the Official Solicitor who had been appointed as JKS’s litigation friend in the COP proceedings.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have concluded that this appeal should be allowed for a number of free standing and complementary reasons.  In my view a significant factor leading to what I have concluded are valid grounds of appeal is the failure by the parties to properly prepare the case for hearing by identifying the issues of law and fact that needed to be considered and determined in applying the approach set by the Mental Capacity Act 2005 (the MCA).  Naturally, I acknowledge that hindsight is a wonderful thing but in my view some of the failures in preparation relate to very basic steps in the preparation of a case in which there is or may be a factual dispute.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">CPR 52.21.3 refers to the admission of new evidence.  I was not invited to and have not approached the review part of this appeal on the basis of evidence that was not put before the COP judge but was put before me as a result of directions I made when giving permission.   It seemed and still seems to me that those directions are directed to obvious gaps in the information contained in the evidence before the COP judge and so a failure to make similar directions and so obtain the additional evidence is relevant to the review part of the appeal.  The product of those directions becomes relevant in respect of the relief to be granted if the appeal succeeds.</p>

Pausing there, it is clear and important to stress that a conclusion on what P would have done is not determinative of the MCA best interests test and so, by stating that the MCA enables the court to do for the patient what he could do for himself if of full capacity, the Supreme Court is not saying that a conclusion on what the patient would have done is decisive.  The test is not a “what P would have done test”, it is a best interests test and so a test that requires the decision maker to perform a weighing or balancing exercise between a range of divergent and competing factors.</p>

This assertion (which is found in the notes taken on 9 June 2010 concerning JKS’s will (cited above) and in JKS’s witness statement in the Chancery proceedings) was not qualified by any reference to whether it was or was not in dispute in the Chancery proceedings   Unsurprisingly, in submissions I was told without contradiction that it was in dispute in the Chancery proceedings.</p>

Rather, the approach taken demonstrates a failure to appreciate or to properly make clear the distinction between and so the impact of (a) reliance being placed on an allegation by JKS in the Chancery proceedings of “misappropriation” or “dishonest misappropriation”, and (b) reliance being placed on the existence of “misappropriation” or “dishonest misappropriation” and so the need to revisit and prove the Chancery Allegations, which the Official Solicitor did not seek to do. </p>

The approach mandated by s. 4 of the MCA applies to decisions made for the purposes of that Act and as a binding contract to make a will would dictate, or effectively dictate, a decision to authorise the making of a statutory will which can only be given by the COP there are powerful arguments that a Chancery judge should at least apply s. 4 when approving such a contract for P, or approve it as a COP judge (if he is nominated as such), or make arrangements for that part of a settlement to be approved by the COP making it clear whether or not his approval of the settlement was dependent on such a contract to make  a will (and a will in accordance with it) being approved and authorised by the COP.</p>

The most he could do was that which he has done, and that is make the application to the Court of Protection. It is then for the Court of Protection to determine whether it is appropriate for a statutory will to be made and, if so, the terms of that statutory will. I am acting on the assumption that both A and [ his wife], who were represented by Counsel for the purposes of entering into the compromise and the Order in the Chancery proceedings, were being advised that it (sic) was not possible to bind the Court of Protection and while the schedule set out what the intentions were at the time it could only be evidence of that intention was and not binding. ”</p>

The sum was also mentioned by D’s son at the meeting on 4 February 2015.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This ground of appeal is not avoided, as argued by the Official Solicitor, by paragraph 46 of her judgment.  As accepted by A’s counsel the error about no family member being present when the Psychiatrist saw JKS probably arises from the presence of D’s wife not being mentioned in the COP 3, but if that was the case it shows that the reference to D’s wife being there for part of the assessment did not sound any warning bells in the mind of the COP judge. Leaving this error to one side, the reliance by the COP judge on the expertise of professionals who she considered would be alert to any indication that JKS was being unduly pressured to say things against A and her conclusion that it was unrealistic to suppose that a pressured view could be held by JKS until such time as she spoke to the Psychiatrist and the Court of Protection visitor are built on sand.  Firstly, as I have set out above there is no evidence that either of them addressed this issue and if they, or those instructing them, did I was not given a good reason why it was thought appropriate to interview JKS when D and/or his wife remained in the house.  Secondly, there was no evidence that the relevance of (a) the existence of serious allegations against D, (b) the point that the Chancery Allegations and the Chancery Behaviour Allegations were disputed or (c) the point that what JKS was saying about her existing relationship with A, his wife and children was or may be more significantly inaccurate than for example the Psychiatrist’s comment on what JKS was saying about it (see paragraph 79 above)<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>was appreciated or properly appreciated by either of them when they conducted their interviews. </p>

In terms of the recent structure of the settlement, certainly so far as the Official Solicitor is concerned we’re not asking the Court to make a determination that A did unduly influence his father. The only relevance of that is, is the fact that that was transferred back, and the fact that [JKS] had to bring those proceedings to recover the land and I say that she will take that into account when considering the testamentary disposition. But other than that I have nothing to add ---- ”</p>

But this statement of his position does not recognise or sufficiently recognise the points made in paragraphs 44, 46 and 47 or in paragraph 68 (i) and (ii) of this judgment (see paragraph 69) and in my view this is likely to be one of the reasons why the points made in paragraphs 97 and 98 hereof were not addressed (see paragraph 4).</p>

The meeting lasted one hour 45 minutes and took place at JKS’s matrimonial home. In addition to MH his solicitor (the same solicitor who took instructions for the 2010 will), an interpreter, D his wife and his eldest son were present at that meeting.  MH referred to the Chancery proceedings and is recorded as having told JKS that because of changes in the circumstances which arose out of the court case it had been agreed by her barrister and the barrister representing the other parties that a new will should be made.  JKS is recorded as becoming upset and saying that she didn’t need any help. In answer to a question about whether there were any assets abroad she replied that there was no property abroad and when asked about any disputes about any land in India she replied that there was no land abroad. However, D’s son indicated that there is a dispute about land in India. In answer to MH saying that he understood that the remainder of the estate is to be split equally between HER two sons  JKS responded as cited by the COP judge “<span style="font-style:italic">no need to give to my younger son because he never comes to visit me</span>” and in response to a question as to when she last saw A, JKS replied 10 years ago.  The record of the meeting ends with a note that D’s son mentioned that JKS gave money to D which was held in a Nationwide Bank account and that D said he used some of that money to pay solicitors in India for the court case for JKS.</p>

The presence of D’s wife is recorded in the report sent by the Psychiatrist to MH dated 6 July 2015 but not in the COP 3.

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">A meeting on 27 January 2016 again at JKS’s matrimonial home attended by MH, his solicitor and an interpreter.  D’s wife was at the property but on this occasion MH asked her to leave the room because the judge will wish to ensure that JKS had not been influenced.  JKS was at first very angry about this but eventually accepted that her daughter-in-law should leave the room which she did. After she had gone JKS is recorded as stating that no one has influenced her.  MH stated that the last time they had met they had discussed that her whole estate should be divided between A and D, she responded that she had not seen A since he was born and when told that his lawyer has said that A had been to see her she responded that that was not true.  She said that: “<span style="font-style:italic">whoever is looking after me should get my estate</span>” and then in response to a question that if both sons are looking after her they should get 50/50 she responded no because A did not come to his father’s funeral.  </p>

He never sees her or helps her, , especially after her husband died and she did not want to give anything to him , not a single penny. The Visitor described her as being “adamant” and “quite animated” when discussing this. She further said that A never came to see her whereas D and his wife and son came to look after her and that she thought of A and his wife As dead. She also referred to D being her eldest son and that he looked after her and that was why she wants to leave things to him and his family. ”</p>

MH set out: “<span style="font-style:italic">JKS has declared to me that she prefers one son against the other because the one son does not visit her as much as the other one and has little contact with her. Notwithstanding that, in accordance with the court order we have proceeded to draw a document recognising the agreement. When the Court visitor came to see JKS she expressed her wishes that one son should be preferred against the other </span>[A’s solicitor] <span style="font-style:italic">has pointed out to me that that is not necessarily the case as there have been occasions when she has expressed the view of equal division between her sons. If that is the case, could she confirm what her instructions are. If she feels under pressure then only the lawyers should be present and the family should leave.”.  </span>JKS’s response was that; “<span style="font-style:italic">What is this about. There is no dispute between us (looking at A) . There is no problem I want my two sons to have an equal share. Everything is clear they must get 50/50 between them. They are my children, I will look after them. I will do what I want.” </span> She was asked to explain what she had said to the Court visitor and it is noted that she became very angry at the mention of the word “court” and when asked to explain why she had told the court visitor something different she became very angry shouting that she wanted them all to leave the house. However she continued that she did not need any help and that no one came to visit her. The note records in brackets that she did not remember the court visitor coming to visit. Towards the end of the meeting MH asked, to get things clear, whether it was correct that she wanted an equal division of her assets between her two sons and her reply was yes.  This meeting lasted 40 minutes.</p>

That order contains standard recitals relating to the overriding objective to resolve matters as quickly as possible and with the minimum of expense to JKS, that the court expects the parties to adopt a co-operative approach and reminding them of the position as to costs. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“We do not agree that there is no provision in the Order which makes the Schedule binding. On page 2, paragraph 5 of the Order, it clearly states “and it is further order and declared that the terms of the schedule to this order be carried out”. This is a binding court order for the terms of the schedule to be carried out. We note your view on the construction of the schedule that it only requires JKS’s deputy to apply for a Statutory Will in the terms set out and not necessarily to obtain a statutory Will in those terms. We agree with this, however, A might well not agree with this view and seek some further remedy against JKS, resulting in further costs payable out of JKS’s assets.</p>

We agree that an attended hearing is necessary but only deal with the terms of the Statutory Will in JKS’s best interests. As we are agreeable to your view on the construction of the Order, we do not feel that the Court needs to consider to what extent a third party can enter into a contract with a person  lacking capacity as the schedule to the court order dated 16 June 2014 was approved by the Court under CPR 21.10. Accordingly, we are not in agreement with the draft letter the official solicitor has prepared  for the Court of Protection.  We intend sending out own letter, as per copy enclosed. ”</p>

Equally the order was approved by an experienced High Court Judge who took some time to pass the Order.  The agreement was concluded in JKS’s best interests as the property and the land was vested in JKS’s name and we obtained a refund of all the inheritance tax paid. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Had the matter proceeded to trial, the outcome might have been quite different with more costs payable by JKS.</span></p>
