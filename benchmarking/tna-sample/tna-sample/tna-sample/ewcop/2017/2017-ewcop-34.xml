His capacity to make that decision for himself is in issue. His expressed wish is <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> to attend a residential rehabilitation placement.</p>

He has an intolerance of pain and needs regular physiotherapy to ensure that his flexibility, muscle tone and function are maintained. He requires PEG feeding. Any food that he does eat orally must be pureed and drinks must be thickened. Many people have described him as “very sensitive.” </p>

I am of the opinion that the inability identified above arises not so much because of an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, MB’s mind or brain…but because of the consequence of the impairments. His impairments, from birth, have required a different level of care from his mother than he would have required had he been born without impairments. One of the consequences of which has been the evolution of an enmeshed relationship between [MB] and his mother, this is best summarised by his mother’s comment “we are one opinion.” I believe that this impairs his ability to conceive of separateness as viable and therefore impairs his ability to weigh the decision in the balance. I believe that the provision of Family Therapy may help to reduce the enmeshment and anxiety within the relationship which may in turn enable [MB] to regain his capacity in this area of decision-making.” </span>[<span style="font-weight:bold">E28</span>]</p>

Given his apparent will to communicate, it is difficult to understand why technology has not been employed much more extensively to assist him; and where technological assistance has been obtained, why it is not actually made available to him in working order. My impression is that there must be a significant possibility that MB could be enabled to communicate better if those closest to MB have the will to support assistive technology and those in a position to effect it are not impeded.  </p>

Regrettable though the current situation as to communication aids may be, I am satisfied that Dr. Poz has taken all practicable steps to do as thorough as possible an assessment of MB’s capacity to decide the issues in question. Her assessments have been conducted over time and across different settings. In so far as it may be theoretically possible to improve MB’s communication by the employment of assistive technology, I am satisfied – sadly – that it has not been practicable for her to employ such aids to date. This very impracticability sits at the heart of the substantive application – one of the goals of the proposed rehabilitation placement is to provide consistent opportunity to use the tablet and chin switch (point 8 in the G Recommendations document.)  </p>

LS is right, and within the remit of her advocacy role, to insist on the need to provide MB with adequate information in an appropriate format; and to insist on adequacy of communication with him. Her assistance with the difficulties particularly in respect of hydroptherapy and the new wheelchair is to be welcomed but I consider that LS fails to distinguish between expressions of wishes and feelings, and a decision-making process. Her statement does not amount to an assessment of MB’s capacity within the terms of the Mental Capacity Act 2005. In contrast, asking the very questions which LS poses leads me to conclude that Dr. Poz <span style="text-decoration:underline">has</span> appropriately addressed each element of the statutory test.  I am satisfied that Dr. Poz is fully aware of the complexity of capacity considerations and, if LS intended to imply otherwise with her ‘<span style="font-style:italic">black and white</span>’ comment, she undermines her own credibility.</p>

I consider that her explicit consideration of MB’s capacity “<span style="font-style:italic">to make decisions on the care he requires, including medical treatment and surgery</span>” fully encompasses the question in issue, namely residential placement at a rehabilitation unit. I accept her conclusion as to functionality – that MB is presently unable to make such decisions for himself within the meaning of section 3 of the Mental Capacity Act 2005.</p>

As to causation, although I accept the correctness of Mr. Lamb’s submissions in law, I do not consider that they are made out in the evidence. Dr. Poz was clear about the limited context of the causation quote, and clearly irritated by Mr. Lamb’s attempts to stretch it further.  I do not accept that in oral evidence Dr Poz in any way widened her written concerns about enmeshment so as to alter her written conclusions in respect of MB’s incapacity to make decisions as to his care. On the contrary, I consider that she firmly refuted Mr. Lamb’s attempts to get her to do so. The submissions of Miss Gannon and Mr Bagchi more accurately reflect the totality of her evidence. I accept the conclusions of Dr. Poz (as set out in paragraph 70 above) that MB’s inability to make decisions on the care he requires arises <span style="text-decoration:underline">because of</span> the identified mental impairment, and <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> ‘because of’ his enmeshed relationships.    </p>

The only “evidence” from a medical professional which contradicts Dr Poz’s conclusions is the lately-produced letter from MB’s GP. In so far as the author states that “it appeared clear to me that [MB] had capacity to make this decision,” I note the express concession just a few lines later that the author had made no formal capacity assessment. Moreover, such conclusion is not supported by any of the parties – Mr. Lamb does not challenge Dr. Poz’s functional conclusions of incapacity. In any event the letter is unsigned, and lacks even a typed named of authorship. I place no weight at all on it.</p>

As a litigant in person, and one for whom English is not her first language, it is of course understandable that NB has not addressed Dr Poz’s report directly but in failing to attend key parts of the hearing, and in particular not giving oral evidence, NB has given up the opportunity to explain to the court her position as to MB’s cognitive abilities. I acknowledge the emotional intensity of her feelings for MB but I am left with the impression that NB does not distinguish on any level between an expression of wishes and feelings, and capacity to make a decision. In his  keenness to give consent to certain medical procedures on his son’s behalf, I conclude that SB too fails to make that distinction. I prefer the evidence of Dr. Poz.

	      </authorialNote> I remind myself that s1(3) of the Mental Capacity Act refers to “all <span style="font-style:italic">practicable</span> steps” (emphasis added). It is truly a source of frustration that MB’s access to technological communication aids has been so limited but I am satisfied that this is in significant part due to the complicated dynamic between MB and NB; and that it has not been practicable for any of MB’s professional carers, for Dr. Poz or for Professor Murphy to take further steps in this regard until that dynamic is addressed. It is further frustrating that the psychological therapy took such a long time to source. However, now it has started I accept Professor Murphy’s evidence that it will take a long time, if it is possible at all.    It is clear that serious attempts have been made to give MB an opportunity to visit proposed placements, so as to inform his decision-making process. They have failed but not for want of trying on the part of those parties who bear the burden of establishing incapacity. </p>

She considered that NB should have an opportunity to visit the placement but she should not do so with MB. As to speed of transition, she said “<span style="font-style:italic">if [NB] can find it in herself to be positive when they are together, it can not be rushed. If professionals believe that her involvement will cause [MB] to be distressed, then transition should be swifter</span>.” In practice she considered it “unrealistic” to think that NB would accept a decision of the court in favour of the placement proposal, so it would be better to follow the latter course: “<span style="font-style:italic">better to go without having been upset by his mother, as difficult as that is</span>.”</p>

However I am of the opinion that any change must be conducted in a mindful and planned way, within a psychologically informed therapy, for example that his independence is fostered gently and not forced upon him.

Their relative isolation from other families and from services often means that they may have very different views about the lives of people with disabilities and they may, for example, not understand the European view that we should strive for self-determination, even with the most disabled individuals….I am not certain yet to what extent this is reflected in [MB]’s family’s views of his care….</span>” </p>

He accepted that the second “<span style="font-style:italic">may be the least worst</span> “ option but urged that “<span style="font-style:italic">no party should be under any illusion that this remains a risky option for MB and may well result in further safeguarding referrals, high turnover of staff and, ultimately, more litigation” </span>[<span style="font-weight:bold">A283</span>] He considered it necessary for the key clinicians and experts to prepare further reports, exchange them and discuss options at a professionals meeting, with a further hearing thereafter.</p>

He urged instead the imperative of vigilance on the part of the Local Authority to ensure that  MB’s needs are met in the future.

In his first interactions with Professor Murphy, and in the college staff account of his interest in discussions of alternative living arrangements, there are grounds to conclude that MB <span style="font-style:italic">may</span> have been open to considering the proposal positively. The enmeshed relationship between NB and MB identified by Dr. Poz, recognised by Amanda Bairstow, and acknowledged by SA and AD, means that NB’s refusal to visit the proposed placements herself is a powerful signal to MB to do the same. I agree with Professor Murphy that there is difference between ‘not stopping’ someone, and encouraging them. Given MB’s dependence on her, NB’s failure to support and encourage MB to take up the opportunity on offer IS the same as preventing him from taking it up. To the extent that MB’s views are a reflection of his mother’s, they are a manifestation of the very disability which DY’s proposal sought to address. </p>

Nonetheless, however frustrating and difficult it may be for professional carers and representatives to accept, I am satisfied that MB does indeed hold those strong wishes and feelings against DY’s proposal; and further that those wishes must be the magnetic factor in weighing the advantages and disadvantages of  residential rehabilitation placement. As long as he holds those views, the prospects of achieving his engagement in the proposed rehabilitation are minimal, meaning that any benefits achieved would be too. To act against them would require measures which those who previously advanced the proposal now accept are realistically untenable, and would cause undoubted trauma to MB. To give effect to DY’s proposal now would be less fighting on MB’s behalf, more simply fighting MB.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="18">

DY will continue efforts to secure for MB as many of the necessary therapeutic interventions as possible within MB’s home environment. NB however must bear the heavy responsibility of knowing that an opportunity to explore enhancement of her son’s life experience has been passed by. Unless she markedly changes her approach to non-family carers and professionals, the likelihood is that his life will continue to be more limited than it could be. And the risk remains that MB will be forced to cope with unplanned rupture in his narrow care arrangements because of ordinary life events, such as illness befalling NB herself.</p>

However, it is clear that there has only been progress in moving to develop MB’s life opportunities within the prism of court involvement. Without it, the need for proactivity on the part of the Local Authority in fulfilling its statutory obligations is acute. I am reassured that the Local Authority is very much alive to this. If NB tries to roll back from the progress made to date with independent carers and activities beyond her involvement, and in particular if she tries to exclude key professionals concerned in the delivery of services to MB (such as the case manager, or the property and affairs deputy), then warning bells should ring. The necessity of future litigation cannot be ruled out.</p>

More positively, NB should take from the conclusion of these proceedings reassurance that her continued role in MB’s life is recognised. With less fear, she could choose to trust the positive aspects of her relationship with her son, and genuinely encourage him to explore the world around him as far as his disabilities allow.  A good start would be to build bridges with those family members who have long been a support to MB, in particular his uncle SA; and to work with DY and the Local Authority to establish a regular structure of care and support for all of MB’s needs.</p>

I am further satisfied that it is not presently in MB’s best interests to move to such placement as long as that is contrary to his own wishes.  To be clear, this decision is not intended to prohibit MB ever from attending such placement. There are many positive aspects to DY’s proposal. If over time MB changes his mind, and becomes willing to explore again the possibility of similar placement, the balance of risks and benefits will be different.</p>
