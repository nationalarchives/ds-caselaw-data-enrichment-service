She has developed and maintained relationships with staff and other residents and benefits from a high level of care and support. This provides her with a broad range of social interaction within her local community and further afield. On balance, it is my view that it is CK’s best interest to remain at C Care Home as to move her will potentially undermine the stability and the progress that she has made to-date. While other service providers may be able to provide a similar service level as well as opportunities for CK that are broadly similar it is my view that this represents a risk of disruption and allied distress and anxiety that is not outweighed by possible advantages.’</span>

In some cases, in some situations, they may carry much, even, on occasions, preponderant, weight. In other cases, in other situations, and even where the circumstances may have some superficial similarity, they may carry very little weight. One cannot, as it were, attribute any particular a priori weight or importance to P's wishes and feelings; it all depends, it must depend, upon the individual circumstances of the particular case. And even if one is dealing with a particular individual, the weight to be attached to their wishes and feelings must depend upon the particular context; in relation to one topic P's wishes and feelings may carry great weight whilst at the same time carrying much less weight in relation to another topic. Just as the test of incapacity under the 2005 Act is, as under the common law, 'issue specific', so in a similar way the weight to be attached to P's wishes and feelings will likewise be issue specific.</span>

The first entry should be of any factor or factors of actual benefit … Then on the other sheet the judge should write any counter-balancing disbenefits to the applicant … Then the judge should enter on each sheet the potential gains and losses in each instance making some estimate of the extent of the possibility that the gain or loss might accrue. At the end of that exercise the judge should be better placed to strike a balance between the sum of the certain and possible gains against the sum of the certain and possible losses.
