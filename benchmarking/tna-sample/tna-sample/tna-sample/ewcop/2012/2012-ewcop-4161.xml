But respect for our human condition, regard for the realities of our society and the common sense to which Lord Oliver of Aylmerton referred in In re K …, surely indicate that the starting point should be the normal assumption that mentally incapacitated adults will be better off if they live with a family rather than in an institution – however benign and enlightened the institution may be, and however well integrated into the community – and that mentally incapacitated adults who have been looked after within their family will be better off if they continue to be looked after within the family rather than by the State.</span>

We need to be careful not to embark upon 'social engineering'. And we should not lightly interfere with family life. If the State – typically, as here, in the guise of a local authority – is to say that it is the more appropriate person to look after a mentally incapacitated adult than her own partner or family, it assumes, as it seems to me, the burden – not the legal burden but the practical and evidential burden – of establishing that this is indeed so. And common sense surely indicates that the longer a vulnerable adult's partner, family or carer have looked after her without the State having perceived the need for its intervention, the more carefully must any proposals for intervention be scrutinised and the more cautious the court should be before accepting too readily the assertion that the State can do better than the partner, family or carer. </span>

Indeed that sets the requirement too low. If the State is to justify removing children from their parents or vulnerable adults from their relatives, partners, friends or carers it can only be on the basis that the State is going to provide a better quality of care than that which they have hitherto been receiving: see Re F, F v Lambeth London Borough Council [2002] 1 FLR 217 at para [43]. </span>

The jurisdiction is to be invoked if, but only if, there is a demonstrated need to protect a vulnerable adult. And the court must be careful to ensure that in rescuing a vulnerable adult from one type of abuse it does not expose her to the risk of treatment at the hands of the State which, however well intentioned, can itself end up being abusive of her dignity, her happiness and indeed of her human rights. That said, the law must always be astute to protect the weak and helpless, not least in circumstances where, as often happens in such cases, the very people they need to be protected from are their own relatives, partners or friends: NS v MI [2006] EWHC 1646 (Fam), [2007] 1 FLR 444, at para [8]. </span>

The court, as I have said, is entitled to intervene to protect a vulnerable adult from the risk of future harm – the risk of future abuse or future exploitation – so long as there is a real possibility, rather than a merely fanciful risk, of such harm. But the court must adopt a pragmatic, common sense and robust approach to the identification, evaluation and management of perceived risk.”</span>

The first entry should be of any factor or factors of actual benefit … Then on the other sheet the judge should write any counter-balancing disbenefits to the applicant … Then the judge should enter on each sheet the potential gains and losses in each instance making some estimate of the extent of the possibility that the gain or loss might accrue. At the end of that exercise the judge should be better placed to strike a balance between the sum of the certain and possible gains against the sum of the certain and possible losses.

In addition to his serious breaches of this court’s order, he has a record of persistent offending stretching back over half a century. His criminal record of 164 offences (many for dishonesty) has been compiled under 24 different names and three dates of birth, and includes failures to answer to bail and breaches of court orders. He has served over 20 terms of imprisonment, which indicates that imprisonment has often not deterred him from committing further imprisonable offences. This reinforces the impression that he struggles to comply with legal requirements and orders, and suggests that a penal notice, with the risk of committal, may prove not to be an effective deterrent.</span>

He received letters telling him that he had committed serious breaches of the order; that any telephone contact not authorised by the local authority was a breach of the order; and that the order stipulated ‘that he shall not have any contact with E and K and that is the position until [the local authority] determines that contact is appropriate.’ On 9 March, his solicitors acknowledged in writing that their client had been made ‘fully aware of the terms of the order’ and had been advised to refrain from speaking directly on the telephone to K. Nevertheless, he continued to have some telephone contact and when he was ‘reminded by staff about the terms of the court order he threatened them, saying he would “come down and sort staff out”.’</span>

Furthermore, it was JB’s conduct that made contact with him impractical, not an unreasonable refusal on the part of the local authority to allow any contact to take place. Very serious breaches of the order occurred in 2011 and the situation facing me today is very different to that when the independent experts visited.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:11pt">Mrs B deserves credit for her admissions; her good character; her past care of her daughters; the lack of significant concern for their welfare until JB became involved with the family; and the successful contact that has taken place since March 2012. I accept that at times she felt isolated and unsupported after the hearing in January 2011. She tells me, sincerely I believe, that she wishes to get on with professional carers and staff; that she is confident that she can work with them; and that she agrees to contact being at the local authority’s discretion. She acknowledges that for a time she lost sight of her daughters’ best interests. Recently, she has demonstrated a greater ability to express her grievances and complaints in a constructive manner. All of these things are positive and hopeful indicators.</span>

In my opinion, the injunctions and penal notices should remain in force for a minimum of one year following Mr B’s release from prison.

	      <span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:11pt">Mr B’s counsel made an application for an adjournment on the second day, essentially on the grounds that his client had complied with some probation and other community-based orders in the past. He wanted time to prove this. I indicated that I was willing to proceed on the basis that Mr B had not breached probation and other community orders on a number of occasions. Even giving him every benefit of the doubt, it remained the case that his record of compliance with court orders was poor and that on many occasions imprisonment did not appear to have had a deterrent effect. It was unnecessary and disproportionate to adjourn the hearing.</span>

The local authority indicated at the pre-trial review that it did not intend to rely upon it.</span>
