RBS himself consented to that order. There was no ‘secret hearing’; indeed there was no hearing at all because the consent order was sent to the court. On 1 June, the media applied for permission to attend future court hearings, having been contacted by RBS, and I readily agreed.</span>

There is some evidence that RBS is unable to understand or give proper weight to these considerations before making litigation decisions. Having publicised matters in China, in an email addressed ‘TO JUDGE’ dated 9 June 2012, he wrote: I trust you will now accept, accountability to the international community.’ His approach to this hearing was to seek as many witnesses as possible to ‘totally embarrass both [the council] &amp; the court …’ His A4 poster publicising the hearing and inviting local people to attend, was handed to local shops, including a kebab takeaway and fish and chip shop. Seemingly, he could not understand that this level of local knowledge of his father’s circumstances might embarrass his father if he returns home, either permanently or for visits. Nor could he see that it might affect his position and standing in his local community. He seemed unable to understand why confidentiality is important, the harm one may do to others if confidences or privacy are breached, the possible penalties and the appropriate way to contest the issue if publicity is desired. Simply taking the matter into one’s own hands, without allowing others an opportunity to present any competing considerations, is potentially damaging to his father, because the decisions are taken without proper, calm, deliberation.</span>

He has been permitted to reside rent-free at his father’s cottage, there have been no applications to commit him, despite fairly vicious public attacks on council staff, and his unauthorised dealings with his father’s assets have been discounted.

Rather than repay some of the money used by him without proper authority, he now demands that the council pays him and his father compensation, and sacks staff. His father must be ‘released immediately from imprisonment’ despite the consent order and the lack of any application to review it.

Although this is unusual, and some would say not ideal, on balance I believe it is appropriate and justified. Mr A still has a friendly relationship with Mr A and the complexity of these proceedings means that it would be unduly expensive and time-consuming for someone unfamiliar with the litigation history to adequately understand all of the litigation issues and to be in a position to protect his interests. An experienced mental health lawyer acts in Mental Health Tribunal proceedings without an intermediary and will know how best to balance his instructions and legitimate interests with the requirement that decisions are in his father’s best interests. Unlike RBS’s friends, he knows the full relevant history and from his contributions to date I am confident that he will serve RBS well while being mindful of his duty to the court.</span>

He is very welcome to attend hearings, to file statements and evidence through his litigation friend, and as a devoted son to keep the court informed of his views as to his father’s best interests. Mr A has always helped him to do that and I am sure that he will ensure that RBS is able to contribute, but in a way that is in keeping with the rules and the rights of others.</span>

He has extreme vascular problems which resulted in toe amputation. He is subject to the usual indoor smoking regulations; and it may be that his opportunities are also limited by needing staff to accompany him outdoors and/or by his vascular condition. He was a 40-60 a day man, apparently, and it is common ground that he is an enthusiastic smoker who has always derived pleasure from the habit, which he wishes to continue. It would be impertinent of me to interfere with his life-long pleasures and habits — his preferences are perfectly clear — provided that he is not about to cause himself significant pain or distress, such that if he had capacity he would be likely to limit his smoking to the current level. If a choice has to be made, my duty to him is to make decisions that help him to live out his life as a happy man, who does not suffer unduly, rather than as a sensible man.</span>

As a general principle, he ought not to be denied any internet and email facilities that the other residents enjoy provided he has the capacity to derive some benefit. The only caveat would be if lacks capacity to decide this for himself and using the facility causes him more distress than benefit because of misinformation and/or interference with his care.</span>

As I explained to the parties at the hearing, a set fee is payable to court visitors. Given the fee, and the complexity of the issues, these reports will be in the nature of ‘scoping reports’. If, when taken with the other independent evidence, they indicate very firmly that it is in RGS’s best interests to remain at X Manor then I will consider whether it is appropriate to proceed any further with the review. If, however, the reports suggest that there is a feasible alternative to the current arrangements, which accords with RGS’s wishes and may be in his best interests, then I will consider with the parties how this can be explored and/or progressed in a way that is affordable. I will also be visiting RGS myself, to hear what he wants to say to the judge in his case.</span>

The law provides a framework for dealing with or containing disputes but it cannot remedy the underlying realities and relationships. Things are as they are. RBS has endured mental health problems since the age of 16 and quite often this has been trying for him, and no doubt for his father, to cope with. His father appears no longer to have capacity to decide how to deal with, or to respond to, his son’s behaviour when it affects his own well-being and interests. I must decide for him. On the current evidence, I think his father is devoted to his son and would wish me to take the same forgiving approach to his actions that he seems to have taken over the years. At present, therefore, I continue to prefer not to take any formal steps against RBS. The position remains the same as set out in my order of 18 May 2011:</span>

He must also refrain from doing anything that injures the children’s interests and feelings, and those of his sister and individuals who are simply doing their job by carrying out the court’s or deputy’s instructions.

Society is made up of individuals, and each individual has distinctive feelings, personal goals, traits, habits and experiences. Because this is so, most individuals wish to determine and develop their own interests and course in life. The existence of a private sphere of action, free from public coercion or control, is indispensable to that independence which everyone needs to develop as an individual.
