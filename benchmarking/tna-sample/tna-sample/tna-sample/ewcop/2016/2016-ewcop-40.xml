	      <span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:11pt">I do not share that view. The second part of the application goes well beyond administrative convenience and affects the rights, obligations and financial position of many individuals. It is not sufficient to exhibit a list of ‘Court of Protection involvements’ to the application as a substitute for naming and notifying or serving those directly affected by it. In the first place, the rules provide for notification or service unless dispensed with by order. Secondly, the Mental Capacity Act 2005 provides that a decision-maker must, so far as reasonably practicable, permit and encourage the relevant person to participate as fully as possible in decisions affecting them. Thirdly, the decision-maker must have regard for their wishes and feelings and any other factors they would be likely to consider. Fourthly, the rules of natural justice require that people are informed of applications and proposed decisions that affect them. Fifthly, each incapacitated person is an individual with their own interests and financial circumstances. It is not be assumed that what is in the best interests of people generally, or has a general benefit in terms of cost or administrative simplicity, is in the best interests of any particular individual. Sixthly, the approach is difficult to reconcile with Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</span>

Who was affected by the application, and would be affected by any order, needed to be firmly established and the persons notified. The suggested bulk order approach without any notification meant this was not properly considered.</span>

The person affected, and anyone else notified, may then object if they wish. I have no power to bar those people from seeking a different costs order when their case comes before the court and in any case such a provision would be unfair.

Or was it an application to rewrite the original orders retrospectively so that each of them is now to be read as if it authorised the deputy to charge the higher solicitor’s fixed costs at the time it was made? The effect of that would be that each affected individual is suddenly liable to pay an additional deputy fee for each year the deputyship has been in force — the additional annual fee being the difference between that permitted by order actually in force at the time and the order now deemed to have been in force. Or, lastly, was the deputy asking the court in an indirect way to relieve it from any liability it has or may have incurred in the past on account of charging fees in excess of those permitted by the orders in force at the time, i.e. an application similar to that made in unauthorised gifting cases?</span>

Furthermore, as will be seen, the practice direction leaves the issue of whether to extend its provisions to not-for-profit organisations at the court’s discretion.

The issue of a practice direction is the exercise of an inherent power of the court even when made under statutory authority.  However, this does not mean that a judge dealing with an application can simply vary practice directions or alter rules with general effect; they are binding on her/him. In particular, a judge’s wide case-management powers in individual cases cannot be construed ‘as giving the power to individual judges or any court simply to vary the rules or practice directions generally’ (</span>

In other words, the court’s order may at its discretion provide that a not-for-profit organisation deputy or ‘other professional’ shall be entitled to fixed costs at the solicitor or local authority rate.

Clearly that is no longer a common understanding. It follows that today court deputy orders which authorise a not-for-profit organisation deputy to have the benefit of fixed-costs without specifying  the rate are defective.</span>

It therefore seems likely that we may see an increase in the number of non solicitor deputies over the forthcoming years and I appreciate your request for guidance at this particular time.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:11pt">However the fact of the matter is that we currently see very few bills from non solicitor deputies and at a rough guess probably over 95% of bills are submitted by solicitors, making it difficult to give definitive rates or guidance with regard to non solicitor deputies. The position with solicitors’ rates is relatively straightforward as they are invariably allowed the SCCO guideline hourly rates unless there are exceptional reasons to depart from the norm.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:11pt">Out of the non solicitor deputies, the highest proportion by far are accountants. In general I would group accountants just below solicitors on the basis they are professionally qualified and carrying out a professional function in a similar manner to solicitors, albeit they are not legally qualified. In practice I find accountants tend to charge lower rates than solicitors and they also engage a range of junior staff to carry out routine tasks at much lower rates than Grade D fee earners in a solicitors firm. It is not unusual to see juniors in an accountants firm charging at perhaps £30 to £70 per hour, whereas the lowest guideline rate for a Grade D fee earner is £111 per hour.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:11pt">The second group of non solicitor deputies are so called 3rd sector deputies, including charities and not for profit organisations. We see very few bills from such organisations, possibly because they have been tied to fixed costs and the court has been reluctant to make orders for detailed assessment. Because of the scarcity of such bills there is insufficient evidence to specify an average rate and each case has to be decided on its individual merits, taking into account the status of the fee earner (including any legal or other relevant qualifications), location of the work and other factors such as the size of the estate and overheads, which are likely to be much less than a solicitor.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:11pt">However a few cases of 3rd sector deputies spring to mind. One was X, who was an ex-receivership officer at W Council. X’s charging rate started out at £52 per hour and ended up at £88 per hour before he retired a few years ago, when his work was taken over by [a firm of solicitors] at much greater cost. Another was Y, an organisation promoting empowerment of disabled people in Essex. I cannot now recall their specific charging rate but I am sure it was significantly lower than a solicitor’s rate and I think about £100 per hour.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:11pt">With regard to the orders for costs sought by not for profit organisations I personally would not concede that they should be entitled to solicitors rates, on the basis the fee earners are unlikely to be legally qualified, they do not have the same overheads as solicitors, are likely to be dealing with smaller and less complex estates and are by definition not for profit organisations. I do not see any problem however allowing them to elect for detailed assessment in appropriate cases, on the basis it would then be left to the Costs Officer to make a judgment as to the appropriate rate.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:11pt">Another option could be for the judge to fix an hourly rate, although as I say there is very little evidence as to a typical rate. I suppose it may be possible to fix a rate by comparing industry standard rates for other relevant groups such as independent social workers, will writers, licensed conveyancers, etc. I think in any event any rate should be fixed significantly lower than the guideline rates for solicitors, which start at £111 per hour ….</span>

Since 1948 the nature of a local authority’s statutory duties has meant that historically they are deputised to manage lower-value estates which local solicitors would be unwilling to manage for economic reasons.</span>
