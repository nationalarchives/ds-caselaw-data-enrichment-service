	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">     Generally a staged approach that applies the relevant rules and so, in the COP, starts with the consideration of whether there is a good reason for a public hearing should be taken. But, this first stage is not an isolated or preliminary stage that, if such a good reason exists, founds an approach that the second stage is addressed on the premise that COP proceedings are treated in the same way as other proceedings where the default rule is that they are heard in public.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">    The default rule, and any practice direction that modifies it, represent a general conclusion on how best to administer justice.  In reaching that conclusion a balance will have been struck between the relevant competing Convention rights and the factors, propositions and public interests that underlie them.  But <span style="font-style:italic">Re S </span>makes it clear that this is not the end of the process and that as between Articles 8 and 10 (and so the factors, propositions and public interests that underlie and promote them) neither takes precedence as such and so, in my view, it would be wrong to approach a default rule as creating a presumption.  Rather, it is part of the structure for a reasoning process that applies the <span style="font-style:italic">Re S </span>approach to a given case. </p>

I am satisfied that it did so and that V and G are correct in asserting that much of the publicity was precipitated not only by a wish to report and comment on the bases on which the Court reached its decision but also to attract prurient interest in their mother’s sexual and relationship history (including her relationship with them and A).</p>

This is the reason it is so important not to forget why proceedings are required to be subjected to the full glare of a public hearing. It is necessary because the public nature of the proceedings deters inappropriate behaviour on the part of the court. It also maintains the public's confidence in the administration of justice. It enables the public to know that justice is being administered impartially. It can result in evidence becoming available which would not become available if the proceedings were conducted behind closed doors or with one or more of the parties' or witnesses' identity concealed. It makes uninformed and inaccurate comment about the proceedings less likely . . . Any interference with the public nature of court proceedings is therefore to be avoided unless justice requires it.

It may also be put in jeopardy unless patients have a reasonable expectation in advance that their identities will not be disclosed without their consent.

To my mind, that would be an unfortunate and odd result particularly, for example, if C had asked for it to be discharged.

The reference to three or four grounds was based on a distinction that could be made between the Article 8 rights of the adult daughters and those of the teenage daughter.  The other grounds identified were (a) C’s medical confidentiality, which it was argued did not survive her death, and (b) the administration of justice. It is convenient to deal with the last ground when I consider the balancing exercise in this case. </p>

OPO (through a litigation friend) sought an injunction to restrain its publication.  One of the causes of action advanced to found the relief was misuse of private information.  The Court of Appeal held that OPO had no such cause of action and so upheld the refusal of the court below to grant an injunction on that basis.  However, the Court of Appeal did grant an interim injunction founded on the prospects of success of one of OPO’s other causes of action, namely the intentional infliction of emotional harm by MLA.

Rather, the argument was that the private information was MLA’s as it related to him and in particular his tormented childhood.  I am not clear whether there were any references in the book that referred to OPO or were directly linked to OPO (see paragraphs 14 and 17 of   the judgment of Arden LJ) and I confess that I am also unclear what the ratio for the conclusion that OPO had no cause of action for misuse of private information (MPI) is (see paragraphs 45 to 47).  But it is clear that the Court of Appeal decided that OPO had no such cause of action against his father.</p>

On the other hand, as this case shows, significant financial and emotional burdens are likely to be placed on the individuals involved in a given case if they have to initiate a further application.  In my view, the balance of those burdens, coupled with the prospects of an agreed solution being reached, also favours the normal duration of a reporting restrictions order being until further order as in the Transparency Pilot.  If a member or representative of the media seek a change that permits wider or unlimited reporting they have a limited pool of people who they can seek consent from, whereas the parties cannot practically obtain consent to a continued or tighter order.</p>

He mentions a practice of Peter Jackson J of doing this and providing that the injunction lasts until a month after the death of P in a serious medical treatment case.  An alternative would be to provide that it lasts until judgment on the substantive issues.  On both alternatives, and in any event, it seems to me that the terms, including the duration of the injunction, should be revisited at the substantive hearing or when judgment is given because it is only then that it will be known what (a) the nature and extent of the COP’s invasion into the private and family life of P, P’s family and others has been, (b) the relevant issues and decisions are and (c) the impact of any reporting restrictions on the competing Article 8 and Article 10 rights are likely to be in that case.</p>

In order to engage the interest of members of the public in the kinds of issues the court decides, it is however necessary to publish articles and reports that people actually want to read. That means telling our readers about the facts of the cases, including the real people and places involved, and sometimes publishing pictures that relate to these people and places.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">Where proceedings are anonymised, it is more difficult to engage our readers as the real people involved in the cases are necessarily invisible and the stories therefore lack a vital human dimension. It is human nature to find it more difficult to take an interest in a story about problems arising from, say, dementia or the right to die if the story does not feature identifiable individuals. If we cannot publish stories about important issues that people are drawn to read, this will inevitably limit and reduce the quality of public debate around these issues. It is in my view important in a democratic society that we should encourage informed debate I believe that the media, including the popular press, fulfils a vital function in this regard. By reading about the experiences of others, readers are likely to be able to identify with those people and understand what they are going through. But they are much less engaged - and correspondingly less focused on the surrounding public debate - where they cannot identify with real people, places and events. Pictures are a hugely potent way of engaging readers and one of the problems with covering anonymised cases is that it is impossible to include pictures in our stories which identify those involved.</span>

In various cases that has been held to be a matter of weight in respect of witnesses seeking to protect their own personal safety. However, in this case, the inquest to be held is into the killing of a child, L, in the situation where a High Court Judge has already found as a matter of fact that the mother was responsible for L's death and the application is made because harm is indirectly apprehended to a child who is a stranger to the investigative process.

Accordingly, as I have done before and others have done, I emphasise this and record that the difficulties that the solicitor for the media Respondents describes in connection with obtaining a copy of the sealed order (or a copy of the order in the terms actually made rather than the draft served when notification of the application heard by Moor J was given) from the solicitors acting for the NHS Trust and the Applicant are regrettable.</p>

It is however clear from what I have been told that counsel for the Applicant had thought about the notice point and concluded that it was appropriate to make a without notice application. He tried to do so to the applications court; but was turned away and so had to pursue an out of hours application given the urgency and the nature and extent of the media interest.  So, although Theis J disagreed with him, I consider that counsel for the Applicant acted properly and I add that in my view some of his reasons for acting as he did and which he acknowledges he could have explained them better to Theis J were properly arguable.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It also seems to me that many of the points made in my note on notification of the media could apply to the making of a PD 13A Reporting Restrictions Order on the first directions hearing.  My experience is that the media (apart from the Press Association) rarely attend such hearings and I am not aware of a case where the order has been objected to on such a hearing.  Indeed, although the existing precedent of a PD 13A Reporting Restrictions Order is not used rigidly its general overall effect is accepted as a standard or default position that is based on established and solid legal foundations (i.e. the COP Rules and the <span style="font-style:italic">Scott v Scott </span>exceptions).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is at least arguable that under the PD 13A procedure prior notification of an application at the first directions hearing for a PD 13A Reporting Restrictions Order adds little, if anything, to service of the order particularly if that order and the listing information contains a description of the subject matter of the proceedings (and so mirrors the Transparency Pilot).  Urgency, particularly if substantive relief is sought on the first or an early directions hearing may require notice of that hearing but equally may provide the “compelling reason” why notice was not given.  Different issues arise when, as in this case, an application is made after judgment and the expiry of the original reporting restrictions order.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Even in urgent cases, and many serious medical treatment cases are urgent, it is the substantive issues and the content of the evidence that informs the balance that that has to be carried out between Articles 8 and 10.  This means that it is unlikely that this balancing exercise can be properly argued and considered at a directions hearing and so disputes on the grant / extent of reporting restrictions are likely to be best dealt with at later stages of the proceedings. </p>

And when that order follows a standard process referred to in a practice direction or rules it seems to me that:</p>
