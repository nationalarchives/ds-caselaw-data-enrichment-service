	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This case concerns an individual SRK who was severely injured in a road traffic accident.  The effects of those injuries are that (a) he lacks capacity to make decisions on the regime of care, treatment and support that he should receive (SRK’s care regime), and (b) applying the approach in <span style="font-style:italic">Cheshire West </span>(see <span style="font-style:italic">Surrey County Council v P and others; Cheshire West and Chester Council v P and another </span>[2014] UKSC 19, [2014] AC 896), SRK’s care regime creates, on an objective assessment, a deprivation of liberty.  SRK was awarded substantial damages that were paid to his property and affairs deputy (the third Respondent IMTC).  He lives at a property that has been bought and adapted for him. His regime of care and support there is provided by private sector providers.  The damages funded that purchase and adaptation and fund that regime of care.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The issue is whether this situation on the ground is a deprivation of liberty that has to be authorised by the Court of Protection (the COP) by it making a welfare order.  The test that the COP would apply in making such an order is whether SRK’s care regime is the least restrictive available option to best promote his best interests.  The same test applies to the decision makers on the ground.  It is common ground that at present SRK’s care regime satisfies that test.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">If the COP makes such a welfare order it will include provisions concerning when and how it is to be reviewed.  It is likely that SRK’s regime of care and support will always create an objective deprivation of liberty and that he will never have capacity to make decisions about it.  However, from time to time issue are likely to arise on what changes should be made to that regime to ensure that it remains the least restrictive available option.</p>

This is because the court that awards the damages, the COP when appointing a property and affairs deputy and the deputy or the trustees or attorney or other person to whom the damages are paid should take steps to ensure (a) that the relevant local authority with duties to safeguard adults knows of the regime of care, and (b) that if, as here, the least restrictive available care regime to best promote P’s best interests creates a situation on the ground that satisfies the objective and subjective components of a deprivation of liberty (and so a derivation of liberty within Article 5) a welfare order based on that regime of care is made by the COP.</p>

In that case the issue was described as whether the domestic care at home by their parents of a child and an adult in the same family amounted to a deprivation of liberty that engaged the protection of Article 5.  I agree that Munby J’s conclusions on the nature of the role and involvement of the local authority in respect of the adult are relevant and apply to the existing regime of law and regulation in England and Wales although they pre-date the Care Act 2014 and other current legislation.  It was not argued that the involvement of the Care Quality Commission (the CQC) (which also has responsibilities under the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (the DOLS)) made any relevant difference and I do not think it does.  </p>

There is no requirement to fix the exact purpose of admission (for example, for assessment or for treatment) and, consistently, no limits in terms of time, treatment or care attach to that admission. Nor is there any specific provision requiring a continuing clinical assessment of the persistence of a disorder warranting detention. The appointment of a representative of a patient who could make certain objections and applications on his or her behalf is a procedural protection accorded to those committed involuntarily under the 1983 Act and which would be of equal importance for patients who are legally incapacitated and have, as in the present case, extremely limited communication abilities.</span>

While the Court does not question the good faith of those professionals or that they acted in what they considered to be the applicant’s best interests, the very purpose of procedural safeguards is to protect individuals against any “misjudgments and professional lapses” (Lord Steyn, paragraph 49 above).</span>

On the other hand, it has also noted the Government’s understandable concern (outlined in paragraph 80 above) to avoid the full, formal and inflexible impact of the 1983 Act. However, the current reform proposals set out to answer the above-mentioned concerns of the Government while at the same time making provision for detailed procedural regulation of the detention of incapacitated individuals (see, in particular, the Mental Capacity Bill described in paragraphs 77-78 above).</span>

It seems to me that in most cases this possibility would not help much because all it would do is add a person on the ground with obligations to monitor and review the (private) deprivation of liberty.

This is a core part of the MCA aimed at promoting decisions on the ground in connection with care and treatment of persons who lack capacity and it effectively results in such decisions being treated as ones that a person with capacity had consented to.

It is not easy to give an accurate estimate of the number of such cases. IMTC acts as a property and affairs deputy in a number of cases (approximately 9% of the professional deputyships across the country). It estimates that it has 25 cases in the same class as SRK’s and thus cases in which P lives in their own home with a 24-hour care regime entirely funded privately with no ostensible state involvement in the arrangements.  If this represents 9% of that class it would mean that there would be between 250 and 300 similar cases across the country.  But this does not include cases managed by either a lay deputy (about 47% of the total number of deputy cases currently supervised by the Office of the Public Guardian) or trustees or an attorney. I do not know how often lay deputies are appointed by the COP in cases when the damages awarded to P are substantial or how many of those awards are paid to trustees or attorneys.</p>

This informed the COP that the settlement resulted in a large capital award and a significant award of periodical payments throughout SRK’s life.  The evidence confirmed that the property referred to in the evidence supporting the application for appointment of IMTC as SRK’s deputy had been purchased, that part of the damages award would be spent on adapting the property and that it was thought that SRK would move in in December 2012. The statement also set out information relating to SRK’s capital and income which includes some state benefits and exhibited a proposed budget from December 2012 which includes payments for his support workers and treatment and identifies the balance to be met from capital deducting his monthly income of about £21,000. By that application IMTC did not seek any order or direction and pointed out that it was made because of the condition included in the order appointing it a deputy dated 9 June 2011. </p>

From 29 July 1977 to 5 April 1979, the Applicant (then 18 years old) was placed in a locked ward of a private psychiatric institution, in Bremen, at her father's demand who believed her to be suffering from a psychosis. The applicant's mother had suffered from a paranoid-hallucinatory psychosis. Under the relevant domestic law that clinic was not entitled to detain patients who were to be kept in accordance with the Act of the <span style="font-style:italic">Land</span> Bremen on the detention of mentally insane persons, mentally deficient persons and drug addicts.

That court allowed the applicant's action for damages, as her detention had been illegal under German law and found that her detention would only have been legal if she had consented to it and that she had not.  The Bremen Court of Appeal disagreed with the Bremen Regional Court's finding that the Applicant had illegally been deprived of her liberty during her stay and treatment in the clinic.  On appeal by the Applicant to it the Federal Court of Justice refused to admit the Applicant's appeal.

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">, cited above, p. 22, § 57). It agrees with the parties that in the present case, there are three aspects which could engage Germany's responsibility under the Convention for the applicant's detention in the private clinic in Bremen. Firstly, the deprivation of liberty could be imputable to the State </span>
	      <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt">due to the direct involvement of public authorities in the applicant's detention. </span>
	      <span style="font-size:10pt">Secondly, the State could be found</span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">in the compensation proceedings brought by the applicant,</span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At the heart of the ECtHR’s reasoning on direct involvement and the breach of the State’s positive obligations is the intervention by the police returning the Applicant to the private clinic.  Indeed, the finding of direct involvement seems to be based solely on that because the comments that, at that time, there was no system providing for supervision by the State of the lawfulness of the confinement and that the police intervention did not lead to any such control relate to the later finding that the State had violated its positive obligations.  But, in any event, the approach taken to direct involvement shows that there is a need to identify specific acts of direct involvement by the State (see also <span style="font-style:italic">Riera Blume v Spain </span>[2000] 32 EHHR at paragraphs 32 and 35).</p>

In addition, the Court has had occasion to observe that the first sentence of Article 5 § 1 must be construed as laying down a positive obligation on the State to protect the liberty of those within its jurisdiction. Otherwise, there would be a sizeable gap in the protection from arbitrary detention, which would be inconsistent with the importance of personal liberty in a democratic society. The State is therefore obliged to take measures providing effective protection of vulnerable persons, including reasonable steps to prevent a deprivation of liberty of which the authorities have or ought to have knowledge (see </span>

In this case, the competent health authority also had supervisory powers to control the execution of these court orders. However, in the applicant's case, the clinic, despite the lack of the applicant's consent, had not obtained the necessary court order. Therefore, no public health officer had ever assessed whether the applicant – what was more than doubtful – posed a serious threat to public safety or order within the meaning of Article 2 of the Act of the </span>

Moreover, a victim could, under German civil law, claim compensation in tort for damage caused by an unlawful detention. However, the Court, having regard to the importance of the right to liberty, does not consider such retrospective measures alone as providing effective protection for individuals in such a vulnerable position as the applicant. It notes that particularly in the Act of the </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt"> Bremen on the detention of mentally insane persons, mentally deficient persons and drug addicts, there were numerous – necessary – safeguards for persons detained in a mental institution following a court order. However, these safeguards did not apply in the more critical cases of persons confined to a psychiatric institution without such an order. It must be borne in mind that the applicant, once detained and treated with strong antipsychotic medicaments, had no longer been in a position to secure independent outside help.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">106.  </span>
	      <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt">The lack of any effective State control is most strikingly shown by the fact that on 4 March 1979 the police, by the use of force, had brought back the applicant to her place of detention from which she had escaped. </span>
	      <span style="font-size:10pt">Thereby, public authorities, as already shown above, had been involved in the applicant's detention in the clinic, without her flight and obvious unwillingness to return having entailed any control of the lawfulness of her forced stay in the clinic.</span>
	      <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt"> This discloses the great danger of abuse in this field, notably in cases like that of the applicant, in which family conflicts and an identity crisis had been at the root of her troubles and long detention in a psychiatric hospital. The Court is therefore not convinced that the control exercised by State authorities merely in connection with the issuing of a licence for the conduct of a private clinic pursuant to Section 30 of the Act regulating the Conduct of Trade sufficed to ensure a competent and regular supervisory control against a deprivation of liberty in such a clinic.</span>
	      <span style="font-size:10pt"> Moreover, Section 30 of the Act regulating the Conduct of Trade as such had not been in force at the beginning of the applicant's detention in the clinic.</span>

In particular, visiting commissions were created to inspect psychiatric institutions, to control whether the rights of patients were respected and to give patients the opportunity to raise complaints. However, these mechanisms came too late for the applicant.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">At the end of the day, the question with which I am here concerned is whether, if there is any deprivation of liberty in these cases, that is something for which the State – the local authority – is responsible. It is in that context that, as I readily accept, I need to explore the ambit of the positive obligations attaching to local authorities by virtue of Article 5. But it is not necessary for me to embark upon any more general analysis of the possible reach of Article 5, and it is in fact undesirable that I do so. That exercise raises issues which are not before me and which are properly to be explored as and when the occasion arises. Moreover, it is not the function of judges to draft practice manuals for public authorities. Mr Bowen will, I trust, forgive me if I therefore take matters quite shortly.</span>

What is reasonable and proportionate in the circumstances will, of course, depend upon the context, but it might for example, Mr Bowen suggests, require the local authority to exercise its statutory powers and duties so as to provide support services for the carers that will enable inappropriate restrictions to be ended, or at least minimised. </span>

But, and this is a key message, whatever the positive obligations of a local authority under Article 5 may be, they do not clothe it with any power to regulate, control, compel, restrain, confine or coerce. A local authority which seeks to do so must either point to specific statutory authority for what it is doing – and, as I have pointed out, such statutory powers are, by and large, lacking in cases such as this – or obtain the appropriate sanction of the court. Of course if there is immediate threat to life or limb a local authority will be justified in taking protective (including compulsory) steps: </span>

Social workers need to keep their eyes open and their professional antennae alert when meeting or visiting their clients. And if there is real cause for concern they must act quickly and decisively.
