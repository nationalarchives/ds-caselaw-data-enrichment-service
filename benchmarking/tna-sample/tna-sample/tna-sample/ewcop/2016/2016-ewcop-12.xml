Finally, insofar as Sir Alan Ward and Arden LJ were suggesting that the test of the patient's wishes and feelings was an objective one, what the reasonable patient would think, again I respectfully disagree. The purpose of the best interests test is to consider matters from the patient's point of view. That is not to say that his wishes must prevail, any more than those of a fully capable patient must prevail. We cannot always have what we want. Nor will it always be possible to ascertain what an incapable patient's wishes are. Even if it is possible to determine what his views were in the past, they might well have changed in the light of the stresses and strains of his current predicament. In this case, the highest it could be put was, as counsel had agreed, that "It was likely that Mr James would want treatment up to the point where it became hopeless". But insofar as it is possible to ascertain the patient's wishes and feelings, his beliefs and values or the things which were important to him, it is those which should be taken into account because they are a component in making the choice which is right for him as an individual human being.’ </span>

And common sense surely indicates that the longer a vulnerable adult's partner, family or carer have looked after her without the State having perceived the need for its intervention, the more carefully must any proposals for intervention be scrutinised and the more cautious the court should be before accepting too readily the assertion that the State can do better than the partner, family or carer.  </span>

That said, the law must always be astute to protect the weak and helpless, not least in circumstances where, as often happens in such cases, the very people they need to be protected from are their own relatives, partners or friends: NS v MI (2006) EWHC 1646 (Fam), (2007) 1 FLR 444, at para (8).  </span>

Her ‘predominant feeling is that she wants to feel safe and secure and she feels that at E Care Home. She needs to know that someone is around to help.

At home getting her out of the house had been ‘a major achievement’. She had been unwilling to attend a day centre and did not develop friendships and relationships. She became withdrawn and possibly depressed in 2013 and 2014, partly because of the difficult family dynamics. If she returned home, she would again be alone for periods during the day because her home is too small to facilitate a carer being present at all times. </p>

She fears being alone and it would not take long for her emotional well-being to decline, possibly as little as 4-6 weeks. Furthermore, given the rapidity of mental decline between around March 2014 and August 2015 referred to in Dr TS’s psychiatric report, it would only be ‘a matter of time’ before she required a move back into residential care. </p>

The task-focused nature of her needs was straightforward. Her need for emotional support and reassurance was not and E Care Home provides for this. Indeed, she probably needs less reassurance at the care home because she can see the staff. </p>

The care home notes did not reveal a constant need for reassurance or attention and a robust care package at home could prevent her from becoming socially isolated. The family dynamics had been managed and there was no real concern that the historical problems of confrontation within her own home would re-emerge. The evidence that RB now needs 24-hour support ‘was not particularly compelling’ and meeting her physical needs had not been the primary focus of the case. </p>

Mr Hatchman said that she was a different person now. At home she had been depressed and uncommunicative, at E she was chatting and smiling and one could see her personality. The Official Solicitor’s attendance notes from 2012, 2014 and 2015 tended to bear this out. Looking at the history of life at home, there was a risk that she would lose these considerable benefits at home. The attempts of core carers to address her social isolation at home had not been successful and it was difficult to get her to go out if she resisted that. Consequently, she had become depressed. At E social interaction at home was always there. </p>

He submits that, ‘In the absence of any solid or compelling evidence’ that RB’s wishes and feelings have actually altered from what they were in 2013, ‘there is no foundation for reaching the conclusion that her position as to where she would like to reside has changed’. He tells me that his mother confirms that she wants to go home when he puts the question to her and that at times Mr Fisher has unduly influenced her.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Away from R Close, her memories of home seem to be fragmentary. When she is prompted and asked to focus there are times that she has some recollection of her one-bedroom flat, for example during her interview with Mrs S on 19 October 2015, and she may say that she wants to go home. However, even then her attention and recall are quite fleeting and disturbed by disorientation:  ‘Mrs S asked RB if she knew where she was living <span style="font-style:italic">at the moment</span>. She replied, “I think it is R Close”.’ </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The degree of disorientation, and in particular RB’s confusion as to where she is now residing, is quite pronounced. On 4 April 2015 she thought home was ‘High Road bungalow’. On other occasions she seems to think that E Care Home is R Close and that she is living at R Close. On yet other occasions home is in the West Indies with her mother. Consequently, when she has expressed a wish to go home on several occasions since February 2015 often it is in order to be reunited with her mother (interview with Ms Taner on 27 February 2015; interview with Ms H on 4 April 2015; care home email dated 12 May 2015; interview with Mr Hatchman on 2 June 2015; interview with Dr TS on 17 August 2015). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Because RB’s expressed wishes have been difficult to interpret at times, it is particularly instructive to consider her present feelings. How does she feel at present? What do her demeanour and non-verbal behaviour indicate? Does she appear happy or sad, content or discontented, angry or calm? How does she seem to feel about her life at E Care Home? Is she anxious, distressed, frustrated, asking to leave, expressing dissatisfaction? What questions does she ask about her home and life without being led or prompted? </p>

She enjoys her current life for the most part (how she lives) and, if she could analyse her situation more fully, the importance for her of where she now lives probably lies in its impact on how she lives: does she have company, does she enjoy the company, feel secure and cared for, content, have access to her family and so on? </p>

I want someone to keep me company in case something goes wrong’). Although she could eventually readjust to living at R Close, she would be sad to leave her current carers and friends and it is likely she would feel anxious, more vulnerable, isolated and more depressed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The relevance and significance of an incapacitated person’s previous wishes, feelings, beliefs and values from a period when they had capacity varies from person to person. In a case where a devout Jehovah’s Witness is unconscious and a decision is being made about whether a blood transfusion should be given, the person’s beliefs and values prior to becoming unconscious are of great significance. In a case such as RB’s they must be balanced against the person’s present wishes and feelings. In RB’s case I give more weight to my finding that she is happy and content at E Care Home and feels at home there than I do to speculating about what she would now make of her present situation if she briefly had the capacity to assess her current incapacity and circumstances and was in possession of all relevant facts. I expect but cannot know that she would approach it as I have tried to do and would choose the option she feels is most likely to promote her happiness. </p>

He has always impressed me as compassionate and dedicated in his care for his mother and again that was very apparent.

His mother had asked not to have evening care and at the time she had, or was believed to have, capacity to make such decisions (MG’s assessment just over one month before concluded that RB had capacity to live as she chose). It had been agreed with VW, a local authority mental health social worker for older persons, that RB’s care would consist of a morning visit and a lunch-time visit, i.e. no evening visit. PB was willing and able to provide the evening care and he was providing RB with a home cooked meal, which she preferred, and putting her to bed. Despite his mother’s wishes and this agreement, the carer company continued to send out carers in the evenings. These carers were young and inexperienced and were unable to provide the care that RB needed. All of this was communicated to the company but they continued to send carers. PB became increasingly frustrated as he felt that he was banging his head against a wall. </p>

He was ‘very aggressive and out of control … shouting at the top of his voice.’ ‘I couldn’t get a rational response from him. He kept saying that L needed to be controlled.’ ‘I felt unsafe around him because he was so aggressive and verbally aggressive and what I was saying had no effect on him, it didn’t sway him. I felt that he was out-of-control and I was worried that he would lash out at me.’ She felt that if she pushed any further, ‘he might have retaliated.’ His mother ‘was anxious and nervous and couldn’t calm her son down. She was upset and telling him to go home. He did not threaten to hit me and nor did he hit me. It was the volume. I tried to calm him down, using all my experience.’ PB ‘was shouting. He would not respond to me so I had to call the police.  ‘We got L to sit down, then I explained to PB that the police were being called because I was not getting through. He was shouting that he wanted to talk to the police. PT told PB, ‘This is a residential home for the elderly. You can’t behave like this … I went to the office and dialled 999. He was hyper, not in control … PB replied that he wanted to speak to the police. I walked away to make the call, PB walked behind me, shouting and saying that he had been hit. I went to my office. He came down with his mother behind him. I was concerned about his aggressive behaviour. Reception staff came to see what was happening.’ His mother said, ‘Calm down, Paul; Go home, Paul.’ While in PT’s office, he was given some paper and ‘began to write down what is written here, while the police were on their way. He started to write out a complaint about the incident just before the police arrived. He was now much calmer than before.’ He then gave PT his note, which appears in the bundle at C/113: </p>

There was no evidence that he has lied about that.

The first she knew of an incident occurring was ‘when I overheard RB’s son shouting aggressively to L never to touch him again.’ This is consistent with PB’s note at the time, ‘L tried to put his arm round &amp; he was goading me.’ As counsel for the Official Solicitor implied, it is unlikely that L did more than that, given that PB did not record having been punched and nor can any of those present recall him shouting out that he had been punched. The fact that PB picked up a chair and pointed it at L, but did not strike L, is consistent with using the chair as a barrier or block, in self-defence.  PB had accepted many of the allegations put to him and therefore some weight was to be given to his consistent assertion that he was acting in self-defence. Given the location (a facility for frail, older, people), L’s mental health, age and circumstances and the distress caused to his mother and other persons present, in my view PB’s reaction was excessive and reflected his problems with anger management, shouting and swearing. </p>

PB’s counsel reminded me that PB’s sisters were, and are, privy to the lawyers’ conversations because they are acting in person. They are personally involved in the discussions about changes to the care regime or order and this can make PB feel excluded and disadvantaged.  The sisters had made serious untoward allegations about PB which he resented. With more active management, the incident ‘could have been nipped in the bud.‘ I accept Mr H’s account. I found him to be calm, balanced and ready to concede valid points. Unfortunately, the behaviour alleged by the local authority in allegation 12 is not a one-off within these proceedings. </p>

When PB asked where I was taking RB, his tone changed and RB changed her mind: “No, my mum doesn’t want to go.” PB was shouting loudly and RB was upset. He threw the papers around, saying, ‘where is the new care plan?’ Then RB asked about the care plan. PB was getting really angry and was shouting until the police arrived. He shouted for a few minutes. RB said, “why are you swearing?” I can’t remember which swear words he used. I simply remember RB crying and saying, “stop swearing.” RB was crying for a few minutes and seemed overwhelmed by the whole situation. I went into the bedroom to put some clothes away. PB started doing some chicken wings while waiting for the police. He was still agitated but had calmed down.  RB was still emotional and asking why when I left, after 45-60 minutes.

She wrote the hairdresser’s appointment down on RB’s calendar. PB had been using that time of the week to visit his mother. He turned up expecting to see his mother there. He was frustrated and went into another room, the kitchen. He was shouting and kept saying, ‘Where is the care plan.’ He was upset that he was not able to see his mother as per the care plan. He asked RD to contact the office. Initially he said, ‘Hurry up and bring her back to see me,’ but his tone of voice then made his mother change her mind.  </p>

He did not shout at RD but he did say to her, ‘You can leave if you like; there’s no care plan in place.’ RD replied that she was not leaving and said that she was taking his mother to the hairdresser’s. At that point, RB said that she wasn’t going. RD made some phone calls. The only care plan there was one done the previous year by EC. </p>

He accepted that he hadn’t left the property even though RD was there. He was pacing around the property and shouting and he threw the case notes to the floor. His mother was upset and told him to calm down; she didn’t tell him to stop swearing.  He was not trying to intimidate RD by raising his voice; ‘I was upset with myself.’  He denied that he was unable to communicate with people calmly and that his only method of sorting a problem out was to shout. </p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0.00in;margin-right:0.04in">I agree with Ms Bhogal, counsel for the local authority, that the consistent theme is PB’s confrontational approach and ‘manner of communication’ when challenged or frustrated: his tone, volume, demeanour, volatility and offensive language.  His behaviour often upsets his mother, sisters and professional carers, or alienates them, so as to reduce his chances of achieving the changes he seeks.  </p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0.00in;margin-right:0.04in">I also agree with Mr Buttler, counsel for the Official Solicitor, that a key issue is whether his conduct indicates that ‘without an injunctive order there will be an obstacle to the provision of care to RB. That is why we are going down this fact-finding route.’ According to Mr Buttler, ‘PB’s inability to express his views without losing his temper indicates the need for such an order. If he is not getting his way there is a real chance that he will shout and swear at people.’ </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:-0.00in;margin-right:0.04in">I do not believe that all of the current problems within the family can be laid at PB’s feet. However, it would not be appropriate or helpful to say more at this stage. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0.00in;margin-right:0.04in">I do believe that PB has made genuine attempts to modify his behaviour and to observe the court’s orders since December 2011, when I first participated in a hearing in this case. He is a devoted son and has taken very good care of his mother over the years. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:-0.00in;margin-right:0.04in">Without compliance, the end point of any enforcement strategy is committal to prison for breaches of the court’s order. Therefore, I would ask PB to consider the only real alternative, which is to accept the help recommended by Dr S. To me, that is likely to be a much more constructive way forward.  </p>

At the end of that exercise the judge should be better placed to strike a balance between the sum of the certain and possible gains against the sum of the certain and possible losses.

It was around this time, however, that PB himself saw a psychiatrist, Dr LS (see below).

PB reacted by lifting a chair and pointing it at the resident and telling him to back off. Because of his problems with self-control, anger management, shouting and swearing, PB’s reaction to the resident’s behaviour was disproportionate, having regard to the location (a facility for frail, older, people), the resident’s mental health, age and circumstances and the distress caused to his mother and others.

These factors include the extent to which Mr B is capable of complying with court orders concerning his mother's contact and care, whether his mental health would preclude committal to prison because of the suffering it would cause him, whether committal would do any good. Is any purpose likely to be served by such a strategy, i.e. is there a chance that he would then modify his behaviour?

An 'unless order' might be along the lines of requiring Mr B to partake in treatment, e.g. an anger management programme, as a condition of contact with his mother, or limiting his contact with her in the event of breaches unless and until his compliance improves. </span>

The inequality lay in their willingness to be involved and interact. The local authority’s position that all of them should be on an equal footing was, therefore, the wrong starting-point.

The obvious solution was to have RB’s care provided by her family and in particular the family member who said that he would like to do it. Mr H had said that he did not ‘discount that’. </p>

He has, I feel, done his best and, after the event, he is usually contrite and apologises very nicely. That does not, however, affect the fact that he has a very significant problem with self-control and how he expresses himself. Although most experienced lawyers and social workers have seen it all before, and take it in their stride, care agency staff, family members and more tender or inexperienced professionals may be frightened or intimidated. There is a real risk of carers withdrawing their services and/or being unable to work constructively with him at certain times.

The final hearing listed for 13-15 December 2011 had to be adjourned, at least in part, because of the local authority’s failure to provide Mrs B’s social care records in time.  In February 2012, the independent social work expert recorded communication difficulties which had caused him inordinate organisational problems, ‘possibly emanating from the local authority’. On 16 March 2012, the Official Solicitor applied, with the consent of the other parties, for the final hearing to be postponed, because the local authority’s evidence had been filed late.

By analogy, if a patient expects or hopes that a particular drug will cure him of his illness, rather than alleviate the worst symptoms, he but not his doctor may later consider that the treatment was a failure. What constitutes failure depends on how failure is to be measured, e.g. failure to restore normal health or failure to improve the patient’s function in certain key areas. </p>

I have already found that RB has expressed a strong and clear wish to remain in her own home; that her relatively simple needs make it realistic to provide care in that setting; that to allow her children or anyone else to disrupt and destabilise her home life and care so that she loses her home would violate her right to respect for her home and private life; and that, where the perpetrator has capacity to choose how to behave, the loss or reduction of contact, painful as it would be for their mother, would be something they themselves had caused. If it comes to it, it is likely that RB will be happier living in her own home with less contact with her children than in a more institutionalised setting. She would be upset to have little or no contact with a loved child but less upset than ‘being taken into care’ through no fault of her own, because they were disrupting her care. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.04in">I am conscious that Court of Protection orders made by puisne judges in serious cases do quite often authorise a local authority (without appointing it as a deputy) to suspend contact with a particular person, provide for supervised contact to take place, or have a contact schedule attached to them. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.04in">The rationale behind orders authorising a local authority to suspend contact, without appointing it as a deputy is, presumably, that it is a decision for the court, and made by it. Although the authority is given a discretion as to when and how to give effect to the court’s decision, in the same way that a surgeon authorised to perform an operation on an incapacitated person has a discretion as to when and how to perform it, the court has already decided the disputed matter on P’s behalf. The local authority and its officers are simply acting on, and carrying out, a decision made for P by the court, not being deputised to decide the issue brought before the court of whether contact may be suspended.  Provided the local authority stays within the boundaries of the court’s decision, such a provision does not make it the 'decision-maker' any more than a decision that it is in P’s best interests to undergo surgery makes the surgeon the ‘decision-maker’ because s/he has control of the operational detail. Ditto, conveying someone to prison in pursuance of a court order (it is not the gaoler's decision), executing a warrant, etc. The court has decided what is to be done, determined the matter in question, resolved on the action to be taken, etc.  All that is left to do is to implement that decision. </p>

This will give it clear authority to co-ordinate and refine a workable care plan and contact schedule, without their decisions on such matters being continually appealed to a judge. During this year, I hope that the care plan can include mediation and/or other strategies that may gradually reduce the amount of conflict between family members and paid carers. If all concerned can try to make that work, it may not be necessary to ‘renew’ the deputyship. </p>

That seems to me to offend against the requirement that the powers conferred by me on the deputy should be as limited in scope and duration 'as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.' If such a condition becomes necessary, because the care plan is becoming unviable, it would be more appropriate for the judge to make a one-off order after proper argument and consideration, rather than to give a local authority or individual a power of such a scope. In any case, PB is presently undergoing some form of psychological treatment. </p>

The other strategy is that when he feels the urge to shout, he should immediately leave the room or building for a few minutes, returning only when he feels more calm. </p>

His mother had asked not to have evening care and at the time she had, or was believed to have, capacity to make such decisions (MG’s assessment just over one month before concluded that RB had capacity to live as she chose). It had been agreed with VW, a local authority mental health social worker for older persons, that RB’s care would consist of a morning visit and a lunch-time visit, i.e. no evening visit. PB was willing and able to provide the evening care and he was providing RB with a home cooked meal, which she preferred, and putting her to bed. Despite his mother’s wishes and this agreement, the carer company continued to send out carers in the evenings. These carers were young and inexperienced and were unable to provide the care that RB needed. All of this was communicated to the company but they continued to send carers. PB became increasingly frustrated as he felt that he was banging his head against a wall. </p>

I felt that he was out-of-control and I was worried that he would lash out at me.’ She felt that if she pushed any further, ‘he might have retaliated.’ His mother ‘was anxious and nervous and couldn’t calm her son down. She was upset and telling him to go home. He did not threaten to hit me and nor did he hit me. It was the volume. I tried to calm him down, using all my experience.’ PB ‘was shouting. He would not respond to me so I had to call the police.  ‘We got L to sit down, then I explained to PB that the police were being called because I was not getting through. He was shouting that he wanted to talk to the police. PT told PB, ‘This is a residential home for the elderly. You can’t behave like this … I went to the office and dialled 999.

He came down with his mother behind him. I was concerned about his aggressive behaviour. Reception staff came to see what was happening.’ His mother said, ‘Calm down, Paul; Go home, Paul.’ While in PT’s office, he was given some paper and ‘began to write down what is written here, while the police were on their way.

The first she knew of an incident occurring was ‘when I overheard RB’s son shouting aggressively to L never to touch him again.’ This is consistent with PB’s note at the time, ‘L tried to put his arm round &amp; he was goading me.’ As counsel for the Official Solicitor implied, it is unlikely that L did more than that, given that PB did not record having been punched and nor can any of those present recall him shouting out that he had been punched. The fact that PB picked up a chair and pointed it at L, but did not strike L, is consistent with using the chair as a barrier or block, in self-defence.  PB had accepted many of the allegations put to him and therefore some weight was to be given to his consistent assertion that he was acting in self-defence. Given the location (a facility for frail, older, people), L’s mental health, age and circumstances and the distress caused to his mother and other persons present, in my view PB’s reaction was excessive and reflected his problems with anger management, shouting and swearing. </p>

He ‘saw PB raise his voice and become verbally aggressive. He interrupted CL’s and DB’s conversation, saying “That’s all lies” … I’m the only one who cares about mum; the only one who does anything.’ He was speaking in a loud voice and with an aggressive tone and manner, providing a commentary on what they were saying for slightly less than ten minutes.  He did not swear or physically threaten his sisters. DB was tearful and visibly upset. CL was also upset but Mr H did not see her in tears. The Official Solicitor’s counsel walked out of the room with the two sisters and, after that, it did not take PB long to calm down. Mr H said that he had been involved with the family for two years. He was shocked ‘and did not expect it in a court of law. I’ve always had a civil relationship with him. I can operate with him but he and his sisters do not get on.’ </p>

He remained where he was when CL and DB left the room. He said that he only interrupted once and that his sisters did not ask him to calm down. He did not see DB crying and denied making her cry: ‘You can’t blame me. It’s not my fault.’ </p>

PB’s counsel reminded me that PB’s sisters were, and are, privy to the lawyers’ conversations because they are acting in person. They are personally involved in the discussions about changes to the care regime or order and this can make PB feel excluded and disadvantaged.  The sisters had made serious untoward allegations about PB which he resented. With more active management, the incident ‘could have been nipped in the bud.‘ I accept Mr H’s account. I found him to be calm, balanced and ready to concede valid points. Unfortunately, the behaviour alleged by the local authority in allegation 12 is not a one-off within these proceedings. </p>

He shouted for a few minutes. RB said, “why are you swearing?” I can’t remember which swear words he used. I simply remember RB crying and saying, “stop swearing.” RB was crying for a few minutes and seemed overwhelmed by the whole situation. I went into the bedroom to put some clothes away.

He was frustrated and went into another room, the kitchen. He was shouting and kept saying, ‘Where is the care plan.’ He was upset that he was not able to see his mother as per the care plan. He asked RD to contact the office. Initially he said, ‘Hurry up and bring her back to see me,’ but his tone of voice then made his mother change her mind.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:-0.00in;margin-right:0.04in">I agree with Ms Bhogal, counsel for the local authority, that the consistent theme is PB’s confrontational approach and ‘manner of communication’ when challenged or frustrated: his tone, volume, demeanour, volatility and offensive language.  His behaviour often upsets his mother, sisters and professional carers, or alienates them, so as to reduce his chances of achieving the changes he seeks.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0.00in;margin-right:0.04in">I also agree with Mr Buttler, counsel for the Official Solicitor, that a key issue is whether his conduct indicates that ‘without an injunctive order there will be an obstacle to the provision of care to RB. That is why we are going down this fact-finding route.’ According to Mr Buttler, ‘PB’s inability to express his views without losing his temper indicates the need for such an order. If he is not getting his way there is a real chance that he will shout and swear at people.’ </p>

Disruptions to her routines tended to upset her. She was able to say where she would like to live and had consistently expressed the same preference before and after her diagnoses. In many ways she had not changed and was the same now as when Mrs J first knew her; her personality had remained significantly intact.

The Local Authority considered that PB disrupted the paid care at home. The Judge catalogued in his judgment a number of incidents of difficult behaviour by PB in relation to the local authority, the carers and those at “B Lodge”. The local authority, notwithstanding evidence of incapacity and the commencement of proceedings, arranged with her daughters for RB to move into a sheltered housing scheme. In due course in January 2012 RB returned to her home, PB giving a number of undertakings as to his conduct. RB has remained at home and the Judge confirmed that she appeared happy to remain there. In February 2012 an independent social work report noted RB’s wish for her daughters to visit two or three times a week and that she did not wish PB to visit every other day as he had tended to do. The independent social worker recommended mediation to elevate the situation above family conflicts. Following the return home it was reported in March 2012 that PB had not interfered with RB’s care and that his behaviour had improved greatly. In May 2012 the contact schedule was noted to be working. In June 2012 a special visitor reported that RB wished to remain in contact with all her children but that she did not have capacity to make decisions about contact where the children may cause problems for her or others. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.80in;margin-right:0.00in">In August 2011 there was a medical assessment of PB identifying the assistance of psychological services and pointing to the very close relationship between him and RB. In September 2012 there was a fact finding hearing in which the Judge found the consistent theme of PB’s confrontational approach when challenged or frustrated relating to his tone, volume, demeanor, volatility and offensive language. The Judge found that his behaviour often upsets the mother, his sisters and the professional carers and alienates them so as to reduce the chance of achieving the changes he was seeking. Nonetheless the Judge found that PB had made genuine attempts to modify his behaviour and that he was a devoted son and had taken very good care of the mother over the years. He also found that not all of the current problems within the family were to be laid at PB’s feet.  In his judgment the Judge made further specified findings of fact. He found that apart perhaps from DB, all of RB’s children bear significant responsibility for the family conflicts that have brought the case to court and that the difficulties had not been generated by RB or by her care needs, but by the sensitive volatile and powerful family dynamics around her. He found that the factor of “magnetic importance” was to ensure that RB lived in her home. He found that RB’s wishes as to how much contact she wanted varied depending on the levels of conflict and interference and how upset she is at a particular time. For example she had dealt with conflicts involving PB by asking him not to visit for a while where his visits had led to conflict with people she was living among. On other occasions, he found, RB enjoyed seeing him more than two or three times a week and she likes his meals. </p>

That distinction is emphasised, I find, by the decision of Parliament as set out in the statute to permit deputies to undertake actions under one provision but not under another.  Accordingly it is necessary to determine the difference between a deputy’s arranging for a period of no contact as part of ‘determining what contact if any P is to have‘ which is permissible on the one hand, or as an act of ‘prohibiting‘ contact on the other which is impermissible for a deputy.  Such differences have been argued in terms of the intention of Parliament, in terms of the length of time implied in the two provisions, in the amount of contact that is implied, in the degree of on-going review and consideration of contact implied in the provisions, in the impact of the provision on the pre-existing level of contact affected by the application of one or other of the provisions. </p>

The Judge defined ‘to prohibit’ as referring to ‘a total cessation of contact until further order’.  In the context of controlling contact, the challenge is to find the difference between that and ‘deciding what contact if any’.  It seems to me that the word ‘prohibit’, if used in isolation, could apply to a number of situations; ‘Parking prohibited for 7 days for building works’ (a single fixed period of a number of days) ‘parking prohibited for house removal on the 21st March’(a single day), ‘Parking prohibited on Wednesdays’, (a recurring day each week) ‘Parking prohibited until further order’ (a total cessation without fixed limit of time).

In finding the meaning of the provisions it seems to me, therefore, preferable not to look for a free-standing definition of ‘to prohibit’, but rather to identify the difference between the two provisions bearing in mind the words used in each sub-section of Section 17. </p>

The actions are qualified by the surrounding words; ‘deciding what contact if any’ describes a process of determining contact presumably as part of managing it which will lead to a determination, one incident of which may be for an element of no contact; the other is described as a singular activity of ‘making an order prohibiting’.  The word ‘deciding’ permits of an on-going process where ‘making an order prohibiting’ seems more of a single act. The fact that it relates to the making of an order of course immediately places it within the court’s own processes away from the day to day work of a deputy. It would appear, I find, that an examination of the words in their context identifies section 17(1)(b) as leading to the possibility of no contact as part and parcel of managing contact on an on-going and fairly flexible basis.  Section 17(1)(c )will apply where a period is set up as more of a response to some identified cause and standing alone; 17(1)(b) will be part of  monitoring in an on-going way; 17(1)(c will be the consequence of a situation, set up to stretch forwards, with the panoply of the formality and finality of a court order; the former seeming, as part of a process, to be more subject to review or monitoring during its course.  I infer this particularly from the clear word ‘prohibiting’ unattached to any surrounding process.  These differences do not appear to be absolute or to lead to totally different situations, but demonstrate, at the least, a difference of emphasis. </p>

In the words of the Judge in paragraph 47 on page 94 of the judgment, “the courts should be slow to create a situation where a deputy has no alternative but to apply to the court for an order each and every time a dispute involving contact occurs when the purpose of appointing a deputy is to deal with and manage periodic incidents and disagreements that hopefully can be resolved”.  I find that the attribution in the statute of ‘deciding what contact if any’ to deputies and ‘prohibiting’ to the court supports the construction that the first is concerned with the day to day management of contact, taking steps to avoid conflict and support the care plan, whereas the second refers to a more strategic and long term process, such as where an action is required to create a pattern or provision as to no contact, for instance where it may be found inappropriate for a certain person to have contact, or to do so to a limited extent as part of a pattern.  Counsel for the Local Authority submits that prohibit refers to a permanent arrangement; whilst I find that this is not necessarily as clear cut as that, nonetheless it does lend itself to the sort of order that would have to be sought from the court; a more strategic and long term arrangement than would be appropriate for a deputy to take.  </p>

If a period of no contact is arranged, the longer it goes on the more it will cease to be part and parcel of contact management and acquire a life of its own. In this case Mr Simblet says that a week is disproportionate and a prohibition, Mr Buttler says it is part of regulating contact over a comparatively short period and if introduced in the appropriate way, looking at the best interests of RB and acting proportionately with a reasonable belief in the necessity to make this arrangement, it is an arrangement of contact under section 17(1)(b) and permissible.  I find that the length of time no contact goes on for is a relevant consideration in determining if the arrangement by a deputy is permissible.

In order to determine which sub-section applied the court should consider the impact of no contact as compared with what would normally happen without intervention in this family.  Mr Simblet argues that for a family where children visit their elderly relative say every 2 weeks, a restriction for up to a week would appear proportionate, but where, as here, there is a pattern of daily visits by PB and twice weekly visits from the daughters, to stop contact for an entire week amounts to a ‘prohibition’ because of its inconsistency with the context, external to the words of the statute, of the pattern of life of this family and therefore disproportionate.  However I find that the ‘life as lived’ in this case must also include the evidence both of the mother’s having asked her son to visit less frequently and of her being less welcoming of his visits when he caused a disturbance.  These are part of the range of facts found by the Judge.  </p>

I pause to note that this rather begs the question as to whether no contact for a week is a restriction or a prohibition. In this appeal and in the judgment of the Judge, the words ‘restriction’ and ‘suspension’ of contact are used, but it seems to me that in construing the statute it is preferable to consider the actual words used.

Although the authority is given a discretion as to when and how to give effect to the court’s decision,… The court has already decided the disputed matter on P’s behalf. The local authority and its officers are simply acting on, and carrying out, a decision made for P by the court, not being deputised to decide the issue brought before the court of whether contact may be suspended. Provided the local authority stays within the boundaries of the court’s decision, such a provision does not make it the ‘decision maker’ any more than a decision that it is in P’s best interests to undergo surgery makes the surgeon the ‘decision maker’ because s/he has control of the operational detail.  Ditto, conveying someone to prison in pursuance of a court order (it is not the gaoler's decision), executing a warrant, etc.  The court has decided what is to be done, determine the matter in question, resolved on the action to be taken, etc. All that is left to do is to implement that decision.” </p>

He distinguishes this process from the surgeon or gaoler here described.  I agree that the Judge is here describing a process where the court decides on an action and the Local Authority is simply the executant.  In a general way I find that this describes a process in which actions are divided between the court and the Local Authority.  I agree that if this were intended to be the reasoned basis for the Judge’s order it could be criticised for failing to recognise that even with a maximum period of 7 days set by the Court, nonetheless the Local Authority would exercise a discretion within that limit.  If this part of the Judgment had gone onto a finding that the Judge was going to authorise the Local Authority not as a deputy but simply to carry out the court’s decision of a 7 day period without contact, then of course such a finding would not recognise that the Local Authority would in fact exercise discretion as a deputy. </p>

Mr Simblet argues that the distinction between “deciding what contact if any” and “prohibiting” it is not a matter of fact and degree and a power is either in the nature of a prohibition or not.  He argues in this case that it is the provision of the judge for 7 days without contact that is a prohibition, no matter in what way the arrangement for no contact in that period is made.  I disagree.  I accept that a deputy could act in a way that would be seen as prohibiting contact for a period of a week, but I find that that would depend on the facts of a case.  If a deputy were to make a blanket ban on contact for a week without considering all the factors and conditions imposed by the Judge, without reviewing it in the light of representations made, and in the light of particular circumstances, then it may be that in a particular case a deputy could offend the provisions of the Act.  I find this is a matter of fact and degree.  Mr Simblet has not suggested what period, under section 17 (1)(b), would not, as a matter of general principle,  be a prohibition .  I find that, as matter of principle, the exercise of the power of a deputy under Section 17 (1) (b) could lawfully lead to a situation in which a particular person had no contact for 7 days depending on the circumstances of the case.  I reject the proposition that there is a general principle to be found in rendering one week automatically a prohibition.  I find in this case one should consider the whole of the judge’s order which relates to the conditions that the deputy must satisfy as well as the period without contact in itself. </p>

Here I find Mr Simblet does not argue in terms of general principle but rather of fact or degree, to the effect that to prevent RB from seeing her children for as long as a week is perverse and, Mr Simblet would say, amounts to a prohibition. Mr Simblet says one should compare the effect of what results from the control of contact with ‘the life as lived’, being in this case of a lonely old woman whose life is the visits from her children, PB 5 times a week and the daughters twice a week.  A suspension for a week can be a prohibition and when one looks at the circumstances of this case it is a prohibition, he says.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:1.29in;margin-right:0.00in">I find that if the period without contact is to fall within Section 17 (1) (b) then in order to avoid being a prohibition it must relate to the circumstances prevailing and to be part and parcel of the process of managing contact in the light of those circumstances.  It follows, I find, that the impact of such a course on the people involved is one of the facts to be considered and I accept that one of those facts is to look at the impact on the family, that is its effect on how the family lived or would have lived; the ‘life as lived’ to which Mr Simblet referred.  I find that the Judge clearly had this in mind.  As referred to earlier, the Judge had found that RB’s wishes for contact varied depending on the levels of conflict and her asking PB to not visit for a while, that on two occasions she had asked PB to not come and RB was recorded as being distressed when there was conflict on such visits.  I find that when viewing this factor on its own, it cannot be said that no contact for a week would be such a difference in the ‘life as lived’ as to be perverse or, indeed, more than the process of managing contact under Section 17 (1) (b).  Indeed I find that it would not be inconsistent with what is liable to have occurred in this family if RB had capacity and one was to reflect the ‘life as lived’.  I find it would not amount to a prohibition on its own, and in any event there are other factors that affect the exercise of discretion of the Local Authority to keep their actions within that sub-section to which I have referred. </p>

Mr Simblet submits that applying the ‘comparative’ approach to ask a visitor to leave may be possible to envision, but that it is difficult to envision the banning of one, or more important all, of a person’s children for a week.  I accept that element of ‘prohibition’ may be one of degree as to length, and that the longer an arrangement for no contact goes on, the closer it comes to a prohibition in the terms of the statute.  However the process of comparison with normal life to be relevant must, it seems to me, include the characteristics of this situation that there is a risk of substantial disturbance and conflict on visiting.  I can imagine a family making arrangements that result in limited contact and many elderly relatives are as a result, in my view, visited once a week or even after longer periods.  However, the comparison approach was not greatly argued before me, and I have found it of limited assistance in this case.  The reason is that the context of the provisions as to contact was a determination by the Judge that the most important aim was to enable RB to remain in her own home, and that this was threatened by the risk of disruptive contact.  It was the introduction of arrangements to stop contact that resulted from this aim.  No comparator was described to me, and I have not myself found a comparator, here, or comparable ‘normal life‘.  I find that the reference to the cases dealing with deprivation of liberty has been of limited assistance in this case, at least to the extent argued before me. Of more relevance is the examination, on which the parties have focused, of the comparison in fact and in this case between the pattern of life in this family and the potential effect of a period of 7 days without contact. </p>

Mr Simblet complains that although the Judge placed importance on Article 8 he did not follow this through in the decision making process. Of course the exception to this right is permitted where it is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of the rights and freedoms of others.  It seems to me that the Judge, in providing for the court to set the maximum period, was himself setting the maximum limit of interference and leaving to the deputy only the exercise within that limit. Further the judge referred to the ‘fearsome family dynamics’, and in making his order he imposed the requirement of a ‘reasonable belief this is necessary and proportionate for the purpose of reducing conflict in the home. I find that related to the balancing of the rights and freedoms of others. Article 8 provides in the exception to ‘the rights and freedoms of others’.  I find that the confining of any period to that which was necessary and proportionate in this context ensured that any period without contact would not offend Article 8.  In these circumstances it seems to me that the arrangements, properly applied, do not infringe Article 8, but are defined so as to be compliant.  It seems to me that for instance in the passage in his judgment quoted in paragraph 11 of this judgment the Judge properly addressed and applied the issues correctly in this connection. </p>

I find that this is an important ingredient in determining whether this is a Section 17 (1) (b) or 17 (1) (c) case.  </p>

I find that 7 days is proportionate where the other conditions are fulfilled.  I find that by imposing the maximum of a week the Judge was in effect providing the framework for the deputy, all other conditions being met, to be able to act under section 17 (1) (b) and avoid acting under section 17 (1) (c).   </p>

	    <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.00in">I find that the terms imposed rendered the power delegated to the deputy to be part and parcel of the management of contact and to lack the characteristics of prohibition to which I earlier referred.  Under the terms the deputy would use the power to ‘decide what contact if any’ as a management tool to avoid conflict and support the care plan on a day to day basis; he would not be making the sort of strategic or more long term decision that would otherwise be referred to the court, so as to bring his power under the judge’s order within section 17 (1) (b). </p>

Indeed I am satisfied he did not provide for prohibition by the deputy. I dismiss this appeal ________________________________ </p>
