	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">This case raises issues of life and death and so vitally important principles and strongly held views.  The decision I have to make is whether a part of the current treatment of Mr Paul Briggs, namely clinically assisted nutrition and hydration (CANH), should be continued.  Mr Briggs is in a minimally conscious state (MCS).  This is the result of the serious and permanent brain damage he suffered as the victim of a traffic accident on 3 July 2015.  He is not in a permanent vegetative state (PVS) and so the approach taken by the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Airedale NHS Trust v Bland </span>[1993] AC 789 does not apply to him.  That approach was that life-prolonging treatment of a patient in PVS is properly regarded as being, in medical terms, useless or futile (see Lord Goff at 869 B/F) or that life-prolonging treatment confers no benefit on the patient (see Lord Keith at 859D) and so in reality the decision whether to continue life-prolonging treatment does not involve a weighing operation of competing factors (see Lord Goff at 869A).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in"><span style="font-style:italic">Discussion. </span>The fundamental principles that are engaged are, on the one side, the sanctity of life and so the very strong but not absolute presumption in favour of continuing Mr Briggs’ life and, on the other side, the principle of self-determination.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Mr Briggs is clinically stable and not presently in need of invasive treatment and so the central issue is the assessment of the weight to be given to and so of the balance to be struck between giving effect to (a) the very strong presumption in favour of the preservation of life, and (b) the right to self-determination of a person who before he or she loses capacity has not made a valid advance decision (or a lasting power of attorney) applicable to the carrying out or continuance of the relevant treatment (here CANH).</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">A relevant factor in the rival arguments is the effect of a valid and applicable advance decision applicable to the refusal of the relevant treatment (here CANH).  It was common ground before me that if Mr Briggs had made such an advance decision it would have been decisive and so no decision would have had to have been made under the MCA best interests test.  I agree.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">This effect of a valid and applicable advance decision is an example of a situation when the principle of self-determination has precedence over the very strong presumption of preserving life.  It also shows that a decision made by a person when he or she had capacity to make it can dictate what happens to them at a later time when they lack capacity.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Evidence and argument was heard over 4 days.  Unusually, the proceedings were brought by Mr Briggs’ wife rather than the NHS Trust and the Wirral Commissioning Group (the WCCG) who sensibly and compassionately discontinued the proceedings they had brought.  A consequence of that procedural approach was that Mrs Briggs was eligible for non-means tested legal aid.  This had the important result that she was able to instruct solicitors and counsel without bearing all or a part of the costs herself from savings.  It is quite clear that without that representation it would have been almost impossible for Mrs Briggs to advance the arguments and evidence of Mr Briggs’ family.  Even if she had been emotionally able to do that the Court would not have received the assistance it has through her representation and the hearing would have been much longer.  So in this case the alarming result of the situation that arose before Mr Justice Baker in <span style="font-style:italic">Re M (Adult Patient)(Minimally Conscious State: Withdrawal of Treatment) </span>[2012] 1 WLR 1653 of public funding not being provided to the family did not arise.  I refer to significant public funding problems relating to proceedings that concern people who lack capacity in my judgment on the preliminary issue in this case (reported at [2016] COP 48).  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">I mention the length of the hearing and representation because none of the earlier decisions makers had that luxury of time and the considerable assistance given by the counsel who were instructed by the parties. My focus, and that of the parties, was on the present and not the history of the decision making.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">It was argued by the NHS Trust and the WCCG that s. 4(5) of the MCA precluded me from making an order that had the result that the CANH treatment was not continued.  I do not agree.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">If I rejected that argument based on s. 4(5) of the MCA, it was common and correct ground that my decision must be based on the application of the best interests test set by the MCA (see in particular ss. 1(5) and 4).  That test has been considered by the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Aintree University Hospitals NHS Trust v James </span>[2014] AC 509.  The one and unanimous judgment of the Supreme Court was handed down by Baroness Hale.  It addresses the relevant history and so legal background to the MCA and it gives important guidance on the approach to be taken to the application of the MCA.    </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">It is the application of the MCA, rather than the common law and inherent jurisdiction set out in the earlier cases that matters.  However, the earlier cases remain relevant because they provide useful analyses of the relevant issues and form a central part of the background to the recommendations of the Law Commission on which the MCA was based and so to the MCA.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in">This definition of the question is crucially important and is derived from the earlier case law, in particular the <span style="font-style:italic">Bland </span>case, where Lord Goff explained at 868 A/D that the correct formulation of the question is crucial and that it is <span style="text-decoration:underline">not </span>whether it is in the best interests of the patient that he should die but whether it is in the best interests of the patient that his life should be prolonged by the relevant treatment and care (here CANH).</p>

It reflects the doctrine of “double effect” which excludes the purpose of causing death and allows death to be knowingly caused as a side-effect and so draws a distinction between the intention underlying an action on the one hand and the consequences that are foreseen but are not intended on the other.</p>

CT scans in June and September 2016 reflect the evolution of consequences of diffuse axonal injury (disruption to the neurological pathways within the brain that can be associated with poor neurological recovery) with development of cerebral atrophy (loss of brain volume).  His current clinical presentation is in keeping with the changes seen on the CT brain scans.  So there is clear physical evidence of extensive brain damage.  And it is common ground that the average life expectancy for patients with such severe brain injury is  of 9 to 10 years if appropriate medical treatment is given.</p>

The main utility of a SMART test is to distinguish between whether a person is in a MCS or a PVS.  Mr Briggs’ was the subject of a SMART assessment over the period 23 February to 17 March 2016 which diagnosed that he was in MCS minus.  Clinical observation of Mr Briggs since then supports the view that he has demonstrated some progress and so it is common ground that he has improved since the SMART assessment but remains in MCS.  There are degrees of MCS and he is categorised as being between MCS minus (the closest to VS) and MCS plus (the nearest to emergence from MCS).  It was accepted in oral evidence that some of the observations relied on to show his improvement need to be treated with caution.  For example, because the appropriate process was not fully observed and because use of a switch reliant on motor function (a process being used to assess the giving of “yes” and “no” answers) is unlikely to be reliable because of unpredictability of dystonia and increased tone and Mr Briggs may find it difficult to press a switch twice consecutively to indicate a “no” response.  Also, if the helpful graph produced by Ms Ankers from the medical notes is continued to the date of the hearing (as she helpfully did during her evidence) earlier higher performance is not repeated.</p>

Episodes reported by staff as “severe extensor spasms and back arching” and observed by Dr Walton are dystonic in nature, have a different pattern of movement to spasticity and do not always respond to anti-spasticity medication.  His dystonic episodes are likely to be painful and can have various triggers including problems with his bowels.

As a result of that accident he suffered serious brain and other multiple injuries and was rendered unconscious.  He is now in a minimally conscious state (MCS) and does not have the capacity to make decisions relating to his care and treatment or to communicate his wishes and feelings to others.  His survival has been and is dependent on the package of the care and treatment he has received and is receiving in hospital.  That care and treatment includes clinically assisted nutrition and hydration (CANH).  If that treatment is no longer given he would die.</p>

What is not provided is that the person making it has have any particular knowledge or have had any particular advice.

Section 25(2)(c) does not specify whether to qualify the inconsistent act must take place when the person has capacity.  Section 25(3) provides a test in fairly general terms.    But it seems to me that an interpretation of these safety nets based on the sanctity of life or anything else (e.g. the detail of prognosis and alternatives at the time when the question about the treatment arises) that sets a low threshold to rendering an advance decision invalid or inapplicable would run counter to the enabling intention of ss. 24 to 26 of the MCA.  In any event, if those provisions did found the view that an advance decision was invalid or inapplicable, and so a best interests test became determinative, I consider that the court would have to take into account the impact of that removal of that person’s right of self- determination that he or she has sought to exercise by making an advance decision.</p>

To make that prediction they will take into account a range of factors relating to their beliefs, values, lifestyle, wishes and feelings.  That is not an easy task for them and their personal history, character, wishes, feelings, belief and values will be central to their performance of it.</p>

The court must make any such decision itself and does so by making a welfare order under s. 16(2)(a) of the MCA that provides that by making such an order the court makes the decision on behalf of P.  The court can also make a declaration based on the effect of that order and has sometimes made declarations based on its best interests decision although in my view that is not the appropriate approach under the MCA (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re MN </span>[2015] EWCA Civ 411 at paragraphs 87 to 91). </p>

So, if P’s family are asserting that they favour a different conclusion to that reached by the medical team, it is likely that in many cases to be reasonable if not inevitable for doctors to give great and probably determinative weight to medical and ethical issues in their exercise of the MCA best interests test pending the resolution of the existence of the matters in s. 4(6) and the weight to be given to them by a court.</p>

What, after all, is the point of taking great trouble to ascertain or deduce P’s views, and to encourage P to be involved in the decision-making process, unless the objective is to try to achieve the outcome which P wants or prefers, even if he does not have the capacity to achieve it for himself?</span>

	      <span style="font-size:11pt">The 2005 Act does not, of course, say that P’s wishes are to be paramount, nor does it lay down any express presumption in favour of implementing them if they can be ascertained. Indeed the paramount objective is that of P’s “best interests”. However, by giving such prominence to the above matters, the Act does, in my judgment, recognise that having his views and wishes taken into account and respected is a very significant aspect of P’s best interests. Due regard should therefore be paid to this recognition when doing the weighing exercise of determining what is in P’s best interest in all the relevant circumstances, including those wishes.</span>

I also accept the evidence that, when reports about Tony Bland appeared on the television, M express views to the effect that it will be better to allow him to die. But, as conceded on behalf of the applicant, there is no evidence that M ever specifically considered the question of withdrawal of ANH, or ever considered the question whether she would wish such treatment to be withdrawn if in a minimally conscious state. Furthermore, even if M did specifically consider those questions, there is no way of knowing her current views, having lived in that state for over eight years. Given the importance of the sanctity of life, and the fatal consequences of withdrawing treatment, and the absence of an advance decision that complied with the requirements previously specified by the common law and now under statute, it would be in my judgement be wrong to attach significant weight to those statements made prior to her collapse.</span>

In my view the last sentence of paragraph 228 and his approach in paragraphs 229 and 230 (which is echoed in paragraphs 244(f) and 247(5) under the heading “balance sheet”) runs counter to the holistic approach that the Supreme Court confirms is to be taken to enabling P to do what he would have wanted if of full capacity, and so to addressing the matters set out in s. 4(6), in all the relevant circumstances of the case, to try to ascertain what P would have wanted and decided.  This is because he overplays the requirements for an applicable advance decision and its absence (which by definition is a starting point for the exercise under s. 4 of the MCA).  Also, he does not address what M would have done, and so her attitude to the application of the competing fundamental principles, by reference to his findings on what she had said and done when she had capacity on the basis that “there is no way of knowing her present views” (which is always going to be the case when P cannot communicate any such views).</p>

In Pauffley J’s case <span style="font-style:italic">N </span>(P) had been physically resistant to all efforts to provide her with nutrition and had pulled out a nasogastric tube and several cannula (she was receiving adequate hydration and dextrose solution through an intravenous line that had been placed into a foot which she could not reach).

After hearing the family evidence the Official Solicitor changed his position and no longer opposed the withdrawal of CANH and it was common ground that if this was done with palliative care Mrs N would not feel pain.  Also, Mrs N’s position was very different to Mr Briggs’ best case scenario (see paragraph 75 of the judgment) and in light of that it is unsurprising that an issue arose as to whether or not Mrs N was in a PVS or MCS.</p>

This argument accords with the argument advanced by the Official Solicitor in <span style="font-style:italic">Re M </span>because it relies on (a) the clinical conditions that give rise to the need for such invasive treatment to found a conclusion that it would be useless, pointless or over burdensome to give such treatment, and (b) that conclusion to trigger the application of the question identified by the House of Lords in the <span style="font-style:italic">Bland </span>case<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>and so the effect of the answer to it.  </p>

The question dictates the analysis and effect of the answer, and so the legality of the continuation or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment for persons who lack the relevant capacity to make their own decisions on whether they should or should not consent to such treatment.  It reflects the doctrine of “double effect” which excludes the purpose of causing death and allows death to be knowingly caused as a side-effect and so draws a distinction between the intention underlying an action on the one hand and the consequences that are foreseen but are not intended on the other.

Worryingly, as in the case before Hayden J, the Official Solicitor, through his lawyers, sought to rely on the ways in which Mr Briggs’ mother and one of his brothers had expressed themselves as a basis for weakening the force of their evidence.  It would be surprising if loving family members did not express themselves in terms that differed in some respects and arrived at their conclusions for reasons that differed in some respects and over different periods of time.  Complete consistency of approach and expression would give rise to more concern. I express the hope that the Official Solicitor will in future not seek to test family evidence in such a pedantic and so unsympathetic and unhelpful a way.</p>

This loving family effectively spoke with one voice in supporting the views of Mr Briggs’ wife.  They agreed that she knew him best and agreed with her on what Mr Briggs would now want in his existing circumstances, including the most recent written medical evidence, and added their own reasons for reaching the same conclusion.  After the oral medical evidence Mr Briggs’ wife and mother were recalled to address the point that had been made that the extent of Mr Briggs’ brain damage meant that he was now a different person who would not appreciate how he had been before his accident.  Both of them had heard all of the oral medical evidence that had also highlighted the possibility of Mr Briggs suffering pain and distress if his CANH treatment was not continued which was linked to the medication of his PSH and dystonia. </p>

At an early age he wanted to join the army and this is what he did. He served in the Gulf War and after leaving the Army he was keen to and sometime later did join the police where he worked in the traffic department. As confirmed by a work colleague and his family as a policeman he witnessed traffic accidents which resulted in serious injury to motorists and visited some of them in hospital.  The details of those cases is not in the evidence.</p>

His family and friends speak with a common voice that he was extremely close to his wife and daughter and was a committed and loving family man. He had met his wife in 1995 shortly after he left the army and they have been married for about 16 years. His daughter is now five and sadly is frightened of visiting her father at the hospital. In this context, his wife describes how Mr Briggs did not think that visiting family members in a care home was appropriate for children.</p>

The one closest to home relates to his mother-in-law and her refusal of PEG feeding and nutrition when she was terminally ill with cancer. His wife reports that he fully supported her and her mother in this decision and told her that he would never want a feeding tube. This provides a clear indication that Mr Briggs did not consider it was sensible to prolong life at all costs and thought it was right that the suffering of his mother-in-law was not prolonged. Indeed his wife reports that he used to ask why there was not something legal that could be done to end her mother’s suffering. His wife has now made an advance decision herself that she does not want a feeding tube.  And she told me that as she knows that as she and her husband have a very similar stance on matters she feels with absolute confidence that he would be doing exactly for her as she is now doing for him by asking for life-sustaining treatment to be withdrawn if their roles were reversed.</p>

However, all of his comments about these people are consistent and are to the effect that he would not wish to live like that and for example in the case of Tony Nicklinson that he understood why he wanted to die.

It took place a few months before his accident in July 2015. She thinks the programme was called “24 hours in A&amp;E” and it was a reality TV programme rather than a drama.  It was showing a man on life support with various machines keeping him alive. Mr Briggs told her that he would want the life support machine to be turned off as he would not want to be kept alive like that as it was not “living”.  She recalls him saying that in that scenario we should turn off the machine and let him go.  She replied that if it was her she would like the chance to see what the medical profession could do but he was adamant that in that sort of situation he would want to be allowed to pass away.

The balance sheets produced in this case also suffered from the difficulty that it was difficult to capture the degree of potential improvement in Mr Briggs’ condition and the description of his best case scenario.  For example, all agreed that these descriptions in the joint statement of Dr Mahendran and Dr Walton suffered from this problem and needed clarification.  Also it was accepted by Dr Mahendran that some of the language she had used on the possible extent of improvement gave a misleading impression.  This linguistic problem is inherent in the description of matters of degree and so in the crucial exercise of giving weight to competing factors that is at the heart of the application of the best interests test.</p>

Indeed Dr Walton’s point that because of his brain damage Mr Briggs would be a different person and so would not appreciate or process the extent and impact of his injuries and so in his realistic best case scenario it was likely that he would be happy, show pleasure and not show distress or depression was based on him not having such capacity as that would or could lead to very different feelings and depression.</p>
