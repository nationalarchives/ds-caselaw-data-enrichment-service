	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">These five cases are examples of cases in which the procedure to be adopted by the Court of Protection (COP)  was left open in my judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Re NRA &amp; Others </span>[2015] EWCOP 59.  That judgment contains the references to the decision of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Cheshire West </span>and of the President and the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re X </span>which are the essential background to <span style="font-style:italic">NRA</span>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In short, the five cases were chosen as cases in which it was thought that there was no family member or friend who could be appointed as a Rule 3A representative.  That is no longer the position in VE and my reference to the test cases in this judgment are to the remaining four.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The general approach taken by the Secretary of State, through officials at the Ministry of Justice (the MoJ) and the Department of Health (the DoH), in these test cases means that it is important to remember that they relate to a class of cases in which a welfare order is sought to authorise P’s deprivation of liberty (“a DOL welfare order application”) and <span style="font-weight:bold">not </span>to such applications in general.  That class is where the applicant (usually a public authority) is of the view that the application is not controversial and there is no family member or friend who the COP can appoint as a Rule 3A(2)(c) representative.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It follows that a general approach that is based on the wide powers of the COP that  includes other classes of DOL welfare order applications (e.g. when the case is controversial or when there is a family member or friend who can be appointed as a Rule 3A representative) has to be de-coded:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This means that it is necessary for me to trace the development of the respective positions and evidence of the parties on the procedural route that the COP should take.  This has added to the length of this judgment.  In doing so and more generally my reference to the Secretary of State (an indivisible office) is to both the Secretary of State for Justice and the Secretary of State for Health and so to central government.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is also important to remember that in <span style="font-style:italic">Cheshire West </span>the Supreme Court has determined that the class of case with which I am concerned involves an objective  deprivation of liberty that can only be authorised and thereby made lawful, by a welfare order made by the COP.  This conclusion does not provide a label or description for a class of welfare order.  Rather, it is a binding conclusion that the position on the ground is that  P is being deprived of his liberty which engages:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A consequence of this conclusion of the Supreme Court is that it has, in a time of austerity, imposed major and perhaps unforeseen difficulties and burdens on those responsible for providing, authorising and monitoring the placement and care of a wide range of vulnerable people and if extra resources (alone or coupled with changes to the underlying statutory framework) are required to meet the procedural safeguards required by the <span style="font-style:italic">Cheshire West </span>conclusion in DOL welfare applications within the class represented by the test cases either:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The provision of any such resources is highly likely if not inevitably to be at the cost of something else that can also be said to be important, and in the case of local authorities it is highly likely, if not inevitable, that it would be at the expense of the resources available to them to fund the placement and care of vulnerable people.  This is an unhappy prospect but, whilst the <span style="font-style:italic">Cheshire West </span>conclusion remains authoritative, it is one that has to be faced by central and local government.  The COP cannot itself change that conclusion or create extra resources to enable the COP to adopt a procedure that takes it into account.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is not easy to predict the number of applications and reviews that are within the class to which these test cases are directed.  An informal survey was conducted in 2014 by the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS) which estimated that there would need to be about 30,000 applications in 2014/15 and 2015/6.  The evidence in these test cases and in <span style="font-style:italic">NRA </span>supports that view if all the necessary applications and reviews are brought.  This estimate relates to all DOL welfare order applications and the present test cases represent part of that workload.  The evidence in these test cases indicates that a high proportion of such cases are likely to be presented as non-contentious and that in over half of such cases it is likely that there will not be a family member or friend who could be appointed as P’s Rule 3A representative.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">So far history does not match such estimates.  At present about 90 cases in the class represented by these test cases have been issued and are stayed but for the reasons set out in <span style="font-style:italic">NRA</span>, and confirmed by the evidence in these cases, this does not provide a reliable guide to the number of cases in that class in which, as a result of the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Cheshire West</span>,<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>public authorities need to apply to the COP for a welfare order to authorise a deprivation of liberty.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The existing small numbers of applications and a focus simply on these four cases could found a short term solution (and so a solution for these four cases).  Such a solution de-railed the similar cases in <span style="font-style:italic">NRA </span>as test cases and one of the purposes of these test cases (and my refusal to join P in them and ask the Official Solicitor to act as his litigation friend) has been to enable me to address in the short, medium and longer term the class of cases, expected to be at least in the thousands each year, in which there is no suitable family member or friend who can act as a Rule 3A representative.  Naturally, I accept that having done so my task is to make appealable orders in the test cases.  </p>

But, even after an adjournment for further evidence the practical availability of funding through legal help (for a considerable number of cases) and so the practical application of the explanations of the effect of the relevant regulations provided by the MoJ (and the LAA) was not clear.  Accordingly, at the adjourned hearing on 13 January 2016, on its application and without opposition I joined the Law Society as a party on the basis that it could put in evidence and make submissions in writing and the other parties could reply to them in writing (if so advised).  This process ended in mid-February. </p>

As by definition in that class of case there is no family member or friend who could be appointed P’s litigation friend (and as yet there are no accredited legal representatives) this means that if (as the Official Solicitor argued should be done) P is joined as a party he would in most if not all of those cases need a litigation friend of last resort – and as the Official Solicitor would not accept appointment there would not be one.</p>

Advocacy Focus confirmed to the Local Authority that they are unable to accommodate or prioritise referrals that are made solely in relation to COPDOL10 applications and that they would be unable to commit to taking these in the long term, owing to capacity and workload issues and already having an excessive waiting list. Effectively, therefore, in this Local Authority area, the IMCA service is not available to complete Annex C of the applications or to act as a litigation friend for P. The IMCA service also stated that, if such a role were to be contemplated, they would need additional resources and funds from the Local Authority. Even if the local IMCA  service (or other professionals) were able to take on the role of Rule 3A representative, the requirement to appoint an independent Rule 3A representative in every case where P had no family member available or suitable to fulfil that role, would represent an additional significant cost to the Local Authority for which there are no resources available. The cost would be a recurring one, as each case would require a review application at intervals of 12 months or less. In addition, the requirement to keep the care arrangements under review in the interim, would necessitate ongoing involvement with the independent Rule 3A representative, which would further add to the burden on resources of the IMCA service if they were to undertake that role, and substantially add to the cost for the Local Authority.</span>

In section 21A MCA 2005 cases, although advocates can be a litigation friend they have felt they do not have capacity to undertake this role to the degree necessary to carry it out appropriately. Additionally, the local authorities are not in a position to fund this role. There is no guidance from the Courts service on the role of independent Rule 3A representative so it is unclear how similar that role is to that of a litigation friend. Certainly, in Gateshead Council’s experience, Rule 3A representatives in Court of Protection proceedings have been expected to attend Court and draft statements which are both time-consuming legal tasks. Unlike with an RPR, legal assistance is considered to be unlikely to be available from a firm under legal aid. The agency cannot be served with a “default notice” for failure to carry out this advocacy as independent rule 3A representative work is not listed in the contract specification as required work.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">Were it to be a legal requirement to use advocacy then the Council would have no option but to comply with this to meet its legal obligations. However, without external funding being made available each year resources would have to be diverted from the provision of social care services to fund additional advocacy, meaning the Council may not be in a position to continue to provide some of the services it currently offers. There may be an impact upon the sustainability of offering services for which the Council has no legal obligation to provide - such as where the Council is exercising a power. This might be where only one of the eligibility criteria is met. Alternatively, it may be that the Council might have to consider operating a waiting-list in a similar way to how some councils have decided to do so with respect to Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards. </span>

He considered Your Voice Counts to be an appropriate organisation in principle to do this type of work however he was also clear that his organisation could not deliver the Rule 3A independent representative role utilising the agency’s existing staff. This is because the service is currently operating at capacity and to deliver more services the agency would require additional staff, office space, computers and telephones as well as resources to allow for increased management, supervision and training of the required new staff. [He] indicated that the agency remains “swamped” with work and that any quotation that was offered for Rule 3A representative work would be unlikely to be financially competitive as they did not have spare capacity that they were keen to fill. On reflection, [he] would be less concerned now about recruiting additional staff as if they were not used for Rule 3A representative work then they could be used on existing contracts.  ----------------- [He] considers that if Your Voice Counts decided to take on Rule 3A representative work then the agency would want to limit the work to dedicated workers and could therefore only accommodate a finite number of cases at any one time. This would be necessary to ensure that Rule 3A representative work role would not impact upon the agency’s ability to deliver other services under existing contracts.</span>

Initially, the role of Rule 3A representative would be most appropriately handled by experienced independent Mental Capacity Advocates (IMCAs). However, the provider currently has only six, qualified IMCAs, who already have full caseloads, with an overall team of 12 advocates. It will take time to train advocates to act as Rule 3A representatives and this will result in pressures on the provider. There will be waiting lists and criteria will need to be developed for prioritising individual cases above others. These issues cannot be resolved simply by allocating additional resources to recruit more IMCAs as there are a limited number of trained IMCAs in the Manchester area. -----</span>

If a separate contract had to be sought elsewhere for the provision of Rule 3A representatives for the time being, the procurement process would take time and represent an additional cost to the Local Authority, difficulties would arise as budgets have already been set for the current financial year an alternative providers may be facing similar issues in terms of capacity and training to undertake the role. In any event, Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council is currently in the process of going out to tender in respect of its arrangements for advocacy services, as the current contract with Advocacy Focus is due to end on 31 March 2016. The requirement for independent Rule 3A representatives could potentially be incorporated within the terms of any new contractual arrangements sought. The more complex the tender, the greater the anticipated cost to the Local Authority. As demand is greater than the supply of advocacy services at present and Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council would be competing with other local authorities for a finite necessary resource, this is likely to further inflate the cost of procuring such services and leave local authorities with little or no leverage</span>

So again legal help may not always be available if solicitors do not have sufficient allocation of new matter starts. If we were to receive a sudden influx of these cases we would not have enough new matter starts because our allocation is used primarily for the mental health tribunal work.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">Legal help pays a different fixed fee depending upon the contract being used (i.e. mental health, community care etc). However broadly we would be able to do about four hours or so work on legal help hourly rates before time starts getting written off at the point of costing over and above the fixed fee. In any event, the hourly rates don’t usually cover our costs. The amount of work involved in these cases in my experience so far is much more extensive than legal help allows, particularly if you factor in the costs of travelling to see P who may be in a remote part of the country.  There is of course the possibility of doing so much work that you end up getting the “escape fee” (if do work at 3 x the fixed fee) but those are still run at a loss, and there is a risk of the LAA reducing your costs upon claiming so it goes below the fixed fee threshold and you end up having to write hundreds of pounds of costs for work legitimately done.</span>

The Law Society gives an example of a national firm that undertakes COP work whose application for an exceptional increase was refused on the basis that other providers in their region had not exhausted all their relevant matter starts. This criterion ignores the fact that some providers with community care matter starts will not undertake mental capacity work. Similarly, some providers with mental health contracts would also not use matter starts for the mental capacity work. And, the Law Society also points out that the vast majority of the 46,824 matter starts allocated to providers that is referred to in the MoJ statement are likely to be for mental health tribunal cases. Additionally, providers have been allocated matter starts under their current legal aid contract in accordance with the assessment of need they made for contracts awarded in 2014 but there is no mechanism by which the number of allocated matter starts may be increased, other than exceptionally, during the current contract period which the Law Society understands may run until 2018.</p>

If that was the case, it might well reduce the likelihood of any challenge and the amount of any damages but, in my view, this pragmatic help to applicant authorities does not found the adoption of a procedure by the COP that is unlawful on the basis that it does not provide P with the minimum procedural safeguards; and it was not argued that it should.</p>

Not only would such a course jeopardise the proper performance by the COP of other aspects of its work, it would be a waste of time and effort if the public authorities faced directly and indirectly with the problems arising in respect of DOL welfare order applications did not address those problems constructively and timeously.</p>
