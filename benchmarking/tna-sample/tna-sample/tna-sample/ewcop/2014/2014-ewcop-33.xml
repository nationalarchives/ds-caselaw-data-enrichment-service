	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">M is a 24-year-old man who has been diagnosed with autism and a learning disability, although, as discussed below, that diagnosis is a matter of controversy.  For the first 18 years of his life he lived at home with his parents - his mother, hereafter referred to as E, and father, A - where he was by all accounts generally looked after very well.  His parents were and are devoted to him and have devoted much of their lives to his care.  He attended local special schools and enjoyed a wide range of activities.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Until his late teens the family had no contact with the local authority.  At that point, however, social services became involved because his parents were looking for a residential placement where he could continue his education.  There is no evidence up to that point of any conflict between members of his family and those professionals with whom they came into contact.  From that point, however, the picture changed and there has been almost continuous conflict, in particular between M's mother, E, and the local authority.  M's parents assert that they have been subjected to a malicious campaign aimed at removing M from their care.  The local authority asserts that M has been subjected to a regime characterised by excessive control exercised by E over every aspect of M's life.  More seriously, the local authority alleges that E has fabricated accounts of M's health problems and subjected him to unnecessary assessments and treatments, as well as imposing on him an unnecessarily restrictive diet, with a range of unnecessary supplements.  There have been several court proceedings concerning the family, culminating in this case, brought by the local authority in the Court of Protection, seeking orders as to M's future residence and care.  The local authority makes a series of allegations on which it asks the court to make findings.  All those allegations are hotly disputed by the parents and this has necessitated a lengthy fact finding hearing.  This judgment is delivered at the conclusion of that hearing.</span>

In preparing this summary I have drawn on the local authority's chronology in section L of the bundle, an outline chronology filed on behalf of the Official Solicitor, the documents filed by E and A, including their 45-page document headed “chronology of health issues”, the chronology of medical records and treatments prepared by Dr Peter Carpenter, a psychiatrist instructed as an expert witness in these proceedings, and my own reading of the voluminous papers.  </span>

Dr Carpenter was unable to find any record of family history of any mental disorder, including learning difficulties or autism.  His mother, E, worked for many years in the National Health Service in a number of jobs involving management responsibility, including responsibility for catering.  Her curriculum vitae discloses, inter alia, that she has diplomas in public health and hygiene and in institutional housekeeping and catering.  She has also, amongst other things, served as a governor for one of the schools attended by M and as a trained mediator, as well as serving in other roles in various organisations concerned with autism.  Since 2004 she has taken a career break to devote herself to caring for M.  M's father, A, has worked for many years in the fire service.  </span>

In May 1990 M was unwell, with a fever and vomiting - diagnosed at the time as a full upper respiratory tract infection.  When seen by Dr Baird, a consultant paediatrician at Guys Hospital two and a half years later, in October 1992, M's parents described how during this illness on three occasions during one night they had felt that he "nearly stopped breathing" and turned blue.  They told Dr Baird thereafter that his health gave rise to great concern because he always seemed to have a problem breathing through his nose and difficulty with swallowing.  In another account, contained in an undated education report, his parents later reported that:</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">On 12th January 1991, aged just under 18 months, M was given the measles, mumps and rubella (“MMR”) vaccination.  There is no record in his GP notes of any adverse reaction.  In fact, there is no report of any adverse reaction to the MMR in any record relating to M for the next nine years.  From 2000 onwards, however, M's parents, and in particular his mother, have given increasingly vivid accounts of an extreme reaction to the injection experienced by M.  There are descriptions of M screaming after having the injection, followed by six hours of convulsions, screaming and projectile vomiting.  It is the parents' case that the mother told their GP that he had had a bad reaction to the MMR but was told by him that she was an over-anxious mother and must be imagining it.  When E called the GP a second time and said she was calling the emergency services, she was told not to do this, but went ahead because M was going in and out of consciousness.  The paramedics and the GP had arrived at the same time, at which point M's temperature was 104.  The GP had told the paramedics to leave.  Before going, they had told her that this was a case of meningeal encephalitis.  The GP had been verbally abusive to E.  The above account, given to Dr. Beck, a psychologist instructed as an expert witness in these proceedings, is similar to that given by the mother to a variety of professionals.  She also gave a detailed description of M's reaction to the MMR in the course of her oral evidence.  One note in an "auditory processing assessment report" dated 31st October 2002 records E alleging that, following the MMR, M had remained in, "A persistent vegetative state for six months."  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The parents' “chronology of health issues” prepared for these proceedings states that between January and June 1991 M was prescribed anti-inflammatories, antibiotics, antihistamines, decongestants and pain relief.  There is no medical record of any such prescription, save for the decongestant.  It is the parents' case that the medical records have been tampered with in some way to conceal the true picture.  They produced two copies of the medical records which purported to show a gap of some eight months between December 1990 and August 1991.  In fact, the original records show that the next consultation after the MMR took place on 26th April 1991.  It is the parents' case that a page of the medical records was missing from the copies with which they had been supplied previously.  The GP note of the consultation on 26th April 1991 records that E was concerned that M was a nasal breather and had thick mucous.  He was prescribed a decongestant.  The note also records that he had been uncooperative at the hearing test that day.  According to E, in the summer of 1991 he started to receive homeopathy, reflexology and cranial osteopathy. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">On 14th August 1991, aged just over two years, M was assessed by medical officers at the Audiology Service.  The notes record that they were told that M had sat at five months and walked at 16 months.  He was now able to feed himself and make attempts at undressing.  It was noted that, though very placid and happy, he did not seem to take notice of people.  He had little speech, other than "mamma" and "daddy".  It was noted that he had bilateral hearing loss.  The assessors were able to establish some eye contact and record during testing but concluded that M needed a fuller developmental assessment.  There is no reference in these assessment notes to any adverse reaction to the MMR.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">On 23rd August 1991, aged 25 months, M was assessed by a speech and language therapist.  He was noted as presenting with delay in all aspects of communication and his development was said to be functioning at a level of approximately sixteen months, and he was said to be suffering from hearing problems.  It was noted that he was using stereotyped play routines.  Again, there is no record of the assessors having been told of any adverse reaction to the MMR injection.  At the end of October 1991 M underwent surgery for the insertion of grommets and the removal of his tonsils and adenoids.  After the operation it was recorded that he “has vacant staring and eye rolling?  Absence seizure."Again, there is no record of any adverse reaction to the MMR.  According to E, it was in December 1991 that M started to receive what she described as "basic natural nutritional supplements."  On 22nd January 1992, when M was again seen by the Audiology Service, it was recorded that E felt that he had a much more healthy interest in activities and was actively involved with them.  He had regained normal hearing.  At about this time, according to E's “chronology of health issues”, M was started on a gluten and casein free diet.  On 25th March 1992, at a further developmental assessment, E reported that there was little progress in M's language development.  She reported that he was producing a lot of sounds but no words, enjoying lining up cars, playing alone and not making eye contact easily.  The assessors observed that he seemed to have a basic communication disorder and referred him to Dr Gillian Baird, a consultant paediatrician at Guys.  </span>

She suggested that he undergo a range of tests but observed that, if all proved negative, there might well be a substantial genetic component to his developmental problem.

According to her “chronology of health issues”, once the complimentary alternative and dietary interventions were established, there were only annual visits to the GP for the purpose of urine tests and checking ears, until November 2009.  M's GP notes, however, show that he continued to be seen by the GP several times each year for a variety of illnesses and was also seen by various specialists, including an audiologist, ophthalmologist and speech and language therapist.  In none of the records prior to 2000 is there any account of an adverse reaction to the MMR.  From 1995 M attended special day schools for children with learning difficulties.  He remained living at home with his parents and sister.  For most of his childhood he was unknown to social services.  There is no suggestion that he suffered any harm during this time.  On the contrary, it is the parents' case that through their efforts he achieved a much higher level of attainment than was originally feared.</span>

In discussions with the press, he linked this to the MMR vaccination.  Unfortunately, when later reviewed the histopathology findings in the cases were felt by several experienced pathologists to show no evidence of colitis and the histories that Wakefield gave of the cases deteriorating immediately after the MMR were shown to be erroneous in many of the cases.  No independent peer review paper has been published subsequently to confirm the findings of an unusual colitis in autism."</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The preponderance of medical opinion is that there is no evidence of any link between the MMR vaccine and autism, and that the actions of Dr Wakefield were, at best, misconceived and, at worst, fraudulent.  It is said that, as a result of his activities, many parents have decided against permitting the vaccination of their children, with significant adverse consequences for public health.  There remains, however, a degree of support for his theories, in particular by a group of parents who are convinced that the autistic traits identified in their children are attributable to the MMR vaccine, in particular, the vaccine administered in the late 1980s and early 1990s that allegedly contained what is called the Urabe strain of the mumps virus.

There has, therefore, been no definitive ruling on the substantive claim which the group of parents sought to bring, and a number of people still believe that Dr Wakefield was correct.

On 22nd September, Dr Wakefield referred M to his colleague, Professor Murch.  M was seen at the Royal Free gastroenterology department on 7th March 2001.  The medical notes from the hospital state the diagnosis as "progressive autism and constipation."  The medical records of this consultation quote E as saying that M's development had been normal until the age of eighteen months, at which point he had some six to eighteen words of speech and normal hearing.  Following his MMR, however, he became "quite distressed, with fever, his eyes were fixed and his pupils dilated and was not well for days."  It was added that he suffered from a loss of eye contact and was not responding to play and had lost his speech and language.  On examination it was found that he had faecal loading on both sides of the bowel, with some impaction in the pelvis.

There remains no acceptance within the worldwide medical authorities that MMR causes the symptoms seen in these children.  Therefore, the litigation was very likely to fail.

E and A identified a college in East Anglia which they thought would be the right option for M.  Difficulties arose, however, as to the funding of this placement and M's parents issued proceedings against the local authority, claiming that it was unreasonably refusing to fund the package of education and social care.  The local authority's case before me is that the placement could not proceed because the Learning and Skills Council was unable to fund the educational component of the placement because the establishment had not been approved by OFSTED and the local authority was unable to pay for the residential component of the placement because it had not been approved by the Care Quality Commission.  In July 2008, M left school and, with the local authority's support, attended a life skills development course locally for a year while the dispute between the local authority and his parents was resolved.  The local authority has estimated that the package of care and support offered to M during this year cost the authority around £55,000.  Negotiations between the local authority, the Learning and Skills Council and his parents continued and ultimately his parents identified an alternative college in the south of England - hereafter known as X College - which the Learning and Skills Council agreed to fund.</span>

In October he moved into a residential unit nearby with the assistance of the local authority - hereafter referred to as Y House.  At first this placement went well but problems soon arose.  E made a series of complaints about the standard of care given to M, including that he suffered repeated episodes of ringworm, other fungal infections, conjunctivitis and ear infections, including a burst eardrum.  As a result, E spent three weeks staying in a nearby hotel to provide support for M.  She was also concerned that certain assurances given about Y House prior to M's arrival had not been fulfilled.  In particular, having been told that the House, which was a new project, was intended for young people of M's age, she was alarmed to find that older people with more extensive disabilities were accommodated there.  Relations between E and the staff at Y House deteriorated.  The staff expressed concern about the level of control over M exercised by his mother.  She provided a strict dietary programme for M to be followed by the staff, regular health bulletins on his return to the unit after weekends at home and a list of all the treatments and supplements to be given to him.  By this point, according to a list prepared by E and A, the range of biomedical interventions being supplied to M included a probiotic, six vitamin supplements, four mineral supplements, five trace elements, fatty acids, amino acids, enzymes and a range of homeopathic remedies.  E and A said that this combination had been arrived at through the advice of the gastroenterology department of the Royal Free Hospital, the Autism Research Unit at Sunderland University, the Autism Treatment Trust in Scotland and a privately funded naturopath.  They said that the reason for M taking this combination of supplements was "to address the autistic enterocolitis he suffers from." </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In November 2009, following a reorganisation of the local authority's services in which the team previously responsible for M's case was disbanded, M's case was reallocated to a different team and manager - hereafter referred to as MS.  The relationship between the parents and MS quickly deteriorated.  In February 2010, following a visit by MS to see M at Y House, E gave instructions that no-one was to visit X College or Y House or see M without the prior knowledge or agreement of her and A.  It is MS's evidence that she has never experienced a response of this nature from a family and that, as the social worker allocated to the case by the commissioning body, she was expected to visit M on a regular basis.  A further dispute arose when MS refused to fund additional support for M when he was on holiday at home, on the grounds that the local authority was already paying for a 52 week placement at Y House.  There was also a disagreement when, apparently on MS's instructions, the staff at Y House removed some of the written instructions that E had left for M in his room at the unit.  E and A have asserted that MS was motivated against them because her husband (like A) had been employed in the Fire Service and had been passed over for promotion in A's favour.  In oral evidence MS stated that her husband had had no dealings with A at work.  In the course of the hearing E asserted that MS had continued to exert an influence over the case because she shared an office with an occupational therapist who subsequently carried out an assessment.  MS denied that she had ever worked with this individual.  </span>

According to E and A, the complaints made on this occasion amounted to a total of 236 individual complaints.  At the hearing before me the local authority asserted that the total number of complaints made was many times more than those made in any other case. Some of the complaints were directed at MS and as a result she was withdrawn from the case.  At the end of June, M's case was transferred to a different locality team within the local authority and allocated to a team manager - JR - and a senior practitioner - LG.  Those senior social workers have remained responsible for M's case to the present day.  The complaints were investigated by an independent practitioner.  Nearly all of these complaints were not upheld.  In his conclusion the investigator observed, inter alia:</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">"First and foremost, although a few of the complaints have been upheld, they arise from a genuine desire by E and A to do the very best they can for M and obtain the very best services that they can ... They feel that their mission has meant having to fight every inch of the way against health and legal services and more recently social care services.  This has no doubt influenced the extent to which they are able to work in partnership with the statutory agencies.  As E and A have such clear ideas about all aspects of M's life and believe that the conclusions they have reached about him are correct, it is understandable that they have difficulty in accepting the views of others where those differ from their own.  In the current circumstances E and A are required to work alongside professionals in social care, medical services and residential care services.  Those professionals will also have M's best interests at heart, but may hold differing views about what is in his best interests.  Where the professionals have wished to pursue their own views and approaches, they have found that they have had to be very clear and assertive.  This has brought about an even more assertive approach in response and commonly this has led to communications which border on the unacceptable.  Many of the complaints appear to arise from such circumstances."</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">E continued to search for alternative and complimentary treatments for M.  In December 2010, a “neurological assessment” was carried out by a clinic run by an establishment known as Hemispheres Movement for Learning Limited, under the supervision of its Director and clinical lead occupational therapist, Shelley Birkett-Eyles.  This assessment was said to have shown "marked primitive reflexes" usually only seen infants.  In his analysis for these proceedings, Dr Carpenter was unable to establish what form of testing of the neurological reflexes had been carried out.  In addition, an auditory assessment identified certain difficulties that M experienced in speech and language.  It was recommended that he was reviewed monthly for one hour, with fifteen minutes of neuro-developmental movements at home every day.  It was also recommended that he underwent therapy known as "the listening programme" to address his problems with sensory and auditory processing.  This involved listening to tapes for two sessions of fifteen minutes, five days a week for twenty weeks.  </span>

In particular, professionals were concerned about the degree of control exerted by E over all aspects of M's life; in particular, hygiene, clothing, diet, supplements and social activities.  Care staff were supplied by E with a large number of documents pertaining to M - support plans, weekly activity timetables, health awareness bulletins, lists of supplements to be provided to him - of a degree and intensity which none of them had come across before.  The local authority believed, that by exerting this degree of control, E was limiting M's ability to make independent choices and acting contrary to his best interests.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">M continued to experience a number of health problems during 2010.  Staff at Y House expressed concern that M was not registered with a local GP nearby and that his medical treatment was being administered by the family GP some distance away.  It was alleged that as a result he had not been able to access the local learning disability specialist team.  It was also said that, when M was ill, he was removed from Y House and taken home, resulting in his being away from Y House for long periods of time.  E's position has consistently been that it was in M's best interests to remain registered with the family GP - Dr W - who knew M well, and that M was able to access all the support he needed via X College.  Further conflict arose when E objected to the fact that the issue over GP registration had been raised by an advocacy service to which M had been referred without her knowledge.  In correspondence, E described this as "an unbelievable experience inflicted upon us" and pointed out that as M's deputy she had the right to choose whether M had an advocate.  The advocacy service subsequently withdrew from any involvement with M.  Further disagreement arose from allegations about E's behaviour when visiting Y House and her attitude to the staff.  There were repeated incidents of E challenging the social workers about a range of issues, again to a level unprecedented in the experience of the staff.  For their part, E and A say that they were concerned in particular by the conduct of the acting head manager - PL - who had previously been M's key worker, whom they accuse of acting in an unprofessional and threatening manner and against whom they made a series of complaints.  It is their case that PL was seeking to exert control over all the residents at the home.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">As a result of all these issues the local authority concluded that the legal controls which E was exercising under the terms of the deputyship were not in M's best interests.  In February 2011 the local authority filed an application in the Court of Protection proceedings seeking, inter alia, orders setting aside the appointment of E as M's deputy, authorising M's continuing at Y House, prohibiting E and A from removing M from Y House without the local authority's consent and authorising the staff at Y House to register M at a local GP.  On 25th May 2011, District Judge Ralton gave directions, including an order joining M as a party and appointing the Official Solicitor as his litigation friend.  On 11th July 2011 the same judge gave further directions, including for the joint instruction of a psychiatrist, to be paid for by the local authority, to advise as to M's capacity.  Difficulties arose as to the identification of an appropriate expert.  E and A insisted on the appointment of what they called a "neuro-psychiatrist" on the basis that M suffered from a neurological condition as opposed to autism.  On 5th September 2011, District Judge Ralton gave permission to the local authority and the Official Solicitor and, if they so wished, E and A to instruct a psychiatrist specialising in learning disabilities - Dr Khouja - together with ancillary directions, including for E to file any statement she wished Dr Khouja to read.  </span>

On the basis of their discussion, Ms Haywood prepared a "dietary protocol" for M dated 23rd July 2011, incorporating about fifteen supplements.  Thereafter, the relationship between E and Ms Haywood became close.  There was very regular communication between them, usually by email, from which it is plain that Miss Haywood was a very strong influence on E and the range of assessments and treatments given to M.  At Miss Haywood's recommendation, E submitted some of M's urine and blood to a number of clinics in other countries.  In an updated protocol in September 2011, Miss Haywood recommended over twenty supplements, some taken once a day, others more frequently.  She also set out a very detailed dietary programme, specifying exactly what M should and should not eat.  Meanwhile, M continued to be seen by a variety of alternative complimentary practitioners, including homeopaths, osteopaths and others.  E continued to provide regular medical bulletins to the residential unit setting out updating information as to his various conditions and problems.  </span>

On 22nd September the managers of Y House gave 28 days' notice to terminate the placement.  Meanwhile, E had also been investigating alternative placements and, after negotiations, it was arranged that M would move to another unit linked to X College - hereafter referred to as “Z House”.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">On 17th October 2011, Dr Khouja filed his report having examined M at Y House and at home.  He concluded that M had a mild to moderate learning disability, had difficulties in all three domains that characterise an autism spectrum disorder and met the ICD-10 criteria for autism, having qualitative difficulties in communication, qualitative impairments in reciprocal social interactions and a range of restricted repetitive stereotype behaviours and interests, together with other features of a pattern associated with the autism spectrum disorder, including high anxiety, rigid thinking, hypersensitivity to noise, poor sensory integration and a unique pattern of deficits.  He concluded that M did not have the capacity to litigate or make decisions regarding his residence or care or the full range of potential activities.  He found that M did have the ability to express a preference from a limited range of options as to diet and dress, but did not have the capacity to determine what that range should be and, therefore, on balance, lacked capacity with respect to diet and dress.  He expressed the preliminary view that M lacked capacity to make decisions as to weekend visits home, although reserved a final opinion on that point as the placement at Y House was being terminated.  </span>

Subsequently, E and A asserted that the round table meeting had been "flawed and farcical" and raised a number of challenges at the outcome of the meeting, which were in turn rebutted by the local authority.  In a supplemental report, Dr Khouja concluded that M had the capacity to decide whether he wanted to go home on visits but not to make decisions regarding biomedical intervention.  Thereafter, the parties engaged in mediation leading to an agreement dated 10th May 2012 which was incorporated in a final court order the following day.  The agreement included the following provisions: (1) the local authority agreed that it would not pursue its application for the setting aside of E's deputyship; (2) the deputyship order would be amended to reflect the respects in which Dr Khouja had identified that M lacked capacity; (3) E and A agreed to arrange, in consultation with Z House, for M to be registered with a local GP; (4) in the event that they failed to register him, Z House should be asked to do so; (5) information about M's financial means would be provided by E to the local authority upon request for the purpose of enabling an assessment as to whether he should pay a contribution to the cost of his care.  The order made provision for a further hearing as to costs in the event that the parties failed to agree that issue.

The family dentist - DC - was not present and M was examined by another dentist, Ms Malik.  What transpired at this examination is a matter of controversy in this case and will be considered later.  In short, however, it is Ms Malik's evidence that from an x-ray examination she diagnosed that M had a periapical area behind one upper tooth indicating the possible presence of an abscess.  E, on the other hand, denies that she was told anything of this sort and asserts instead that she was told that there appeared to be a problem with M's sinuses.  In an email dated the following day, E told Ms Haywood that "nothing has shown up on the x-ray, so I am told it is likely to be sinusitis causing teeth nerves to be on edge."  On 25th June an out of hours GP prescribed a course of antibiotics for sinusitis.  In a further email to Ms Haywood on 27th June, E recorded that M had been put on antibiotics "as his temperature was in the region of 104, his facial features were all swollen and his brain was inflamed."  On 27th July, M, with E present, was examined by another dentist at a surgery near to Z House.  Nothing abnormal was detected, although the notes of this examination produced in the course of the hearing indicated that E requested that no x-rays be taken.  When seen by the oral hygienist at the family dental surgery on 4th September 2012, no signs of an abscess were detected. It was said in evidence that a hygienist would not be in a position to make such a finding.  </span>

In one incident it was alleged that E had sustained some more broken ribs.  Following his return to Z House after Christmas, M continued to suffer headaches and returned to college on high doses of paracetamol and ibuprofen.  Staff were concerned at the level of the medication and felt under pressure from E to give M more than was appropriate.  It is claimed that on 5th February the staff refused a request by E to give M additional paracetamol as he had already had the maximum dose that day.  On the following day, 6th February, E arrived and took M home.  It is her case that she did this because M wanted to go home, that she was concerned that he was not receiving proper attention for his worsening health problems at the unit and that her concerns were heightened because of similar experiences of another resident.  </span>

However, one member of staff - KH - was sufficiently concerned about him that he telephoned E on a regular basis to check on M's progress.  The local authority relies on KH's records of these conversations as set out in the local authority records and emails that he sent shortly afterwards to senior colleagues.  KH had worked with M during the last few months of his stay at Z House, and it was his evidence that E and A seemed to get on with him, to the extent that they offered him a job helping care for M at home.  E and A now maintain, however, that KH has a tendency to elaborate and sensationalise situations and was desperate to become a permanent member of staff, so was plainly keen to please his employers.  A meeting took place at X College on 15th February 2013.  E and A did not attend the meeting because M had a medical appointment.  At the meeting renewed concerns were expressed about M's presentation and E's behaviour.  It was reported that other residents had complained about E's presence at the unit late at night.  It was also reported that KH had been advised that M was now being sedated up to twelve hours a day following an increase in his pain management medication.  It was at this meeting that the chief executive of X College - MH - first suggested that E's behaviour was akin to "Munchausen by proxy".  Three days later, on 18th February, a professionals' meeting took place at the local authority's offices.  Renewed concerns were expressed about the way that E exercised her powers as a deputy.  It was agreed that inquiries would be made as to whether the level of pain relief being administered was appropriate.  It was suggested that the concerns may be at a level to justify a safeguarding investigation and, as a result, a welfare visit took place on 20th February at the family home, attended by a community nurse and police officer.  M appeared well and alert.  Thereafter, LG tried to make contact with E via email but had no response.  Offers to meet her were not taken up.

On 12th March, according to KH, E told him that they had taken M to accident and emergency two days earlier because he was in an immense amount of pain.  He had been diagnosed with what appeared to be brain seizures.  On 19th March, according to KH, E said that M was now on three types of pain relief - paracetamol, ibupfofen and codeine - and this seemed to help.  She thought he was suffering from either migraine clusters or brain seizures.  On 4th April, JR and LG made an unannounced visit to the home.  What happened on this visit is disputed.  The social workers' evidence is that they spoke to A but that E refused to come down to see them as she was busy upstairs and dealing with M.  A told them he would ensure that M came to no harm.  The social workers did not see M on this visit.  </span>

When KH asked to speak to M, he was told he was asleep, although it was 2.30 in the afternoon.  KH also states that, on 23rd April, E told him that M's urinary system had shut down.  When this was passed on to JR, she spoke to the family GP, Dr W.  He told her that he had seen M recently with E, who had shown him video footage of M apparently in pain, and as a result he had prescribed codeine.  He said that M had seemed in good health and no different from any other time when he had seen him.  On 26th April, JR and LG made another unannounced home visit.  Their account on this occasion was that they saw M, who seemed in good health.  E seemed agitated and told the social workers that she had been giving M a hand and foot massage, although the social workers saw no signs of this on M.  E told them that they should not have visited; they should have made an appointment.  On 1st May when KH rang again to check on M's progress, E allegedly told him that M had lost sensation in both his hands and feet, so she was massaging them for two hours each day and night.  Meanwhile, E, with the support of some of the alternative practitioners she had consulted, had requested a blood test to establish the presence of measles and rubella.  Neither was detected, but E remained concerned that the viruses were present in M and quoted one of the alternative practitioners with whom she had consulted, Professor Puri, as supporting her concern.  In May 2013, E sent an email to the Breakspear Unit stating that M was now finding it difficult to walk very far at all.

On 26th June, KH rang again to check on M's progress.  On this occasion he was able to speak to M, who told him that he was feeling better.  It is KH's evidence that E told him that M was extremely weak as he was suffering from autonomic failure.  On 1st July, in a conversation with the senior practitioner at X College, E was said to have recorded that M's immune and nervous systems were down and that the tumours needed operating on and that he had also been diagnosed with chronic blood poisoning.  She mentioned Lyme disease and said that M was now on oxygen for six hours a day.  On 4th July, after M had attended for a pre-operative assessment, KH spoke to E again.  According to his note of the conversation, E said that M had Lyme disease and had tumours in his gum sockets, but the main thing the surgeon was worried about was “the black shadow sitting on the left sinuses”.  E had said that the surgeon had said that he was a cancer and facial reconstruction surgeon and would be able to do facial reconstruction if necessary.  E said that she was concerned that M might not survive the operation, adding "with what has happened in the last five months, it will be a miracle if he pulls through."  She said she would ask MH to arrange an autograph book for M for everyone at X College and Z House to sign, adding "so, if he doesn't pull through, it's something for him to take to the grave."  </span>

At that hearing the local authority and the Official Solicitor were represented by counsel, whereas E appeared in person, accompanied by two friends, who are, I am told at this hearing, the mothers of two other autistic young persons who have been involved in litigation concerning MMR.  The order directed, inter alia, that, pending further order, no medical examination, investigation or treatment of M should be carried out without the knowledge and written approval of his GP, Dr W.  The district judge directed that the local authority carry out by 25th October an assessment of M in order to determine whether it was deemed to be in his best interests to reside with his parents, in supported living or in residential care, and that the other parties responded in seven days as to whether they agreed with that assessment.  The order recited that the court concluded that it was in M's best interests to remain living with his parents pending completion of this assessment.

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">These conclusions led the Official Solicitor and the local authority to be concerned, first, that M might be at risk of harm remaining in E's care and, secondly, and immediately, that he might be at heightened risk of harm when the report of Dr Beck was disclosed to the mother.  The Official Solicitor made an application to me for directions in relation to the disclosure of the report to E and A. By the time the application came on for a hearing the local authority had applied for the immediate removal of M from the care of E and A and this was supported by the Official Solicitor.  At the conclusion of that hearing on 6th March, I authorised M's removal the following day, into an emergency placement at an establishment - hereafter referred to as “N House” - run by an organisation - hereafter referred to as “C Limited” - some sixty miles from the family home and in a different County, and ordered that he should reside there until further order.  I listed the matter for a hearing on notice before me on 11th March and I gave supplementary directions.  </span>

I directed, inter alia, that the hearing previously listed on 28th March should be used to determine M's interim placement prior to the hearing in June and gave further directions as to that hearing.  I made a detailed order as to interim contact arrangements and an order preventing the mother from removing M from his placement, attending at or visiting the accommodation or communicating with him by any other means other than those specified in the contact order.  I further ordered that E and A should not, whether by themselves or by encouraging any other person to do so, disclose or publish any information relating to the proceedings to any person, including any media organisation, save for their legal representatives.  I gave permission to E to instruct a consultant forensic psychiatrist to report on whether she suffered from any mental illness or disorder and her relationship with M.  Subsequently, Dr Gwen Adshead was instructed pursuant to this direction, and met E on two occasions. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">At the hearing on 28th March, when E and A were still represented by Miss Ball, oral evidence was given by Dr Beck, Mr McKinstrie and E.  I reserved judgment over the weekend and gave judgment on 31st March, concluding that it was in M's best interests to continue to reside at N House in the interim pending conclusion of the final hearing listed in June 2014.  I recorded in a recital that there should be supervised contact between M and his parents at N House on three occasions every week for two hours on each occasion, subject to this being in M's best interests and that the length of the contact sessions and the need for supervision would be reviewed regularly.  I renewed the orders preventing the removal of M from N House and against any unauthorised disclosure of information relating to the proceedings.  At the hearing Miss Ball had argued for the instruction of a suitable physician to prepare a chronology of medical and complimentary medical involvement.  I adjourned that issue to a further directions hearing on 10th April.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">At that adjourned hearing on 10th April, the issue of interim contact was revisited but I concluded that the court was in no position to amend the current arrangements in the absence of evidence.  I declared that it was in M's best interests to have contact in accordance with the terms set out in a schedule as to the dates, times, provisions for reviews and E's behaviour.  Following the course advocated by Miss Ball on behalf of E and A, I gave permission to the parties jointly to instruct a consultant psychiatrist with a specialism in autism and learning disabilities to prepare a medical chronology, to include a chronology of complimentary medical therapies in relation to M and, if possible, to provide an opinion as to whether past medical and other investigations/assessments of him had been in his best interests.  I further gave permission to the parties jointly to instruct a consultant gastroenterologist to provide an opinion as to M's dietary needs and the need for biomedical supplements.  I directed that the cost of these instructions be borne in the proportions of one half by the local authority, one third by M and one sixth by E on the basis that the local authority should provide an indemnity to E in relation to her share of the costs which E should discharge by payment to them at or before the conclusion of the proceedings, adding that there would be permission to any party to apply for a different allocation of the costs of the reports at the conclusion of the hearing in June.  I gave directions that, if the parties were unable to agree the identity of these two experts, the matter should be referred back to me for a decision on paper.  In the event, (with hindsight, unsurprisingly), the parties were unable to agree on the choice of experts and the matter was, indeed, referred back to me.  On 25th April, I approved the experts identified by the local authority and the Official Solicitor, namely the psychiatrist, Dr Carpenter, and the gastric surgeon, Professor Williamson.  As the parents objected to this choice, I amended the previous order so as to exclude them from the instruction and reallocate the funding so that the costs of instruction would be borne by the local authority and M equally.  I added that, if E and A wished to apply for the instruction of a further expert or experts, as had been intimated, such application should be made in the appropriate form and on notice to the other parties by 5th May 2014 and, if opposed, should be listed for hearing before me.  No application was pursued prior to 5th May, but subsequently E and A applied for permission to call a psychologist, Dr Kenneth Aitkin, as their expert.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">On 18th May, E and A filed a notice that thereafter they would be acting in person.  Asked to prepare a witness schedule, E filed a document which appeared to indicate that she wished to call, or at least rely on the evidence of, 91 witnesses at the hearing, including Keith J, who had heard part of the litigation involving MMR, and their MP, the Right Honourable Mr Michael Fallon, and for 48 witnesses to be required to attend for cross-examination.  A further case management hearing was convened on 4th June, at which E reduced the number of witnesses required.  Having heard the application by E to adduce expert evidence, notwithstanding that the application was being pursued some weeks after the expiry of the time limit for such an application and only two weeks prior to the start of the final hearing, I made an order permitting E and A to instruct either Dr Aitkin or another expert, Mr Paul Shattock, on condition that. (1) whichever expert was instructed would confirm that they would produce a report by 9th June, (2) the expert's costs would be borne by E and A, (3) the expert instructed would receive copies of certain identified court documents and (4) the scope of the report would be limited to advice as to the appropriateness of medical and other treatment for autistic people generally and M in particular.  I further ordered E to produce by 6th June a list of all relevant documents which she maintained were missing from the court bundles, which had by then been prepared for the final hearing, running to over 30 lever arch files.  I directed that M's solicitors should use their best endeavours to identify those documents which were not in the bundles, whereupon E would provide copies of all such documents to the solicitors for onward distribution as appropriate.  The purpose of these directions was to ensure that all relevant documents were available at the start of the hearing.  In the event, this direction was not properly complied with and E and A proceeded to produce a steady stream of documents throughout the hearing, amounting in the end to over 700 pages.  I extended the time for E and A to file all statements from all witnesses from whom they intended to adduce evidence to 9th June, indicating that such statements would stand as their evidence-in-chief, subject to any supplemental questions that might be allowed by the court.  </span>

At that hearing it emerged that, contrary to my clear direction, E and A had sought and obtained reports from both Dr Aitkin and Mr Shattock.  Nonetheless, I allowed both reports to be filed and relied upon.  E and A had not filed all the statements from witnesses as directed by the court.  I extended the time for filing to 13th June - the last working day before the start of the hearing.  Dr Carpenter's evidence was started at the hearing on 10th June but not completed.  It became clear that the 10 days allocated for the case were insufficient and a further three days were identified, with Dr Carpenter to return on one of those days.  I gave a number of further miscellaneous directions, several devoted to the disclosure of further medical records, as it was alleged by E that some of M's records were missing.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In addition, M's parents had expressed concern at the suitability of the current placement at N House.  They were concerned as to the quality of care he was receiving there, pointing in particular to an increase in his weight and an alleged deterioration in his condition which they attributed to the fact that he was no longer following the prescribed diet.  Subsequently, a report from a GP local to N House indicated that M was in good health.  E and A urged the court to consider authorising his move to another home run by C Limited - hereafter referred to as “W House” - which was much closer to the family home and, furthermore, was known to M and the family as by this stage some of the contact sessions had been relocated there.  I directed that Mr McKinstrie be asked to consider the suitability of such a move in the event that the court was unable to deliver its judgment for some weeks.  </span>

They say that they have accurately reported his symptoms, which are difficult to interpret because of M's autism and communication difficulties.  As for their use of alternative and complimentary treatments, they say that they have done nothing wrong.  They assert that, in addition to what they describe as the standard approach of cranial osteopathy and homeopathy, along with what they consider a responsible dietary intake and natural supplements, they have kept ahead of research and used appropriate alternative therapies to avoid the need for medication and further complications.  They point out that many people, including conventional doctors, accept and in some cases recommend the use of such treatments for autism.  It is their case that these treatments and the adherence to a careful diet has worked well for M, including the use of a gluten and casein free regime.  They deny that taking the supplements has caused him any harm.  E and A point out that they have acted on the advice of a specialist, Ms Haywood, and that thousands of people follow such regimes, including leading sportsmen and women.  They say that they “fail to see why different standards should be applied in the management of optimum health and performance for someone merely because they happen to be disabled."</span>

When M became ill in 2012/13 and suffered from high levels of pain, the steps they took to establish what was wrong were reasonable. Since they were unable to establish what was wrong, they kept an open mind to ensure that nothing was missed, including, for example, Lyme disease, hypersensitivity to electromagnetic radiation and undetected brain tumours.  E’s concerns about the inadequacy of the NHS test practices led her to send samples abroad for further testing.

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Had control been their aim, they would never have pursued an out of county placement.  Theirs was a normal functioning family characterised by unconditional love.  Guidance on diet and other matters were merely at the request of the college and care provider and were not prescriptive, but rather a basis which could be built upon.  They were helping the staff to get to know M's likes and dislikes without having to discover the hard way.  E stated that she is a very precise individual and passed on the information in a way that ensured clarity.  They refute the suggestion that the staff at the homes found the amount of information provided excessive.  On the contrary, the staff told them that it was helpful and in some respects, for example diet, adopted the guidance for other residents in the home.  They accepted that the documents were lengthy but stated that this was justified because of the range of staff that had to use them, including agency and bank staff, and the difficulty that M has in communicating his own needs.  They drew attention to a comment by Dr Khouja in his report during the first Court of Protection litigation that it was in M's best interests to have a set of appropriate guidelines for staff in order for them to deliver high quality care because people on the autistic spectrum respond well to consistency and predictability.  They point out that the staff at X College did not have a problem with this approach.  In the Scott schedule, in response, however, E adds that the guidance "developed into measures to counteract the failings and neglect of others".  It quickly became apparent that the care home environment did not suit M but it was unavoidable if he was going to attend the college.  Such an environment had to meet the needs of a range of users with different needs.  In the case of Y House, there were residents of a much wider age range than had been anticipated at the time that M was first placed there.  The guidance was the way to ensure that M's needs were met.  So far as bowel movement management was concerned, they assert that in childhood, due to his gut problems, he had required the use of an aggressive bowel clearance treatment and that the monitoring of his bowel habits was designed to guard against repetition of these problems.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">On the particular issue of the GP registration, E and A state that a number of the residents at Y House remained registered with their family GPs.  Dr W was familiar with M, and M knew him well.  They do not accept that M missed out on support from the learning disability team in the locality of Y House since he received a wide range of support via X College.  E and A do not accept that M's life was restricted, and point to the large number of activities that they enabled him to access when he was living at home, both before he went to X College and after he returned in 2013.  They want his life to be as full as possible, hence their pursuit of a further education place, initially in East Anglia and then at X College.  One of their main complaints about Y House was the paucity of activities available to M in contrast to what he had been used to at home.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">As for the allegation about restricting access, E denies that she inappropriately used her deputyship as a way of causing professionals to abide by her instructions.  She asserts that she has been fully aware of her obligations as a deputy and acted in accordance with the Mental Capacity Act and all relevant guidance at all times.  She points to the positive comments about her made by the Office of the Public Guardian.  She asserts that generally she has worked in a collaborative way with professionals.  The reasons for asking that any information to be passed on to the local authority should be requested from them, rather than given by the care staff at the home, was to ensure clarity of information.  They objected to the referral to an advocacy service because they were not consulted and because they believed it was made as a ruse to get M to say that he wanted to transfer to a GP local to Y House.  In any event, it is their case that M did not need an advocate as E was acting as his deputy and as his "support and collaborator".  E and A refute the allegation that they denied the social workers access to M after he left Z House.  It is asserted that the series of emails which LG claimed to have sent to them was never received.

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">As for working with professionals, E and A point to their good relations with other professionals involved in M's care, including the alternative and complimentary medical practitioners and many of the mainstream doctors who have treated M over the years, in particular his GP, Dr W.  They say that tensions only arose in 2008 when the local authority forced them to start litigation to secure funding for the specialist education they sought for M.  E and A say that their many criticisms of professionals who have been involved in this case since 2008 are all justified.  They stand by the criticisms that they have made of the social workers – MS, LG and JR, the Head of Adult Services, MW, the staff at Y House, Z House and N House and the experts who have been involved in the case, in particular Dr Carpenter, Dr Beck and Mr McKinstrie.  In oral evidence E agreed that it was her case that no fewer than 13 of these professionals had lied in their evidence to this court.  E accepted that she may have appeared angry at times but said this was not surprising given the extent of her frustration at the actions of the local authority.  She maintains that the local authority was motivated against them from the outset of the placement at Y House because MW had chaired the funding panel at the time of the judicial review application and would have taken it as a personal slight that they had successfully litigated over that issue.  E and A say that they were concerned at the poor quality of staff at Y House throughout M's time at the home.  In their response they described it as a failing care provider and assert that the care manager, PL, "had a desperate need for control over the residents."  It was to address these concerns and on the advice of X College that E had applied for deputyship.  At Z House the staff had been better at the outset but things had deteriorated when a new home manager, CH, took over.  E and A deny the charge levelled by the local authority that E is a vexatious complainant who uses the threats of complaints as a method of bullying.  </span>

It is their case that each approach is equally valid and should be given equal respect.  They assert, however, that many members of the "mainstream medical" lobby do not treat the "mainstream autism" approach with proper respect, but rather have pursued a campaign to undermine the use of alternatives to mainstream medicine.  </span>

First, they assert that there has been a systematic conspiracy by the medical profession to conceal the truth about the effects of the MMR vaccine and its links with autism.  Secondly, they assert that the employees of this local authority have fabricated a case against them with the aim of removing M from their care for financial reasons, to acquire control of his benefits and limit the amount of money the authority has to spend on him and, furthermore, has drawn into this conspiracy all the other professionals involved in this case - the staff at Y House, X College and N House and some of the doctors - all of whom they say are financially dependent on the renewal of future contracts with the local authority.  Thirdly, they assert that the Official Solicitor, far from representing M properly in these proceedings, has used them as an opportunity to pursue an agenda of undermining the prospects of future litigation about the MMR vaccination and to that end has deliberately chosen experts (Dr Carpenter and Professor Williamson) whose views are known and who have been involved in similar cases in the past.  They assert that the Official Solicitor and the local authority have attempted to attract political favour by bringing the MMR issue into this litigation.  </span>

With hindsight, the time estimate was plainly too short, but the case was undoubtedly extended by the fact that E and A were representing themselves.  At the hearing E acted as advocate and A as note-taker and supporter.  In some respects this arrangement worked well.  At the outset I was told by E that she had problems with communications attributable to a long-standing neurological condition.  In closing submissions I pointed out to her that, having listened to her for 20 days, I had detected no problems with communication whatsoever.  I found it difficult during the hearing to keep E on the point when she was cross-examining witnesses.  This problem arises of course, with many litigants in person and, indeed, some professional advocates.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">E and A complained that, notwithstanding the efforts of the court, they have been unable to compete with the "limitless public funding and resources" at the disposal of the local authority and the Official Solicitor.  Mr Bagchi, on behalf of the Official Solicitor, stated that other parties have recognised that the litigation would be an arduous process and have afforded E and A substantial assistance with the storage and transportation of the court bundles, with copying facilities for the papers and with a daily opportunity to identify in advance the documents relevant to the witnesses to be called; that the Official Solicitor's representatives have, additionally, assisted with securing the attendance of E and A's witnesses and seeking disclosure of documentation from third parties for their use and that E and A were given an early sight of the final submissions and have been provided with a neutral overview of the law and supporting materials.  E does not wholly share this view of the degree of cooperation provided by the other legal teams, asserting that they "wanted to appear to assist us throughout the trial" and asserting that the cooperation tailed off as the trial progressed.  My firm impression, however, is that E and A were afforded a high degree of assistance by the other legal teams throughout the hearing.  </span>

I am satisfied that as a result E and A, and indeed M, have received a fair hearing, but this was only achieved at the cost of a significant lengthening of the proceedings.  One lesson of this case is that, if parties such as E and A are to be unrepresented in hearings of this kind, be it in the Court of Protection or in the Family Court, the hearings will often take very considerably longer than if they were represented.  Denying legal aid in such cases is, thus, a false economy.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In total, the court papers filled some 33 lever arch files (court documents and file records) plus two further lever arch files of documents produced by E and A during the hearing.  No doubt if the parents had been represented, it might have been possible to reduce this material into a core bundle, as I did myself at the conclusion of the hearing.  Even those 35 files may not represent the totality of the disclosable documents that might have been produced.  For example, no health visitor records were produced for the period of M's early years.  At a very late stage E alluded to the possibility that she may have copies of these records somewhere in the loft at her home.  Furthermore, and despite my explaining the rules about disclosure on more than one occasion, I am not entirely satisfied that E and A have complied with their obligation to disclose all relevant documents, including those that do not support their case.  At one point E's medical records were produced and, when E objected to their disclosure on grounds of confidentiality, I conducted a public interest immunity examination to determine which pages of the records were relevant.  In the event, I concluded that only 16 pages fell into that category, but E insisted on challenging the disclosure of some of those pages on the grounds that they would assist the other parties.  This illustrates another consequence of parties appearing without representation in these cases, namely that the courts may have to devise new rules as to disclosure.  </span>

For example, someone such as a family carer who is close to a person with profound and multiple learning disabilities might apply to be appointed as a deputy with authority to make such decisions.  The most appropriate way to act in the person's best interests is to have a deputy who will consult relevant people but have the final authority to make decisions; if there is a history of serious family disputes that could have a detrimental effect on the person's future care unless the deputy is appointed to make decisions; the person who lacks capacity is felt to be at risk of serious harm if left in the care of family members.  In these rare cases, welfare decisions may need to be made by someone independent of the family, such as a local authority officer.  There may even be a need for an additional court order prohibiting those family members having contact with that person."</span>

That does not, however, justify the appointment of family members as deputies simply because they are able and willing to serve in that capacity.  The words of s.16(4) are clear.  They do not permit the court to appoint a deputy simply because 'it feels confident it can' but only when satisfied that the circumstances and the decisions which will fall to be taken will be more appropriately taken by a deputy or deputies rather than by a court, bearing in mind the principle that decisions by courts are to be preferred to decisions by deputies.  Even then, the appointment must be as limited in scope and duration as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I start with M's mother, E.  Although she was the penultimate witness, it is appropriate to consider her first.  E has dominated this hearing in a way quite unlike any other case in my professional experience.  In assessing her, I rely not only on her oral evidence which was given over the last few days of the hearing, but also on her performance as an advocate representing herself and her husband over the preceding 17 days.  I use the word "performance" deliberately because that is what it was.  E performed the role of advocate throughout the hearing.  She has described the experience of these proceedings as being "insufferable" but on many occasions during the hearing I had the clear sense that she was relishing the opportunity to put across her case about which she plainly feels very strongly.  In his closing submissions, Mr Bagchi said of E that she:</span>

I have no doubts that E adores her son and her daughter, and that she has devoted much of her life to her children and, in particular, to getting the most that can be achieved for her son.  Her devotion is not, however, selfless.  On more than one occasion she said that this was case was about her and, although she was quick to retract that comment, when I pointed out that it was actually about M, there was no doubt that she felt she was the main focus of the inquiry.  She was the centre of attention and, in my judgment, at times obviously enjoying the experience.  </span>

	      <marker name="tab"/>
	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">It was E's case that she had suffered from a neurological condition - vestibular neuritis - that causes problems with communication and memory.  This was her excuse for clandestinely recording her interviews with a number of witnesses, including Dr Beck, Dr Adshead and Mr McKinstrie.  Plainly, if she has a problem with memory, this is something that the court would have to take into account when considering her evidence, so I deal with it at this point.  E suggested at the outset of the hearing that she would provide a report from her treating neurologist, but no report appeared.  Her medical records did not support the suggestion that she suffered from problems with memory and her GP, Dr W, confirmed that the key feature of this condition is the onset of dizziness and does not to his knowledge include memory loss.  In her oral evidence she had no difficulty apparently recalling detailed events from many years ago.  I have already observed that she showed no difficulty in communicating. Mr Bagchi submits that her suggestion that she had a memory problem was just a crude cover story to avoid criticism for her secret recordings.  I agree.  Her decision to record certain professionals was born out of her intense suspicion of those who she perceived or anticipated would disagree with her rather than any problem with memory.  In short, this was an example of E exaggerating or fabricating an account of her own health for her own ends.  I shall consider later whether this was a pattern of behaviour that she demonstrated with regard to M.  </span>

She never once interrupted inappropriately, preferring to raise her hand whenever she wanted to make a point.  At times she came across as a warm and humane person.  At other times, however, she was domineering and even on occasions intimidating, in particular when cross-examining some of the witnesses called by the local authority; for example, KH.  Dr Beck reported that throughout her meetings with E, she had the impression that she was attempting to control the interview.  E used a number of tactics to avoid answering questions and ensure that the interview was focused on materials she considered important, including talking a great deal and without allowing interruption, providing emotive impressions which lacked concrete detail, and jumping from one topic to another.  Dr Beck reported that she felt on occasion as if E had embarked on a monologue and she found that she had to be very firm and to interrupt her, and when she did interrupt her, E sometimes apologised and at other times protested, but invariably continued talking about whatever she wanted to talk about, without apparently being influenced by Dr Beck's interruption. Dr Beck had the impression that E was keen to control the interview and that, if she reflected on this with her, E's apologies were not genuine and she did not generally change her behaviour as a result.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">My experience of E was very similar.  Despite her respectful attitude to the court, she tried to control the court process.  She endeavoured to focus on what she thought was important rather than the issues raised by the other parties.  On a number of occasions she embarked on a monologue and it was very difficult to stop her.  When interrupted she often apologised but almost invariably went back to the topic that she wanted to talk about.  In the end, I concluded that attempts to interrupt her or to try to focus her attention on the issues that were of concern to the court were doomed to fail.  </span>

She found that the mother seemed to regard herself as superior and adopting a patronising attitude.  The same tendencies were apparent in her oral evidence and at other times in the hearing, particularly towards the staff at the various homes where M has lived.  Dr Beck thought that E's manner reflected the fragility of her intra-psychic structures.  In Dr Beck's opinion, E relies heavily on M's needs and complaining about them not being met to provide structure and meaning to her life.  It is Dr Beck's view that E:</span>

Dr Beck did not believe that everything she said was a lie, nor that the mother herself could always recall which of her stories were true and which were not.

E gave a detailed account of her employment history in the NHS, involving a succession of posts in catering, in the course of which she has acquired some qualifications, but the history was somewhat nebulous.  The circumstances in which she left her employment were also left unclear, although at one point of the hearing she spoke of difficulties having arisen because she had been a whistleblower.  E's GP records include a letter from a solicitor to her former GP in 2006 seeking disclosure of her records for the purposes of a claim against her former employers in the employment tribunal and alluding to a separate claim for personal injury arising out of alleged breach of employer's duties.  It would have been interesting to explore that aspect of her background in more detail, but to do so would have extended the hearing even further.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In Dr Beck's opinion, E has a narcissistic personality disorder which involves her having (1) an exaggerated sense of her own self-importance and simultaneously a fear that she may be of no importance whatsoever, and vacillating between these two extremes; and (2) impaired interpersonal functioning whereby she cannot identify with the feelings and needs of others.  In her supplemental report, Dr Beck added that the people with narcissistic personality disorder usually lack empathy for others and often think that they are the most important thing in everyone else's life and that the world should be organised around them.  Dr Beck advises that this disorder is extremely difficult to treat.  The major challenge in the treatment of narcissistic personality disorder is that most people who suffer from it do not accept that they have it and in fact work hard to defend themselves against it.  In Dr Beck's opinion, it is not feasible in this case that E's narcissistic personality disorder could be alleviated in a reasonable timescale for M.  Dr Adshead agreed with Dr Beck that there are significant features of personality disorder in E's presentation, mainly narcissistic and histrionic features.  In addition, she suspects that E may have some features of an emotionally unstable personality disorder.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Dr Beck also expressed the view that E has factitious disorder imposed on others.  In her oral evidence she confirmed that this diagnosis is dependent on the court's findings on the local authority's allegations that she has fabricated or exaggerated M's symptoms.  Dr Adshead also stated that any diagnosis would turn on the court's findings of fact.  I shall, therefore, return to this aspect of the case towards the end of the judgment.  </span>

She believes that the local authority are pursuing this case in order to gain control of M so that they can spend as little money as possible.  She said that it seemed to her as though he was being used as an experiment.  He was completely different from the person he had been six month ago.  At the conclusion of her evidence she read out a further statement setting out her views, beginning with a comment that she “truly believed that the local authority will not stop this hatred campaign until her parents have keeled over and died”.  </span>

They were critical of the way in which their son had been looked after at Y House, including a lack of attention paid to diet and sensory issues which effect some people with autism.  Like E, they found Z House to be an improvement after Y House but they, too, thought that the situation had deteriorated after CH took over as manager.  They had concerns about the attention being given to their son's health and recounted how he had undergone an emergency operation after staff had failed to appreciate the seriousness of his condition.  As a result, they alerted E and it seems that their warnings played a part in leading E to take M home in February 2013 because of concerns about his health.  </span>

He described this approach in evidence as "practising defensively".  In some respects, therefore, he was acting in a fashion that could be regarded as typical of an older style family GP.  In his evidence he was taken through the list of conditions which E asserted M had suffered from and he excluded a considerable number.  In their final submissions filed on the morning of the judgment, E and A expressed a degree of disillusionment with Dr W and said that they were considering their position as to whether or not he should remain their GP.

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Ms Haywood, whose professional qualification is a diploma from the College of National Nutrition, has played a major role in advising E in recent years.  The papers contain a number of emails passing between E and Ms Haywood and it is clear from reading them that there are others which have not been disclosed.  I am satisfied that in the course of her involvement with the family Ms Haywood has given advice that went well beyond her expertise.  One glaring example was Lyme disease when, on her advice, given after seeing a photograph of a mark on M's leg, E sent urine samples abroad for further testing.  Subsequently, Ms Haywood confidently expressed an opinion on the interpretation of the results of those tests.  She has no chemistry or other qualification that equips her to do so.  I was also concerned that Ms Haywood had prescribed the dietary protocol for M without seeing him and with no independent knowledge of his medical history, content to rely solely on what she was told by E; for example, that M had a chronic gut disorder.  In contrast to Mr Shattock's Sunderland Protocol, which recommends the systematic testing of diets and supplements individually, Ms Haywood was content to prescribe a dietary programme without testing each individual component separately.  She did not agree with the NICE guidelines as to the impact of diet on autism.  She had forthright views on many things, saying, for example, at one point that she did not like Cancer Research UK.  I was left with a profound anxiety about Ms Haywood's influence on E and her role in the treatment that M has received.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">There was one other matter which gave rise to concern about this part of the evidence.  None of the three witnesses had received any training on the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and it was clear from their evidence that none of them had given proper consideration to the question whether M had capacity to consent to their assessments or the treatment they were prescribing.  The family GP, Dr W, also admitted in his oral evidence that he only made a detailed study of the Act and the Code of Practice when he was told that he would be giving evidence in this case, and he identified a number of learning points about the Mental Capacity Act arising out of his involvement in these proceedings.  Mr Bagchi reminded me in his closing submissions of the concerns expressed in the House of Lords' Select Committee on the Mental Capacity Act 2005 Post-Legislative Scrutiny Report on the implementation of the Act, dated 30th March 2014, about the general lack of awareness by the general public and professionals of the principles and workings of the legislation.  This case has highlighted the urgent need for all health professionals, including those practising in alternative and complimentary medicine, to familiarise themselves with the Act so that they can apply its principles and procedures when they treat a person who lacks capacity, as most of them will at some point.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Dr Carpenter also considered the various other diagnoses that had been suggested over the years.  I shall review his observations about the physical diagnoses later, but at this stage I record his comment on the diagnosis of "regressive autism" which was mentioned at various points in M's history and is still cited by his parents as part of the diagnosis.  Dr Carpenter points out that there is no such formal diagnosis in the international classification systems, although it is a term often used informally to describe the regression that can occur at about aged 16 to 20 months.  He noted that it was mentioned as a diagnosis by the Royal Free Hospital in March 2001 and concluded that this was a reasonable statement having regard to the history supplied by the parents.  Dr Carpenter stated that about 25% of children with autism have a history of regression which has over the years been attributed to a variety of external causes, including at one stage the MMR vaccination.  Dr Carpenter says that no single external cause has been identified to explain this common regression, which may be a consequence of normal maturation within the brain and in most cases does not indicate an external brain insult.  Dr Carpenter noted that there had been different accounts of M's development in the first two years of life and, in particular, the date on which he was perceived as deteriorating.  I shall recount his assessment of the history in more detail later.  Assuming the account of his normal development, followed by a dramatic regression is true, Dr Carpenter describes regressive autism as "an informal, unofficial subcategory", which fits the picture.  He adds, however, that the contemporaneous notes show no such regression, although there was a lack of progress.  </span>

Furthermore, he dismisses the use of the phrase "severe somatic and pragmatic language and communication disorder" as adding anything to the diagnosis since there is no evidence that he has communication difficulties going beyond those to be expected in someone with childhood autism.   Dr Carpenter bluntly concludes that M has childhood autism and that anything else should be seen as a euphemism.  </span>

They reached similar conclusions.  Dr Carpenter's impression from meeting with M, the accounts of the staff and the past assessments is that he has been very well trained to do things through rote learning.  It is, however, much less clear whether he understands what he is doing and why or when to use what he has learned.  Dr Carpenter considers that his apparent low level of understanding is masked by his rote learned skills.  With some things M is clear, for example, when he refuses things, but Dr Carpenter finds it telling that lengthy work with advocacy and speech and language therapist has still only enabled them to establish some basic understanding.  Frankly, Dr Carpenter has severe doubts that he can reliably communicate any complex decision.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">This is one aspect of the case where there is no substantial disagreement.  It is not disputed that he lacks mental capacity to litigate these proceedings, to make decisions relating to his residence and his contact with others or as to his medical treatment, nor is it disputed that he lacks mental capacity to make decisions relating to his dietary or nutritional needs or to have biomedical supplements or engage in medical therapies.  Dr Khouja concluded that he was able to make a decision from a list of options presented to him in relation to choices of food, diet and activities and also whether to go home for weekend visits.  Dr Carpenter accepted that he had the capacity with regard to food but not other activities or weekend visits.  However, decisions as to activities involving an assessment of risks and consequences and decisions about going home are, in Dr Carpenter's phrase, "fraught with value-laden issues."  Both Dr Khouja and Dr Carpenter thought that, in those areas where M had capacity, he should be actively supported and given the opportunity to make choices in accordance with the underlying principles of the Mental Capacity Act.  Both experts identified his communication difficulties as a significant feature.  Dr Carpenter identified:</span>

As stated above, W House is much closer to the family home and, therefore, to the family and social network and activities with which M is familiar.  E and A are anxious that M should move to W House as soon as possible, and indeed sought to argue in the course of the hearing that this move should take place immediately.  For different reasons, the other parties are opposed to an immediate move; the local authority because of concerns that E was becoming too close to the manager of W House, and the Official Solicitor because of advice from Mr McKinstrie that the move should not occur until a significant number of the other residents have already moved in, before a full complement of staff have been recruited and trained, routines established and teething problems overcome and a rigorous care plan produced in conjunction with C Limited for the approval of the court.  </span>

From photographs he pointed out and named members of his family and other residents and support workers at N House.  Later, when we went into the garden, M spent some time on the trampoline, which he plainly enjoyed.  My abiding impression of M is of a warm and friendly young man who clearly enjoys life.  I can well understand why his family feel so strongly about him and want to do whatever they can to ensure that he gets the most out of life.  It is manifestly right that everything should be done to bring this about, for example, by helping him to access a wide range of activities, as he has done in the past when living at home.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Dr Carpenter reached the conclusion in his report that the diagnosis of M's autism as having been induced by the MMR vaccine is inconsistent with the independent contemporary evidence and, therefore, not viable.  He notes that M's parents did not link his apparent regression to the MMR injection until after the publication of Dr Wakefield's paper in 1998.  Dr Carpenter has carried out, as requested, a full analysis of the medical records and found that the first account of M deteriorating immediately after the MMR vaccination was not given until 2001.  E's subsequent accounts of M's reaction to the vaccination - of a child developing normally prior to the vaccination and thereupon having seizures, screaming fits and declining into a vegetative state for six months - is incompatible with the other records.  There is no mention of adverse effects or any reference to a bad MMR reaction in the GP records.  Dr Carpenter notes that a few months after the MMR, the GP records show M being described as hyperactive, which Dr Carpenter points out is inconsistent with the account of his being in a vegetative state.  When a change of GP took place a few months later, there was no note of any recent adverse event being recounted to the new doctor.  If M had been in a severely regressed state at this time, Dr Carpenter would have expected this to have been mentioned to the new GP.  Furthermore, 21 months after the MMR, when giving a detailed account of his development to Dr Baird, no mention was made by the parents of any deleterious reaction to the MMR.  On the contrary, their account concentrated on an earlier deterioration after an illness at age 10 months - seven months before the MMR was administered.  In cross-examination by E, Dr Carpenter said that any adverse reaction to the MMR vaccination which had caused a regression in M's development would have been recorded in his 24 month developmental check and it was not.  What was recorded was not regression, but a lack of progress.  </span>

	      <marker name="tab"/>
	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">After the allegation of an adverse reaction to MMR was eventually recorded in 2001, it became more dramatic in subsequent accounts.  Thus, in 2001 the description was: "Distressed after injection.  Had fever.  Eyes glazed, dilated and fixed." E's account became more florid over time, with references to screaming, jolting, spasming and a persistent vegetative state.  In her final statement she said that: "M died within six hours of the MMR." In the witness box she gave a full account of the events on the day on which the MMR was administered and M's reaction to it.  E acknowledges in her final statement that she uses certain words and phrases in her own particular way.  For example, for her the phrase "vegetative state" means "slipping in and out of consciousness, not responding and appearing lifeless."  And her use of the word "died" to describe what happened to M means "stopped breathing and lost consciousness".  For E, her use of these words and phrases is as valid as the way in which they are used by medical professionals.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">For some time E has alleged that part of M's medical record is missing.  The inference that she invited the court to draw was that pages had been deliberately removed to conceal contemporaneous records of his reaction to the MMR.  It is now clear that no part of the records have been removed.  One page of the records was missing and copies produced by E and A, but the original record was intact.  I am not going to speculate on the reason why the copies produced by E and A are incomplete.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">If M had an experienced an extreme reaction to the vaccine, as now alleged, it is inconceivable that E and A would not have sought medical advice and thereafter told all doctors and other medical practitioners about what had happened.  As I put it to E in the course of the hearing, there are only three possible explanations for what has happened.  The first is that E did give the account to Dr Baird and all the other practitioners at every appointment, but each of them has negligently failed to record it. The second is that she gave an account but all the practitioners have chosen not to include it in their records.  That is what E maintains has happened, alleging that the whole of the medical profession is deliberately concealing the truth about the MMR vaccine.  The third is that E has fabricated, or at least grossly exaggerated, her account.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">As recounted above, part of M's diagnosis as expressed by E is that M has autistic enterocolitis, or leaky gut syndrome.  Just as this case is not an inquiry into whether there is a link between the MMR vaccine and autism, so also it is not an inquiry into whether there is a form of colitis associated with autism.  I note, however, that in his report Dr Carpenter advised that autistic enterocolitis is not a recognised condition.  It was put forward by Dr Wakefield, and is now discredited and withdrawn by The Lancet paper, and no independent peer review paper has been published subsequently to confirm the findings of colitis in autism.  Professor Williamson described autistic enterocolitis as "a controversial entity".  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">E has repeatedly stated that M was diagnosed with enterocolitis at the Royal Free Hospital in 2001.  In his report, Dr Carpenter observed that, if this is the case, then it must have occurred at an examination that is not contained in the Royal Free records and not communicated to the GP.  He was unable to find any evidence in the papers disclosed to him to support the parents ever having been given a formal diagnosis of enterocolitis.  The Royal Free tested for gluten free sensitivity and bowel inflammation but found no evidence of any anomaly other than constipation.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Professor Williamson also noted that, unlike some patients seen by Dr Wakefield and his colleagues, M was not given the label of autistic enterocolitis.  In his careful analysis of the relevant medical records, Professor Williamson found no evidence to support an organic disease of the gastrointestinal tract in M, with the sole exception that, according to the doctors at the Royal Free who saw M in 2001-2, when they were reporting accounts given by his carers, M's bowel habit had alternated between diarrhoea and constipation.  Professor Williamson noted that M had had none of the typical symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.  In his evidence, Mr Shattock disagreed, suggesting that constipation was a symptom associated with gut disorders seen in persons with autism.  On this point, I was concerned that Mr Shattock was speaking outside his sphere of expertise, but it is of little consequence so far as this hearing is concerned.  </span>

I find that not even the Royal Free team, who at that time were leading the way and postulating the link between autism and a form of colitis, found any evidence in 2001 of significant gut disorder in M.

She thought the mark on M's leg had been caused by just such a bite.  Her fears were stoked by comments from Ms Haywood, speaking about a matter in which she was completely unqualified, who warned that testing carried out by British laboratories was inadequate.  At her suggestion, E therefore insisted that samples be sent abroad.  The results suggested that one marker consistent with, though not diagnostic of, Lyme disease was present in one sample.  On this basis E maintained that M had indeed had that condition and continued to include it in summaries of his health history.  For example, when he was admitted to hospital in August 2013 for the dental extraction, E said that he "had tested positive for Lyme disease".  </span>

On examination she found slight tenderness in tooth upper left 6.  An x-ray was taken and revealed that he had an area of periapical infection.  Ms Malik was shown the x-rays in the witness box and confirmed the diagnosis.  The records indicate that she told E that M needed to be assessed urgently for extraction or root canal treatment under general anaesthetic and that E said that she would like to monitor it for now as M was unable to have a local anaesthetic.  The records further indicate that Ms Malik offered antibiotics for M, but E declined.

She denies that there was any talk of root canal treatment or extraction or that antibiotics were offered.

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Two days later after M was examined by Ms Malik, E called an out of hours doctor about M because he had pain and facial puffiness.  When M was examined by the doctor, E reported that he had been seen by a dentist who, according to the doctor’s record, said he had sinusitis.  In court, E denied using the word "sinusitis" but said that she had told the doctor that the dentist had said there was a problem with his sinuses.  According to the doctor's note, on examination the doctor did not detect any definite tenderness in the sinuses, but after E said that M would not definitely say if there was tenderness, the doctor recorded the diagnosis as "likely sinusitis" and prescribed antibiotics.  When M returned to X College and Z House on the Monday after Ms Malik's examination, a diagram was provided (now at page N202 in the bundles) showing the sinuses and recording that the x-rays taken on 21st June had indicated no tooth or gum infection or decay, no nerve irritation, but swelling of the sinuses and pressure from a ruptured wisdom tooth.  This was completely at odds with what Ms Malik said she had advised E.  On 27th July 2012, M was seen by a different dentist at a surgery close to Z House.  On examination nothing untoward was detected.  It seems likely, as suggested in evidence by Ms Malik, that the antibiotics prescribed by the out of hours doctor on 23rd June temporarily alleviated the symptoms.  E requested that no radiographs be taken at the examination on 27th July.  In oral evidence, Ms Malik told the court that a clinician would need to see x-rays to diagnose the presence of abscesses.  </span>

I completely reject that submission.  I found Ms Malik to be an utterly truthful and a reliable witness.  At one stage in the hearing, E suggested that the records had been falsified and Ms Malik had lied to the court because DC was concerned about his surgery being sued for negligence.  For that reason, DC was called by the Official Solicitor, although in the event E did not put it to him that he had falsified the records.  When DC gave evidence, he described Ms Malik as an excellent clinician to whom he had entrusted his patients as locum for many years.  I accept Ms Malik’s account of the examination and what she said to E.  Amongst the many revealing details is her note that E had told her that M could not have a local anaesthetic.  It has been E's case that she is allergic to local anaesthetics following an incident when she was younger, for which there was no independent evidence, and that this has been inherited by M.  Ms Malik's note, therefore, contains something that E must have told her.  </span>

In ignoring Ms Malik's advice, failing to make an urgent appointment with DC on his return, taking M to another dentist, failing to give a full or accurate account to that other dentist and expressly declining further x-rays which would have been likely to reveal the abscesses, E was solely responsible for allowing M's infected mouth to go untreated for over a year, thereby condemning him to further pain and suffering as the area of infection gradually got worse.  Throughout the period of 14 months between Ms Malik's examination and the eventual surgery to extract teeth, M suffered pain, repeatedly described by E, which Ms Malik advised in evidence was probably caused by the abscesses.  Meanwhile, as I find, E pursued other increasingly extreme theories for the causes of M's pain, none of which has any basis in fact, at a time when she knew or ought to have known that the cause of the trouble was the dental infection which she was concealing.  </span>

Other diagnoses put forward by E and dismissed by Dr Carpenter were: rheumatoid arthritis; heavy metal poisoning (based again on an isolated test result when such a diagnosis turns on repeated elevated levels); and a defective blood brain barrier.

During the period June 2012 to September 2013, when this crescendo of false and exaggerated reporting took place, M was subjected to a large number of different tests, examinations and assessments, a number of which were invasive and all of which took up his time which would have been better occupied elsewhere.  </span>

The issue to be determined in these proceedings is whether E has acted in M's best interests by insisting that he is placed on a strict diet, that he receives a range of daily supplements and undergoes a range of treatments and therapies.

That view is plainly shared by others and the validity claimed for alternative treatments and therapies is not confined to autism, but extends to many other diseases and health abnormalities.  In the case of autism, however, the popularity of such treatments seems to be greater because, as Dr Carpenter observes, there is no "cure".  The only approach that has consistently worked, according to Dr Carpenter, is concentrating on education and training and improving skills.  There is, therefore, a greater incentive for people - in particular, parents facing the arduous task of managing an autistic child - to search for anything that might help.  As this case demonstrates, there are plenty of people offering help.  Whether what they are offering is truly helpful is debatable.  Dr Carpenter in oral evidence observed that no medical treatment has been identified that stands up to scrutiny and most of the evidence of the impact or therapies is anecdotal rather than robust, double-blind research science.  </span>

Mr Shattock is another proponent of alternative treatments who, through the Sunderland Protocol, had developed a strategy for determining the effectiveness of individual treatments.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In his closing submissions, Mr Bagchi observed that many people with no relevant mental impairment undergo quasi-medical therapies or take nutritional supplements because they hope and believe that it may promote their health and well-being, even if conventional medical science cannot establish the effectiveness of the treatment.  Those people are able to weigh up the advantages and disadvantages of such products and therapies and make free choices about their own health.  Even if there may be limited physical benefits of such therapies, there may be a beneficial psychological effect in terms of a person's sense of well-being.  Clinicians speak openly of the placebo effect of certain treatments.  Mr Bagchi submitted, however, that the position in relation to a mentally incapacitated person is quite different.  A person like M, without the mental capacity to make his own decisions about health care or diet, is unable to weigh up the advantages and disadvantages of any particular therapy or supplement.  He is reliant upon others to decide whether he should be given the treatment in his best interests by family members, clinicians and, where appointed, a deputy.  It can be accepted that in this context “best interests” may take account of factors other than clinical or medical benefit - as observed by Baroness Hale in the </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Dr Carpenter observed that most of the dietary and nutritional therapies given to M are ones that he has experienced with other patients over the years.  He has not objected to them being used in most cases.  He also observes that E appears to have normally sought professional help when using therapies; that she has not devised treatment protocols without advice.  He adds, however, that he found little evidence that E carried out what he would expect a best interests decision-maker to do when using non-conventional therapies for an adult who does not have capacity to choose for himself: namely, (a) draw in as wide a range of advisors as possible, and (b) ensure that the therapists are fully aware of the medical history.  Dr Carpenter is very concerned that the therapists in this case were not given copies of any diagnostic reports but were, rather, given accounts of how the MMR vaccine had induced a vegetative state and a diagnosis of enterocolitis, which was not supported by any contemporaneous medical records.  </span>

He is concerned at the lack of evidence that E looked at the arguments against therapies, as well as the arguments for.  He is concerned at the apparent inadequacy of some of the assessments prior to starting therapy.  He is also concerned at the apparent lack of monitoring of the effects of therapies.  He notes that, despite the lack of evidence that any of the supplements work, the number and manner of taking them has been allowed to grow so that they now seemingly dominate M’s life and care regime.  It is the quantity and intensity of the supplements given to M that causes concern for Dr Carpenter rather than any single supplement.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">For a number of years, until his placement at N House, M was on a gluten and casein free diet.  The efficacy of this diet for people with autism is a matter of controversy.  Dr Carpenter quoted the guidelines issued by NICE in 2013, which he helped to draft, which recommended against the use of exclusion diets such as gluten or casein free diets for the management of core features of autism in children and young people.  He cites research published by "Research Autism", which he described as a generally respected organisation that attempts to review the evidence of main treatments and interventions in an unbiased manner and which concluded:</span>

Reviewers have found the research evidence to be inconclusive.  Despite this lack of evidence, many people embark on a GFCF diet with high expectations that there will be beneficial effects.  However, these diets can involve significant inconvenience and costs, as well as a significant limitation on what the individual can eat.  Because of this we cannot recommend the use of such diets."</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">A different opinion was expressed by several witnesses called by E and A.  Mr Shattock said that excluding gluten and casein from the diet had been reported as leading to measurable improvements in a high proportion of subjects, though in some instances the improvements were minor and not worth the effort, cost or possible disruption to life.  Those reports are, however, based on the impression of parents and carers rather than any scientific analysis.  Mr Shattock conceded that the benefits of the diet are clinically unproven and frankly acknowledged in his report that, had he been on the NICE committee himself, he would not have been able to disagree with the negative conclusion as to the use of such diets for people with autism.  Dr Aitkin said that in general there are several reasons why such a diet might be considered as part of a management approach in an individual with an autism diagnosis and not merely used as a placebo.  He cited research that suggested that such a diet is safe if properly adhered to and that there is some limited evidence of benefit.  Some individuals with autism showed improvements on such a diet, for reasons other than a casein or gluten free intolerance.  Again, however, the evidence of such improvements is the subject observations of parents and carers rather than any clinical or scientific analysis.  Ms Haywood, however, was clear that there is now overwhelming evidence about how much autistic people benefit from a gluten free diet. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In M's case, there is no clear evidence that being on a GFCF diet is beneficial.  The notes of the Royal Free Hospital recorded on 18th March 2001 that E had tried M on such a diet, but by January 2002 the hospital was recording that “he remains on a normal diet as there were no improvements in his behaviour or bowel habits on a gluten and dairy free diet” and there is no evidence that the Royal Free made any subsequent recommendation that he be put back on that diet.  The diet was subsequently reintroduced unilaterally by E without positive medical approval.  Professor Williamson regards it as a "telling fact" that, since M became resident at N House, he has remained in good physical health despite eating a normal diet, free of any restrictions and devoid of any of the numerous supplements that he had previously been obliged to take.  On the contrary, he is eating well and gaining weight.  When Professor Williamson saw him, he thought that he looked in excellent physical shape.  Professor Williamson advised that, if M can stay well after a restricted diet, vitamins and minerals, it provides “strong evidence to suggest that they are unnecessary."</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">For Dr Carpenter the key feature was that the reason given for M being on a diet - that he had a diagnosis of enterocolitis - was fallacious.  In those circumstances there was no good reason for his diet being restricted in this way.  It seems plain that those who advised E about the diet, in particular Ms Haywood, assumed that the diagnosis of enterocolitis given by E was correct.  The concern about the insistence of the diet in this case was, therefore, not so much about the use of the diet per se, (which is plainly not uncommon amongst people with autism, notwithstanding the clear view expressed in the NICE guidelines), but, rather, the fabricated diagnosis which led to the diet being imposed.  </span>

He notes that: “Research Autism” observed the evidence of nutritional supplements being untested or incapable of being proved and, therefore, it was not a treatment that they could recommend. Dr Carpenter notes, however, that most of the supplements appeared to have no known toxic overdose limit.  He acknowledged that he is not an expert, although he expresses concern in general about how over the years the number of supplements delivered to M has increased dramatically and how the rigidity of instructions given for the supply of the supplements produces what he describes as unnecessary behaviour and choice restrictions of M.  </span>

There is no evidence that the supplements caused physical harm, but I am not persuaded that there is any reliable evidence that they cause any benefit.

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">This approach to supplements was replicated with other treatments and therapies.  By and large, it is the sheer range and number of the treatments and their indiscriminate use on an incapacitated person that gives rise to concern, rather than the risk of any harm befalling the individual.  I accept Dr Carpenter's evidence that there is no evidence that cranial osteopathy, rheumatology, colloidal silver or homeopathy generally are clinically beneficial.  In the case of some treatments, they may have been harmful.  I accept, for example, Dr Carpenter's evidence that there may be concern about the use of auditory integration therapy.  He quoted NICE as finding no good evidence that such therapy works.  Research Autism quoted research evidence to say that such therapy was not helpful in improving perceptions of autism, although it may be of limited use in the help with sensory problems.  Dr Carpenter was concerned, however, that people with hearing loss or infection or damage to the inner ear should not be treated in this way.  Dr Carpenter observed that, for M, who has recurrent ear problems, such therapy was potentially dangerous.  Equally, he was concerned about the use of oxygen therapy.  In his report, his concern was about the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which is associated with risks to ear and teeth, and would have been potentially risky to M. Throughout the hearing, E stated that the oxygen therapy had not been hyperbaric, although I note in her final statement E said at paragraph 245 that M “uses a hyperbaric oxygen chamber for health reasons." The main concerns about oxygen therapy in M's case were, first, the sheer degree of interference with the life of an incapacitated adult required to have oxygen administered to him for up to six hours a day and, second, the question of the theoretical process for the therapy provided by Dr Julu - neurodevelopmental dystautonomia - which is not mentioned in any international classification known to Dr Carpenter.  </span>

M's life was increasingly dominated by the programme of treatment to the exclusion of other activities.  I find that E has implemented a programme of diet, supplements and treatments and therapies indiscriminately, with no analysis as to whether they are for M's benefit, and on a scale that has been oppressive and contrary to his interests.  She has exercised total control of this aspect of M's life.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I stress, again, that I am not making any definitive findings on the efficacy of alternative treatments generally.  That is not the subject of these proceedings, which are about M.  I do, however, find that: (1) there is no reliable evidence that the alternative treatments given to M have had any positive impact on people with autism generally or M in particular and (2) the approach to prescribing alternative treatments to and assessing the impact of such treatments on people with autism in general and M in particular has lacked the rigor and responsibility usually associated with conventional medicine.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">This demonstrates the fallacy of E's belief that there are two parallel approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of autism - "mainstream medical" and "mainstream autism" - each of which is equally valid.  The evidence in this hearing has demonstrated clearly that there is one approach - the clinical approach advocated by Dr Carpenter - that is methodical, rigorous and valid, and other approaches advocated by a number of other practitioners, for which there is no evidence of any positive impact and which (in this case at least) have been followed with insufficient rigor.  Whilst each treatment may be harmless, they may, if imposed collectively and indiscriminately, be unduly restrictive and contrary to the patient's interests.  These disadvantages are compounded when, as in several instances in this case, insufficient consideration is given by the practitioners to the question of whether a mentally-incapacitated patient has consented to or wishes to have the treatment.</span>

Staff felt that the deputyship was impeding M's choices in a number of ways, including diet, clothing and social activities.  RR, the agency's operations manager, spoke of how E had been unhappy that M was expected to do activities with some of the other less able residents.  She objected when staff used the word "peers" to describe the other residents, explaining that in an email to RR dated 19th April 2011, quoting the dictionary definition of "peers" and adding that: “we usually do ignore 'ignorance' as knowing no better" and asking her to arrange a training session to enlighten staff on this matter.  As stated above, a major issue at Y House arose over the parents refusing to allow M to be registered with a local GP.  PL said in evidence that all residents in any care home require a local GP so that they can access the local services that are channelled through NHS referrals.  PL, who took over as acting manager, was particularly concerned that M was being denied his own voice, for example, in the question of whether he should have a local GP.  He said in evidence that he is a believer in the importance of advocacy for people with learning disabilities and had, therefore, referred M to an advocacy service.  He said he felt that M needed an advocate because his life was being controlled by E and he needed to have his own voice.  In cross-examination of PL, E suggested that the purpose was not to give the service users a choice but, rather, to take the voice away from the parents and family members.  PL did not accept that this was so.  He said that he wanted to help M to live his life to the full.  </span>

After M left, KH was sufficiently concerned about him that he rang every week to check on his health.  He has given a detailed account of his conversations with E during these calls in written notes and stood by this account in oral evidence.  In cross-examination, he denied that he had been trying to give evidence against E to impress his employers.  In his evidence, E suggested to him that it was he who had raised the possibility that M might have cancer because he, KH, had been tested for a bowel problem.  KH said that no such conversation had ever taken place.  He reiterated that it was E who told him that the dentist had found a tumour.  He also stood by his note which recorded that E had asked him to arrange an autograph book for M from everyone at X College and Z House to sign and that she had said "so, if he doesn't pull through, it's something he can take to the grave."</span>

AA, the owner of the agency that runs the home, recorded in his statement that, whilst A had remained focused on spending time with his son, E had become increasingly demanding and challenging during the visits.  E and A secretly recorded some of their sessions at N House.  AA was alarmed that this had happened.  He was very concerned that staff had not been asked and that there was a risk that the confidentiality of other residents might have been compromised.  Matters came to a head when a visit was terminated early because of the way, it was alleged, that E had treated a junior member of staff - AR - who had been asked to supervise a contact session and to make notes about it.  E told the solicitor then acting for her, in an email that she has voluntarily disclosed to the court, that they could not have chosen someone more insulting and offensive if they had tried.

AR did not accept that this was so.  On one occasion, AR had been sitting in her car outside the home when E and A approached her unexpectedly.  They had arrived and were unable to get into the home.  In her oral evidence, AR said that she felt very intimidated on this occasion, in particular by E.  She described how they had banged on the window of her car.  She described in detail what E and A had asked and what she had done to try to get someone who was on duty to see them.

A GP local to N House, with whom he has been registered, has seen him during this hearing and reports that, although he has put on weight, he remains in the healthy weight range.  In cross-examination by E, AA denied that he was making the situation look rosy to justify the decision to remove M from home, or that he had tailored his evidence out of a desire to maintain his commercial relationship with the local authority.

It was for that reason that two senior members of staff had been assigned to this case after MS withdrew because of the complaint made by E and A.  The local authority had statutory duties in respect of M and it was in carrying out those duties that the social workers came into conflict with E.  JR said that it was her preferred approach to work with families to support young people for whom they have statutory responsibilities.

There had been a process undertaken before the contract had been approved by the local authority, as commissioning body, to check to see if there were any safeguarding issues.  The CQC reports about the unit are publicly available.  LG corroborated the evidence given by several others that E had used her deputyship to restrict the local authority access to information.  That was what she had been told by staff at Y House and was also her own experience.

She rejected the suggestion that the wording of the protocol was inappropriate and designed to cast E in a bad light.

It is the parents' case that the local authority has put pressure on the agencies which run the various homes where M has lived to provide evidence that fits the authority's agenda of removing E's deputyship and gaining control over M.  It is also their case that, far from E being controlling, it was in fact the managers of the homes, in particular PL at Y House and CH at Z House, who were seeking to control the lives of the residents.  </span>

Various reasons for the challenge to her deputyship were alleged in this statement, including a mutual interest and a tension between the local authority and service providers to conceal service failures; to prevent the involvement of the CQC; to misrepresent M as more able than he is; to enable the local authority to take over decision-making powers in respect of M; to prevent E and A escalating their complaint at the way in which their complaints had been investigated; retribution for the local authority's loss of credibility following the various earlier judicial review proceedings; and various financial reasons, including gaining access to M's benefits.</span>

At times I found her manner towards the witnesses intimidating, in particular to the junior members of staff, such as AR and KH, but also towards CH and, indeed, JR.  During her cross-examination of JR, in particular, E became increasingly strident and angry, accusing her, for example, of violating her deputyship behind her back, using M as a pawn to get at E over the last three years and of getting to know him better so that she could, in E's phrase - "kidnap him”.

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In contrast, E adopted a different tone while examining MS, the social worker allocated to the case in the first few months after M went to Z College.  MS was a notably assured witness who was not at all intimidated by being cross-examined by E.  She rejected the suggestion that she had been motivated against E and A because her husband had been passed over for promotion in favour of A.  She described how E had become angry with her.  E then became agitated, accusing her of telling lie after lie.  MS remained calm.  She denied that she had been pursuing any agenda or that she had retaliated against E after a complaint against her had been made.  In her final statement, E described MS as "a very nasty, incompetent and unprofessional person."  In her supplemental closing submissions filed this morning, E asserts that, "The social workers' obsession is to punish me" and adds that "they seem to take a sick pleasure doing so."  </span>

	      <marker name="tab"/>
	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In assessing the witness evidence, I take into account that not every relationship between E and a professional is fraught with difficulty identified by the local authority.  Although there has been little evidence about it, I am satisfied that the relationship between E and the staff at X College was mostly better than her relationship with the social workers and care staff.  In her final statement, E says that she and A both had "an exceptional working relationship with everyone throughout M's 13 years of specialist education."  Another example is their relationship with the family GP, Dr W.  Having heard Dr W in oral evidence, it is clear to me that his relationship with E was more subtle and nuanced.  He had no concerns from his own experience that M was coming to harm in her care and he appreciated the great challenge facing any parent looking after an autistic child.  He was critical of E's inaccurate use of medical terminology when describing M's symptoms, and he adopted what he described, as I have already said, as a defensive approach.  So far as I can see, whilst he tried on a number of occasions to dissuade E from taking a certain course, there was no occasion when he challenged her outright on any issue that mattered.  As a result, they maintained a relatively good relationship.  The local authority and the Official Solicitor submit that the reason for E and A's reluctance to agree to M having a local GP when he was living at Y House was because they found Dr W to be emollient and unchallenging.  E has also been on excellent terms with a number of alternative practitioners, but I am satisfied that is because they have not challenged her but rather tended to support her uncritically, reinforcing her beliefs and in some cases feeding her anxieties and prejudices.  </span>

	      <marker name="tab"/>
	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I also take into account, importantly, that all parents who, after caring for a disabled child for many years decide that he should move into residential care, must find the transition very difficult.  It is not surprising, having had no dealings with social services at any stage in their lives, that the involvement with the local authority in 2007 and onwards has required E and A to make adjustments.  Many people who are obliged to seek the assistance of social services find it irksome and bureaucratic.  At home the young person will have received devoted personal attention.  He will have been the main focus of his parents' lives.  They will have done everything within their power to give him whatever he needed in his best interests.  It is inevitable that, however well run a residential home, the move into residential care will involve making compromises.  The quality of care will not be quite the same, the attention will never be quite as personal and there will not be quite the sense of devotion that a parent can give.  Such a move will be very difficult, particularly in the case of a home catering for disabled adults, each of whom will have different and special needs.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I do not doubt the devotion which E and A feel for their son.  In some ways his life at home was far richer than could possibly be achieved in any care setting.  The range of activities arranged for him was plainly very stimulating and beneficial.  I am sure that in some respects the quality of care given to M at the three residential homes was inferior to that he received at home.  In such circumstances, it is only to be expected that parents may complain about some aspects of the care offered to their beloved son.  A degree of criticism would not be surprising and, indeed, would be expected, but the level of complaint and criticism, in particular of Y House, goes far beyond what might normally be expected and far beyond what is supported by most of the evidence, in particular the evidence of LG, a very experienced local authority senior social worker, whose evidence I accept.  I find that the level of criticism made by E and A is grossly disproportionate and unjustified.</span>

E and A denied that this was so, and when an inquiry was made of Dr Delamont, who did not give oral evidence, he replied that the request had come from JR.  JR subsequently apologised for misleading the court and the parents on this and explained in a further statement that she had forgotten about a conversation with Dr Delamont.  I accept her apology and her explanation.  I do not find that she was deliberately concealing information from the court.

Without exception, I accept the evidence of the social workers and care staff.  Where their evidence conflicts with that given by E, I prefer their evidence and reject that given by E, and indeed A.  I find that E has not told the truth about a large number of matters.  For example, I find that she has grossly exaggerated the deficiencies in the standards of care at Y House.  I am sure that they were not perfect, and no doubt some care staff were better than others, but the picture painted by E in her evidence is completely distorted and inaccurate.  I find that she repeatedly referred to her deputyship in dealing with social workers and staff, including when speaking to CH, in order to impose her will.  I find that staff and some residents at Y House, Z House and N House have found her difficult and intimidating.  </span>

I found KH to be a careful and truthful witness who was plainly motivated only by concern for M.  I accept his evidence as to the content of his phone calls with E in the months after M left Z House.  As those phone calls demonstrate, it is in fact E who has a tendency to elaborate and sensationalise situations.  After the conclusion of the evidence, E sought to introduce extracts from her diary which, although alluded to in the course of the hearing, had not been disclosed, which purported to support her account of her dealings with KH.  I do not accept that these extracts from the diary, if genuine, undermine the reliability of KH's evidence.

There are a number of email exchanges in the papers - see, for example, at N600 to 618 - in which her email address has been written in exactly the same way as in the emails to which LG referred and to which E has responded.  E's explanation about this was wholly implausible and I have found it to be untrue.  I found that she did receive these emails and chose not to respond.  I find that E has a fanatical desire to maintain control over her son's life and there is little she will not do to achieve it.  I find that E has restricted the access of professionals to M, for example, by seeking to prevent the staff at Y House from speaking to the local authority social workers, by scuppering the proposal that he should have an advocate and by refusing to allow him to be registered with a GP local to Y House.  E’s practice is to look for professionals and others who are biddable and compliant and then use them for her own ends.  She bombards professionals with written instructions and emails in order to get her own way.  If challenged, she will threaten and intimidate and, if that does not work, she will launch a professional complaint.  </span>

Indeed, I find that this was the very reason why she sought to be appointed deputy in the first place - as her application asked to be appointed his "lifelong custodian" and specifically asked the court to decide that “lifelong advocacy is also included in this role unless otherwise delegated by me." She expressly said in the application that she wanted to be able to take decisions "without the influence of external pressures or distractions".  This is completely contrary to the underlying purpose of deputyship under the 2005 Act, as described in the Code of Practice and previously reported cases.  </span>

The social workers have not been vindictive, nor malicious, nor cruel, nor vengeful, nor callous.  They have tried to do their job, meeting the local authority's statutory responsibilities to M, in the most difficult circumstances, caused entirely by E's completely unreasonable behaviour.  In 35 years of family law and in the Court of Protection, dealing with many hundreds of families, I have rarely, if ever, come across someone who is so difficult to work with, who presents so many challenges to hard working professionals and who takes up so much of their valuable time and resources.  </span>

She advised that it is not a diagnosis of an illness from which people "suffer".  The term is, rather, used to describe highly abnormal behaviours in relation to health care professionals, demonstrated by a person who has responsibility for another person.  To date, such abnormal behaviours have been most commonly described in mothers who have care of dependent children, but they have also been seen in nurses and in those who have care of the elderly and other vulnerable adults.  In essence, the key feature of the disorder is that the person who has care giving responsibility elicits professional health care in one of the following abnormal ways.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Dr Adshead advised that abnormal behaviour of types (1) and (2) is probably common and may go undetected.  The commonest forms of abnormal behaviour are giving exaggerated or false accounts of symptoms.  There is, obviously, an overlap of those mothers who have unusual levels of health anxiety, who tend to misinterpret any symptoms as a sign of dangerous illness.  Abnormal behaviour of types (3) and (4) are probably less common and are detected by clinicians who are familiar with some of the recent presentations in the literature.  Detecting these behaviours is, however, often extremely difficult.  The commonest presentation is by a mother of a young child with limited verbal ability.  Perpetrators are not typical of criminal offenders in general or even other maltreating parents.  They often have features of good mental health and physical health and no previous contact with the criminal law.  Dr Adshead stresses that it is important to emphasize that perpetrators do not "have" factitious disorder; they are exhibiting behaviours which may or may not be associated with a psychiatric diagnosis.  In one study half the mothers were recognised as showing abnormal illness behaviour on their own account and slightly over half were diagnosed with having a borderline personality disorder.  However, a substantial sub-group had no underlying psychiatric diagnosis and it is important to emphasize that there is no direct connection between any psychiatric diagnosis and this behaviour.  There is little published evidence available on the treatment of perpetrators.  They tend to deny any such behaviour and disclosure and acceptance usually takes place over time in the context of support and therapy.  If there is an identifiable mental disorder, then treatment of this probably increases the chance of an ongoing relationship with the child.  However, it has been described by Dr David Jones, the well known child psychiatrist, that abnormal illness behaviour by proxy is a bad prognostic sign in terms of family reunification.  </span>

Both Dr. Beck and Dr. Adshead observed that the degree of contradiction between E’s claims and the medical records record indicates a pattern of abnormal illness behaviour which seems to have escalated in the last few years.  The nature of the diagnoses put forward are couched in increasingly dramatic narrative terms but are not supported with corroborative medical evidence. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Dr Beck believes that the underlying driver for the mother's factitious disorder is that she is suffering from narcissistic personality disorder.  Dr Adshead agrees with Dr Beck that there are significant features of personality disorder in E's presentation, mainly narcissistic and histrionic features, and, in addition, Dr Adshead suspects that she may have some feature of an emotionally unstable personality disorder.  As a psychiatrist, Dr Adshead reported that she had seen no evidence that E suffers from a severe mental illness.  Dr Beck and Dr Adshead both thought that M's health care and his identity as an illness sufferer is a key part of his mother's relationship with him and that M's health status clearly dominates that relationship.  Dr Beck expressed the view that the mother's desire to find other people to blame appeared to serve functions for her.  First, it distracts from her own shame (self-imposed) and, secondly, it draws attention to her and her own needs.  Dr Beck concluded her first report by observing that, whilst she did not doubt that E loves her son, she does not believe that she is capable of putting his needs above her own.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Dr Adshead advised that, if the facts are proven that support the accounts of factitious disorder imposed on another, together with a diagnosis of personality disorder, this provokes questions of further future risk and how the relationship between carer and a dependent other should be managed in the future.  In her experience, the risk of harm to the dependent other is real, especially if the carer has no insight, although the nature of the harm may not necessarily be severe or dangerous.  Having seen there is a real risk, it should be fairly clear that the risk can be managed if E is prevented from being the person responsible for M's care.  Once a carer is removed from the role of a carer, there is usually no danger in the carer and the dependent other spending time together.  Dr Adshead advises, however, that in such circumstances there must be a proper health care plan put in place, overseen by a senior health care professional.  It is Dr Beck's recommendation that all of M's health needs hereafter should be overseen by the local authority.  Dr Beck agreed that there would be the real risk of an emotional mental and physical nature were M to return to live with E.  She also believed that M's access to opportunities to make choices and grow as an individual would be curtailed.</span>

I have no reason to believe that there is any basis for this assertion, but it certainly does not apply in this case.

I must have regard to M's wishes and feelings, to his beliefs, to the beliefs and values that would be likely to influence his decision.  In view of his limited capacity as analyzed above, I accept Mr McKinstrie's opinion that it would be unwise to form any opinion as to his wishes based on a single remark or when he has been encouraged to express particular views.  What is known is that he has not expressed a consistent wish as to where he wishes to live in the future.  I accept that family life is important to him, as is the aim of helping him to achieve his maximum potential.  The court must also have regard to the views of his family.  E and A wish their family, culture and values to be respected and for M's right to a family life to be upheld.  They ask that as soon as possible M be returned to the family home.  </span>

	      <marker name="tab"/>
	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Mr McKinstrie identifies several advantages of a return home.  First, M clearly has a longstanding affectionate relationship with his parents and sister and they continue to be important people in his life.  Furthermore, each is committed to M and in supporting him in what they consider to be his best interests.  The family home is a known environment for M and he has established routines that are familiar to him.  Furthermore, if he went home he would be able to access activities in the community that he has previously attended and enjoyed.  As Mr McKinstrie recognises, however, these advantages are manifestly outweighed in this case by the disadvantages which flow from my findings.  It is inevitable that, were M to return home, he will be subjected to the same regime as before in which his mother sought to reimpose control over all aspects of his life.  Furthermore, it is likely that she would continue to misrepresent his state of health and expose him to unnecessary examinations and treatments.  It is inconceivable that M could return home unless E demonstrates a fundamental change of attitude.  </span>

As Mr Bagchi observed in closing submissions, A has become so enmeshed in E's view of the past that he has been unable to protect M from his mother in the past and his lack of insights into her difficulties and the risks she may present offers little confidence that he would be able to do so in the future.  As for S, it is notable that she has not played any active part in these proceedings until late in the day.  I am unclear about S's role and position in this family in recent years.

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">As to the alternatives, Mr McKinstrie reaches the clear view that a move to W House is the best option for M.  It is a large, detached house with four floors each of which has their own separate living space.  There is also a shared communal lounge for the whole house on the second floor.  There is capacity for up to 12 residents. The intention is for each floor to have people with similar needs to each other.  People with the most complex needs are to be on the first floor, whereas the two bed-sits on the top floor will be available for people with more ability.  It is proposed that, were he to move to W House, M would occupy one of those two bed-sits.  Within each bed-sit there is a kitchen range, a sofa and a single bathroom to be shared between the two bed-sits.  W House is intended to support young people at a transitional stage of their lives.  A quarter of the staff are already in post and the rest are being recruited.  The plan is to build a permanent staff team so that the property does not have to depend on temporary or agency staff.  It is not proposed that W House should be a permanent home.  It has been set up with the intention of assessing and assisting young people to maximise their potential to live as independently as possible and then support them to move to live in supported housing or similar in the community.  </span>

	      <marker name="tab"/>
	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Mr McKinstrie does not consider that there are benefits for M continuing to live at N House for any longer than the short-term.  W House is managed by the same provider as N House and so this would provide some continuity in the approach, care and support.  The current staff at W House have spent time at N House and have therefore become familiar with M.  W House is more spacious than N House and able to offer M a greater variety of living areas.  M spent time at the property and staff at W House and family members have begun the process of building relationships focused on M.  Finally, W House is relatively close to the family home and would provide M with the opportunity to renew some of his local activities and contacts, as well as making contact with his family easier.  </span>

	      <marker name="tab"/>
	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">There are some disadvantages to W House perceived by Mr McKinstrie. It is a larger property, so there would be times when the environment is busy and noisy - a disadvantage to M given his acute perceptual awareness.  In addition, W House is a new, untried residential unit and the staff are new and still being recruited.  Furthermore, it is not known who the other residents will be and, in particular, there is no other person yet nominated for the second bed-sit on the floor where M will live.  The size of the staff group and the number of residents may mean that he is not always supported in a person-centred way as would be desirable.  Overall, however, Mr McKinstrie indicated that he thought the benefits of a placement at W House outweighed the risks.  The property is intended to support people of his age and ability, the stated ethos is to encourage young people to move on and to be able to live more independently, consistent with the long-term plan for M.  The bed-sit property seems particularly ideal for that purpose.  It would be a long-term planned placement for M and potentially allow for stability to enable him to move in a further planned way into supported living accommodation within two years.  Living at the property would provide him with the option of attending day services that he has attended in the past and revisit past friendships.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In his oral evidence, however, Mr McKinstrie added that M should not move to W House until certain things had been established.  First, it was important that a significant number of other residents move into W House first and that a full complement of staff be recruited and trained, routines established and teething problems overcome.  In addition, there should be a rigorous care plan approved by the court.  None of these steps have yet been achieved so, relying on Mr McKinstrie's oral evidence, the Official Solicitor suggests that it is premature for the court to sanction a move to W House.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In the course of the hearing the local authority, which had initially been very supportive of a move for M to W House, became increasingly concerned about the relationship between E and the manager of the home.

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I have decided that it is too soon for the court to reach a conclusion whether it is in M's interests to move to W House.  The next move will undoubtedly be of crucial importance.  If it is, indeed, the aim that he should move into a form of supported living - and happily this is one issue on which all parties seem to agree - it is vital that his next residence should be able to equip and prepare him for that move.  W House may be the best resource to achieve that and it has the added advantage that it is close to his home so that, if he moves there, contact arrangements will be easier and he will be able to access some of the activities he enjoyed when living at home.  But I accept the views of Mr McKinstrie, the Official Solicitor and the local authority that, for different reasons, now is not the right time for such a move.  </span>

Having considered all the evidence, including that of Mr McKinstrie, it seems that it is better for him in the short-term to remain there.  Although it is not an ideal place for him, I do not accept that he is suffering harm there and I agree with Mr McKinstrie that a precipitous move to W House will be counterproductive.  This placement is intended only as a short-term option while decisions are taken as to where M should live in the medium-term pending a long-term move into supported living, as supported by all parties, it seems.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">So far as contact is concerned, I note that, following the difficulties that arose at N House, arrangements were varied so that contact now takes place once a week for four hours at W House and a further session for two hours within the community near to N House at weekends.  Mr McKinstrie noted, and I agree, that it is clear that, since contact moved away from N House, it has been a less intense and more constructive experience for all concerned.  There continue to be tensions, but they are at a lower level and supervisors have been able to manage things differently by having an external focus to the contact.  I agree with Mr McKinstrie that it would be in M's best interests for contact to continue to take place in the community.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">As for the future, Mr McKinstrie stresses that E, A and S continue to be significant people for M and it is important and in his best interests to be supported to maintain these relationships.  He warned, however, that contact will only continue to be in M's best interests if it is not secondary to or subverted by tensions between E and others.  Mr McKinstrie advises that contact should be face to face rather than indirect and there should be a clear understanding between all parties that contact sessions are to allow M and family members to spend time together, that there should not be any discussion during contact of how M is cared for or supported or his health or other issues concerning his future plans.  Furthermore, Mr McKinstrie advised that contact should continue to be supervised directly to mitigate any potential risk to him from the arrangements and ensure that the conditions attached to contact visits are followed.  Supervision should only be relaxed as a result of a review of arrangements and when there is confidence that all parties are able to maintain the conditions attached to contact.  Mr McKinstrie does not at this stage consider that contact should take place at the family home.  </span>

	      <marker name="tab"/>
	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">On the issue of supervision, Dr Beck expressed a different view.  She advised that, if no observer was present at contact and E were allowed contact only on the basis that she was fully compliant with a set of guidelines, Dr Beck thought that E would be much less able to exercise control or protection.  She would therefore be interested to see how short periods of unsupervised contact between M and his family worked.  She thought that unsupervised contact in a fixed place was less likely to be antagonistic to E.  I understand Dr Beck's point but on the issue of supervision I am firmly of the view that Mr McKinstrie is right and that all contact should for the time being remain supervised.  Until the next hearing M should continue to have supervised contact with his parents twice a week as he has done in the course of this hearing.  I also agree with Mr McKinstrie that the local authority should carry out a risk assessment of all contact arrangements.  There should be a contact agreement signed by all parties and a clear process for reporting and monitoring the work of the arrangements.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> I turn to the question of deputyship.  It is plain from my findings that E has grossly abused her position as deputy, and there is no question of her being reinstated.  She is the last person who should be entrusted with that responsibility, and her application to be restored as deputy is refused.  The question arises whether there is a need for a deputy to be appointed at all, either for M's personal welfare care or for his property affairs.  Both the local authority and the Official Solicitor question the need for any deputy having regard to the legal framework in the Mental Capacity Act and the guidance in the Code of Practice and previous reported cases.  </span>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in">
	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In view of the very great difficulties that have arisen between the parents and various professionals in this case, I foresee that similar difficulties will arise in future, so that the normal process of decision-making through collaborative working together is unlikely to occur.  Paragraph 8.39 of the Code of Practice makes it clear that the appointment of a deputy may be required, inter alia, where there is a history of serious family disputes that could have a detrimental effect on the person's future care unless a deputy is appointed to make necessary decisions, or where the person who lacks capacity is felt to be at risk of serious harm if left in the care of family members.  Mr McKinstrie advises that the relations between E and social care and other professionals are likely to remain difficult due to the fundamental disagreements between them as to what constitutes M's best interests in virtually every aspect of his life.  I agree.  I doubt whether E is going to change her attitude as a result of this judgment.  Indeed, in so far as her attitude is determined by her personality disorders, she may be incapable of changing without long-term therapy.  It is plainly impossible for the Court of Protection to take these decisions.  It seems to me that it is, therefore, highly likely that a deputy will have to be appointed for M's personal welfare.  I shall not make a final decision on this issue at this stage, however, and, therefore, adjourn the question whether a deputy should be appointed to the next hearing.  I ask the parties to reflect on this matter in the light of my findings and the rest of this judgment and at the next hearing make further representations as to whether there should be a deputy and, if so, the identity of that person and the terms of appointment.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Mr McKinstrie made some sensible suggestions about the practical arrangements for future decision-making in this case.  It is important to remove as far as possible the opportunity for misrepresentation by any party.  To assist in achieving this, all communications should be formalised and recorded.  E and A should be a party to relevant information concerning M and should receive any formal communications that concern him.  They should also be included as a matter of course in any formal assessments or reviews of his health and social care needs and in planning for his future, with their views taken into account as part of those processes.  </span>

The issue does not arise for consideration at this stage as M will remain at N House for the time being and should, therefore, remain registered with his current GP.  The question of who should be his GP in the event that he returns to a placement nearer to the family home can be decided at a later hearing.  </span>

I shall give directions as appropriate for a supplemental report on that issue to be prepared for the next hearing.  At this stage I merely give these directions.  First, as just stated, I direct that M should continue to be treated by the GP local to N House as necessary.  Secondly, I conclude that he should receive a tetanus booster injection if in the opinion of the GP such an injection is in his best interests.  His parents are opposed to all vaccinations, but their opposition stems from their erroneous view that his autism is attributable to the MMR and that he is the victim of what E calls "vaccine assault".  There is no objective reason why M should not have an updating tetanus inoculation and, if he is going to take part in outdoor activities such as farm visits, there would seem to be every reason why he should have it.  If his GP recommends that he has the booster injection, then this court will give its approval.  Thirdly, I direct that his diet shall be in accordance with the practice at N House and any recommendations by his GP.  I am sure that the staff at N House will allow M an element of choice as to what he eats - that being an issue on which, as Dr Khouja and Dr Carpenter have found, he has limited capacity.  I would be grateful if counsel would draw up an order reflecting these directions and submit it to the Clerk of the Rules by 4 p.m. on Thursday 14</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Secondly, E and A seek the lifting of what they call the "gagging clause", namely, the order made at the hearing on 11th March 2014 and subsequently renewed, that they should not publish or disclose any information relating to the proceedings to any person, including any media organisation, save for their legal representatives.  For the time being that order will remain in force, but I will in due course hear submissions that any party wishes to make as to the lifting of that provision and as to the lifting as to the confidentiality which attaches to all Court of Protection proceedings unless otherwise ordered, and also as to the imposition of any further injunctions.  I remind all parties that the proceedings in the Court of Protection are held in private and information may not be disclosed without the court's permission.  I also indicate that I propose that a transcript of this judgment be published in accordance with the President's recent guidance, suitably anonymised to protect M's privacy.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Thirdly, E and A have requested that the court takes steps to recommend an independent inquiry into the use in this country of the Urabe strain of the MMR vaccine.  I suspect that part of their aim in this litigation has been to bring about such an inquiry.  I do not propose to make any such recommendation, not least because, as I have found, M's case has nothing to do with the MMR vaccine, save in the false accounts given by E.  Suffice it to say that nothing has emerged in the course of this case to undermine the prevailing view quoted above that the overall evidence clearly indicates no association between the MMR vaccine and autism.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">This court acknowledges the enormous demands placed on anyone who has to care for a disabled child.  Even though such carers are motivated by love - and I accept that both E and A love M and are deeply devoted to him - the burdens and strains on them are very great.  Every reasonable allowance must be made for the fact that they love their vulnerable son and want the absolute best for him.  Every reasonable allowance must be made for the impact of these burdens and strains when assessing allegations about the parents' behaviour.  However, having made every reasonable allowance for those factors, I find the behaviour exhibited on many occasions, by E in particular, was wholly unreasonable.  I agree with the insightful observation of the independent investigator appointed to consider the parents' complaints in 2010 quoted above.  E and A do feel that their mission has meant having to fight every inch of the way, against health and legal services and, more recently, social care services.  This has influenced the extent to which they are able to work in partnership with statutory agencies.  As they have such clear ideas about all aspects of M's life and believe the conclusions they have reached about him are correct, it is understandable that they have had difficulty in accepting the views of others where they differ from their own.  However, their attitude and approach has far exceeded anything that could be considered as reasonable.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">E’s friends admire her determination to stop at nothing to get M the care, support and long-term achievement he deserves.  Unfortunately, I find that this determination has led her to behave in a devious and destructive way, relentlessly criticising, occasionally bullying, repeatedly complaining about those who do not follow her bidding.  Throughout this hearing she has repeatedly accused the local authority of pursuing its own agenda.  I find that it is she who has an unshakeable agenda to follow her own course in pursuit of her own beliefs about M's condition and how it should be treated.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">E's allegations of multiple conspiracies are a fantasy.  It is nonsense to suggest that there has been a conspiracy by large numbers of the medical profession to conceal the truth about the MMR vaccine.  It is ridiculous to suggest that the local authority has pursued a vendetta against E and set out to remove M from his family for financial reasons and that the staff at the various residential homes have fallen into line and in some cases perjured themselves under financial pressure from the local authority.  It is delusional to suggest that the Official Solicitor has been motivated in this case by an agenda designed to prevent a revival of the claims arising out of the MMR and to that end suborned experts.  The tone of these outlandish claims by E has become increasingly more strident as the case progressed, culminating in the documents filed after the conclusion of the hearing in which she expresses outrage at the conduct of the local authority and the Official Solicitor at the hearing on 6th March, in terms that are barely coherent.  In their final submissions, E and A have made a number of further attacks on the integrity of the Official Solicitor, all of which I reject.  It is unnecessary to go into any further detail.

	      <marker name="tab"/>
	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The critical facts established in this case can be summarised as follows.  M has autistic spectrum disorder.  There is no evidence that his autism was caused by the MMR vaccination.  His parents' account of an adverse reaction to that vaccination is fabricated.  The mother has also given many other false accounts about M's health.  He has never had meningitis, autistic enterocolitis, leaky gut syndrome, sensitivity to gluten or casein, disorder of the blood brain barrier, heavy metal poisoning, autonomic dysautonomia (which, in any event, is not recognised in any classification of medical conditions), rheumatoid arthritis or Lyme disease.  As a result of E maintaining that he had these and other conditions, she has subjected M to numerous unnecessary tests and interventions.  He did have a dental abscess for which E failed to obtain proper treatment and caused him 14 months of unnecessary pain and suffering.  E has also insisted that M be subjected to a wholly unnecessary diet and regime of supplements.  Through her abuse of her responsibility entrusted to her as M's deputy, she has controlled all aspects of his life, restricted access to him by a number of professionals and proved herself incapable of working with the local authority social workers and many members of the care staff at the various residential homes where M has lived.  This behaviour amounts to factitious disorder imposed on another.  In addition, E has a combination of personality disorders - a narcissistic personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder and elements of an emotional unstable personality disorder.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Despite her serious conclusions about E's personality, it is Dr Beck's view that these parents have a lot to contribute to their son if they are capable of offering the care and support he needs under the guidance of an overarching programme of care coordinated by the local authority.  I agree that they would have an enormous amount to offer their son if they could work in collaboration with the local authority social workers and other professionals in M's best interests.  I have not given up hope that this may be achieved.  Such an outcome would be manifestly to M's advantage.  It will not be achieved, however, unless E and A – in particular, E – can demonstrate a fundamental change of attitude.  If this does not happen, this court will have to take permanent steps to restrict their involvement in his life.</span>
