	      <span style="font-size:10pt">Because of the extreme vulnerability of people like P, MIG and MEG, I believe that we should err on the side of caution in deciding what constitutes a deprivation of liberty in their case.  They need a periodic independent check on whether the arrangements made for are in their best interests.  Such checks need not be as elaborate as those currently provided for by the Court of Protection or in the Deprivation of Liberty safeguards (which could in due course be simplified and extended outside hospitals and care homes). Nor should we regard the need for such checks as in any way stigmatising of them or their carers.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Experience gained from sitting in the Court of Protection and on appeals in Mental Health Act cases shows that whatever may be said to them many carers understandably do regard such checks as upsetting.  For example, when the time comes at which a parent or parents can no longer bear the burden of caring for an adult child, who needs constant care and supervision, those parents can feel guilty. In many such cases, the suggested checks would not provide, or would not be seen to provide, the recognition of the care and quality of decision making of such carers.   And so they would be unlikely to assist them in accepting that they have nothing to be guilty about and that what they are doing is firstly in the best interests of the P they love and have cared for, and secondly is a continuation of selfless care directed to promoting the best interests of someone they love.  </p>

The assessment of the Effects will involve an assessment of an aspect of that essence, namely a speedy, practical and effective process as opposed to one that is theoretical or illusory.  A flexible and proportionate approach is appropriate to the consideration of the potentially competing factors involved in that balancing exercise and so of the Safeguards.  In other words, Safeguards that are likely to work in practice are to be preferred to those that are not.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The number of non-contentious property and affairs applications has increased year on year.  Presently they are running at around 20,000 applications a year.  The demographic of the population indicates that the number of those applications will continue to increase.  The cost of such applications is likely to fall on P’s assets (or his or her family).  These applications are made of necessity because P cannot make the relevant decisions and give the necessary instructions about his or her property and affairs, and history shows that the vast majority of them are made by honest and caring family members or carers.  If there was to be an independent check of every application by making P a party and appointing an appropriate litigation friend, or by some other method, in that vast majority of cases the cost and intrusion that would be so caused would be both unnecessary and very understandably resented.  Further, its financial cost would mean that P’s resources, or resources that might otherwise be used to support P, would be used on an unnecessary process.  This lies at the heart of the Procedural Balance that the COP Rules strike by, for example, the Rules that P need not be a party, that P is bound whether or not he is a party and on the notification of P.</p>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">It is easy to fall into the trap of thinking that, because, typically, both the court and some other public authority are concerned with the welfare or well-being of a child or incapacitated adult, they are viewing the matter from the same perspective and applying the same principles. Neither is so. The perspective of the court – the Court of Protection or the family court – is a narrow focus on the welfare of the individual child or adult. The perspective of the public authority is necessarily different and much wider. Often, the public authority, as with the authorities involved in the present case, will have to have regard to the interests of a very wide group of service users who are, in the nature of things, competing with each other for the allocation of often scarce resources. Sometimes, as in the case of the Secretary of State in an immigration case, the public authority has to balance an individual's private interest against a wider public interest, in the immigration context the public interest in a proper system of immigration control. Flowing from this, the principles that have to be applied by the court and the public authority will almost inevitably differ.</span>

But the reality, accepted by the Official Solicitor during the hearing (and not contested by the Secretary of State), is that absent the provision of extra publicly funded resources to enable the Official Solicitor, or someone else, to act as an independent litigation friend for P if, in accordance with the obiter conclusion of the Court of Appeal, P has to be a party to all cases of this type the process will soon become one that is not fit for purpose, because its Effects (namely the delays and costs involved) will mean that is not speedy, practical and effective. </p>

He advanced arguments that any such order could and would be validated (see by analogy <span style="font-style:italic">Dunhill v Burgin (Nos 1 and 2) </span>[2014] 1 WLR 933).<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>But, on the assumption that such orders would be valid or would be validated, this is not an effective solution because the reviews of such interim orders would have to take place earlier than those of a final order and so this proposed course would create an additional category of case in an ever increasing backlog and possibly the need for further applications to validate earlier orders. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the context of that note that conclusion is open because it is not focusing on the position of a solicitor instructed by a litigation friend and so the course urged by the Official Solicitor and the Law Society.  Legal help as “controlled work” can be applied for by someone who is proposing to become a litigation friend.  It is subject to the merits and means criteria and covers advice and assistance that is likely to give sufficient benefit to justify its provision.  But it does not cover (i) issuing or conducting court proceedings, (ii) instructing an advocate in proceedings, (iii) preparing to provide advocacy in proceedings, or (iv) advocacy in proceedings.  On the information and argument before me, I am of the view that these exclusions mean that, save in respect of very limited introductory matters, whose only benefit is likely to be an identification of the relevant principles and thus of the information that needs to be gathered and assessed for the purposes of the proceedings, the advice and assistance that P and his litigation friend or proposed litigation friend would want and benefit from would not be covered by legal help.  This is because it would relate to one or more of the areas directed to the “conduct of proceedings” that are excluded from legal help.  For example, a visit to P and the placement, the preparation and presentation of a report of that, advice on the care package and possible changes to it and advice on the application of the determinative test are all directed to conducting the proceedings and advocacy in the proceedings, even if they lead to an order that is agreed and presented to the court for approval. To my mind, this means that legal help would not provide an effective basis for the funding of P as a party acting through a litigation friend (or to a P whether or not a party) for the purposes envisaged by the Court of Appeal, the Official Solicitor or the Law Society, namely the safeguards in “the conduct of the proceedings” provided by a litigation friend. In any event, if that is wrong, the financial limits for legal help and problems relating to the cap on new matter starts would mean that legal help would not effectively fund those safeguards.  </p>

A similar response was made by the Secretary of State to paragraph 249 of the House of Lords Select Committee Report on the MCA by which, in March 2015, the committee recommended an urgent remedy to the inconsistent provision of non-means tested legal aid in cases concerning deprivation of liberty.  No changes to implement such a remedy were identified in evidence and the stance of the Secretary of State in these proceedings is an indication that none are imminent or likely to effect it.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In his letter to the court (and so before he put in place the procedure that has enabled him to accept appointment in the majority of the ten test cases before me) the Official Solicitor points out that the Convention guarantees rights of access to the court that are practical and effective not theoretical and illusory.  I agree.  He then asserts that unless it is read down Rule 3A(4), which provides that P does not become a party until a litigation friend is appointed, makes the rights of P, if he must be a party, theoretical and illusory.  I do not follow this.  Firstly, it is not an assertion based on a lack of P’s right to be a party under the relevant procedural rules.  Rather, it is based on a delay after an order joining P has been made and so it is the practical non-availability of the litigation friend and the problems relating to the effectiveness of interim orders that have this result.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The starting point that P is not automatically a party and the impact of Rule 3A(4) apply far more widely than in applications for welfare orders made to authorise a  deprivation of liberty, and Rule 3A(4) enables the court to act quickly in a range of contentious or potentially contentious cases where this is necessary and, if as the Court of Appeal concluded, P must always be a party in cases seeking a welfare order to authorise a deprivation of liberty this can be achieved by exercising Rule 3A.  So, although I agree that if P must be made a party in all such applications the reality is that the right of access to a court that this would give to P will in many cases soon not be fit for purpose.  The reasons for this relate to the practical application of that joinder as of right (or effectively as of right) and not the starting point that P is not automatically a party and Rule 3A(4).</p>

The removal of the specific requirement for the litigation friend to act by a solicitor appears to imply that there is nothing to prevent the litigation friend carrying out procedural steps on behalf of the patient. Although there is no definition of the expression “conducting legal proceedings” in Part 21 (or in the Civil Procedure Act 1997, under which the new rules were made) it is difficult to see how it can differ significantly in scope from the expression “conducting litigation” as defined in the 1990 Act.

The role of a litigation friend (which has a significant overlap with that of a legal representative appointed by a First-tier Tribunal (HESC) in a case under the Mental Health Act 1983 when the patient lacks capacity to litigate which I  discussed and described in <span style="font-style:italic">YA v Central and NW London NHS Trust and Others </span>[2015] UKUT 0037 (AAC)  in particular at paragraphs 92 to 103) shows that a litigation friend can be faced with difficult decisions in respect of both the advocacy role (directly or by giving instructions) and the implementation role and thus that both roles are integral to his task.  Indeed, by applying the best interests test the litigation friend may have to control all aspects of the proceedings and, in doing so, may have to take a position that is contrary to, or does not fully accord with, the expressed wishes and feelings of a P.  </p>

I do not agree because any such grant, as with the appointment of the litigation friend, would be based on (a) a prediction of behaviour that would demonstrate the suitability for the role, and (b) the safeguard of the ability of the court to control and prevent the mischief referred to by the Official Solicitor.

In my view, the fact such persons have performed that role, and in doing so have formed firm views, as to where P’s best interests lie, and have voiced those views, does not mean that they cannot meet the criteria in Rule 140(1) or that they are disqualified from acting as P’s litigation friend.

But it cannot be that in every case a RPR should test the validity of a DOLS authorisation because then they would only be the precursor to proceedings in the Court of Protection.  Rather, the role of the RPR, like that of a litigation friend, involves deciding whether to issue a challenge and then advancing P’s best interests in any such challenge without advancing unarguable points (see by analogy the approach to be taken by a legal representative in a tribunal dealing with a Mental Health case which I discuss in <span style="font-style:italic">YA </span>(cited earlier) see in particular paragraphs (13) to (20) of the Overview and paragraphs 65 to 103 of the Decision).

The approach in such a case therefore does not mirror the determinative test applied by the Court of Protection.  Rather, that determinative test is one under which the best interests of P is determinative (or paramount), and is not one which poses the issue whether P’s liberty should be removed or P should be detained for a particular purposes (e.g. treatment).  Rather, it asks whether the care package is the least restrictive available option to promote P’s best interests and the deprivation of liberty is a consequence and not an aim of what is applied for or what is at stake.

Their parents who are now 70 and 69 have been actively, devotedly and constructively involved with this care throughout the lives of their two sons and until recently they have lived at home with their parents.  The care packages build on respite care that has been provided and will result in them living for the majority of the time in residential care with home visits rather than at home with respite care away from home.  The parents for convincing and very understandable reasons have concluded that because of their age and some health problems the time has come for their sons to make this move.  The very responsible and effective role of the parents in directly and indirectly promoting the best interests of their sons is well recognised and  the move is clearly the least restrictive available option that is highly likely to work having regard to the needs of their sons and their behaviour in respite care. </p>

His mother, who is a social worker and an approved mental health professional, has been actively and constructively involved in his care throughout his life.  She supports the care package for convincing reasons and has made a witness statement asking that she be considered as AJG’s litigation friend.

The first relates to the quality of the evidence on capacity and the second to points referred to above in the improvements suggested.  On the face of it, there is nothing to suggest that the experience and skills of the Official Solicitor or the solicitor instructed by him (both of which I acknowledge) were important factors.
