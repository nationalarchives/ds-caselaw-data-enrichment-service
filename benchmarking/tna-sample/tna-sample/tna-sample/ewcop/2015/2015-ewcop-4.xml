She also displays characteristics consistent with an attachment disorder, likely to have resulted from her experience of physical and possibly sexual abuse as a child or young person. As an adult, DD has had an extraordinary, tragic, and complex obstetric history; she has had six children who are now aged between 6 months and 12 years, all of whom are being raised by permanent substitute carers, five of them in adoptive homes.  DD has no continuing contact with any of her children.  DD <span style="color:#000000">has never demonstrated the desire or capacity to engage with the level of support which is likely to be required to assure a child’s safety in her care.</span></p>

Uterine scarring due to caesarean sections predisposes a woman to this condition. If DD were to suffer placenta accreta, it would inevitably lead to massive haemorrhage at the point of delivery of her infant.  Placenta praevia involves a low-lying placenta located in the lower segment of the uterine cavity. If DD were to suffer from this condition, as her cervix dilated in labour she would inevitably experience massive haemorrhage such that safe delivery of the baby could not be achieved and her own chances of survival would be compromised.</p>

Illustrative of professional clinical concern in this regard, which I unreservedly share, is the description of events in 2011 when BC failed to take any action when DD suffered her intra-cerebral embolism and began fitting in their home.  Only by good fortune did a social worker visit the couple and encounter this grave situation; emergency services were instantly called, and DD was admitted urgently to hospital, where she was placed in an induced coma to control her seizures. BC was unable to say how long DD had been fitting before the social worker had arrived. The baby (which was suffering foetal bradycardia, slowing of the heart and consequent distress, during DD’s fitting) was delivered by caesarean section. Following this birth DD suffered significant post-partum haemorrhage, and was hospitalised for nine days.</p>

I have been impressed by them all, and am conscious that this judgment will not fully reflect the diligence and thoroughness of the experts’ contributions.

The evidence appears to show that the contraceptive pill was first prescribed for DD when she was 12 years old. Her first Depo-Provera injection was in March 2000 but she was unwilling to use it again after 2 injections because of heavy bleeding, and in September 2000 she requested to go back on the oral contraceptive pill. There is a note of a discussion between DD and her GP in March 2002 at which DD requested contraception – the GP discussed a range of contraceptives including the pill, coil and implants, and DD agreed to an implant. The GP inserted the implant later that month although it was in place only briefly as, in fact at that time it transpired, DD was pregnant with Child 1; accordingly, the implant was removed. Following Child 1's birth, a further implant was inserted. In September 2003, the family planning clinic prescribed the oral contraceptive pill in addition to the existing implant. In December 2003, DD attended her GP requesting sterilisation (this was not the first time she had made this request). A specific referral for sterilisation was made in January 2005. When seen in hospital two months later, that request was refused as her motives were felt to be inconsistent and therefore unreliable. In October 2005, DD attended the family planning clinic and underwent the re-insertion of a contraceptive implant. This was removed in 2008, and at that time she indicated that she and her partner would use condoms. Later in 2008 she sought advice on becoming pregnant</span>.”</p>

Dr F formed the view that this was consistent with her rigidity of thinking: she tended to see things in black or white, rather than in the round, and once she had decided something or formed a particular view, it was very difficult for her to change that view or to see matters from an alternative perspective.   By the time of a further meeting on the 18 July 2014, she had been told of Mr. A’s finding (from the caesarean procedure) of the finding of the ‘tissue-thin’ wall of her uterus. T<span style="color:#000000">he fact that Mr. A had been able to see her uterine wall and describe it to her helped DD to accept that this was a real and identifiable risk.</span> Ultimately, DD required considerable prompting to recognise the implications of this condition, i.e. that she could bleed to death if a rupture occurred.

Placental localisation scanning (as occurred during the pregnancy with Child 6) would determine which of these scenarios DD faces. Without such scanning (which was only achieved in the last pregnancy following court intervention and forced entry to her home, and which would be the position in a concealed pregnancy), all that can be said is that she would face the epidemiological risk.</p>

I am not comfortable with this approach, which was in any event not supported by the Applicants (specifically Mr. A).  It matters not.  The simple fact, it seems to me, is that if DD should successfully conceal her pregnancy, or (even assuming the pregnancy went to full-term) attempt another home delivery, the clinical risk of a fatal outcome from either of these medical conditions, measured at “<span style="font-style:italic">at least</span>” 30% or 50%, is dangerously and unacceptably high.</p>

Dr Rowlands, sexual and reproductive health specialist, in his report, dated 16 January 2015, explains the duration of fertility for the average woman, and advises that the mean age of menopause to be 51 (although <span style="color:#000000">pregnancy beyond the age of 50 is rare).  </span>It appears therefore that DD is at risk (albeit a diminishing one) of future pregnancy for around 15 more years.</p>

It is no longer feasible, in my judgment, to continue to provide DD with a contraceptive Depo-Provera injection every three months. This would involve a long-term expectation on DD to comply with the regime, against a background of low level compliance in the recent short term.  Were DD to withdraw her co-operation, the reactivation of court process, and short-term emergency measures (including possible forcible entry into her home and restraint) to secure contraception while further court decisions are taken would be a disproportionate (and as it is, an avoidable) interference in DD’s private life.

She considers that these feelings will be stronger than with sterilisation because of the sexual symbolism of the act of inserting the intra-uterine device, but also more simply because the device can be removed by those who control her, but they refuse to do so.</p>

After attempts to encourage co-operation, the Applicants entered by force on 13 August 2014; DD was so distressed by the events that it was not possible to engage her in the relevant education and, although she conveyed to a clinic for the purposes of meeting with the staff, she was quickly returned home.  I referred to this incident at [2014] EWCOP 44 at [8] by highlighting my anxiety about the effect on DD of repeated forced entries to DD’s home:</p>
