But respect for our human condition, regard for the realities of our society and the common sense to which Lord Oliver of Aylmerton referred in In re KD …, surely indicate that the starting point should be the normal assumption that mentally incapacitated adults will be better off if they live with a family rather than in an institution – however benign and enlightened the institution may be, and however well integrated into the community – and that mentally incapacitated adults who have been looked after within their family will be better off if they continue to be looked after within the family rather than by the State.</span>

We need to be careful not to embark upon 'social engineering'. And we should not lightly interfere with family life. If the State – typically, as here, in the guise of a local authority – is to say that it is the more appropriate person to look after a mentally incapacitated adult than her own partner or family, it assumes, as it seems to me, the burden – not the legal burden but the practical and evidential burden – of establishing that this is indeed so. And common sense surely indicates that the longer a vulnerable adult's partner, family or carer have looked after her without the State having perceived the need for its intervention, the more carefully must any proposals for intervention be scrutinised and the more cautious the court should be before accepting too readily the assertion that the State can do better than the partner, family or carer. </span>

Indeed that sets the requirement too low. If the State is to justify removing children from their parents or vulnerable adults from their relatives, partners, friends or carers it can only be on the basis that the State is going to provide a better quality of care than that which they have hitherto been receiving: see Re F, F v Lambeth London Borough Council [2002] 1 FLR 217 at para [43]. </span>

The jurisdiction is to be invoked if, but only if, there is a demonstrated need to protect a vulnerable adult. And the court must be careful to ensure that in rescuing a vulnerable adult from one type of abuse it does not expose her to the risk of treatment at the hands of the State which, however well intentioned, can itself end up being abusive of her dignity, her happiness and indeed of her human rights. That said, the law must always be astute to protect the weak and helpless, not least in circumstances where, as often happens in such cases, the very people they need to be protected from are their own relatives, partners or friends: NS v MI [2006] EWHC 1646 (Fam), [2007] 1 FLR 444, at para [8]. </span>

But the court must adopt a pragmatic, common sense and robust approach to the identification, evaluation and management of perceived risk.”</span>

The evidence that he lacks an understanding of his wife’s dietary needs was poor and, perhaps in recognition of this, as the hearing proceeded the local authority’s case focused increasingly on the quantity of food he serves her. In fact, I find that he provides her with an exceptionally good diet, in keeping with her long-standing wishes and reasonably tempered by dietary advice, and only rarely gives her too much of it. His wife simply has type 2 diabetes and must be careful about her diet. On one occasion at the care home the GP was asked for telephone advice about her high blood-sugar level. When the blood-sugar readings were produced at the court’s request there was no obvious pattern to them. Contrary to Ms CD’s initial contention, they were not noticeably or consistently higher or lower following time spent with her husband. Her blood-sugar levels have been well-maintained since June 2014.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:11pt">I find this to be the more likely explanation. Mrs C appeared to be happy and content at the matrimonial home during the visits undertaken with Mr McKinstrie and Ms Noble; she is more animated and verbally responsive when at home; she often expresses a wish to have telephone or face-to-face contact with her husband; she is generally responsive to Mr C and initiates affectionate contact towards him; she consistently stated to Ms Noble that she wished to live with her husband; and she consistently stated to her solicitor in January 2014 that she wished to live with her husband (she said ‘no’ twice when asked if she wanted to stay at S Care Home and on one occasion when asked where she would like to live responded ‘somewhere else’). Mr GH (an impressive witness) also told me that she is much more responsive at home than in the care home. He had three very good conversations with her during lucid moments between mid-November and mid-December 2014. He asked her if she was happy at S Care Home and she said, ‘Not really’ and indicated that she wanted to go home. He was told by S Care Home not to ‘badger her with such questions.’</span>

It was worth considering, he said, but whether it was ‘doable was the problem’. It would have to be properly risk-assessed by a multi-disciplinary team and demonstrated to be practicable or impracticable.

A combined care package consisting of paid carers and volunteers would be extremely complicated and compromised by difficulties of language and communication. No family members wrote to the court or provided witness statements stating that they are able and willing to do this or to do it as part of a sustainable rota. There is no evidence that they can afford to spend three months at a time in England or that Mr C can afford to house and feed them or to pay their fares. Indeed, he is quite heavily in debt.

Given the lack of local authority financial support relative to his wife’s assessed needs, I find that it is unlikely that he could sustain providing significant care, including night-time continence care, for very long without his own health and conduct being compromised.

If so it may be appropriate and in Mrs C’s best interests to settle them from the proceeds of sale of the matrimonial home. An independent deputy can assess this and advise the court.

Knowing that is really a starting point for any sustainable arrangement moving forward. One also needs to know how much benefit Mrs C will get from visits to a new home: it will not be the home to which she has long been attached but it will have many familiar things in it.

The arrangements outlined will protect and promote Mrs C’s health and well-being and hopefully also allow contact with her husband at home to increase in a sustainable way that brings her enjoyment and is in her best interests.</span>

I would ask all of the parties to work together over the coming 12 months to see what further progress can be made to improve Mrs C’s contact with her husband. If everyone commits themselves to that it will, I think, become clear what final arrangement is in Mrs C’s best interests.</span>
