	<p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0.00in">This application by Her Majesty’s Attorney General for permission to pursue an application for committal for contempt concerns an alleged breach of an embargo on publication of a judgment of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Friends of the Earth Ltd) v Heathrow Airport Ltd</span> [2020] UKSC 52; [2021] PTSR 190 by Mr Timothy </p>

      <p style="margin-left:-0.00in;margin-right:0.00in">Crosland, an unregistered barrister who represented the charity Plan B Earth in those proceedings. That appeal concerned the lawfulness of the Airports National Policy Statement, (“the ANPS”), and its accompanying environmental report. The ANPS was designated as national policy on 26 July 2018 by the Secretary of State for Transport. The ANPS is the national policy framework which governs the construction of a third runway at Heathrow Airport. Any future application for development consent to build this runway will be considered against the policy framework in the ANPS. The ANPS does not grant development consent in its own right. </p>

	<p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0.00in">The alleged breach of embargo was referred by Lord Reed, President of the Supreme Court, to the Attorney General and the Attorney General decided to apply for permission to pursue proceedings against the respondent, Mr Crosland, seeking his committal or such other penalty as the court considers appropriate for contempt of court. This application is being heard by a different panel of the Supreme Court from that which sat on the Heathrow Airport case. </p>

That judgment has been handed down by the Supreme Court and, as with all judgments in all courts in this country, members of the public are free to subject it to the closest scrutiny and to express their views on the decision. The present proceedings are about a distinct and very limited matter: the conduct of Mr Crosland in disclosing the result of the appeal in breach of the embargo before it was made public by the Supreme Court and whether that constitutes a contempt of court. </p>

The draft was marked ‘in confidence’. The rubric on the title page stated that those to whom the content of the draft are disclosed must take all reasonable steps to preserve their confidentiality and that any breach of these obligations may be a contempt of court.

The said statement included the words, ‘I have taken the decision to break the embargo on that decision as an act of civil disobedience.

The contents of this draft are confidential initially to the parties’ legal representatives and, when disclosed to the parties in the 24 hours prior to delivery, also to the parties themselves. Those to whom the contents are disclosed must take all reasonable steps to preserve their confidentiality.

      </blockContainer>
      <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:0.50in">“6.8.3 The judgment of the Court is made available to certain persons before judgment is given. When, for example, judgment is given on a Wednesday morning, it is made available to counsel from 10.30 am on the previous Thursday morning. In releasing the judgment, the Court gives permission for the contents to be disclosed to counsel, solicitors (including solicitors outside London who have appointed London agents) and in-house legal advisers in a client company, Government department or other body. The contents of the judgment and the result of the appeal may be disclosed to the client parties themselves 24 hours before the judgment is to be given unless the Court or the Registrar directs otherwise. A direction will be given where there is reason to suppose that disclosure to the parties would not be in the public interest. </p>
      <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:0.50in">6.8.4 It is the duty of counsel to check the judgment for typographical errors and minor inaccuracies. In the case of apparent error or ambiguity in the judgment, counsel are requested to inform the Judicial Support section as soon as possible. This should be done by email to Judicial Support no later than two working days before the date judgment is to be given. The purpose of disclosing the judgment is not to allow counsel to re-argue the case, and attention is drawn to the opinions of Lord Hoffmann and Lord Hope in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Edwards) v Environment Agency</span> [2008] UKHL 22; [2008] 1 WLR 1587. </p>
      <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:0.50in">6.8.5 Accredited members of the media may on occasion also be given a printed copy of the judgment in advance by the Court’s communications team. The contents of this document are subject to a strict embargo and are not for publication, broadcast or use on club tapes before judgment has been delivered. The documents are issued in advance solely at the Court’s discretion, and in order to inform later reporting, on the strict understanding that no approach is made to any person or organisation about their contents before judgment is given.” </p>

	<p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0.00in">There is no substantial disagreement between the parties as to the primary facts. Documents before this court show that, following circulation of the draft judgment, the respondent sent emails to the court in which he contended that there were inaccuracies in the draft judgment and sought permission to discuss them with external lawyers prior to hand down. In those emails, the respondent maintained that the Secretary of State for Transport had in June 2018 assessed the ANPS against the historic global temperature limit of 2 degrees Centigrade, a standard which by that date had been rejected by the UK Government and by the wider international community. The respondent said that the fact that this standard had been applied had only come to light through the disclosure process in the Heathrow litigation. </p>

At 11.22 on 15 December 2020, the respondent published his personal statement in which he disclosed the outcome of the appeal in an email sent to the Press Association and possibly to other media organisations. He issued a statement in similar terms on Plan B’s Twitter account at 12.41. He also emailed the Supreme Court judgments clerk in similar terms at 13.55. </p>

It issued a statement to the Press Association and from 11.50 the Supreme Court began notifying media organisations of the breach of embargo. However, by that time publication had been made by various organisations, including Reuters, City AM, The Independent, The Daily Telegraph and the Mail Online. Some of these withdraw their articles but The Independent and the Mail Online did not. The Independent article was removed after the judgment had been handed down. </p>

The respondent did not respond to the email and the tweet was not deleted. Plan B’s Twitter account had 3,585 followers. It was re-tweeted at least 406 times by other Twitter users, including Extinction Rebellion UK, which had 55,600 followers at that time.

We note that the respondent states that he in fact submitted the article under the title “Why I broke the court embargo on the Heathrow judgment” and that the title was changed by the editor at The Independent. We also note that the respondent appears to have made no objection at the time to the amended title under which it was published, that that title reflected what was said in the last paragraph of the article, and that in his blog post entitled “Barrister who breached Supreme Court embargo: I felt I had no choice” the respondent referred to “my contempt of court in breaking the embargo on the Heathrow judgment”. </p>

It stated in terms, “Tomorrow the Supreme Court will overturn the Court of Appeal’s judgment in Heathrow’s favour and rule that Mr Grayling acted lawfully”. Just over an hour later at 12.41 he posted a similar statement on Plan B’s Twitter account. The respondent has not denied that he made these publications. On the contrary, he has admitted them. </p>

	<p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, when the respondent made the disclosures, he was aware of the embargo. Once again, this was admitted by the respondent. The personal statement sent to the Press Association at 11.22 stated that he had taken the decision to break the embargo as an act of civil disobedience. The statement posted on Plan B’s Twitter account at 12.41 stated, “I am breaking the court embargo on Heathrow to protest against the injustice of the verdict, which is a betrayal of the younger generation and those on the frontline of the crisis in the UK and around the world.” </p>

	<p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0.00in">The respondent here points to the sentence in the rubric which states “A breach of any of these obligations may be treated as a contempt of court”. He suggests that there is uncertainty in this statement. There is no substance in this submission. First, the rubric made it abundantly clear that there was a prohibition on publication of the judgment or any part of it prior to hand down. What matters here is that, when he made the disclosure, the respondent was aware of the embargo. Secondly, the prohibition on publication was reinforced by the express warning in the email from the judgments clerk which enclosed the draft judgment. Thirdly, the respondent was in no doubt that his conduct would be likely to be treated as a contempt of court. In his personal statement he stated at the outset, “This will be treated as a contempt of court and I am ready to face the consequences”. We find that these acts of publication were deliberate and calculated breaches of the embargo. </p>

The request that he be permitted to discuss the draft judgment with external lawyers made by email at 11.15 on 11 December gave as the reason that “We need legal advice on what we can and cannot say <span style="text-decoration:underline">following the judgment</span>, depending on its final form” (emphasis added). </p>

	<p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0.00in">In the words of Lord Toulson in <span style="font-style:italic">Director of the Serious Fraud Office v</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">O’Brien</span> [2014] UKSC 23; [2014] AC 1246, para 39: “A criminal contempt is conduct which goes beyond mere non-compliance with a court order or undertaking and involves a serious interference with the administration of justice”. The present case is not a case involving a breach of an order by a party to litigation where the order has been made at the instance of an opposing party and its purpose is simply to protect the private rights of that other party. Rather the order was made in order to protect the administration of justice and its breach involves a general interference from which the administration of justice must be safeguarded; see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">Attorney General v Yaxley-Lennon</span> [2019] EWHC 1791 (QB); [2020] 3 All ER 477, para 54; <span style="font-style:italic">Attorney General v Dallas</span> [2012] EWHC 156 (Admin); [2012] 1 WLR 991; <span style="font-style:italic">Solicitor General v Cox (Contempt of Court: Illegal Photography)</span> [2016] EWHC 1241 (QB); [2016] 2 Cr App R 15, para 73. Furthermore, the requirement of confidentiality was imposed directly by the court on the respondent, who was a representative of a party to the litigation. The strictly confidential basis upon which draft judgments are provided to parties is well established, as are the reasons underpinning the duty of confidentiality in this context; see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">Director of Public Prosecutions v P</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">(No 2)</span> [2007] EWHC 1144 (Admin); [2008] 1 WLR 1024, paras 2 and 10 per Smith LJ; <span style="font-style:italic">R v Noshad Hussein</span> [2013] EWCA Crim 990, paras 1 to 2 per Treacy LJ. The potential damage to the administration of justice which breaches of this duty of confidentiality may cause has also been emphasised; see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">P (No 2)</span> at para 10 per Smith LJ. A critical point here is that the respondent has interfered with the court's control of its own proceedings. We accept the submission on behalf of the Attorney General that the publication of the outcome of the appeal in breach of the embargo was an interference with the proper administration of justice. </p>

	<num>24.</num>
	<p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0.00in">Moreover, we accept the submission on behalf the Attorney General that the threshold of seriousness is passed in this case. First, it is vital for the authority of the court and in the interests of legal certainty that its judgments should be delivered at a time of its choosing and in a definitive form. Published judgments must be accurate, complete and in final form. Leaks of draft judgments could undermine the authority of the court and its judgments. </p>

	<num>25.</num>
	<p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, the Attorney General has correctly referred to the powerful public interest in the court’s being able to circulate draft judgments confidentially among the parties prior to their being handed down in complex and important cases so that typographical mistakes and other errors can be addressed and a final definitive version of the judgment can be handed down, so that the parties can prepare submissions on consequential matters and so that the parties can prepare themselves for the consequences of the judgment becoming public. These are matters of importance to the administration of justice. If the confidentiality of the process is not respected, it will have to be abandoned and these benefits will be lost. In this regard we also note that in October 2020 the Attorney General had cause to issue a media advisory notice drawing attention to the importance of this confidentiality. In our view, this reflects the importance of the procedure and the need to protect it from abuse. </p>

In our view, that is sufficient for present purposes (see <span style="font-style:italic">Solicitor General v Cox</span> at paras 69 and 73) and it is not necessary for the applicant to prove an ulterior intention to interfere with the administration of justice. However, in any event, we are also satisfied to the criminal standard that in publishing the judgment in breach of the embargo the respondent did have a specific intention to interfere with the administration of justice. Such an intention may be readily inferred here. The respondent is a barrister who would have been well aware of the purpose of the condition of confidentiality attaching to draft judgments and the significance of its breach. He knew that the prohibition on publication was intended to serve the interests of justice. Nevertheless, as he stated in his personal statement, he took the deliberate decision to break the embargo as an act of civil disobedience, knowing that it would be likely to be treated as a contempt of court. He wanted to demonstrate his deliberate defiance of the prohibition and to bring this to the attention of as large an audience as possible. </p>

However, he submits that, at all times, he considered his action to be lawful. The respondent submits that the court should have regard to his intentions, beliefs and motivations in disclosing the result of the appeal. He submits that he was justified in doing so in breach of the order because this was a reasonable and proportionate measure to prevent harm to the public as a result of the catastrophe which he believes would be caused by global warming. To that end he has placed before this court material which we have read relating to what he sees as the erroneous approach of the Supreme Court and the consequences to which it will lead. </p>

The respondent had been given a direction by the court not to disclose the draft judgment and he was bound to obey it unless there was a successful application to the court to vary it. </p>

There is no such thing as a justifiable contempt of court; see <span style="font-style:italic">Attorney General v Times Newspapers Ltd</span> [1974] AC 273, 302 per Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest. The respondent was bound to observe the confidentiality attaching to the Supreme Court decision irrespective of any such belief. In particular, it is clear on the authorities that a person may have an intention to interfere with the administration of justice even if he or she acts with the motive of securing what he or she considers to be a just outcome overall; see <span style="font-style:italic">Connolly v Dale</span> [1996] QB 120; <span style="font-style:italic">Attorney General’s Reference No 1 of 2002</span> [2002] EWCA Crim 2392. </p>

Once the judgment had been handed down, the parties, the media and the public were all free to scrutinise the judgment and to comment on it.

If the respondent’s case is that the Supreme Court judgment violated article 2, then that could be tested in proceedings against the United Kingdom in Strasbourg.

The embargo on publication was intended to protect the operation of the legal system. The breach of the embargo was carried out intentionally and in full knowledge of the prohibition on disclosure. The respondent admitted in the contemporaneous documents that the breach of embargo was a considered act on his part. In addition, there was a clear intention to interfere with the administration of justice. The conduct in question was intended to attract publicity to conclusions in the judgment with which the respondent fundamentally disagreed. The respondent was deliberately disobeying the court’s embargo and abusing the court’s judgment hand down procedure in order to gain publicity. </p>

This was as the respondent intended. This risks undermining respect for the confidential nature of the court’s judgment hand down procedure and may encourage others, dissatisfied by the impending outcome of the case, to do likewise. Deterrence is a relevant consideration in sentencing in such a case. It appears that little direct harm was caused as a result of the publication. It has not been suggested, for example, that this was a case where market-sensitive information was released prematurely to the public. The Attorney General accepts that the direct adverse consequences were limited. Nevertheless, the respondent’s conduct was damaging to the system whereby judgments are made available to the parties in advance of hand down, a system which is beneficial to the parties to civil litigation and to the courts. </p>

Both of these matters are relevant to the nature of the proceedings and the way in which the case is disposed of (see paras 47-50 of the judgment, citing <span style="font-style:italic">Cuadrilla Bowland Ltd v Persons Unknown</span> [2020] EWCA Civ 9; [2020] 4 WLR 29 and <span style="font-style:italic">Cuciurean v Secretary of State for Transport</span> [2021] EWCA Civ 357). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">First, at the hearing, in advance of imposing a penalty, the court invited the respondent to provide details of his means (Transcript of Hearing, pp 102-106). The respondent first told the court that he was a full-time volunteer for a small charity. He was then encouraged by the court to provide more details of his financial means. He explained that he had a share of the income from properties he owns and rents out with his wife, which came to approximately £1,500 per month, in addition to outgoings of £2,000. This information was before the court and was taken into account when the issue of costs was considered. It appears to be more favourable to him than the details which have since been provided in annex 1 of his written submission. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Secondly, the respondent was once again invited to make oral submissions on costs before the Court decided whether to make an order (Transcript of Hearing, pp 107-108). The respondent accepted this invitation and made oral submissions, but he chose not to mention his means. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Thirdly, in annex 1 of his written submission he states that he works full time as the unpaid Director of Plan B Earth, a charity. He states that as a result his annual income from letting property and investments is £3,199.76. However, he does own jointly with his wife three properties: the family home and two flats which are let. The combined value of these properties has not been disclosed. The respondent states that the flats are held on trust. From the information provided by the respondent, only one of these properties is subject to a mortgage. While we make no assumption as to possible assistance the respondent may or may not receive from third parties to meet an order from costs, we note that the respondent has informed the court that “a crowdfunder to cover the costs of my court fine … has to date raised £4,240”. </p>
