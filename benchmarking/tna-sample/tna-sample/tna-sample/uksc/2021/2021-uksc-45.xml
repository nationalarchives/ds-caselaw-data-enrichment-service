	      <span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">The nature and history of the proceedings are fully explained in the judgments of Lord Lloyd-Jones and Lord Leggatt. In summary, the claimant seeks to recover damages from the operator of the hotel in Egypt which provided the excursion during which the accident occurred. She claims damages pursuant to Egyptian law, both in contract and in tort, first, in her own right, for her personal injuries; secondly, as executrix of Sir Ian’s estate and on behalf of the estate and its heirs, for his wrongful death; and thirdly, for dependency for wrongful death.</span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">
	      <span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">The claim form was issued in December 2012. Proceedings followed in which the jurisdiction of the English courts was challenged. It ultimately emerged, during the hearing of an appeal to this court, that the claimant had named the wrong company in the Four Seasons group as the defendant, and that the operator of the hotel was FS Cairo (Nile Plaza) LLC, an Egyptian company. The High Court subsequently permitted the claimant to amend the claim form so as to substitute that company as the defendant, and to serve the amended claim form on the defendant in Egypt.</span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">
	      <span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">The present appeal raises two issues. The first is whether the claims in tort pass through the gateway in CPR PD 6B, paragraph 3.1(9), on which the claimant relies: that is to say, whether they satisfy the requirement for suing a defendant who is outside the territorial jurisdiction of the English courts that “damage was sustained … within the jurisdiction”. The second issue is whether the claims, both in contract and in tort, satisfy the requirement that they must have a reasonable prospect of success. That issue arises because it is common ground that the only claims which can be advanced are those available to the claimant under Egyptian law. The defendants maintain that the claimant must therefore adduce evidence of Egyptian law, whereas she maintains that she can rely on English law, on the basis that is applicable in the absence of satisfactory evidence of foreign law.</span>

She booked a limousine “safari” excursion to Al-Fayoum and certain other desert locations outside Cairo, for the claimant, her husband, Sir Ian Brownlie, his daughter Rebecca, and Rebecca’s two children.</span>

The claimant maintained that the contract for the provision of the excursion into which she had entered was made by FSHI as principal or as agent for an undisclosed and unidentified principal with the result that it was liable to be sued as if it were the principal to the contract. The claimant alleged that the contract was subject to an implied term that the excursion be supplied with reasonable care and skill so as to enable the claimant and her husband to be reasonably safe. The particulars of claim alleged that the accident was caused by the negligence and/or breach of contract of FSHI, its employees, suppliers, sub-contractors, their agents and/or employees. Particulars were provided of the negligence of the driver of the vehicle and of FSHI, its employees, suppliers, sub-contractors, their agents and/or employees. It further alleged a failure to exercise reasonable care and skill with respect to the planning, organisation, management and operation of the excursion and a failure to exercise reasonable care and skill to ensure the reasonable safety of the claimant and her husband. Particulars were provided of the claimant’s injury, losses and expenses. The claim form then set out the claims in respect of the death of Sir Ian on behalf of his estate and by the claimant as his dependant.</span>

Under the Brussels system the general rule is that a defendant domiciled in a member state of the European Union is to be sued in the state of his domicile, but this is subject to a series of limited exceptions in cases of “special jurisdiction”. Following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, the Brussels system no longer applies in this jurisdiction. The present proceedings are in any event outside the scope of the Brussels system because the defendant is not domiciled in a member state of the European Union.

	      <span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">Before addressing these submissions in detail, it is necessary to say something about the evolution of the domestic rule and its relationship to the Brussels system. Before the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 (“the 1982 Act”) came into force, the Rules of the Supreme Court Order 11, rule 1(1)(h) had permitted service out of the jurisdiction “if the action begun by the writ is founded on a tort committed within the jurisdiction”. The Rules of the Supreme Court (Amendment No 2) 1983 (SI 1983/1181 (L21)) amended this rule, with effect from the date when the 1982 Act came into force, to apply to cases where “the claim is founded on a tort and the damage was sustained, or resulted from an act committed, within the jurisdiction” (RSC Order 11, rule 1(1)(f)). This change is likely to have been prompted by the fact that under the Brussels Convention, to which the United Kingdom acceded in 1978 and which was given effect in domestic law within the United Kingdom by the 1982 Act, article 5(3) created a rule of special jurisdiction that a person domiciled in a contracting state could be sued in another contracting state in matters relating to tort, delict or quasi-delict “in the courts for the place where the harmful event occurred”. This rule was subsequently set out in article 5(3) of the Brussels Regulation I and it now appears in article 7(2) of the Brussels Recast Regulation. In </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif"> (Case C-21/76) [EU:C:1976:166]; [1978] QB 708, the European Court of Justice had held that article 5(3) should be read as referring to both the place where the tortious act occurred and the place where the damage occurred, where they are not identical. As a result, where the River Rhine was polluted in France and damage occurred downstream in the Netherlands, the claimant had the option of suing the tortfeasor in the courts of either state. It is likely that the amendment to the RSC to widen the tort gateway was effected because it was appreciated that it would otherwise have been narrower than the head of special jurisdiction in article 5(3) of the Brussels Convention.</span>

The Court of Appeal considered that under the domestic rule jurisdiction might be assumed only where the claim was founded on a tort and either the damage was sustained within the jurisdiction or the damage resulted from an act committed within the jurisdiction. The first limb raised the question of what damage was referred to. It had been submitted for one of the defendants that since the draftsman had used the definite article and had not simply referred to “damage”, it was necessary that all the damage should have been sustained within the jurisdiction. The court rejected the submission. It was not supported by authority and could lead to an absurd result if there were no one place in which all the claimant’s damage had been suffered. In the court’s view it was enough if some significant damage had been sustained in England.</span>

In the court’s view (at p 591) “in a real sense this amounts to the suffering of damage in England”. I consider that the court was justified in taking this wider view of damage and in addressing where in a real sense the damage was suffered.

The French claimants argued that the place where the harmful event occurred was the place where their interests were adversely affected; the financial loss which they suffered following the insolvency of their subsidiaries in Germany was the place of their registered offices in France. In rejecting the submission, the Court of Justice considered that the damage alleged was no more than the indirect consequence of the harm initially suffered by other legal persons who were the direct victims of damage, and that the expression “place where the damage occurred” in </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">Bier</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif"> did not refer to the place where the indirect victims of the damage suffer the repercussions on their own assets. The Court of Justice drew attention to the general rule in article 2 of the Brussels Convention that the courts of the state of the defendant’s domicile would have jurisdiction and to “the hostility of the Convention towards the attribution of jurisdiction to the courts of the plaintiff’s domicile” as demonstrated by article 3. It was only by way of exception to the general rule that special jurisdiction was allowed in certain cases, including that envisaged by article 5(3). The Court of Justice emphasised that those cases of special jurisdiction, the choice of which was a matter for the plaintiff, are based on the existence of a particularly close connecting factor between the dispute and courts other than those of the state of the defendant’s domicile. It explained that, in order to promote recognition and enforcement of judgments in other states, it was necessary to avoid the multiplication of courts of competent jurisdiction which would heighten the risk of irreconcilable decisions. Accordingly, the concept of the place where the damage occurred could be understood only as indicating “the place where the event giving rise to the damage, and entailing tortious, delictual or quasi-delictual liability, directly produced its harmful effects upon the person who is the immediate victim of that event”.</span>

The claimant association sued Volkswagen in Austria in tort, delict or quasi-delict on behalf of persons who had purchased in Austria motor cars manufactured by Volkswagen in Germany which were alleged to have been fitted with a device which falsified the emissions readings. On a preliminary reference on the issue of jurisdiction under article 7(2) of the Brussels Recast Regulation, the Court of Justice noted that the damage alleged took the form of a loss in value of the vehicles stemming from the difference between the price paid and their actual value owing to the installation of the device. The court considered (at paras 30-35) that while those vehicles became defective as soon as that software had been installed, the damage asserted occurred only when those vehicles were purchased, as they were acquired for a price higher than their actual value. Such damage constituted initial damage and not an indirect consequence of the harm initially suffered by other persons. Moreover, such damage was not purely financial damage but material damage stemming from the fact that the purchaser received a defective vehicle. In the court’s view the damage suffered by the final purchaser was neither indirect nor purely financial and occurred when the vehicle was purchased in Austria. Similarly, in </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif"> The majority (Lady Hale, Lord Wilson and Lord Clarke) considered that the word “damage” in paragraph 3.1(9)(a) was intended to bear its natural and ordinary meaning and that in the case of personal injury or wrongful death that extended to actionable harm caused by the tortious act alleged, including all the bodily and consequential financial effects, which a claimant suffers as a result of the tortious conduct. In coming to this view, the majority rejected a narrower reading which sought to distinguish between direct and indirect damage, founded on the nature of a cause of action in tort or on the relationship of the tort gateway to the special jurisdiction in tort within the Brussels system. Furthermore, the majority considered that its reading would not permit claimants to bring proceedings wherever they chose. There remained a requirement that there should be a substantial connection between the claim and this jurisdiction and that would be protected by the exercise of judicial discretion. In a dissenting judgment, with which Lord Hughes agreed, Lord Sumption considered that “damage” in paragraph 3.1(9)(a) means direct damage. A number of different lines of reasoning led him to this conclusion, in particular (1) the nature of the duty broken in a personal injury action and the character of the damage recoverable for the breach, (2) what he considered to be the deliberate assimilation of the domestic rule in relation to tort claims to the corresponding head of special jurisdiction in the Brussels system, and (3) the need to identify some substantial and not merely casual or adventitious link between the cause of action and this jurisdiction.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">In support of his view that “damage” in paragraph 3.1(9)(a) is limited to direct damage, Lord Sumption considered (at para 23) that there is a fundamental difference between the damage done to an interest protected by law and facts which are merely evidence of the financial value of that damage. The law of tort is primarily concerned with non-pecuniary interests such as bodily integrity, physical property and reputation and, save in limited cases, does not protect pecuniary interests as such. Where the interest in bodily integrity is deliberately or negligently injured, the tort is complete at the time of injury, notwithstanding that damage is an essential element of it. In this regard he pointed to the requirement that all the damage flowing from bodily injury or damage to property must be claimed in one action which may be brought as soon as the claimant has been injured or his or her property damaged and to the fact that, although damage is an essential element of a cause of action in tort, the limitation period in respect of any damage flowing from the breach will run from that time. While Lord Sumption accepted that “damage” as that word is used in the rule is not necessarily limited to the damage which serves to complete a cause of action in tort, he maintained that the two concepts are clearly related. In his view “damage” within the rule does not extend to the financial or physical consequences of that damage.</span>

We are concerned here not with the completion of a cause of action in tort, a matter of substantive law, but with the scope of a jurisdictional rule which is intended to identify the appropriate forum for the adjudication of the resulting claim. In my view there is no justification in principle or in practice, for limiting “damage” in paragraph 3.1(9)(a) to damage which is necessary to complete a cause of action in tort or, indeed, for according any special significance to a place simply because it was where the cause of action was completed. First, while damage is an essential element of many torts including negligence, many other torts, including trespass to the person and trespass to goods, are actionable per se, without proof of damage. There is therefore no warrant for reading paragraph 3.1(9)(a), which is a rule of general application to claims in tort, in such a restrictive way.</span>

Section 18(4) of the Common Law Procedure Act, New South Wales (SI 1899/21) permitted a judge, in a case of non-appearance of the defendant, to enter judgment if satisfied “that there is a cause of action which arose within the jurisdiction”. In considering within this jurisdictional context where the cause of action arose, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on an appeal from the Supreme Court of New South Wales, having rejected a submission that every ingredient of a cause of action must have occurred within the jurisdiction, continued (at p 467E-G):</span>

The last event might happen in a particular case to be the determining factor on its own merits, by reason of its inherent importance, but not because it is the last event. Decisions under statutes of limitation are not applicable. The question in that context being when did the cause of action accrue so that the plaintiff became able to sue, the answer is that the cause of action accrued when it became complete, as the plaintiff could not sue before then. But when the question is which country’s courts should have jurisdiction to try the action, the approach should be different: the search is for the most appropriate court to try the action, and the degree of connection between the cause of action and the country concerned should be the determining factor.”</span>

In my view, therefore, there is no reason to read “damage” in paragraph 3.1(9)(a) as limited to the damage which violates the claimant’s right and which completes the cause of action. On the contrary, the word in its ordinary and natural meaning and when considered in the light of the purpose of the provision extends to the physical and financial damage caused by the wrongdoing, considerations which are apt to link a tort to the jurisdiction where such damage is suffered.

This amendment occurred at the same time as the introduction into our domestic law of the parallel but distinct Brussels system applicable in relation to cases where the defendant was domiciled in an EU member state. It seems clear that it was appreciated at that time that it was necessary to amend the domestic rule for tort cases in this way, for otherwise the exceptional special jurisdiction in tort in the Brussels system would have been wider than the domestic tort gateway. The intention was to widen the domestic gateway so as to encompass the cases covered by the Brussels Convention. (See </span>

However, it does not follow that what was effected at that time was an assimilation of the two tests. Had that been the intention, it could have been achieved by the use of the same terminology; in fact the language employed in the amended rule was and has remained very different from that of the Brussels Convention. Nor is there any basis for an assumption that, following the amendment to the RSC, the domestic gateway was thereafter to be tied to EU law on the scope of article 5(3) as that was developed by later decisions of the Court of Justice.

To that end, it establishes in article 2 a basic rule that a defendant domiciled in an EU state should be sued in its state of domicile. Heads of special jurisdiction, including the tort head, are limited exceptions and are to be interpreted narrowly in order to protect the basic rule in article 2 and to avoid a proliferation of possible jurisdictions which might pose a threat to the enforceability of judgments.

By contrast, within our domestic system the requirement of passing through one of the jurisdictional gateways is only one element of the test to be satisfied; in addition it must be demonstrated that England and Wales is the proper place in which to bring the claim and forum non conveniens and discretion play a vital part in the decision as to whether to accept jurisdiction.

Within our domestic system the function of determining whether this is the appropriate jurisdiction is not performed simply by the breadth of the gateway but in addition by the forum non conveniens discretion. There is, therefore, no sound basis for seeking to assimilate the limited, exceptional jurisdiction under article 5(3)/7(2) of the Brussels system with the tort gateway in our domestic system. In particular, the scope of the exceptional special jurisdiction under the Brussels system cannot be the defining consideration for the scope of the tort gateway in our domestic system.</span>

Mr Nigel Teare QC refused an application to set aside service out of the jurisdiction, rejecting a submission that “damage” in the rule referred to damage which completes the cause of action in tort and that that damage was the death of the claimant’s husband which had occurred in Egypt. In the judge’s view the word should be given its ordinary and natural meaning, namely harm which had been sustained by the claimant, whether physical or economic. Furthermore, the absence of the definite article in what was then CPR rule 6.20(8)(a) suggested that it was sufficient for the purposes of that sub-paragraph that some damage (not all of the damage) was sustained within the jurisdiction. In the judge’s view this was not an improbably wide construction because before jurisdiction was exercised the court had to be satisfied that it was appropriate to exercise that jurisdiction which involved considering whether England was the forum in which the case could most suitably be tried for the interests of all the parties and for the ends of justice (at paras 35-37).

Haddon-Cave J rejected a submission that “damage” in gateway 9(a) was limited to direct damage only (at paras 32-35). First, there were no limiting words which would justify such a narrow meaning and exclude indirect damage. The ordinary and natural meaning of “damage” was any damage flowing from the tort. Secondly, the suggested construction was tantamount to saying that damage was sustained only where the injury occurred. However, that was plainly not the case in many instances including that case where the sequelae flowing from the original accident or injury in Croatia continued to be suffered long afterwards in England in the form of substantial pain and suffering and economic loss. Thirdly, he considered that the defendant’s submission involved re-writing sub-paragraph 9(a) so as to read “the injury was sustained within the jurisdiction”. Moreover, he considered (at para 37) that the fact that a tort may be complete on proof of loss or damage did not mean that jurisdiction could not properly be founded by proof that some of that loss or damage occurred in the jurisdiction in question.</span>

The applicable rule permitted service outside the state “where the proceedings are founded on, or are for the recovery of, damage suffered wholly or partly in the State caused by a tortious act or omission wherever occurring”. On behalf of the defendant it was submitted that “damage” within the rule was limited to the immediate consequences of the proposed defendant’s tort, ie, the immediate physical injuries and losses which occurred in Queensland as distinct from the longer term physical and financial consequences which occurred in New South Wales. It was further submitted that “damage” within the rule was limited to that damage which constituted the necessary element in the cause of action in tort which, once established in another jurisdiction, rendered the rule inoperative in respect of damage and losses additionally suffered in New South Wales.

They concerned a reinsurance pool arrangement operating in the United States which had been set up at the instigation of an English group of companies (Clarksons) and managed by an American group (Howdens). Following a “disastrous outcome”, numerous actions were brought in England and Wales against Clarksons which, in turn, sought to make claims over against Howdens by separate writs issued in this jurisdiction which they sought to serve in the United States. Clarksons maintained that they had suffered damage in their pocket in London and that therefore damage had been sustained in England and Wales.

However, their claim was not so limited. The damage for which Clarksons claimed was their exposure to claims by reinsurers which were being pursued in England and Wales and which, if successful, would result in judgments enforceable here. That was considered to amount, “in a real sense”, to the suffering of damage in England (at p 591). The decision is concerned only with pure economic loss and casts no light on a case like the present where physical and other damage were suffered sequentially first outside and then inside the jurisdiction.</span>

The nature of pure economic loss creates a need for constraints on the legal consequences of remote effects and can give rise to complex and difficult issues as to where the damage was suffered, calling for a careful analysis of transactions. As a result, the more remote economic repercussions of the causative event will not found jurisdiction. By contrast the tort alleged in the present case is not “wholly economic in nature”.

However, this is not such a case. In a case of personal injury or wrongful death “damage” within gateway 9(a) extends, both in its natural and ordinary meaning and on a purposive reading, to the actionable harm caused by the tortious act, including all the bodily and consequential financial effects which the claimant suffers. In this context it is neither necessary nor appropriate to seek to limit the scope of the provision by a restrictive reading or by attempting to distinguish between direct and indirect effects, a distinction which itself can give rise to great difficulty and uncertainty. The damage of which Lady Brownlie complains has, in a very real sense, been sustained by her in this jurisdiction. She has largely endured the pain, suffering and loss of amenity consequent on her own personal injury in this jurisdiction and the financial consequences of her husband’s death have also largely been sustained in this jurisdiction. Furthermore, this does not amount to permitting claimants to bring proceedings wherever they choose, for the additional reason that the requirement of a substantial connection between the claim and this jurisdiction will be protected by the operation of the principle of forum non conveniens, considered in detail below. This approach is not inconsistent with the cases on economic loss considered above.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif"> to the wider reading of “damage” in rule 3.1(9)(a) is that all of the jurisdictional gateways in the Practice Direction are intended to identify some substantial link between the cause of action and England and that this purpose is better served by locating jurisdiction in the place where the relevant interest of the claimant was damaged than by asking where he or she experienced the effects of the damage. In the context of personal injury claims, it is suggested, the latter approach would confer on the English courts what would amount to a universal jurisdiction to entertain claims by English residents for the more serious personal injuries suffered anywhere in the world, a jurisdiction which would be so wide as to conflict with the purpose of the rule. This, however, overlooks the fact that the jurisdictional gateways in the Practice Direction, however wide or narrow, form only one element of the jurisdictional test. Before the court will give permission to serve proceedings out of the jurisdiction, not only must a claim pass through one of the gateways, but it must also be shown that England is the proper place in which to bring the claim. I am unable to agree with the statement of Lord Sumption in </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">Brownlie I</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif"> (at para 31) that “[t]he discretion as to forum non conveniens authorises the court to decline a jurisdiction which it possesses as a matter of law”. The gateways alone do not confer jurisdiction and the discretionary test must be satisfied before permission to serve out of the jurisdiction will be given. (See CPR rule 6.37(3) set out at para 30 above.) Provided that the discretionary test is correctly applied, there should, therefore, be no danger that the wider reading of “damage” would establish a jurisdiction simply on the basis of the English identity of the claimant or that it would permit foreign defendants to be brought before the English courts in cases where there is no substantial connection between the wrongdoing and the jurisdiction. In this regard the domestic system is markedly different from the Brussels regime which does not possess such a safety valve. As a result, there is no need to adopt an unnaturally restrictive reading of the domestic gateways.</span>

In addition - and this is a point to which I attach particular importance - the forum non conveniens principle is not a mere general discretion, the application of which may vary according to the differing subjective views of different judges creating a danger of legal uncertainty.

Nicol J, in considering whether England is the proper forum for the litigation of the claimant’s claims, while also considering procedural advantages and disadvantages of the competing jurisdictions, gave weight to the fact that to a significant extent the claimant’s losses had been experienced in England (at para 139(viii)). There has been no appeal against his conclusion that England is the proper place in which to bring the claim, permission to appeal having been refused by the judge and the Court of Appeal.</span>

Furthermore, I can see no reason to apply within English domestic rules the distinction between direct and indirect damage which has now developed in the Brussels system. To my mind, the word “damage” in paragraph 3.1(9)(a) of Practice Direction 6B simply refers to actionable harm, direct or indirect, caused by the wrongful act alleged. This reading reflects the ordinary and natural meaning of the word and is in accordance with the purpose of the provision and with principle. There is no need to limit its scope to direct as opposed to indirect damage, a distinction which in any event I consider obscure and likely to give rise to difficulty in its application.

In my view, all three heads of claim should be considered to relate to actionable harm suffered in the jurisdiction as a result of the wrongful acts alleged and therefore to pass through gateway 9(a). In this regard, I can see no reason to distinguish between the different heads of claim. So far as the first head is concerned, the pain, suffering and physical injury were suffered sequentially, first in Egypt and then in England. As Lady Hale observed in </span>

The injury to Sir Ian’s estate and the claimant’s bereavement and loss of dependency can properly be regarded as sustained in this jurisdiction. To employ the language of McHugh JA in </span>

Such elision of the two concepts can also be seen in some judicial decisions. The potential for confusion is increased by the fact that the expression “default rule” is capable of being used - as it was by Underhill LJ in the Court of Appeal in the present case - to refer to a situation where “the court is applying the foreign law but using the default rule to establish its effect”: see [2020] EWCA Civ 996, para 171.

By contrast, the “default rule” (as I shall use that term) is not concerned with establishing the content of foreign law but treats English law as applicable in its own right where foreign law is not pleaded.</span>

The answer given to that objection by those who defend the default rule is that, in an adversarial system such as that in England and Wales, if a party does not rely on a particular rule of law even though it would be entitled to do so, it is not generally for the court to apply the rule of its own motion. The issues in proceedings are defined by the parties’ statements of case. Thus, it is for each party to choose whether to plead a case that a foreign system of law is applicable to the claim; but neither party is obliged to do so and, if neither party does, the court will apply its own law to the issues in dispute.</span>

Article 1(3) of each of the Rome I and Rome II Regulations provides that (with immaterial exceptions) the Regulation “shall not apply to evidence and procedure”. The rule that (with limited exceptions) the court is not obliged to decide a case in accordance with a rule of law on which neither party chooses to rely is a rule of English civil procedure. The Rome I and Rome II Regulations therefore do not seek to oust it. (If, which I doubt, the Court of Appeal in </span>

In accordance with this procedural rule, the English court is not obliged to apply the choice of law rules contained in the Rome I and Rome II Regulations if neither party chooses to assert in its statement of case that foreign law is applicable. That is so even if the case is one to which a foreign system of law would clearly have to be applied if either party chose to rely on that fact. It may also be said that in such a situation the parties are tacitly agreeing that English law should be applied to decide the case. There is no public policy which prevents this. Indeed, the freedom to agree after the event to submit a contractual or non-contractual obligation to a law of the parties’ choice different from the law previously or otherwise applicable is expressly affirmed by, respectively, article 3(2) of the Rome I Regulation and article 14(1)(a) of the Rome II Regulation.</span>

To apply English domestic law in that situation would ex hypothesi be unlawful.

		<span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">First, while there are of course many differences between the laws of different countries, there are also often similarities. That is most obviously true where the laws have a common origin, as in the case of countries which apply the common law. While there is a natural tendency for the laws of such countries to diverge over time, that tendency is reduced by the respect which courts in common law jurisdictions afford to decisions of the courts of other common law countries as persuasive authority on the content of their own law. Even where the foreign system of law is a civil law system with its historical roots in Roman law, there is often good reason to expect that the foreign law will provide the same answer to a legal question, even if the result is reached by a different legal route. Such parallels have been enhanced where international conventions aimed at harmonisation of laws have been adopted, mainly in areas of commercial law. In </span>

Unless there is a real likelihood that any differences between the applicable foreign law and English law on a particular issue may lead to a different outcome, there is no good reason to put a party to the trouble and expense of adducing evidence of foreign law. The object of adjudication is not to achieve a goal of abstract legal purity but to do practical justice between the parties. Moreover, unlike decisions applying English law which may be relied on as precedents in later cases, where foreign law applies there is no larger purpose to be served beyond reaching the correct result in the instant case.</span>

A creditor who was seeking to seize the husband’s goods in execution of a debt incurred by the wife contended that the antenuptial contract was invalid. In the absence of any evidence of Russian law, the creditor sought to rely on the presumption that the relevant Russian law was the same as the domestic law. Under South African legislation an antenuptial contract was only valid if registered (a requirement which had not existed at common law). The creditor argued that, presuming Russian law to be the same as the South African law, since there was no evidence that the contract relied on had been registered, it must be regarded as invalid.

		<span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">As Part VIII of the Companies Act 1985 by its terms applied only to companies registered under the UK Companies Acts, it plainly did not apply to a Pennsylvanian company. If the court had indeed been required to apply English law by default, the attempt to rely on Part VIII could therefore have been disposed of very shortly. Without expressing a final view on the point, the Court of Appeal did suggest that the fact that Part VIII applied only to UK companies might well be a sufficient indication that it could not be applied in that case (see paras 66-67). That suggestion was, in my opinion, misplaced, as the case was not one in which both parties were content to proceed on the basis that English law should be applied. It was common ground that the law to be applied was that of Pennsylvania. In these circumstances, as discussed above, there was no scope for the operation of the default rule. English law was only of potential relevance if and in so far it could be presumed that the law of Pennsylvania was materially similar. The fact that the English statute only applied to UK companies did not rule out such a presumption.</span>

That test presupposed that the relevant question was whether in the circumstances it could properly be presumed that the law of Pennsylvania was materially similar to the English statutory law. The Court of Appeal concluded that it could not, as the relevant requirements of Part VIII were derived from a European Community Directive on company law and it was unrealistic to expect the law of Pennsylvania to impose similar requirements (paras 68-69).

		<span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">Second, also as a matter of broad generalisation, the presumption is less likely to be appropriate where the relevant domestic law is contained in a statute, but this depends on the nature of the statute and, more specifically, the relevant statutory provision. There is a difference between a statute which codifies general principles and one which introduces a local scheme of regulation. The fact that the events in question are not actually within the scope of the domestic statute, for example because it does not have extraterritorial effect, is not a bar to relying on the presumption - as the question is not whether the domestic statute itself applies but whether it is reasonable to presume, unless and until the contrary is shown, that the foreign system of law contains a materially similar rule. That may depend upon the particular aspect of the statutory rule on which a party is seeking to rely. To take an example, it might be reasonable to presume that, if death is caused by a wrongful act of the defendant, the foreign law will make provision for a claim for damages for bereavement. It also seems likely, however, that the extent of such provision will vary from one legal system to another. So, whereas it might be reasonable to presume that the spouse of the deceased is entitled to claim such damages, it might be hard to argue that, for example, the right of action should be presumed to extend - as it now does under section 1A of the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 in the UK - to a cohabiting partner of the deceased.</span>

I do not think this problematic, however, given that reliance on the presumption is always a matter of choice. It is always open to the party who is asserting a claim or defence based on foreign law to adduce direct evidence of the content of the relevant foreign law rather than take the risk of relying on the presumption. Equally, it is always open to the other party to adduce such evidence showing that the foreign law is materially different from the corresponding English law rather than take the risk that the presumption will be applied.</span>

Self-evidently, there is more scope for relying on the presumption of similarity at an early stage of proceedings when all that a party needs to show in order to be allowed to pursue a claim or defence is that it has a real prospect of success. By contrast, to rely solely on the presumption to seek to prove a case based on foreign law at trial may be a much more precarious course.</span>

		<span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">I would add that it should not be assumed that the only alternative to relying on the presumption of similarity is necessarily to tender evidence from an expert in the foreign system of law. The old notion that foreign legal materials can only ever be brought before the court as part of the evidence of an expert witness is outdated. Whether the court will require evidence from an expert witness should depend on the nature of the issue and of the relevant foreign law. In an age when so much information is readily available through the internet, there may be no need to consult a foreign lawyer in order to find the text of a relevant foreign law. On some occasions the text may require skilled exegesis of a kind which only a lawyer expert in the foreign system of law can provide. But in other cases it may be sufficient to know what the text says. If, for example, the question is whether a spouse has a right to claim damages for bereavement under the applicable foreign law, producing a copy of the relevant foreign legislation (with, if necessary, an English translation) is a much more secure basis for a finding than presuming that the foreign law is the same as the English law. Of course, a judge needs to be alert to whether the text relied on is current. But even if that cannot be guaranteed, the presumption of continuity may be a more reliable foundation in the absence of contrary evidence than the presumption of similarity.</span>

Inevitably, adducing direct evidence of foreign law narrows the potential for relying on the presumption; but whether it eliminates the potential for doing so altogether must depend on the circumstances. For one reason or another, the evidence tendered by the parties may be incomplete. A party or its expert may not have anticipated every point of foreign law which may arise in relation to a particular issue; or a party might consider it unnecessary or disproportionate to adduce evidence of foreign law on a particular matter and choose instead to rely on the presumption. There is no principled reason why reliance on the presumption should be prevented in such circumstances. A common example of a situation where evidence of foreign law is incomplete and where reliance on the presumption may be entirely appropriate is where the court is provided with the text of a foreign statute but does not have evidence either of how the particular statute, or statutes in general, would be interpreted by the foreign court. In such a situation it is often reasonable for the court to presume, in the absence of contrary evidence, that the foreign court would apply similar principles of statutory interpretation to an English court.</span>

During the hearing, the claimant applied for permission to raise a new point of Indian law which had not been addressed in the experts’ reports and to introduce additional evidence of Indian law on this new point. Cooke J refused the application for case management reasons in circumstances where a list of issues had been agreed at the court’s direction, of which this issue did not form part.

The defendant’s expert, Mr Ezzo, in contrast, began by considering the potential claim for breach of contract. The thrust of his evidence was that any contract made with FS Cairo for the provision of a car and driver for an excursion was a contract of carriage and, as such, was exclusively governed by the Egyptian Commercial Code. Under the Commercial Code the carrier’s liability for injury to a passenger is strict but is subject to a two-year time limit. Although the limitation period could be interrupted in certain circumstances, those circumstances did not apply in this case and the claim was therefore time-barred. Mr Ezzo also said that under Egyptian law it is not permissible to bring a claim in tort where there is a claim in contract and it is not permissible to bring a claim based upon contractual liability and tort liability at the same time. However, if a court were to conclude that there was a relevant tortious liability, a claim based on such a liability would in his opinion be time-barred.</span>

Furthermore, the claimant’s pleaded case does not offend the “doctrine of cumul” (which I understand to be a reference to the rule relied on by the defendant’s expert that it is not permissible to bring a claim in tort where there is a claim in contract) because the claim made is one in tort and the contract is simply the means by which the defendant’s vicarious liability for the negligence of the driver can be established.

While the precise nature and extent of the obligations owed will no doubt vary from one legal system to another, I agree with McCombe LJ in his judgment in the Court of Appeal (at para 62) that it seems reasonable to presume for the purpose of showing a serious issue to be tried that under any system of law a hotel operator who enters into a contract with a customer to take the customer and members of her family on an excursion in a chauffeur-driven car provided by the hotel will owe obligations under the contract and/or under the law of tort to ensure the safety of those concerned.

Furthermore, the expert evidence taken as a whole seems to me, if anything, to reinforce that conclusion as regards the claim in contract. It is true that, as counsel for the claimant accept, the supplemental report of the claimant’s expert, Mr Edge, is incorrect in suggesting that the claimant is not making a claim in contract and that her case is simply one in tort. But the defendant’s expert did not contend that FS Cairo has no potential contractual liability under Egyptian law. His argument was that the contract was one of carriage governed by the Commercial Code and, as such, is time-barred. The claimant’s expert gave credible reasons for disputing that analysis and arguing that the relevant time limit is that prescribed by the general Civil Code, which had not expired.

It is also unclear whether there is any distinction in this regard between the vicarious liability claim and the direct liability claim in tort. In these circumstances I do not think that the judge can be faulted on the current state of the evidence for holding that all the pleaded claims are reasonably arguable for the purpose of establishing the English court’s jurisdiction.

But reliance on the presumption does not alter the ordinary rules of pleading. If a claimant chooses not to plead a case based on any specific rules of the foreign law, hoping to be allowed to do so later if it becomes expedient, the claimant takes the risk of needing to persuade the court at a future date to grant permission to amend - just as in any other situation where a party seeks to change its case.

On this interpretation, which I will refer to as the “narrow” interpretation of the gateway, damage was sustained in this case in Egypt as a direct result of the defendant’s allegedly wrongful act when the claimant and her husband were injured (in his case fatally) in a car crash on 3 January 2010. Indirect consequences of that accident and those injuries subsequently suffered by the claimant in England do not bring the facts of this case within the tort gateway.</span>

It would mean that ground 9(a) applies where anyone who lives in England is injured when travelling abroad provided only that the injury sustained is sufficiently serious to cause pain or disability which continues, or financial loss (such as loss of earnings or the cost of medical treatment) which is incurred, after the claimant returns home to England. In effect, therefore, the claimant’s interpretation makes it a sufficient factual basis on which to found jurisdiction over a foreigner who otherwise has no connection with England and Wales that the person whom he is alleged to have wrongfully injured in his own country is an English tourist. Whilst such a rule would no doubt be welcomed by people living in England and Wales who holiday abroad and may reduce the need for travel insurance, no one has suggested any principled basis for it.</span>

It is implicit that ground 9(a) applies only to damage which is connected in some way with the claim in tort which the claimant wishes to bring and with the act committed by the defendant which is said to give rise to that claim. The key question is the nature of the required connection. That is not stated in ground 9(a), which says nothing about how “damage … sustained … within the jurisdiction” must be connected with any conduct of the defendant in order to come within the gateway.

		<span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">I agree with Lord Lloyd-Jones, however, for the reasons he gives, that in interpreting the tort gateway which applies in cases not covered by the Brussels regime, no inference can properly be drawn that it is intended to have exactly the same scope as article 7(2). As Lord Lloyd-Jones has explained, when the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 came into force, the English domestic rule was amended to include for the first time claims in tort where “the damage was sustained … within the jurisdiction”. (The definite article was later deleted to make it clear that any significant damage and not necessarily all relevant damage will suffice.) It appears that the reason for widening the rule in this way was to ensure that it was not narrower in scope than the corresponding rule in the Brussels regime. It does not follow, however, that the intention was to assimilate the two rules or to ensure that the domestic rule was </span>
		<span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">no wider</span>
		<span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif"> than its European counterpart. Not only is the wording of the two rules different, but the Brussels regime operates in a different way from the domestic rules. The Brussels regime is intended to allocate jurisdiction between member states of the EU in a uniform manner which leaves no room for discretion. As part of this scheme, the exceptions to the general rule that jurisdiction is based on the defendant’s domicile are intended to be narrowly confined. The domestic rules, on the other hand, are intended to apply in all situations where there is no such reciprocal arrangement allocating jurisdiction between the UK and the state where the defendant is domiciled and to operate more flexibly. In these circumstances it would be anomalous if ground (9) were narrower in scope than article 7(2) of the Brussels Recast Regulation; but there is no anomaly if ground (9) applies more widely.</span>

		<span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">These authorities - which include three decisions of the Court of Appeal - are inconsistent with the broad interpretation of the tort gateway. In each of them the court adopted the distinction between damage directly and indirectly caused by the defendant’s tortious act. It is true that in each case the court considered that ground 9(a) should be interpreted in line with article 7(2) of the Brussels Recast Regulation (or its predecessors) - which, as I have indicated, is not an inference that I think it safe to make. I nevertheless consider that the courts in these cases were correct to adopt the narrow interpretation of the tort gateway for the reasons that I am about to give. I also find cogent the point made in these cases that, to hold that any loss felt by a claimant in the place where he or she resides (or, in the case of a corporation, has its business seat) is damage falling within the scope of ground 9(a) would be tantamount to holding that claimants in tort have the option of suing in the courts of their own country. Such an option is not an accepted or acceptable basis on which to found jurisdiction. This point seems to me just as pertinent in cases of personal injury as in cases where the claim is for conversion of goods or conspiracy to defraud. Conversely, these authorities also show that, if no distinction is drawn between damage directly and indirectly caused by the defendant’s wrongful act, the logical consequence is that ground 9(a) will be satisfied in all cases where a claimant situated in England suffers any significant financial detriment for which damages are claimed in tort.</span>

Once it is accepted, however, that the distinction between direct and indirect damage is relevant in cases of financial damage, I am unable to see any warrant in either the language or the purpose of the tort gateway for restricting the distinction to such cases and declining to apply it in cases involving bodily injury.

As noted earlier, the practical effect of such an interpretation would be that, in any claim in tort for serious injuries sustained in another country, it is treated as a link with England sufficient to satisfy the gateway test that the claimant is ordinarily resident here.

Thus, it would be enough to satisfy the gateway requirement for bringing a claim in tort in the English courts that, for example, an Egyptian claimant badly injured in Egypt in a road traffic collision with a vehicle driven by another Egyptian driver afterwards comes to England while still suffering pain or disability.

The question whether England and Wales is “the proper place in which to bring the claim” is intended to codify the doctrine of forum conveniens (also sometimes referred to as forum non conveniens), which applies where there is a sufficient basis for founding jurisdiction in England but there is also some other available forum, having competent jurisdiction, where the case could be tried. The test of forum conveniens, as Lord Lloyd-Jones has pointed out at para 78 above, is not concerned merely with practical convenience. As stated by Lord Goff of Chieveley in his classic exposition of the doctrine in </span>
		<span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">Spiliada Maritime Corpn v Cansulex Ltd (The Spiliada)</span>
		<span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif"> [1987] AC 460, 480G, the object of the inquiry is “to identify the forum in which the case can be suitably tried for the interests of all the parties and for the ends of justice”. That, however, is an inquiry of a different kind and with a different purpose from the question whether there is a sufficient connection between the defendant and the jurisdiction to make it just or legitimate for the courts of England and Wales to assert jurisdiction over the defendant. Whereas the gateways look back to the events which gave rise to the claim, the test of forum conveniens looks forward to the nature and shape of the dispute at a trial. A key factor is usually where witnesses and documentary evidence are located (see eg </span>
		<span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">VTB Capital plc v Nutritek International Corpn</span>
		<span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif"> [2013] UKSC 5; [2013] 2 AC 337, para 62); but other factors are also relevant such as the law which the court will have to apply and the places where the parties respectively reside or carry on business: see </span>

In exceptional cases it may also be necessary to consider an allegation that the claimant would not be able to receive a fair trial in the alternative forum. None of those factors is relevant to whether there is a sufficient connection between the defendant and England to make it legitimate for the English court to assume jurisdiction in a case where the defendant has not submitted to the jurisdiction of the English courts, and it is wrong in principle as well as inconsistent with how the law has been applied to trade off the absence of such a connection against the relative advantages of England as a place to hold a trial.

To put it at its lowest, there is no ready way to balance the lack of any substantial connection between the proposed defendant and England against factors which would make England a suitable forum for a trial. Widening what is already a very wide-ranging evaluative assessment to include the presence or strength of such a connection would exacerbate the unpredictability, inefficiency and unfairness of the “proper place” requirement as a means of determining whether proceedings may be brought in England.</span>

		<span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">These considerations underline the need to interpret the gateways in a way which gives effect to their purpose and requires a real and substantial connection with England to be established before the court applies the test of forum conveniens. But they also bear in another way on how the gateways should be construed. CPR rule 1.2(b) requires the court in interpreting the Civil Procedure Rules to seek to give effect to the overriding objective of enabling the court to deal with cases justly and at proportionate cost. This includes, so far as is practicable, (a) ensuring that the parties are on an equal footing, (b) saving expense, (c) dealing with the case in ways which are proportionate to the amount of money involved, the importance of the case, the complexity of the issues and the financial position of each party, (d) ensuring that it is dealt with expeditiously and fairly, and (e) allotting to it an appropriate share of the court’s resources, while taking into account the need to allot resources to other cases: see CPR rule 1.1(1). The point is well made by Professor Andrew Dickinson in a case note on </span>
		<span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">Brownlie I</span>
		<span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif"> that adopting a wide interpretation of the tort gateway which makes the assumption of jurisdiction almost wholly dependent on a discretionary test of forum conveniens conflicts with the overriding objective. It does so by potentially (a) placing the parties on an unequal footing, given the defendant’s foreign residence and lack of connection to the English jurisdiction, (b) increasing expense, (c) adding complexity, (d) causing delay, and (e) occupying the public resources of the court: see Andrew Dickinson, “Faulty Powers: One-Star Service in the English Courts” [2018] LMCLQ 189.

That at least is the lesson I draw from the series of first instance decisions which I have cited at para 163 above, holding that pain or financial loss felt in England in consequence of personal injuries sustained in an accident abroad was enough to get through the tort gateway. In each of those cases the judge went on to consider whether England was “the proper place in which to bring the claim”. In every case the judge felt able to conclude that it was.</span>

The fact that a large number of expert witnesses would have to travel to Australia in order to give evidence was also seen as an important factor. The fact that the defendant had no connection with England apart from having had the misfortune to be involved in a collision with a British holidaymaker while driving in Western Australia does not seem to have been given any weight at all.</span>

The main reasons appear to have been: that to a significant extent the claimant’s losses have been experienced in England and the witnesses who would testify to those losses, including the claimant herself, live here; that a trial in England would be likely to reduce the need for translation (because English is more widely spoken in Egypt than Arabic is in England); and that, because in the Egyptian legal system there is an appeal as of right to the highest court, the scope for litigation to take longer if conducted in Egypt “would seem inevitable”: see [2019] EWHC 2533 (QB), para 139. In relation to this last factor, the irony seems to have been lost that, ten years after the claim form was issued, these proceedings in England are still bogged down in a preliminary dispute about jurisdiction, which is now on a second appeal to this country’s highest court.</span>

But it is human nature to wish, if possible, to allow a person who is before the court and who has suffered what may have been catastrophic injuries apparently as a result of another’s wrongdoing to proceed with a claim for compensation rather than sending him or her away to try to bring proceedings in a foreign country. It is also human nature for a judge who has spent his or her professional career working in a particular legal system to attach more weight to its perceived advantages than those of the legal system of a faraway country of which the judge may know little or nothing. Such factors are likely, on the evidence of these cases, to incline a judge who is afforded a discretion to exercise it in favour of permitting service outside the jurisdiction, even if the claimant’s injuries were sustained abroad and there is no real or substantial connection between the proposed defendant and the conduct which gave rise to the claim and England and Wales.</span>

		<span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">To frame the question in a neutral way, I think it useful to contemplate the situation which arises in such cases in reverse. Suppose that a British citizen who has lived her whole life in England drives carelessly on an English road and collides with another vehicle causing a serious injury to a passenger travelling in that vehicle. It so happens that the passenger is a tourist visiting this country from, say, the People’s Republic of China. The passenger returns home to China and wishes to bring a claim for damages for personal injury against the driver in his local court. He argues that the claim ought to be tried in China as, although the claim is governed by English law, no significant issue of law is likely to arise and liability is likely to be admitted; most of the witnesses whose evidence is relevant to the quantum of the claim, including the claimant himself, are situated in China and do not speak English, and most of the documents relating to quantum are in the Chinese language; moreover, the claim would be tried more quickly and cheaply in the Chinese courts. In such a case I cannot accept that the fact that the claimant has suffered continuing pain and incurred the cost of medical treatment and loss of earnings in China would amount to a link with that jurisdiction capable of justifying permitting proceedings to be brought against the driver in China, provided only that the Chinese court considers that practical considerations of the kind mentioned make China, on balance, the proper place in which to bring the claim.</span>

The judge concluded that the contract entered into when the claimant booked the sightseeing excursion in a telephone call made to the hotel before she left England came within this gateway.

		<span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif"> case, it is fair to hold that no contract has been concluded. To apply the same approach to decide whether the English courts have jurisdiction in relation to a claim made under a contract, however, produces entirely arbitrary results. The connection with England is no greater where the party to an international call who is situated in England is the one who makes the offer than it is where that person is the party who accepts the offer by which a contract is made. There is no principled basis for distinguishing between the two situations. The fact that one party is in England when the contract was made should either be sufficient or insufficient to satisfy the gateway requirement. It makes no sense that the result should depend upon a fine analysis of exactly who said what to whom in the conversation in which the contract was made.</span>
