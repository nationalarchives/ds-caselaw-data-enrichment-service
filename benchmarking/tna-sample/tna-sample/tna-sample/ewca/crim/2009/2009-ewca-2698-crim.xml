	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">DNA evidence has played a significant part in criminal trials since its application to forensic science was appreciated; it has been employed as a routine technique in the United Kingdom since 1987.  The process as first used was described by Lord Taylor CJ in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Deen</span> (21 December 1993).  In<span style="font-style:italic"> R v Doheny</span> [1997] 1 Cr App Rep 369, Phillips LJ (as he then was) gave some general guidance about its interpretation, the role of experts and directions given to juries.  In <span style="font-style:italic">R v Bates</span> [2006] EWCA Crim 1395, Moore-Bick LJ gave a more detailed description of DNA evidence at its then stage of development as used in a trial in 2005.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">As the science of DNA developed, techniques of analysing minute quantities of DNA, Low Template DNA, were developed from 1999 onwards.  One of the processes of analysis and interpretation of Low Template DNA is called Low Copy Number (LCN) DNA.  It is employed by the Forensic Science Service (FSS).  Evidence of DNA profiles using this process was adduced in August 2007 at the trials of the appellants in these appeals.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">During 2007, following a recommendation of an earlier review of the LCN process, the Forensic Science Regulator (the holder of a post established by the Home Secretary in July 2007 to advise the Executive on the quality standards of suppliers of forensic science services) asked Professor Brian Caddy to lead an independent review of the standards of science used in the analysis of all Low Template DNA, including the LCN process.  Professor Caddy was Emeritus Professor of Forensic Science at Strathclyde University with extensive experience in conducting independent reviews.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Before this review had been completed, a challenge was made in the Northern Irish case of <span style="font-style:italic">R v Sean Hoey </span>[2007] NICC 49 to the reliability of DNA evidence using the FSS’s LCN process.  The defendant was charged with offences of murder, conspiracy to murder and other offences in relation to the Omagh Bombing which had occurred on 15 August 1998.  The case against Hoey was based substantially on DNA evidence using the LCN process.  As the judge, Weir J, was not satisfied as to the integrity of any of the items relied on prior to their examination, the prosecution case failed.  However, extensive evidence was given in the course of the trial as to the reliability of the LCN process for the purpose of obtaining data of sufficient evidential quality.  Weir J summarised in his judgment what he described as, “the attack made on the evidential value and reliability of the system” by Dr Daniel Krane, a professor at Wright State University, Dayton, Ohio and Professor Allan Jamieson, a Director of the Forensic Institute.  We set out at paragraphs 104 and following the relevant experience of Professor Jamieson when he gave that evidence.  It appears that Weir J drew attention to the attack of Dr Krane and Professor Jamieson because of his stated concern about “the present state of the validation of the science and methodology associated with the LCN process and in consequence its reliability as an evidential tool”.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Professor Caddy reported in April 2008 that the processes were valid, as we explain below at paragraph 72, but set out caveats in relation to the interpretation of the results where the quantity of DNA analysed was below a certain amount.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In the grounds of appeal in each appeal, as they developed, the appellants raised, among other grounds, the general reliability of DNA evidence using the LCN process including its lack of validation, the limited research, the absence of protocols, disputes over interpretation and the scope of evaluation.  Leave to appeal was given in each case on this and other grounds.  In each appeal, leave was also sought to adduce fresh evidence under s.23 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968; that evidence was contained in expert reports provided by Professor Jamieson who had not given evidence at either trial.  In other cases where DNA evidence obtained by the Low Template DNA has been relied upon, criticisms similar to those made in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Hoey</span> have been made, often by Professor Jamieson.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">These two appeals were therefore listed together for hearing on the basis that the Court would hear <span style="font-style:italic">de bene esse </span>evidence as to the reliability and evidential value of Low Template DNA evidence, primarily that which had been obtained using the LCN process and then determine whether to admit that evidence.  Directions were given by the court at a directions hearing for the service of evidence in relation to that general issue.  The court was told at a hearing in July 2009 that the appellants would rely on a <span style="font-style:italic">pro bono</span> opinion provided by Dr Krane, in addition to calling Professor Jamieson.  This was not provided. Instead the appellants provided a report in September from Dr Bruce Budowle, a professor at the Department of Forensic and Investigative Genetics at the University of North Texas; he had been a senior scientist in the FBI’s Laboratory Division and had been involved in the development and validation of DNA processes.  The appellants sought leave to call Dr Budowle and that legal aid be extended to cover his attendance, as it still appeared that there was a general challenge to the use in evidence of profiles obtained from Low Template DNA.  The Crown sought leave to call Dr Adrian Linacre, a senior lecturer in forensic science at Strathclyde University who had been a member of Professor Caddy’s review, Mr Andrew Rennison, the Forensic Science Regulator, and others experienced in Low Template DNA.  Witness Statements were served containing extensive materials in relation to the general reliability of Low Template DNA analysis and in particular the LCN process.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">However, very shortly before the hearing of the appeals, both appellants abandoned, in circumstances we explain at paragraphs 62 and following, their general attack on the reliability of Low Template DNA evidence using the LCN process.  Although, therefore, in the event, the reliability of DNA profiles obtained from Low Template DNA through the LCN process in general was not directly before us, it became clear that the circumstances in which the reliability of Low Template DNA profiles obtained through the LCN process can be called into question can be described within the narrow compass which we set out at paragraphs 71 and following.  We nonetheless heard evidence <span style="font-style:italic">de bene esse</span> from Professor Jamieson, Dr Budowle, Dr Linacre and Valerie Tomlinson (an officer of the Forensic Science Service) in relation to this issue as well as the other issues on the appeal which we must summarise along with an outline of the evidence before turning to the detail of DNA profiling and the analysis of Low Template DNA. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Two pieces of plastic which the Crown contended were parts of two separate knife handles were found near Peter Hoe’s body.  One (AC/3) had revealed cellular material which matched the DNA profile of Terence Reed and the other (AC/4) cellular material which matched the DNA profile of David Reed and Peter Hoe.  The match probabilities were such that it was accepted to be their DNA.  AC/4 fitted the blade of a knife which was found in a drain at Peter Hoe’s address.  In addition to that evidence, the Crown contended, primarily on the basis of a message left on a mobile telephone, that the murder was at or shortly after 2100 on 12 October.  Observations of the appellants in the vicinity of Peter Hoe’s house and cell site evidence showed that both appellants had had the opportunity to kill Peter Hoe at about that time; there was also evidence of motivation.  The Crown also relied on the purchase by Terence Reed of an Adidas tracksuit top on the day following the killing, the purchased item being identical to the top that he had been wearing on the night of the killing.  It was their case that he had had to dispose of the one he was wearing because it had become bloodstained.</p>

The evidence for the Crown given by Valerie Tomlinson, an officer of the FSS based at Wetherby, was that the profiles which had been recovered from AC/3 and AC/4 had been obtained using the LCN process.

Although all of these were accepted by Valerie Tomlinson to be possibilities, she expressed views that it was highly unlikely that the appellants had innocently touched the knives at some stage and that someone else had brought the knives to Peter Hoe’s address.  She also considered that it was unrealistic that each appellant had passed their DNA to someone else who then transferred it to the pieces of plastic which were found at Peter Hoe’s address.

It was contended that the only admissible evidence that Valerie Tomlinson could have given was evidence of match probability and as to the general mechanisms of primary and secondary transfer, without any evaluation of its significance to the case.  It was further contended that, as she was not on this basis entitled to give evidence as to when and how the DNA  material was transferred to AC/3 and AC/4, the evidence of match probability would have led to speculation and so should have been excluded under s.78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.

In March 2006 Garmson forced himself into the back of a car in which a young woman, AO, was sitting.  In the front passenger seat was another woman.  The driver was a man.  He threatened them with a knife, demanded money and directed the man where to drive.  He then assaulted AO in the back seat, kissing her on the lips, putting her hand on his genitals and asking her to give him oral sex.  She grabbed the knife and asked the driver to stop.  When he did so, she and the other lady escaped.  Garmson compelled the man to continue driving, following the directions given by Garmson.  Garmson was subsequently identified.

Professor Caddy recommended in his review that quantification should take place.  It now is standard practice in the FSS to quantify, as it can be helpful to take into account the quantity in determining the subsequent process and the interpretation of the result.

During the process these STR regions are targeted by synthetic pieces of DNA called primers which seek out the STR regions.  Each primer is labelled with a fluorescent dye so that the newly generated STR copies are tagged and can be visualised and measured in the laboratory.  There then follows a further part of the process known as gel or (more recently) capillary electrophoresis.  In essence this process involves the newly synthesised DNA fragments being introduced onto a matrix or gel and being separated according to size by the application of an electric current which causes the DNA fragments to move through the matrix.  The longer fragments containing more STR repeats are impeded by the matrix and pass the point of reference later than shorter and therefore faster fragments.</p>

The electrophoretogram requires expert interpretation, as, for example, the different loci can react differently on amplification.  The process can generate results, known as “artefacts”, which are the consequence of the process and which are not an analysis of the DNA itself.  Two of the most common are “pull up” which is a consequence of the detection software and results from saturation of the various electronic detectors of the fluorescent dyes resulting in over exposure of the STR profile image and “stutter” which is a miscopying of the DNA during the amplification process and typically seen as a peak one repeat unit less in size than the true allele.</p>

It is important to note, as we have mentioned at paragraph 37 above, that the FSS at the time of the testing did not quantify the DNA, but acted on the judgment of the forensic science officer as to whether it was appropriate to use the LCN process based on that officer’s judgment of the quantity of DNA.</p>

These include allelic “drop out” (an allele that should be present but is not detected, giving a false negative for that allele), allelic “drop-in” (an apparently spurious allele seen in electrophoresis, potentially giving a false positive for that allele) and an increase in stutter.  As we explain at paragraph ii) the threshold below which stochastic effects can be produced is at present accepted to be between 100 and 200 picograms – a picogram is one million millionths of a gram (<span style="color:#000000">10</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:#000000">-12</span>) roughly equivalent to a ten millionth of a grain of salt.  Above that threshold (often called the stochastic threshold), the stochastic effect should not affect the reliability of the DNA profile obtained.  Below that stochastic threshold the electrophoretograms may be capable of producing a reliable profile, if for example there is reproducibility between the two runs. </p>

There may be cases where the match probability in relation to all the samples tested is so great that the judge would consider its probative value to be minimal and decide to exclude the evidence in the exercise of his discretion, but this gives rise to no new question of principle and can be left for decision on a case by case basis.  However, the fact that there exists in the case of all partial profile evidence the possibility that a “missing” allele might exculpate the accused altogether does not provide sufficient grounds for rejecting such evidence.  In many cases there is a possibility (at least in theory) that evidence exists which would assist the accused and perhaps even exculpate him altogether, but that does not provide grounds for excluding relevant evidence that is available and otherwise admissible, though it does make it important to ensure that the jury are given sufficient information to enable them to evaluate that evidence properly.  Moreover, as the court observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Doheny and Adams</span> at page 373D, the significance of DNA evidence depends to a large extent upon the other evidence in the case.

The study was directed at transferability in Low Template DNA cases where it was not possible to identify the cellular material transferred. It showed that in tests under controlled conditions there was a difference between individuals in their tendency to deposit or shed DNA, but it was not known why this was so.  Secondary transfer which resulted in only the cellular material of the original transferor being found (and not that of the intermediary) could occur under certain ideal conditions where clean objects and washed hands were used; the tests had shown that this happened where all the contact occurred without delay. In all other cases where the delay in the different contacts was either 30 minutes or an hour, a profile of the transferor and the intermediary was found. It would therefore be expected that unless the contacts had occurred within a very short time period, a mixed profile would be found. The paper made clear that it was necessary for further work to be done.</p>

The results indicate that the success rate of obtaining a trace DNA profile on forensic casework items will depend both on the characteristics of the DNA contributor and the specific activities performed by the contributor before touching the item.  Despite this the results gained in this study have shed some light on the variables that affect the transfer of trace DNA, factors that have been shown to include the time since a person last washed their hands and which of the two hands an item is touched with.  Although further research is required, the work presented here goes someway towards advancing understanding of the transfer of trace levels of DNA, and in doing so may allow forensic analysts to be able to evaluate better the meaning of this type of evidence.”</p>

However, as we have set out at paragraph 7, an appeal based on a general challenge to a number of aspects of evidence obtained from Low Template DNA was developed. Extensive information was provided by the FSS in this appeal and in a trial at the Central Criminal Court, <span style="font-style:italic">R v Stretch and Puttock</span>, in which Professor Jamieson had been engaged; with leave, the information provided in <span style="font-style:italic">Stretch and Puttock</span> was made available for use in these appeals.  The detail of the general challenge was set out in reports by Professor Jamieson and Dr Budowle served in August and September 2009.  It was deployed to contest specific aspects of the case against the Reeds, apart from the issues relating to transfer.  These aspects included (1) the inadmissibility of the profiles as they were based on the science of Low Template DNA which was uncertain and unreliable and  (2) the inadmissibility of  the profile on AC/4, the mixed profile, as there were special difficulties with the interpretation of mixed profiles</p>

The Crown maintained that the profiles from AC/3 and AC/4 were interpretable and had none of the stochastic effects that made them uninterpretable for the reasons set out in paragraph 48.  It was also accepted by Professor Jamieson that no credible challenge could be made to the profiles.  It appears, however, to have been assumed by those advising them and the Crown that the quantity of the DNA was such that it was only possible to obtain a profile by using the LCN process.</p>

Care may also be needed in interpretation where the LCN process is used on larger quantities than that for which it is normally used.  However a challenge to the validity of the method of analysing Low Template DNA by the LCN process should no longer be permitted at trials where the quantity of DNA analysed is above the stochastic threshold of 100-200 picograms in the absence of new scientific evidence.  A challenge should only be permitted where new scientific evidence is properly put before the trial court at a Plea and Case Management Hearing (PCMH) or other pre-trial hearing for detailed consideration by the judge in the way described at paragraphs 129 and following below.</p>

At one stage of his evidence he appeared to accept the conclusions we have set out; he then appeared to go back on this.  It might therefore have appeared that he had contradicted himself. If that had been the case, it would have cast grave doubts about the value of his evidence.  We think, however, from a detailed consideration of the transcript that he did not, in the result, resile from his acceptance of the conclusions we have set out, but was rightly seeking to draw attention to the need for careful interpretation and to the need for an expert to take considerable care in the conclusions expressed.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Valerie Tomlinson is a chartered biologist who has been employed by the FSS since 1982; since 1988 she has been engaged in DNA profiling for criminal investigations and paternity testing, after undergoing a three month intensive course in DNA profiling at the FSS laboratory and then a period of apprenticeship.  She has since then undergone periodical assessment of her competencies.  Her predominant work has been in cases involving offences against the person, predominantly in the laboratory, but also in visiting scenes of crime since 1985.  During the period of the existence of the Council for the Registration of Forensic Practitioners, she was one of the assessors employed to conduct peer review of those accredited by the Council.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">After the discovery of Peter Hoe’s body she visited Peter Hoe’s house and spent 3 days at the crime scene.  The two pieces of plastic were near Peter Hoe’s body – AC/4 near his right leg and AC/3 a little further away from his outstretched left hand.  She considered these incongruous as, apart from the disturbance caused by the killing, the house was very tidy; she formed the view that these came from two different knife handles and it was possible that they related to weapons used in the attack on Peter Hoe.  As we have set out at paragraph 13 above, a blade was found in the drain and AC/4 fitted that blade.  Although it was not formally admitted, either at the trial or on the appeal, that the pieces of plastic came from the handles of two knives, there can be little doubt that they did.  It was the evidence of Dr Mark Egan, the pathologist called by the Crown, that the blade found in the drain could have been used to inflict four of the wounds inflicted on Peter Hoe.</p>

AC/4 had traces of blood on it as it was on part of the carpet that was blood stained.  AC/3 was examined under the microscope and had no traces of blood.  She was of the opinion that, if there was any DNA on the plastic, other than and additional to the blood on AC/4, it was most likely to be DNA which had been transferred through touch; it was therefore likely that the amount would be low and therefore it should be tested by the LCN process which she considered reliable.  She did not quantify the DNA recovered from each piece, as quantification would have consumed some of the DNA, as explained at paragraph 37.  This was in line with FSS policy. The recovered DNA from both AC/3 and AC/4 was each divided into three parts and test runs using the LCN process were then conducted simultaneously on two of the parts recovered from each piece; simultaneous testing was in accordance with FSS operating procedures for police investigations. </p>

He was punctilious in underlining the danger of a scientist expressing views beyond that expert’s competence.  He rightly emphasised the dangers that can arise when a scientist expresses views beyond the narrow scientific point on which the expert is asked to opine.  There is, we accept, always a danger that if an expert expresses one part of his scientific evidence with confidence, and also expresses other views, those other views can, unless care is taken, be given a verisimilitude of certainty by association.</p>

We reject it primarily because it does not stand the test of analysis as set out in our conclusion at paragraphs 120 and following.  It is significant to note that he accepted that an expert could in other circumstances give evaluative evidence.  When he declined to evaluate the possibilities that had been enumerated in this case, he claimed he did not have sufficient information or that there were other possibilities.  He never identified those other possibilities.  Nor could he explain why he could not do so, save to say that a DNA scientist should not do so, as the scientist did not have the requisite knowledge and that the possibilities should be evaluated by others by reference to other evidence.</p>

It is also important to note that his experience was not based on the work of a forensic scientist in this jurisdiction who attends both the scene of the crime and supervises the laboratory work.  As he made clear, his experience was limited to the examination of DNA both in the laboratory and from case work.  His expertise did not extend to examining the scene of a crime and relating that examination to the evaluation of the circumstances of transfer of unidentified cellular material.  </p>

When the review was published, the Forensic Institute published a press release which stated that the review had not consulted anyone who had expressed a contrary opinion on the FSS’s LCN process and “spoke only to the organisations selling the technique” and to the police as “customers”.  A similar passage appears in a paper entitled <span style="font-style:italic">Fit for Purpose: The Review of Low Template DNA </span>written by Professor Jamieson and Dr Rhonda Wheate and published in <span style="font-style:italic">Barrister Magazine</span> in 2008.  These were, in our judgement, not only inaccurate statements, but statements that appeared to call into question the integrity of both the review by Professor Caddy and the providers of processes of Low Template DNA analysis.  There is no foundation for these statements.  We are satisfied that the review was carried out with complete integrity.  There is no evidence whatsoever to call into question the good faith or integrity of the suppliers of processes for analysing Low Template DNA.  The fact that Professor Jamieson, in the light of all the material he has now seen, no longer calls into question the validity of the process where the quantity is above the stochastic threshold, provides considerable mitigation for statements that in our view should never have been made and which, we were told, have now been withdrawn.</p>

His basic premise was that, where the nature of the cellular material was unknown, there was insufficient research to evaluate whether it was transferred to the surface where it was found by primary or secondary transfer.  Furthermore the research to date did not provide sufficient information about the persistence of such cellular material and how long it could remain on a surface.  There was therefore no reliable basis on which to put forward an evaluation of the probabilities of the mechanisms and circumstances of transfer in any given case.</p>

We retain clear reservations about the extent of his expertise in relation to DNA profiles; it is, for example, not comparable to that of Valerie Tomlinson.   However, it is not necessary for us to go further, as our grounds for not accepting his evidence in relation to the capability of an expert to give evidence on the circumstances of transfer are the same as the primary reasons we have set out in respect of Dr Budowle at paragraph 102 above.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is important to distinguish the issue of the admissibility of expert evidence from the assessment of that evidence by the jury. In the present appeal, the issue related to admissibility. There are three relevant principles relating to the admissibility of the evidence given by Valerie Tomlinson. First, expert evidence of a scientific nature is not admissible where the scientific basis on which it is advanced is insufficiently reliable for it to be put before the jury.  There is, however, no enhanced test of admissibility for such evidence.  If the reliability of the scientific basis for the evidence is challenged, the court will consider whether there is a sufficiently reliable scientific basis for that evidence to be admitted, but, if satisfied that there is a sufficiently reliable scientific basis for the evidence to be admitted, then it will leave the opposing views to be tested in the trial.</p>

However, there is no closed category where evidence cannot be placed before a jury; as was observed by Steyn LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Clarke</span> [1995] 2 Cr App R 425 at 429, “it would be wrong to deny to the law of evidence the advances to be gained from new techniques and new advances in science.” This is exemplified in the DNA cases. </p>

The alternative, of simply leaving the jury to make up its own mind about the similarities and dissimilarities, with no assistance at all about their significance, would be to give the jury raw material with no means of evaluating it.  It would be as likely to result in over-valuation of the evidence as under-valuation.  It would be more, not less, likely to result in an unsafe conclusion than providing the jury with the expert's opinion, properly debated through cross-examination and, if not shared by another expert, countered by contrary evidence.”</p>

We say no more about that than that there can be no doubt that such a power exists.  That is because he who asserts admissibility must demonstrate it.  Evidence of opinion is not ordinarily admissible.  Opinion based upon identifiable expertise outside the experience of the jury is one exception.  If objection be taken to admissibility (though not otherwise) it must be determined by the judge.  It is for him who tenders such evidence to establish the exception, viz the expertise and that it is the foundation of the opinion.  The power to rule on admissibility applies equally to Crown and defence.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.62in">The issue for us is whether, given the state of scientific knowledge on transferability of unidentified cellular material, Valerie Tomlinson could give admissible evidence setting out the possible explanations for the presence of DNA on the plastic from the knife handles and evaluating those possibilities, where the biological material from which the DNA has been taken was not identifiable, even though the amount was more than 200 picograms.  The question of admissibility depends on the reliability of the underlying science and the scope of evidence it is proper for an expert to give. As objection has been taken, then it is for the Crown to prove that the evidence was admissible.  If it was correctly admitted, it was for the jury to determine whether they accepted it.</p>

Even though the scientific knowledge on transferability (which we summarised at paragraphs 59 and 60 above) is plainly incomplete, we consider that the underlying science is sufficiently reliable for a range of possibilities to be enumerated as to the circumstances of transfer, including the mechanisms and timing, provided the limitations are made clear.  Whether a forensic scientist can do so in any given case will depend on the circumstances, but in the present appeal the circumstances (including the quality of profile) were such that the possibilities  could be enumerated.</p>

It seems to us that it is not logical, as was the essence of the evidence of Professor Jamieson and Dr Budowle, to say that an expert could never give such evidence, once it is accepted that the possibilities can be enumerated.  Indeed, as we have mentioned, Dr Budowle accepted that a forensic scientist could do this in relation to other areas of science.  His reservation concerned unidentified cellular material, whatever the quantity.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As Valerie Tomlinson told us, it may well at the present time be uncommon for a forensic science expert to be able to give evidence which enumerates and evaluates the possibilities. However, we consider that the science is sufficiently reliable for it to be within the competence of a forensic science expert to give admissible evidence evaluating the possibilities of transfer in DNA cases where the amount is over 200 picograms and when there is a sufficient evidential basis from the profiles and other material, as there was in this appeal, for it to be done.  As Valerie Tomlinson rightly pointed out, it is difficult to envisage the circumstances being set out in a protocol or defined by a set of rules (as suggested by Dr Budowle and referred to in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Hoey)</span>, because the circumstances in which such evidence can properly be given are likely to be so variable.  It is therefore essential, as we emphasise at paragraphs 128 and following below, that the court exercise a firm degree of control over the admissibility of this type of evidence by reference to the principles to which we have referred.  The evidence on the possibilities and the evaluation must be clearly set out in full in the terms in which it is to be given.  Where there is a challenge to its admissibility, the court must rule on the issue of admissibility in advance, or at the outset of the trial, in the way we describe below.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">One of the points raised by Dr Budowle was to suggest that there were other possibilities that might affect the position. He posited the possibility that one of the Reeds had brought both knives to the scene.  If that possibility had been raised in cross examination of Valerie Tomlinson at the trial, we consider that it was capable of evaluation.  However such an evaluation would have made no difference, as that possibility did not affect the essential matter which she had evaluated – handling of the knives by the appellants when bringing them to the deceased’s house.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Another possibility raised by Dr Budowle further demonstrates the illogicality of the position taken.  It is common ground that the cellular material cannot be identified. However there are, based on reliable science, only two real possibilities - from skin cells transferred on handling or by secondary transfer, as Valerie Tomlinson suggested or, as Dr Budowle suggested, deposit from epithelial cells through spit.  It is easy to envisage ways in which spit might have been transferred – putting the knife handles into the mouth (as Dr Budowle opined in relation to a pen), spitting on the hands (as Dr Budowle opined in relation to a base ball bat) or spitting or sneezing.  Given the information that Valerie Tomlinson observed at the scene of the killing and the other agreed facts, it is difficult to see why the jury could not have been given Valerie Tomlinson’s evaluation of the possibilities.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the present case, it was clear that an evaluation could and should have been given.  The striking fact about the present case is that the DNA of the appellant Terence Reed was present on AC/3 and that of David Reed was present on AC/4; there is sufficient in the scientific research for a view to be expressed on the circumstances in which there can be secondary transfer.  An expert could therefore give admissible evidence evaluating the possibilities to which we have referred at paragraph 89 by reference to the known mechanisms of primary and secondary transfer, the observations at the scene of the crime and the other agreed facts.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Valerie Tomlinson was an impressive witness.  She had no preconceptions as to what she would find at the scene.  She made a very careful evaluation of the electrophoretograms; they were in fact of high quality, as the test conducted in October 2009 proved.  She was entitled to use her undoubted and extensive experience and the research set out in the papers to which we referred in paragraph 60 to evaluate the possibilities.  We are satisfied that Valerie Tomlinson’s evidence was put forward in such a way to make clear that she was expressing her evaluation of probabilities and that this part of her evidence was to be viewed in marked contradistinction to her evidence in relation to the match probability, where there was no issue as to the scientific certainty of her conclusion.  In short, the evaluative evidence was not given the verisimilitude of scientific certainty in the way her evidence was given. Her evidence was admissible.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We would add one qualification.  Although we accept that Valerie Tomlinson could properly give admissible evidence evaluating the alternative mechanisms of primary and secondary transfer, we do not consider that she could give admissible evidence that expressed an opinion that the appellants were handling the knives when they broke. This was not one of the possibilities which could properly be enumerated, as there was no reliable scientific basis for her to be able to express a view on the use the appellants made of the knives as opposed to the circumstances of transfer of their DNA. Her opinion on this had no underlying scientific basis and therefore went beyond the scope of the evidence an expert could be permitted to give. However, as we have made clear, she was entitled to express the view that the most likely explanation for the DNA of the appellants being on AC/3 and AC/4 was that they had brought them to the scene.  That view was the logical conclusion from her evaluation of the other possibilities - secondary transfer was unrealistic and primary transfer to each of the knives which had then been brought by another to the scene was highly unlikely.  As the bringing of the knives to the scene was the vital part of her evidence, we do not consider that the impermissible gloss she added would have affected the jury’s conclusion.  Furthermore, no objection was made to that gloss, as, in accordance with the principles we have set out, it should have been. There is a clear procedure to identify such evidence and exclude it as inadmissible, as we set out in the following paragraphs.</p>

First, we agree with the views of Professor Caddy (to which we referred at paragraph 73) as to the importance of Rule 33.3(1) in providing a very important safeguard.  This requires at sub-paragraphs (f) and (g) each expert to identify where there is a range of opinion on the matters dealt with in his report.  In such a case, the expert must summarise the scope of opinion and give reasons for his own opinion.  If the expert cannot give his opinion without qualification, he must state the qualification.  Compliance with this obligation will identify for the other party an area where there is a range of opinion; it is particularly important that this rule is followed in the expert report obtained by the Crown.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, the Rule enables clear identification of what is in issue before the trial begins. Under Rule 33.6(2) the court has power to direct experts to discuss expert issues in the proceedings and prepare a statement for the court of the matters on which they agree and disagree giving their reasons.  If an expert does not comply with this, that party may not call the expert to give evidence without the permission of the court (Rule 33.6(4)).  The court has further extensive power under Part 3 to which recourse can be had as necessary.</p>

For reasons we explain at paragraphs 140-143 below, we decline to admit their evidence under s.23 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. If we had accepted their evidence and admitted it, then the logical consequence would have been that Valerie Tomlinson’s evidence on evaluation of the possibilities was inadmissible.  As Mr Hill QC accepted on behalf of David Reed, if there was to be a challenge to the evidence of Valerie Tomlinson on the basis that some of her evidence went beyond that which an expert could properly give, then the proper course would have been to apply to exclude that part of the evidence of Valerie Tomlinson.  As that did not happen and as we have declined to admit the evidence of Dr Budowle and Professor Jamieson, the issue raised by the appellants under s.78(4) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (as summarised at paragraph 97 above) does not arise.</p>

He considered that it probable that neither of the knives used had fractured in the course of the attack and that they were probably not even used in the attack, because in order to fracture they had to bend and the pathology evidence was that there was nothing about the wounds that suggested that they had bent.

As the appeal developed, the aspects relating to Low Template DNA fell away and the issue was one relating to the scope of evidence that could be given about transferability.  The scientific literature to which we referred at paragraph 60 was available at the time of the trial and the issues well understood.  The fact that the profile was obtained by the LCN process was irrelevant to this issue, as was the report of Professor Caddy which dealt with quantities less than 200 picograms.  The evidence of Professor Jamieson and Dr Budowle was not dependent on the quantity of the cellular material, but on the fact that it was not identifiable.  That fact was always known.  There was no reason for the failure to adduce it, save for the obvious inference that those experts instructed at the time on behalf of the appellants rightly considered that no challenge could be made to the essential part of the evaluative evidence being given.</p>

We have determined that her evidence was admissible.  A decision was made at trial not to call the experts who were then advising the appellants to challenge the evidence put forward by Valerie Tomlinson.  As the challenge to the admissibility of her evidence has failed, the decision not to call that evidence cannot be revisited, as was implicitly accepted by Mr Hill QC for both appellants. It is not therefore in the interests of justice now to admit evidence of Dr Budowle and Professor Jamieson simply on the basis that, if it had been called, it might have affected the decision of the jury.</p>

In relation to Judith Hunt he initially did so in terms which are accepted to be impeccable, and which in our judgment were in no way undermined by what followed later.  We do not accept that anything he said could be said to invite speculation adverse to the defence case.  It is unfortunate that the judge’s later remarks were based on a mistaken understanding as to whether Judith Hunt had given a statement to the police.  However, the judge corrected the error in an appropriate manner, and we see no basis for thinking that the jury ignored his direction not to speculate.  It was not in the circumstances of this case necessary for the judge to repeat what he had already said about the burden of proof, or to spell out again what must already have been abundantly plain to the jury in this regard.  The criticism of the judge for adding to the evidence is unsustainable when counsel did not at the time object to his stated intention to tell the jury that the police had taken a statement from Judith Hunt: their silence can only be taken as assent to the course which the judge had indicated, and in the circumstances of this case there was no irregularity in correcting, by agreement, what was agreed to have been an error.  </p>

Initially the judge simply said that since Cairns had not been called as a witness “you don’t know whether he would have supported Terry’s version of events up to then but you also do not know why he has not been called to give evidence and therefore you have simply got to leave it at that”.   In the absence of the jury, counsel submitted that the judge should add to that direction (which was not otherwise criticised) words to the effect, “You don’t know whether he would have supported or contradicted the prosecution case”.  He submitted that it was a question of balance.  The judge responded that he did not think there was any lack of balance in what he had said, and declined to say any more on the topic.</p>

In relation to a single syllable utterance nine seconds into the tape, Mr Harrison gave evidence that he was as sure as he could be that it was a product of the human vocal cords, though he could not say what it might be.  In relation to certain noises on the recording which sounded like breathing, Mr Harrison said in terms that they were electronic interference and not a human voice.  In relation to different noises heard about 2 minutes 30 seconds into the recording, however, his preferred interpretation was that it was a human voice moaning and groaning, although he could not rule out either an electronic noise or a human humming along with the music or breathing heavily on exertion.

It is always for the jury to decide the facts in the light of the evidence as a whole.  Whilst they must of course pay due regard to the expertise of an expert witness, they are neither obliged to agree with him, nor obliged to share doubts or reservations expressed by him.  The judge rightly directed the jury to that effect.  In the circumstances of this case the jury were entitled to be sure that the fatal attack was carried out by the appellants between the 2047 sighting at the Talbot public house and the 2100 voicemail to Atkinson’s phone.  A particular feature of the evidence which was highly relevant in this regard, bearing in mind that the body of Peter Hoe was not found until the following day, was that Peter Hoe’s 2 mobile phones were not used to make or answer any call after the voicemail left on Atkinson’s phone at 2100.  </p>

Firstly, Mr Harrison himself had referred in his evidence to the possibility that the DVD had been paused and then restarted, so the judge was doing no more than reminding the jury accurately of that part of the evidence and making clear that he was not suggesting that such pausing had in fact occurred.

The defence case was that the jury should accept the cell siting of that call as supporting the appellant’s evidence that he was at his home by that time.  That was a fair point.

The judge accepted the submission, and went on to say to the jury that “there could be a difference between Terry Reed knowing that the police could interrogate his mobile to find out where it was at a particular time, which Terry Reed did admit knowing they could do at the time when his defence case statement was made, and whether Terry Reed knew that the police could find out just from having his mobile number rather than having his mobile phone where his mobile was at a particular time, and that was not something which he was asked about”.  </p>

In any event, it seems to us at best a peripheral point which added nothing to the defence case, and cannot affect the safety of the conviction.  If the evidence as a whole made the jury sure of guilt (as it plainly did), evidence that the appellant was at or near his own home by 2114 could not help him.

There was evidence that on the following evening he purchased a new red Adidas hooded top from a sportswear shop.  The prosecution case was that the top he had been wearing at the time of the murder would have become stained with the blood of Peter Hoe, and that he had therefore disposed of it but had quickly bought an identical replacement so that he would not have to explain what had become of the first one.  The defence case was that the appellant was not involved in the murder and therefore had no need to dispose of the first top, and that he often bought sportswear similar to items which he already owned.</p>

His defence was fully and fairly put before the jury in the summing up, and nothing the judge said to the jury was wrong in law, or unfairly prejudicial to the defence, or otherwise undermined the safety of the conviction.  The same is true of the case against David Reed, and the summing up in relation to his defence.</p>

They expressed concerns about whether match probabilities derived from minor profiles can be relied upon at all.  It was also Professor Balding’s opinion that it is not safe simply to ignore missing alleles and that these may have a significant effect on match probabilities.  Dr Short was concerned the evidence did not establish the DNA came from Garmson, nor the number of sources from which it had come.  She expressed particular concern as to the source of the DNA derived from KM’s tampon string and considered it possible that it was not derived from the offender but rather from an old semen stain found on the car seat and that it diffused up and onto the tampon string, as she drove the car whilst naked from the waist down.  This stain yielded a DNA profile which matched that of JB.  Importantly, Dr Short did, however, accept the DNA evidence showed that Garmson was one of the men who might have committed the offences.  Subject always to her general concerns, she also accepted the calculation of the 1 in 120 match probability in relation to KM’s tampon string and the 1 in 2,500 match probability in relation to her lower lip swab.</p>

As we have set out at paragraphs 180 and 182, if these are discounted then the match probability in relation to the DNA derived from the tampon string increases from 1 in 120 to 1 in 9, and the match probability in relation to the DNA derived from the lower lip swab increases from 1 in 2,500 to 1 in 77.</p>

Indeed Dr Short agreed with his calculations, subject of course to her general concerns to which we have referred at paragraph 191.  The likely reason became apparent as Professor Jamieson was cross examined and can be illustrated by his evidence in relation to the sample derived from the tampon string.  As set out at paragraph 180 above, the three foreign alleles common to the reference profile of JB were 18 at D2, 13 at D18 and 21 at FGA.  Each of these is of a relatively high molecular weight and hence particularly susceptible to degradation.  If an allele has degraded then it will not be revealed in the DNA profile.  So, as Professor Jamieson accepted, the alleles of relatively high molecular weight tend to be lost first.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The significance of this becomes clear by consideration of the low molecular weight alleles such as those at loci D3, VWA, D8 and D19.  On the assumption that JB contributed the high molecular weight foreign alleles to the minor profile derived from the tampon string, then it may reasonably be supposed that he also contributed low molecular weight foreign alleles, these being less likely to have degraded.  The profile of JB reveals the presence of some alleles at loci D3, VWA, D8 and D19 which are different from any of those seen in the profiles of KM and Garmson.  Yet none of these is apparent in the mixed profile derived from the tampon string.  The natural inference is that the DNA in the minor profile is not derived from JB at all.  As Professor Jamieson accepted in cross examination, the obvious conclusion is that the minor profile is derived from one single source – and, if so, that source cannot have been JB.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Professor Jamieson’s second concern was that in relation to all four samples, there was nothing to indicate the foreign alleles were derived from more than one person (indeed he thought that was the most obvious explanation) and, if so, that person cannot have been Garmson.  He elaborated this primarily by reference to the mixed profiles derived from the outside waistband of KM’s trousers and the saliva stain on the inside front of her knickers.  He emphasised that the former required an explanation for the presence of foreign allele 8 at D8, and that since this cannot have come from Garmson or JB, it was necessary to postulate yet another person, who is unknown.  As for the latter, neither Garmson nor JB could have provided <span style="font-style:italic">all</span> the foreign alleles.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In our judgement this was evidence which both Dr Short and Professor Balding could have given at trial.  Indeed, in her statement of 26 September 2006, Dr Short expressly noted in relation to the sample recovered from KM’s trousers that of the six foreign alleles, JB had three in his profile, Garmson had four (they shared two in common) and one of the alleles was not present in either profile and so represented DNA from someone else.  An explanation, she continued, was that all of the foreign DNA had come from one source, that source being someone other than Garmson.  She did not give evidence of this particular aspect of her statement when she gave evidence at the trial, but she did explain that such low levels of DNA are very difficult to interpret, that it was very difficult to say how many people might have contributed to the foreign DNA and, indeed, that it was not possible to say whether it had come from more than one person.  She did not, however, comment specifically on the evidence Mr Harrington gave in relation to the DNA recovered from the trouser waistband, the presence of the foreign allele 8 at D8 and the potential for DNA found at this location to have come from different sources.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We are satisfied that in the summing up the judge properly directed the jury on all the issues relating to DNA.  Indeed we would wish to pay tribute to the way in which the complex issues were put before the jury by the judge.  After summarising the basic science of DNA, the elements of the process of profiling and the concepts of match probability and partial profiles, he summarised the substance of Mr Harrington’s evidence to the jury.  He pointed out that the DNA recovered from the lower lip and tampon string were the two items upon which Mr Harrington felt it safe to rely and which provided some assistance by way of match probability.  He summarised the concerns of Dr Short as to the source of the DNA derived from the tampon string.  He specifically reminded the jury of her evidence that the match probabilities would be rendered invalid if the foreign alleles had not all come from the same person.  But on the assumption they did, she agreed with the calculations presented by Mr Harrington.  As for Professor Balding, the judge explained his essential criticism that the prosecution had treated the missing alleles as neutral and this, the Professor considered, was not justifiable, at least not in all cases.</p>

Nothing said by Professor Jamieson in the course of his evidence on the question of match probability gives us any reason to doubt the safety of the conviction.  His only criticism of the match probabilities presented by the prosecution melted away in the course of his cross examination, as we have set out above.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We can address the first criticism quite shortly.  It relates to the DNA samples derived from the saliva on the inside front of KM’s knickers and the outside of her trousers’ waistband.  In the case of both, the judge explained to the jury that Mr Harrington did not consider it appropriate to calculate a match probability.  In the case of the DNA derived from the knickers, this was hardly surprising since only four foreign alleles were identified and only two of these matched the profile of Garmson.  The importance of this result was not that it suggested Garmson <span style="font-style:italic">was</span> the offender but rather that it indicated he could not be <span style="font-style:italic">excluded</span>. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Much the same applies to the DNA derived from the waistband.  In this case Mr Harrington did not consider it appropriate to attribute a match probability to the common alleles because, as the judge reminded the jury, trace amounts of DNA from unknown sources were to be expected given the location of the DNA on the outside of the trousers and the sensitivity of the LCN process.  In these circumstances, the possibility of secondary transfer was clearly a very real one.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly we reject the first criticism.  The judge fairly directed the jury as to the significance of the match between Garmson’s profile and the foreign alleles found in the DNA profiles derived from KM’s knickers and trouser waistband and they were left in no doubt that the reason Mr Harrington had not calculated a match probability was because he could not assess the significance of the match beyond the conclusion that it did not <span style="font-style:italic">exclude</span> Garmson.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second criticism is that the judge failed adequately to direct the jury in relation to an alleged inconsistency in the approach adopted by the prosecution to, on the one hand, the DNA samples derived from the tampon string and the lip swab and, on the other hand, those derived from the knickers and trouser waistband.  The submission was developed as follows.  Mr Harrington approached the former on the basis that all the foreign alleles came from one person, and hence his calculation of the match probabilities to which we have referred.  By contrast, Mr Harrington approached the latter on the basis that the foreign alleles may have come from more than one person.  If he had adopted a consistent approach to both, and accepted there was nothing to indicate <span style="font-style:italic">all</span> the foreign alleles in <span style="font-style:italic">all</span> the samples had not come from one person, then he would have been driven to accept that Garmson cannot have been that person.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In considering this submission we have had well in mind the evidence at trial.  We have also had regard to the evidence given before us by Professor Jamieson.  As we have explained, Mr Harrington was not effectively challenged as to his approach to the foreign alleles identified in the DNA samples derived from KM’s tampon string and lower lip swab, nor as to his approach to the foreign alleles identified in the DNA samples derived from KM’s knickers and trouser waistband.  Moreover his evidence expressly included an explanation as to why the DNA derived from the waistband might have come from multiple sources.  Dr Short’s concerns were more general and she considered it was not possible to say how many sources any of the samples had come from.  But she clearly accepted that all of the foreign alleles might have come from Garmson.  There was nothing in any of the results to exclude him.       </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.02in">“The important thing is this.  No-one suggests that this evidence on its own conclusively proves the guilt of the defendant on any count or goes anywhere near doing that.  If all you had was the DNA evidence you could not begin to find Mr Garmson guilty on any of these counts because all the DNA evidence does (at the most) is show that he is one of the men who may have committed these offences and that is perhaps to put it at its highest.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A little later the judge asked the jury to consider whether the evidence showed that all of the DNA in the minor profiles came from one person, this being an assumption the experts had made when talking about match probabilities, and again pointed out that Garmson was one of the persons from whom it could have come.  Now it is true to say he did not expressly say that if the jury considered that every foreign allele in every sample came from one source then it cannot have been Garmson.  But in context we have no doubt the jury must have understood this aspect of the summing up to be directed to the samples from which the match probabilities were derived.            </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">After addressing the concerns of Dr Short and Professor Balding, the judge returned to the overall value of the DNA evidence and explained to the jury that they might consider it fell somewhere in a spectrum.  At the bottom end, none of the DNA evidence eliminated Garmson as a suspect.  At the other end, there was evidence that he was one of hundreds or thousands of men in the UK who might have committed the offences.  The judge then reiterated the approach to be adopted in these terms:</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.02in">“…if the DNA evidence stood alone, you could not convict on it on any count.
