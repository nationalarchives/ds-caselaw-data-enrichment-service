Cassim Koubari, Melvin Smit, and Michael Phillips were all acquitted on that Count.  Rich and Knaggs were acquitted of a similar offence alleged to involve them and others unknown (Count 2), and Hadley was acquitted of five charges of conspiracy to import specified Class A &amp; B drugs seized from a lorry at Dover and from a warehouse in Rotterdam (Counts 3-7).  On Count 1, Knaggs was later sentenced by the trial judge to 20 years’ imprisonment, Hadley to 18 years’ imprisonment, and Rich to 14 years’ imprisonment – in each case less 568 days spent on remand. Anthony Perger, who had pleaded guilty to Count 1 before the trial, was sentenced to 5 years 6 months’ imprisonment – also less 568 days spent on remand.</p>

On 13 November 2012, after a re-trial before the same judge in the Crown Court at Birmingham, Ruiz-Henao (who is now in his late fifties) was convicted on Count 1. He was later sentenced by HHJ Chambers QC to 16 years’ imprisonment, concurrent to a sentence that he was already serving, and a Serious Crime Prevention Order was imposed for a period of 5 years. After eventual extradition from France, Duberley Navaez-Alvarez (“Alvarez”) pleaded guilty to Count 1 and was sentenced to 8 years’ imprisonment.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On behalf of Knaggs, Hadley and Rich (and ultimately adopted on behalf of Ruiz-Henao) it is asserted that the Dutch intercept and slimjim Grounds concern distinct and equally pivotal parts of the Respondent’s case and that the material now available shows, in relation to both alleged methods of communication, that there was, and continues to be, serious non-disclosure by the Respondent of materials relevant to the lawfulness of the way in which the evidence was obtained – which materials were properly disclosable at trial, at least in relation to admissibility and abuse of process issues, and which (in accordance with e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">R (Nunn) v Chief Constable of Suffolk Constabulary </span>[2014] 3 WLR 77) remain disclosable in this appeal.  It is said, by reference to <span style="font-style:italic">R v Alibhai</span> [2004] EWCA Crim 681 at [57], that the failure to disclose itself renders the convictions unsafe, but that the substance of the undisclosed materials would also in turn have enabled the Appellants to bolster their application for specific (but still undisclosed) exculpatory material, which further taints the safety of the convictions.  It is therefore clear that compliance or otherwise by the Respondent with its duty of disclosure is at the heart of this appeal.</p>

However, after the service of further evidence, that Ground was eventually abandoned.  Leave was refused in relation to various other Grounds advanced by Knaggs, Hadley and Rich – including one which was concerned with alleged misconduct by the one-time Officer in the Case from SOCA, Mr Bill Butterworth.  A final Ground, which related to a possible jury irregularity, was the subject of investigations by the CCRC, consequent upon which, ultimately, it was pursued no further.</p>

The sentence that Knaggs was serving, imposed in 2003 after he had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply Class A drugs (mainly cocaine), was one of 16 years’ imprisonment.  The sentence that Ruiz-Henao was serving, imposed in 2005 after he had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply cocaine (which had been imported into the United Kingdom from Colombia via Spain), and to assisting another to retain the proceeds of drug dealing, was one of 17 years’ imprisonment.  He was alleged, in that case, to be the major figure in organising the importations from Colombia.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The respective roles asserted by the prosecution in relation to Count 1 were that Knaggs, using the pseudonym ‘George’, had an organisational role. Ruiz-Henao, who had connections with drug producers in Colombia and was seeking to build up a nest egg because he was due to be released in around May 2012, was responsible for arranging the sourcing of the cocaine in South America.    Hadley, referred to by the pseudonym ‘Mike’, was to provide money and to arrange contacts, including travelling to South America.  Rich, referred to by the pseudonyms ‘Vince’ and ‘Elvis’, was responsible for direct contact with Knaggs, meeting external contacts, attending meetings, and being on the ground in South America – which he visited on three occasions.  Alvarez, a naturalised British citizen of Colombian descent, was referred to by the pseudonym ‘Jose’, and was instructed by Ruiz-Henao to facilitate the sourcing of the drugs in South America – which he travelled to for the purpose.  Perger’s role was to assist with transport and warehousing. His pseudonym was ‘Tony’.  It was alleged that drugs were variously referred to in conversations and messages as “<span style="font-style:italic">oil</span>”, a “<span style="font-style:italic">plastering job</span>”, “<span style="font-style:italic">cigarettes</span>”, a “<span style="font-style:italic">motorbike</span>”, and “<span style="font-style:italic">cars</span>”. </p>

It was not possible for others to ring in to the phones.  Calls to accredited legal representatives were not recorded, all other calls were.  It was part of the process that, in order to get a PIN, a prisoner had to consent in writing to his non-legal calls being recorded.  Prisoners were not allowed to have mobile telephones and SIM cards.  However, there was clear evidence that Knaggs had the use of SIM cards which were used to make and receive calls.

On 29 March 2009, a liaison officer working in the United Kingdom Embassy in The Hague was notified of that information.  It was passed to Ms De Boar, a public prosecutor in Rotterdam, under whose leadership an investigation codenamed Operation ‘Samber’ was thereafter carried out by the Midden Criminonleit Crime Squad of the Regional Crime Investigation Department of the Regional Police of Rotterdam. One of the officers involved was Inspector Branderhorst.  Ms De Boer decided that the deployment of special investigative powers was required and so, it was said, sought and received authorisation from an Examining Magistrate to intercept and record telephone calls made by Metin Cicek and other persons who became known during the Dutch investigation. During its course, it became clear that a brother of Cicek and (via the recovery of the CCTV footage from 14 Alblasstraat and other enquiries) Hadley, were also persons of interest.  On 30 March 2009, the Dutch police raided the warehouse at 14 Alblasstraat and recovered 421.44 kg of amphetamine, 25 kg of heroin and 4.6 kg of cocaine.</p>

Mr Butterworth noted that therefore there should be no impact on Hadley’s role in Operation Dearly, but that that would be reviewed regularly and, if necessary, further meetings would take place to discuss the case. He decided to continue collaborative working with Branderhorst and De Boer in relation to evidence gathering in the UK / Holland regarding the seizure at Dover and Rotterdam.</p>

On 19 April 2009, Koubari and Smit had a recorded PIN telephone conversation – with Koubari explaining that an Englishman was going to come out to meet Smit; instructing Smit not to give any details of transport methods or routes; giving instructions as to three potential dates (17 May, 21 June &amp; 19 July) for a boat sailing; telling Smit that the first delivery was to be 300 / 600 in weight with a price of 3.6 million (with Smit collecting a third prior to delivery); giving Smit the mobile phone number of ‘Vince’ (Rich); and telling him to inform ‘Vince’ that the man in Germany had already been paid.   It was said that ‘Tony’ (Perger) would meet ‘Carlos’ the transport man in Costa Rica, and that ‘they’ were paying 7,000 a unit. Later that day, Smit rang Rich. </p>

In a subsequent PIN recorded call that day, Smit told Koubari that ‘he’ wanted to come to the Netherlands on Wednesday. Koubari indicated that ‘they’ needed transport as ‘they’ used to bring in stuff via Spain but it kept on getting intercepted or went missing – hence they had involved Koubari.  Transport had been arranged for 600 units with ‘the stuff’ going between two industrial compressors.  Smit said that he would be meeting two men on Wednesday – ‘Mike’ (who was in charge of the money) and ‘Vince’ (who was in charge of “<span style="font-style:italic">the other part of the world, the handing over part</span>”).  After 600 units, ‘they’ would do 5,000.</p>

Smit was told to tell ‘them’ that ‘Tony’ (Perger) was the runner and that the container would leave Costa Rica and sail to Long Beach, and then sail on to Hamburg where Koubari’s contact, an inspector, would release the container.  In another such call later that day, Koubari and Smit agreed to tell ‘them’ that the man in Germany had been paid 250,000, that there were other transport costs, and that ‘they’ must pay up 500,000 or the deal was off.</p>

Prior to the meeting, in a PIN recorded call, Koubari spoke with Smit and told him to tell ‘them’ that the 300 units were 7,000 a unit, and would not be delivered until Smit received the 500,000.  There was surveillance of the meeting between Hadley, Rich and Smit and parts of the conversation (which the prosecution alleged related to the importation of cocaine) were overheard – including reference to 1,000 kg; a route that had already been tested; a male called ‘Tony’ (Perger); Hamburg; and “<span style="font-style:italic">You have to make a down payment before you get something</span>”.  Shortly after the meeting, Koubari was in contact with Smit via a recorded PIN telephone call.  Smit reported that the others had refused to pay a deposit, whether of 1/3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> or 500,000, and that they had asserted that both ‘Tony’ and ‘George’ had said that a down payment was not needed.  Koubari confirmed that when the load came into Maasmechelen someone would have to sign for it, that the units would be in 1 kg blocks, and that “<span style="font-style:italic">everything is there in San Jose and it is all ready</span>”.  In the evening of 23 April 2009, whilst Hadley and Rich were on route back to Doncaster, Smit contacted them by phone – after which, in a recorded PIN telephone call, he reported to Koubari that he had told ‘them’ that, without a deposit, the deal was off.  He also said that he had the feeling that ‘they’ did not have the money, and first wanted the money from the cocaine.</p>

On 25 April 2009, there was telephone contact between Rich and Smit and Rich and Perger, after which, in a recorded PIN call, Smit told Koubari that ‘that man’ had called and the deal was on. Koubari said that as soon as ‘it’ arrived in Maasmechelen ‘they’ would have to come over with the dough; that he did not want the ‘Englishmen’ to know how the transport system worked; that it was only 300 units now; and that he wanted to get ‘Carlos’ involved for the second one which would be more.  Koubari said that he had spoken to ‘them’ direct, and that if they did not pay up they could “<span style="font-style:italic">bugger off</span>”.  On 26 April 2009, Hadley and Rich were observed to meet Perger at a public house in Sheffield. Perger reported the meeting to Koubari in a subsequent recorded PIN telephone call – during which he indicated that ‘they’ were expecting him to go on the 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> or 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>.  On 29 April 2009, during a recorded PIN telephone call between Koubari and Smit, Koubari said that the plan was that ‘Tony’ would go to Costa Rica and sort out 300 units and tell ‘them’ when it was delivered.  Koubari also said that ‘they’ owed him about 300,000 Euros and that all he wanted to do was to rip ‘them’ off, but then (when Smit became annoyed) said that he was not being serious, and that ‘they’ wanted the deposit dropped from 500,000 to 200,000.</p>

On 3 May 2009, in PIN recorded calls, Koubari told Smit that ‘they’ were trying to get the money together as they really wanted to do it, and would pay as soon as the goods “<span style="font-style:italic">get there</span>”; that he had asked for “<span style="font-style:italic">one point two</span>”; that he would send ‘Tony’ over next week; that 300 units would come to Germany; and that if ‘they’ did not come up with the money “<span style="font-style:italic">we will have the 300 units in any case</span>”.

They still haven’t got the sizes you want because no one has seen it, they have said that the only way we can give you them is for me and h to fly out to the stuff next week and measure it ourselves! so we will have to do that pal and then just stay there til its done. It’s a fukin joke! They still won’t confirm any figures until the first one is done so we will jus have to wait on that. Ive told them about the third date moving and they seemed fine about that.

At around 5 pm that day Rich was in telephone contact with Alvarez, after which he rang Hadley telling him that he had been in touch with ‘him’, that ‘he’ had heard nothing and that they needed another couple of days.  Hadley complained about the stress of the situation and wasting £100 per night waiting.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the morning of 21 October 2009, Rich was in telephone contact with Alvarez, after which there were several intercepted calls between him and Hadley.  In the first, Rich said that he had just been on the phone with ‘him’.  He and Hadley discussed people being in different time zones and a further delay meaning that Hadley would have to re-book his flight. Hadley also mentioned the “<span style="font-style:italic">kid I’ve got in Pakistan</span>”. In the late afternoon Rich was again in telephone contact with Alvarez, and then rang Hadley. It was said that Rich told Hadley that he had spoken with ‘him’ and said that he was worried about people “<span style="font-style:italic">in the C place</span>” (Colombia) turning their phones off, and that ‘he’ had asked if Rich had spoken to ‘George’.  ‘He’ had said that ‘he’ had spoken to a friend who was in with ‘George’, and that ‘George’ (Knaggs), who thought that Rich and Hadley had brought back $30,000 from South America, wanted Rich to visit him.  That call was cut off, whereupon Hadley rang Rich and they discussed Rich going to see ‘George’; having lost the money because people had been killed; the delay; and worries about why people “<span style="font-style:italic">in the C place</span>” should have their phones turned off.  ‘Jose’ (Alvarez) was mentioned in the context of being someone in contact with others overseas.  Hadley mentioned using a top man in Dubai.  Shortly after 6pm Hadley rang Rich again and told him to get ‘him’ to call Hadley “<span style="font-style:italic">on this number</span>”.  Rich expressed concern about passing the number over the phone, but Hadley said: “<span style="font-style:italic">It’s going to get fucking dumped anyhow</span>”.  Shortly afterwards, Rich was in telephone contact with Alvarez.  At 6.35pm, Hadley received a call from an unknown male using a Dutch number.  They discussed the delay and the fact that Hadley was concerned about his friend in Pakistan (“<span style="font-style:italic">the guy with the paperwork to buy all these things</span>”). However, they agreed that he (Hadley) would stay for a few more days and that the caller would ring him if he knew anything.  Hadley later called Rich and they discussed people ripping off Diego Bahos’s family, and how to deal with ‘George’ (Knaggs) and the $30,000 – with Hadley complaining about Colombians. In subsequent text messages between them, Hadley said: “<span style="font-style:italic">It feels like we have been fucked mate</span>” and Rich said, amongst other things: “<span style="font-style:italic">Oh well pal, lets see what the next few days bring…keep ya chins up</span>”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the first two calls between Rich and Hadley in the morning of 22 October 2009, Rich expressed his reluctance to visit ‘George’ (Knaggs).  They discussed being ripped off and agreed that the amount was a lot for “<span style="font-style:italic">over there</span>” (Colombia).  Rich said that he and Hadley knew exactly where to find the scammers if they travelled back “<span style="font-style:italic">over there</span>”. They also discussed the fact that Rich had told the family that he had a load of money, and that he was interested in buying something over there.  Rich wondered whether something had happened to their associates to make them ditch their phones, or whether possibly someone had been arrested.  Thereafter he rang Alvarez, after which there were further recorded calls between him and Hadley.  Rich told Hadley that he had just spoken to ‘him’, and that he had threatened him.  He also told Hadley that he had decided to visit ‘George’ (Knaggs).  Rich said that he would call someone about the $30,000 before he went to see ‘George’, and would tell ‘George’ that he had not been in touch with Hadley and did not know where he was.  Before visiting Knaggs, Rich was again in telephone contact with Alvarez.  Rich’s visit to Knaggs was covertly recorded.  In the first half of the meeting they talked about the rental of business premises called The Beauty Box.  It was alleged that, thereafter, they talked about a failed cocaine importation (which Knaggs said that he had called off), and about a future agreement to import cocaine (which part of the conversation was the alleged foundation of Count 2).  As to the failed importation, it was alleged that, having expressed various concerns about security, Knaggs had said that he had “<span style="font-style:italic">pulled the fucking plug</span>” and that “<span style="font-style:italic">It’s just gonna cost me a few quid</span>”.  After the visit there were further intercepted calls between Rich and Hadley.  Rich told Hadley about the visit, saying that a prison officer was sat close to them and so they could not speak properly.  He said that ‘George’ would sort everything out with Hadley, and that he had told him that he had not seen Hadley – who said that he thought that ‘George’ was telling different people different things.  Rich said that he had made himself so red hot that he did not want to do anything at the moment.  Nevertheless, he and Hadley discussed wanting to get a call from someone ‘down there’.</p>

Hadley said that “<span style="font-style:italic">Something’s not right”. </span>In a subsequent call Rich told Hadley that he would send him someone’s number so that he (Hadley) could speak to them direct.  Shortly thereafter, Hadley rang Alvarez’s number – introducing himself as ‘Mike’ and referring to Rich as ‘Vince’.  The recipient of the call said that everything was alright and urged Hadley to be patient.  Hadley then texted and called Rich – explaining that the man had said that he was getting a phone call ‘today’.  Just after 9pm, Rich tried to get into telephone contact with Alvarez.  A few minutes later, in a text, he explained to Hadley that he had tried but could not get through; and that he had sent a text but had yet to receive a reply.  Hadley then rang Rich, saying that he was worried that something may have happened to their contact.  They likened their position to waiting to be executed.  Rich said that he would try the contact again or text him.  Hadley said that he would be returning (to England) the following day.  Hadley then sent a text message to Rich asking: “<span style="font-style:italic">Have you got the email address they are using”.  </span>Rich responded in a draft email on the slimjim account: “<a href="http://error/?original=mailto:agroindustrias-internacionales@hotmail.com%20password...decopapa%5Cmurdo2008">

In the result, she had decided that there was enough probable cause to justify the use of special investigative measures against Hadley, Mesut Cicek (the brother of Metin) and other persons of interest.  Accordingly, in accordance with Dutch law, and obtaining the prior approval of a judge when needed, she had authorised wire taps, and the obtaining of historic telecommunication data and data of a hotel booking (relating to Hadley).</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:1.18in;text-indent:-0.68in">(1) <marker name="tab"/>Knaggs’ case on Count 1 was that he had had no intention to import cocaine into this country, rather he had been involved in a scam with Philips, and later with Koubari, to defraud Hadley of money supposedly for the transport of drugs.  His motive for defrauding Hadley was that he had carried out extensive work for Hadley in relation to Hadley’s successful appeal (in 2006 – see below) but had not received any remuneration.  His intention had been to involve Hadley in what appeared to be a drugs operation, but which was in fact a fiction, to try to obtain a cash deposit on the false basis that money was required for transport.  Hence his scheme had involved what, on the face of it, was a plausible plan to import drugs, and any evidence appearing to disclose an agreement to import cocaine was no more than part of that scam.  However, he had only ever spoken to Hadley about transport, not drugs.  He was aware that Hadley was intending to import oil but had played no part in that himself. As to Count 2, his case was that the recording of the conversation with Rich on 22 October 2009 did not demonstrate an agreement to import drugs – at most it was boastful nonsense, rooted in the discovery by Rich and Hadley of the scam, and a desire on his part to mollify Rich.  He accepted that he had lied in interview about the document found in Philips’ cell – saying that he had not wished to admit a connection with a document that related to drugs, and that he had not wished to implicate others. He called witnesses, including a fellow prisoner, Mr Flook, who said that Knaggs had spoken to him about scamming someone.</p>

He did not dispute any of the draft emails and intercepted calls (albeit saying that some calls were missing) but said that they were to do with the oil venture, not drugs. He denied all knowledge of the drugs the subject of Counts 3-7, saying that his involvement with Cicek was in relation to travertine stone.  He denied lying in interview about his visits to Holland and Dubai.  He also alleged that as a result of the overturning, in 2006, of his conviction, in 2004, for conspiracy to supply heroin consequent on disclosure failings in relation to surveillance evidence (see [2006] EWCA Crim 2544), and of Mr Butterworth having been involved in that case, and of Hadley having commenced civil proceedings against a number of those involved including Mr Butterworth, the instant investigation had, in consequence, been biased and improper, as evidenced by various matters including:</p>

Hadley had approached him to assist in the sourcing and importation of vegetable oil.  He had been present at the meeting with Hadley and Smit in Eindhoven on 22 April 2009 but had played no part in it.  There had been no mention of cocaine or any other drug, but he had overheard conversation about transportation, which he had believed to be in relation to the bio fuel scheme.  He had travelled to South America on 3 occasions – the first in 2008 for a wedding; the second when he had been introduced to Alvarez (who Knaggs had introduced to Hadley), and he had been taken to various meetings, at which Alvarez had translated, which he had believed to be about sourcing oil; and the third, with Alvarez and Hadley, when he had been trying to develop a relationship with Alvarez’s niece.  Again, he had understood any discussions to be about oil.  He did not dispute the content of the slimjim draft emails and accepted that he had written some of them – but said that (for the most part) they were messages between Alvarez and Hadley.  As to the Dutch intercept recordings, which he did not dispute, the shipment that was due to arrive in October 2009 was one of oil but was being transported in a container carrying counterfeit cigarettes because Hadley had wished to avoid duty on the oil.  He denied lying about his business arrangements with Hadley and said that in interview he had not been asked about either bio fuel or cigarettes.</p>

He relied, in particular, on what he asserted to be a lack of proof of prior dealings between himself and Alvarez; limited contact with Alvarez during the indictment period (with no telephone contact after 10 April 2009 and no evidence of any contact at all after 7 August 2009); a comment that he had made during the recorded conversation on 21 November 2009 (“<span style="font-style:italic">never to England, it was Belgium or Holland</span>”); and the fact that, during 2009, he had made three applications (which were in evidence) to move prison.  </p>

He had also complained to the Solicitors Regulation Authority (although that complaint was later withdrawn).

However, proposed new counsel attended and made another application under Regulation 16. He advanced similar points to those advanced in the November 2011 application, with additional complaints as to events during the first trial – in particular, that Ruiz-Henao had been told not to give evidence because of issues with his Defence Statement (which had been constructed without his instructions). The proposed new solicitors were Salhan &amp; Co. Ruiz-Henao’s’s trial counsel asserted in response, without breaching privilege, that a lot of what the judge had been told in support of the application was palpable nonsense, but that arrangements had been made for Mr Berman, a senior solicitor at Daniel Berman &amp; Co., to see Ruiz-Henao.</p>

The judge made clear that Ruiz-Henao needed to understand the hard work undertaken on his behalf by his trial lawyers and that there would be a re-trial.  If legal aid was not transferred, the choices would be for the present able team to continue to represent the Applicant, or alternatively it would be likely that the certificate would be discharged, and that he would have to represent himself, which would not be to his advantage.

For the reasons set out above, I am driven to the conclusion that now that his brother has been acquitted, this defendant wants to run a different defence that he thinks would be more likely to find favour with a jury, such as the defence run by Koubari.  It is inconceivable that he was not aware how his case was to be put or that that was done without his instructions.  Whether or not his Defence Statement was signed by him, and it probably was not, is irrelevant.  The real question is whether his case was run on his instructions; it clearly was.  There were many conferences and he was not the sort to sit back and say nothing. He could hear what was going on and appeared fully content.  He had able and experienced solicitors and counsel.  Likewise I do not believe that he was bullied against his will not to give evidence.  The clear inference is that he is seeking to contrive a breakdown with his present solicitors for his own ends.  He needs to understand that if he runs a different case at the re-trial it is likely to be the subject of legitimate comment by the prosecution whatever the Defence Statement said at the first trial or whether it was signed or not and whoever represents him and whether he is unrepresented.”</span>

In my judgement this is a deliberate attempt by a defendant to manipulate the system and engineer a breakdown of his relationship with Daniel Berman &amp; Co. I am not satisfied that there has been an irretrievable breakdown (the assertion that they wanted him to instruct other solicitors of their choosing if they could not act even if correct, is irrelevant to the matters that I have to decide).

The judge was told that a first potential source of funding had come to nothing, but that Ruiz-Henao had been pursuing another source of funding through a Mr Rhodes, a self-employed builder.  Mr Rhodes gave evidence before the judge that he hoped that contracts would be paid which would enable him to be in sufficient funds by 26 October 2012.  He said that he did not know Ruiz-Henao, but that his new partner (whose first name only was given) did.  However, no documents were produced to show that such funding might be available, nor was there any evidence as to the source of the money, nor had any due diligence been begun. Nor, indeed, were Salhan &amp; Co prepared to come on the record in anticipation of the receipt of funds.

Claims of a breakdown in the professional relationship between lawyer and client are frequently made by defendants, and they are often utterly spurious.  If the judge intends to reject an application for change of legal representative, he may well explain to the defendant that the consequences may be that the case will continue without him being represented at public expense.  The simple principle remains that the defendant is not allowed to manipulate the legal aid system and is no more entitled to abuse the process than the prosecution.  If he chooses to terminate his lawyer’s retainer for improper motives, the court is not bound to agree to an application for a change of representation”.</span>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">
	      <span style="font-style:italic">“There is as yet little to express sanction in domestic legislation or domestic legal authority for the appointment of a special advocate or special counsel to represent, as an advocate in PII matters, a defendant in an ordinary criminal trial, as distinct from proceedings of the kind just considered. But novelty is not of itself an objection, and cases will arise in which the appointment of an approved advocate as special counsel is necessary, in the interests of justice, to secure protection of a criminal defendant’s right to a fair trial. Such an appointment does however raise ethical problems, since a lawyer who cannot take full instructions from his client, nor report to his client, who is not responsible to his client and whose relationship with the client lacks the quality of confidence inherent in any ordinary lawyer-client relationship, is acting in a way hitherto unknown to the legal profession. While not insuperable, these problems should not be ignored, since neither the defendant nor the public will be fully aware of what is being done. The appointment is also likely to cause practical problems: of delay, while the special counsel familiarises himself with the detail of what is likely to be a complex case; of expense, since the introduction of an additional, high-quality advocate must add significantly to the cost of the case; and of continuing review, since it will not be easy for a special counsel to assist the court in its continuing duty to review disclosure, unless the special counsel is present throughout or is instructed from time to time when need arises. Defendants facing serious charges frequently have little inclination to co-operate in a process likely to culminate in their conviction, and any new procedure can offer opportunities capable of exploitation to obstruct and delay. None of these problems should deter the court from appointing special counsel where the interests of justice are shown to require it. But the need must be shown. Such an appointment will always be exceptional, never automatic; a course of last and never first resort. It should not be ordered unless and until the trial judge is satisfied that no other course will adequately meet the overriding requirement of fairness to the defendant. In the Republic of Ireland, whose legal system is, in many respects, not unlike that of England and Wales, a principled but pragmatic approach has been adopted to questions of disclosure and it does not appear that provision has been made for the appointment of special counsel: see Director of Public Prosecutions v Special Criminal court [1999] 1 IR 60.”</span>

In many cases, the court, on reading the closed material will be able to reach a view about the propriety of what happened and the safety of the conviction without any need for special counsel.  However, there may be cases where, before deciding whether to grant leave, or on granting leave, the court might consider it necessary in the interests of justice to request that special counsel be appointed.  This might be for a number of possible reasons: the court may consider that help is needed from special counsel to ensure that it has all the material which it ought to have; the court might want to know whether special counsel, having read the grounds of appeal and supporting advice, would wish to present argument in support of any of the grounds of appeal on the basis of material not known to the applicant or the applicant’s ordinary counsel relating to what happened in the closed proceedings.

The Court, in open and closed judgments, concluded, amongst other things, that in ruling on the admissibility of both types of call the judge had wrongly taken into account material that had been put before him in “PII hearings”.  In any event, new material then came to light in consequence of which the Respondent conceded the appeal and a retrial was ordered.  Thereafter the prosecution offered no evidence on the importation charges, and after that Austin was tried for money laundering offences and convicted.  <span style="font-style:italic">Austin No.3</span> (above) was concerned with his appeal against that conviction, on the Ground that the trial judge had wrongly taken the closed judgments in the previous appeals into account (which he had obtained with this Court’s approval but without informing either of the parties) in ruling on an abuse of process application.  In the result the court considered the power of the trial judge and the Court of Appeal to view unused material, and the appointment of special counsel at first instance and on appeal.

Disclosure is concerned with the question of what material should be disclosed to the defence with a view to it being deployed before the tribunal of fact, and it is the everyday experience in criminal proceedings that a judge may be required to examine material that is prima facie disclosable and it might (although only exceptionally) be appropriate for special counsel to be appointed for this purpose.  If the judge ruled against disclosure the judge would put the material out of his mind for the purpose of any subsequent rulings in the case, including any ruling on abuse of process.  All that was well established.  Abuse of process was different because it involved a substantive determination, thus for a judge to determine such an application by reference to material that the defence had not seen created a difficulty. </p>

However it must be an added safeguard for a defendant in an appropriate case, that the assistance of special counsel can be sought…..For our part we associate ourselves with the observations made in Chisholm and need add nothing to them, save perhaps to commend the help given to us by special counsel in this case”.</span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Section 1(4) of RIPA required that where the UK was party to a mutual legal assistance treaty in connection with the interception of communications which required the issue of a warrant or equivalent, the Secretary of State was under a duty to ensure that no request was made by the UK except with lawful authority – defined in s.1(5) as including authorisation under s.3 or s.4 of RIPA or an interception warrant pursuant to s.5(1).  Both the UK and the Netherlands were parties to the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, which requires that any request from a foreign state to intercept telecommunications must include “<span style="font-style:italic">confirmation that a lawful interception order or warrant has been issued in connection with a criminal investigation</span>”. Thus, in order to procure Dutch interception via the Convention the UK authorities would first have to issue an interception warrant under s.5(1)(b) of RIPA, the existence of which would trigger the prohibition in s.17, making the product of the Dutch intercept inadmissible in this country.  However, that does not prevent less formal liaison between police and prosecutors in this country and police and prosecutors abroad, including the provision of information by one to the other.  If the foreign police and prosecutors carry out any intercept during or after such liaison the admissibility of the intercept in this country will depend, as the cases immediately below illustrate, upon the particular facts of the case and consideration of s.78 of PACE.</p>

The statute then in force in this country was the Interception of Communications Act 1985. The Court concluded that admissibility turned on the application of s.78 of PACE, including consideration of the circumstances in which the evidence was obtained.  Equally, the giving in evidence of the Dutch intercepts would not elicit the Secretary of State’s sources of knowledge or the surveillance authorities’ confidential methods of work (which were the public policy issues underlying the prohibition on use of UK intercept by the 1985 Act).  Finally, the court underlined that even if it were to emerge that there was some breach of Dutch law, and it could be said that there was some breach of Article 8, that would not necessarily result in the exclusion of the evidence.</p>

The English prosecuting authorities, via a Letter of Request, sought and, after judicial approval in the other country, obtained the recordings and proposed to put them in evidence.  Approving the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Aujla </span>(above), the House of Lords held that although the proposed use involved an interference with the accused’s article 8 rights no breach had been shown because all had been done in the other country pursuant to statutory authority and subject to judicial supervision; that, after consideration of s.78 of PACE the trial judge had been right to rule in favour of admission; that there was no rule of public policy, independent of statute, that intercept should not be used in a criminal trial; and that, where secrecy was not required in the public interest, it was “<span style="font-style:italic">necessary in a democratic society</span>” within article 8(2) for all relevant and probative evidence including intercept evidence obtained abroad, to be admissible to assist in the apprehension and conviction of criminals and ensure that their trial was fair.</p>

At trial, counsel then appearing for Knaggs had tried to investigate the relationship between SOCA and the Dutch and compliance or otherwise with the law, including the suggestion that the evidence had been procured against the background of the decision to prosecute here, and that there had been no independent Dutch investigation.  That was the allegation that had been pursued for the last 3 ½ years, and a reading of the now disclosed Decisions tended to confirm it.  In the result the court needed assurance from special counsel to ensure that it had all the material that was required.</p>

It was against that background, he explained, that the Decision Records of Mr Butterworth had been served because the Respondent sought to rely on them in relation to the appeal Grounds pursued.

There was no evidence of improperly directed surveillance, quite the opposite, and the material had been served to abate the speculation surrounding the material that had been disclosed.

Yet, Mr Owen submitted, there had still been no specific response touching on the issue of Dutch legality.  In the result, his prime submission was that there should be disclosure and that there was a danger that if the court reviewed the material without the input of special counsel there would be an appearance of unfairness.</p>

When granted access by the Dutch College of Procurators-General to what was supposed to be the Prosecution file he found a file that contained nothing relating to ‘Samber 2’ and a large number of redactions; three months later he had been told that he had been provided with the Police file, which had been redacted by the Prosecution Service, by mistake; he was then offered another opportunity to see the Prosecution file, but there were no documents in it that related to ‘Samber 2’; three months later he was told that that file had been the case file of another person; hence he had never been shown any record of a Dutch decision that no prosecution would be brought against Hadley; and it was said to be “quite remarkable” that nothing that he had been shown contained any record of the intercept product.  There were thus, it was said, “serious irregularities”.  In consequence, on 7 November 2017, Mr Dieben had made a further request to the Police to sort the position out, and the Court was asked to consider an adjournment to enable the product of that request to be considered in due course.</p>

It was, he submitted, not acceptable to proceed where obviously relevant material in relation to disclosure (which was the central issue in the appeal) existed and the Court had seen it and he had not.   The way out of the article 6 problem which this created was, he submitted, for him to view all non PII unused material in relation to the two Grounds, and for special counsel to be appointed to view all related PII material.

There was no breach of the duty of disclosure. The evidence before and at trial was clear, as was the material served or disclosed since – these were Dutch intercepts which were lawfully obtained, and the content of the calls that had been put in evidence had not been disputed by those who had been involved in them.  The points raised by Mr van de Ven had been dealt with in evidence at trial by Inspector Branderhorst. HHJ Inman QC was clearly right, on the material before him, to rule in favour of admissibility (whether legally obtained or not), and there had been no dispute about the content of the proved calls by those involved in them. There was no explanation as to why the new evidence was not obtained and used at trial, and anyway it did not afford any ground for allowing the appeal. </p>

We scrutinised the material solely for the three limited purposes explained above – ultimately concluding that there was nothing to disclose; that there was no material in relation to which special counsel might assist the Appellants or the Court; and that there was no other possibly relevant material with which we had not been provided and special counsel was not required to assist in that regard. The Appellants have not been deprived of any material that would have allowed them properly to pursue admissibility or abuse of process arguments in relation to the Dutch intercept evidence.  Finally, we had no doubt that, as experienced judges, we were well able to put out of our minds anything that might help the Respondent in the material that we had seen during the disclosure exercise, and most emphatically have done so.</p>

For the reasons advanced on behalf of the Respondent, we have no doubt that both judges were entitled to admit the Dutch intercept evidence (and subsequently, in HHJ Inman QC’s case, to rule that there was no abuse of process in relation to it); that, in any event, it was only one part of the case against the Appellants and that even if excluded (whether alone or in combination with the slimjim evidence), and notwithstanding the acquittal of Koubari, Smit and Phillips, the remainder of the case against the Appellants was, as demonstrated above, overwhelming.  </p>

It was therefore in the interests of justice formally to receive the fresh evidence. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In our view there is no proper basis for the suggestion that the Yahoo email evidence adduced at trial was the product of unlawful monitoring or unlawful snapshotting of any sort.  The consistent evidence of the Yahoo witnesses was that the evidence was not the product of such conduct, and the evidence of Ms Chan (Lai) and Mr Dash (upon which the Appellants seek to rely) actually provides a clear explanation of why that was so – both as to autosaves and their timing and the potential for the abiding presence of certain emails on the relevant server. Thus, taken as a whole, the evidence now relied on by the Appellants does not support a conclusion that there was unlawful monitoring of some sort such that the evidence should have been excluded</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The most important witness for the Appellants on this Ground is Mr Abramson. However, in our view, his evidence amounts to no more than speculative opinion without any factual foundation.  No purpose would be served by his cross-examination, and there was no obligation on the Respondent to cross-examine him.  He strays into analysis of the documentary evidence; he has no factual knowledge of events to buttress the views that he expresses; the views that he expresses are no more than speculative opinion; the evidence relied on must be viewed as a whole and aspects of it are contrary to his speculative hypothesis; and it is perfectly justifiable for the Respondent simply to make submissions on relevance and weight – not least as his views are contrary to evidence sought to be relied on by the Appellants as a result of questioning on behalf of Knaggs, albeit that they say that the answers are not to be taken at face value.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ultimately, we have concluded that both judges were entitled to admit the slimjim evidence (with HHJ Inman QC admitting it whether legally obtained or not). Subsequently, HHJ Inman QC was also entitled to reject an abuse of process application that was, in part, concerned with the slimjim evidence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In any event, the slimjim evidence was only part of the evidence relied on by the Respondent against the Appellants and even if excluded (whether alone or in combination with the Dutch intercept evidence), and notwithstanding the acquittal of Koubari, Smit and Phillips, the case against the Appellants, as described above, was overwhelming.</p>

Accordingly, we decline to admit the evidence under s.23 of the 1968 Act, and therefore this Ground also fails. </p>
