	      <span style="font-size:12pt">To explain the background, it is necessary to begin by stepping back in time. In about 2006, as the Metropolitan Police Service (“MPS”) investigation into Ibori progressed, he hired private investigators Risc Management Limited (“Risc”), through solicitors Speechly Bircham (“SB”), as part of his defence team. Gohil was either involved in obtaining this assistance from Risc or, on any view, very soon became aware of Risc’s involvement. Risc employees included a number of former MPS officers; one such – and holding a senior position at Risc - was a Mr Cliff Knuckey (“Knuckey”), previously a MPS Detective Inspector. One MPS officer then engaged on the Ibori investigation was a Detective Constable John McDonald (“JMD”), who looms large in the story. Knuckey and JMD knew each other; before Knuckey’s retirement from the MPS, JMD had worked with him.</span>

First, leading, junior and disclosure counsel were replaced. Secondly, a review was launched in respect of a number of aspects of disclosure in the Ibori series of cases (project “Phoenix”). As we understand it, Phoenix has resulted in the disclosure of nearly 10,000 pages of new material, an exercise, in our judgment, wholly dwarfing the scale of the disclosure task that would have been required had it been properly undertaken in the first place.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">In a nutshell, the central ground sought to be advanced by Gohil on any appeal to this Court (should he be permitted to re-open the final determination against him) is that the Crown’s conduct in Tureen, Augen and Tarbes amounted to a bad faith abuse of the process of this Court, such that the convictions offend against the integrity of the criminal justice system (“the corruption ground”). As the foundation for the application to re-open, it is contended on Gohil’s behalf that the Court of Appeal (on the renewed application for leave to appeal conviction) was materially misled as to the disclosure which existed to support the corruption ground; in this way, Gohil was denied effective consideration of his putative grounds of appeal, especially the corruption ground. Moreover, it is submitted that the prosecution of Gohil for attempting to pervert the course of justice was made on a knowingly false basis, so as to protect the reputation of the MPS, the convictions achieved under Tureen and Augen and to undermine the appeal for which Gohil was seeking leave. With regard to non-disclosure of the material available to support the corruption ground, the submission advanced by Mr Kamlish QC for Gohil, in its final form, was that the Prosecution errors were “egregious” and that one or more of those in the Prosecution camp had acted in bad faith; it was unnecessary for Gohil to say who that was.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">July, 2013, ESW produced a Note on Disclosure of material, reviewed at the DPS, in connection with the Gohil appeal. The Note asserts that the review had been conducted in accordance with the relevant statutory and Guidelines’ requirements. In reviewing the material, it is apparent that counsel adopted what Mr Kinnear characterised as “the context” test (see further below). Thus, the Note says that “…there is no doubt that when seen as a whole there is no material that would in fact support the appeal”. Continuing, the Note states that a reading of the SB attendance notes and e-mails “..show that Badresh Gohil was at the centre of the instructions and involvement of Risc and…controlled the operation of this ‘defence strategy’…”. Nevertheless, the Note goes on to say that “certain documents have been identified for further detailed consideration, since despite what is set out above, when each document is considered individually and out of context, it is possible that individual phrases and the existence of some documents may assist the defence”. Amongst the categories of such documents were e-mails and attendance notes in which Knuckey suggested that he had contact with JMD. In all, 38 items were thus identified, 12 emanating from SB; none were ultimately disclosed, though the Note concluded by advising that some 14 items should be disclosed.</span>

We find it impossible to reconstruct from this material, or the other matters put forward an arguable case of corruption relating to the first trial of the kind Mr Khamisa [i.e., Mr Khamisa QC, then appearing for Gohil] would seek to propound. It would not be permissible inference; it would be complete speculation. It has no support from any evidence of RML itself. On the contrary, subsequent statements by the relevant employee of RML in interview would seem to tend to rebut it; and internal investigations (by the Directorate of Professional Standards) have found no evidence of wrongdoing….. As Miss Wass QC for the Crown recorded in a note of 14 April 2014, that investigation was concluded with no breaches of any Regulations identified or arrests made. There was found ‘no evidence to corroborate any of the intelligence….’. The subsequent investigation has had a like result. More than that, there is simply no evidence that information was being supplied <span style="font-style:italic">from </span>RML <span style="font-style:italic">to </span>the unit; at their highest, the documents now relied upon purport to record the passing of information from the confidential source to RML.

There overall, in our judgment, simply is no sufficient material to justify an argument that the prosecution was so tainted as to amount to an abuse of the process or otherwise that the defence was prejudiced.</p>

For all practical purposes, the present application would simply comprise another application for leave to appeal and appeal (if leave was granted) in the other proceedings later in 2018. That would be wrong in principle. There is a real hurdle to be overcome in seeking to re-open a previous final determination of this Court.

That said, the picture altered dramatically over the course of the hearing. When he first addressed us, Mr Kamlish painted a picture of disputed factual issues, which we could not determine adversely to Gohil without hearing oral evidence, which will or may be before the Court when the other applications come to be considered – and which we had already indicated we would not be entertaining on this occasion. Tellingly, however, by the time of his reply, Mr Kamlish submitted or accepted that the “only real factual dispute” went to “seriousness”: how many of those in the prosecution camp were involved in knowingly misleading the Court (as Mr Kamlish expressed it). Given Mr Kamlish’s further submission that it was unnecessary for Gohil to contend which individual/s had behaved in bad faith or, indeed, as we understood Mr Kamlish, for the Court to make any such more specific findings, the scope for the need to make assumptions in favour of Gohil significantly narrowed.</span>

Instead, he said, the Crown was obliged to make an application for directions from the Court, pursuant to s18 of the RIPA and this they had failed to do. </span>

There was, accordingly, no factual basis for the CACD’s earlier order and, as expressed in the head note “a real injustice would arise if the defendant did not serve the sentence that had been imposed on him”. There was, of course, no possibility of recourse to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (“CCRC”).

We reject the submission. The test for leave to appeal is whether the grounds sought to be advanced are “arguable”. However, the meaning of “arguable” does not extend to contentions which, though capable of being formulated as an argument, are hopeless; in such instances, leave to appeal will not be granted. In this context, grounds of appeal are not “arguable” unless they have (at least) a reasonable or real prospect of succeeding. Insofar as there is a distinction between a “reasonable or real prospect of succeeding” and (the CCRC test) “a real possibility that the conviction would not be upheld”, it is a distinction without any meaningful difference.</span>

In this case, it is plain that the CPS and Counsel were involved from very early in the proceedings; there can be no criticism in that regard. However, on the Crown’s own case as to the admitted disclosure failures, it is apparent that there has been a breakdown in communications, at the least between the MPS on the one hand and the CPS and counsel on the other. Moreover, such communications, to be effective, must be robustly pursued or pressed. By way of examples, difficulties have arisen in this case in connection with the April 2014 Advice and the April 2014 Note which would have been avoided if Counsel had sight of the original source of the intelligence (upon which the Advice was being given) and if Counsel had prevailed as to the retention of the (subsequently deleted) material in the Note.

It is in any event supported by the Note from his leading counsel at the time (Mr Winter QC), which Mr Kamlish placed before us. Mr Winter QC, whilst of the view that the Risc invoice for £5,000 was, by itself, plainly insufficient to establish police corruption, went on to say that “without solid evidence of police impropriety” (which, we observe, the D/L 3 and D/L 6 material did not supply) arguments of that nature “would not sit well” with the defence Gohil was then advancing.</span>

There is, however, no such basis. We agree entirely with and adopt the observations of Davis LJ, at [47] of the July 2014 judgment, together with Davis LJ’s characterisation of the argument as “singularly devoid of merit”. The plea was unequivocal and, as made clear in Mr Winter QC’s post-trial Advice (dated 20</span>
	      <span style="font-size:8pt">th </span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">May, 2011), there was a wealth of evidence pointing towards Gohil’s guilt. Much was then made of the plea, as Davis LJ remarked, including remorse and certain other matters, for the purposes of mitigation. Mr Kamlish accepted that Gohil had authorised the mitigation advanced on his behalf. Having chosen to plead Guilty and thereafter actively sought the benefits of that plea, Gohil cannot now be heard to say (as Mr Kamlish sought to argue) that he continued to believe in his own innocence. On the footing that Gohil was indeed Guilty, as reflected by his plea in respect of the Augen indictment and the mitigation advanced on his own instructions accepting guilt and expressing remorse in respect of both the Tureen and Augen indictments (Mr Winter QC’s Response of 12</span>

We do not minimise the prosecution’s disclosure failures in this case. To the contrary, we take a grave view of them. Considerations of fairness underpin the Crown’s disclosure obligations. As recent events have yet again emphasised, disclosure failures can cause great injustice. That, on the view we have formed, the prosecution’s disclosure failures did not undermine the safety of Gohil’s convictions, is a matter of good fortune. Even so, the disclosure failures here probably (see below) meant that Gohil was exposed to a charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice (on the basis alleged) for significantly longer than he should have been. Additionally and quite apart from any impact on Gohil, the upshot has been a massive, costly exercise, dwarfing (as already remarked) the scale of the disclosure task had it been properly undertaken in the first place.</span>

It suffices to focus on the essence of those failures, arising out of a failure to link the first paragraph of D/L 3 with Source A. Taking a snapshot at the time of the April 2014 Note, the contents of D/L 3 were by then well-known to the entire prosecution team. So too, it was also by then known that the information in question had been supplied to the MPS by HMRC. However, on the Crown’s case the link between that paragraph of D/L 3 and Source A was not known to counsel (SWQC and ESW) or the CPS (in particular, DW and MM who were key personnel) until January 2016. As of April 2014, Counsel appear to have thought that the source of D/L 3 was an anonymous tip-off. That mistaken understanding was reflected in SWQC’s submissions to this Court, (presided over by Laws LJ) on the 15</span><span style="font-size:8pt">th </span><span style="font-size:12pt">April, 2014 (“nothing untoward” had been found at all, as set out above). So too, with SWQC’s submission, recorded by Davis LJ (at</span>[19] of the July 2014 judgment) that the prosecution was aware of “nothing” calling for disclosure. On the basis that the source of the first paragraph of D/L 3 <span style="font-style:italic">was </span>an anonymous tip-off, still more so if the information was planted by Gohil himself, SWQC’s remarks to the Court can be explained (even if erroneous as to disclosure).

There are, it has to be accepted, some puzzles. Thus, there is (as set out above) JD’s manuscript note of July 2013, reacting to Counsel’s “Briefing Note”. There is, too (also set out above), MM’s handwritten note of Source A, in the context of a November 2014 consultation. That said, in April 2014, DW and MM went beyond the position taken by Counsel in calling for the Limonium intelligence to be disclosed – not simply supplied as “voluntary information”. That the CPS and Counsel were in error in giving way to the MPS requirement to make the deletion in the April 2014 Note and that DW and MM did not press the disclosure point is one thing; but the stance they took calling for disclosure tells overwhelmingly against any intention knowingly to mislead the Court. Though the contemporaneous reaction of the CPS to the “revelation” in January 2016 is not as clearcut as that of Counsel, there is nothing in the evidence of those events to support prior CPS knowledge of the link between Source A and the first paragraph of D/L 3 – other than DSW’s account, already described. Albeit, after more reflection than that required when considering the position of Counsel, we are not persuaded that there is any basis for the allegation that the CPS through any of its diverse representatives knowingly intended to mislead the Court. Given the weakness of the allegation as it stands, we are not persuaded that it stands any realistic prospect of success and therefore cannot see a proper foundation for making any assumption in Gohil’s favour in this regard.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Finally, Mr Kamlish’s concluding and “overall submission” is that there may yet be further disclosure and that, accordingly, as we understood it, both this application and the Ibori applications should be put on hold or should be heard together. We reject this submission. First, the existence of further disclosure undermining any conclusions we have reached on this application is wholly speculative. Secondly, there are in any event the most cogent reasons for not hearing this application together with the very different applications of Ibori and others. Those reasons have already been set out and it is unnecessary to repeat them. Thirdly, while it would much be preferred if all disclosure had already been given, the reality in any large case is that there always is a risk of further stray documents coming to light. It is fanciful to suppose that either this application or the Ibori applications should now be put on hold by reason of the small tranche of additional disclosure most recently supplied. Fourthly, the additional disclosure most recently given suggests that the Crown is very much alive to its continuing duty in this regard – and no doubt will remain so. Fifthly, in the event that any further material </span>

We do not have a transcript of the hearing. However, we do have the skeleton arguments lodged with the Court by counsel then acting for Preko and by prosecution counsel. It is apparent from the skeleton arguments that a schedule of unused material was in the hands of those then representing Preko and that disclosure was sought of three particular items. The schedule (the relevant part of which had been served shortly before the re-trial) revealed that the material concerned e-mail contact between JMD and a manager at Goldman Sachs named Sassoon. On behalf of Preko it was argued that this was relevant to an issue in the case, namely the credibility of one of the prosecution witnesses at the trial. The witness, a man named Ford, was also employed by Goldman Sachs. He gave evidence at both trials of a significant meeting with Ibori which took place in February 2001. His account of the meeting was in conflict with the account given by Preko. At the</span> second trial (but not prior to that), Ford said that Sassoon had been present at the meeting. The submission made on behalf of Preko to the Court of Appeal was that the e-mail contact was disclosable on the basis that it may have assisted the defence case and/or undermined the evidence of Ford.</p>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">The prosecution position was that it was Preko who first had suggested that Sassoon might be someone of significance in the case, this suggestion coming in the first trial. The e-mail contact was a result of Preko raising the point. Prior to that the prosecution had not considered Sassoon to be of any relevance to the case. The prosecution had served a schedule identifying the e-mail contact. Although there had been many other disclosure requests in the lead up to the re-trial, no request had been made in relation to the e-mail contact. The prosecution’s position was that Sassoon’s whereabouts were well-known – he had a position at an Oxford college by the time of the re-trial – and the defence could have contacted him had they thought him to be of significance.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">It is clear that the Court of Appeal examined the material. That much is stated in the appellant’s skeleton argument. It is apparent that the Court determined that it was not disclosable material. It played no part in the substantive appeal. Indeed, Sassoon does not appear to have figured at all in the arguments raised in the appeal as it proceeded.</span>

It has been disclosed to those now representing Preko. JMD posed a list of questions to Sassoon. Most of them concerned procedures at Goldman Sachs in relation to money laundering compliance. Sassoon’s answers on those matters are not said to assist the case of Preko. On the face of it they are inimical to Preko’s case at trial. He was also asked when he was employed by Goldman Sachs. His answer was between 1980 and 2000. This corresponded to other evidence called in the case i.e. that he resigned his directorship in November 2000. The potential significance of this was that the meeting which Ford said Sassoon attended was early in 2001. This theoretically was possible since Sassoon’s contract did not terminate until February 2001 but it was unlikely given the cessation of the relationship between Sassoon and Goldman Sachs. This point was made by those representing Preko at trial. Given that Sassoon’s reply to JMD about his employment was the same as the evidence at the trial, it is not clear that it was disclosable. In any event, it added nothing to what already was known. Sassoon also said that he did not remember meeting Ibori. However, he also said that he met hundreds of clients a year and he would not be able to recall the names of accounts. Again, even if nominally</span> disclosable, it added nothing to the case. The only way properly to utilise it would have been to call Sassoon which would have been damaging to Preko’s core case.</p>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">The basis upon which it is argued on behalf of Preko that this is a proper case to give leave for him to re-open his appeal against conviction is the failure of the prosecution to disclose the material obtained by JMD from Sassoon. This is the only basis independent of the case put by Gohil. There is a very obvious difficulty with the proposition. The Court which heard the appeal in 2015 was aware of this material. The prosecution provided the Court with the material so that the court could reach its own judgment as to the disclosure. The Court determined that it was not disclosable. For us now to allow the point to be re-opened would be tantamount to allowing an appeal against the decision of this Court. That would be wholly improper. Fortunately, it is not necessary for us to grapple with the propriety of the course suggested on behalf of Preko. The decision of the Court in 2015 was clearly justified given the content of the material concerned. Even if that material notionally was disclosable, disclosure of it would have made no difference at all to the appeal in 2015 and it would not have affected the course of the trial. This disclosure point is not even barely arguable. It does not begin to satisfy the necessary conditions. If there is anything in it at all – which we are satisfied there is not – it is something for the CCRC to consider.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Preko also relies on what he argues is demonstrable bad faith on the part of the prosecution in the various prosecutions which was so pervasive that it should operate to permit his appeal to be re-opened. He cannot point to any particular feature of his case affected by the bad faith alleged on behalf of Gohil. He simply says that the conduct of the prosecution was so egregious that no conviction arising out of this series of prosecutions should be allowed to stand. Thus, he should be permitted to re-open his appeal in order that the court may put right this injustice. Leaving aside the need to consider some causal link between prosecutorial misconduct and a conviction following trial, Preko’s argument could only succeed if there were such substance in the case mounted by Gohil that the appeal should be re-opened. In view of our conclusions in relation to the case put on behalf of Gohil, Preko’s argument which is parasitic in nature must fail.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">The officer in the case in respect of Preko’s prosecution was JMD. On behalf of Preko it was suggested – albeit very faintly – that the officer’s corruption must have carried over into Preko’s trial. No suggestion was made as to what was done or not done by JMD as a result. As was put by the prosecution when responding to Preko’s application, we were being asked to reach a conclusion favourable to Preko on the basis of unknown unknowns. Put bluntly the submission made on behalf of Preko was completely speculative. It could not form a proper ground of appeal let alone the basis for re- opening an appeal already concluded.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">The final point made on behalf of Preko was that his conviction depended upon the conviction of Ibori. We shall assume for present purposes that this is the case though it does not necessarily follow. It is said that, if Ibori’s convictions are overturned, Preko’s convictions also must fall. Ibori has applied out of time for leave to appeal against his convictions and a hearing will take place later in 2018. The pragmatic and sensible course would be to permit Preko to re-open his appeal so that he may join with Ibori’s application.</span>
