The problems associated with such cases have been examined at some length by this Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Choudhery and Others</span> [2005] EWCA Crim 1788.

Of the instant appeals, the respondent takes the view that the convictions are safe and that the appeals should be dismissed.  There are two exceptions. The respondent concedes the appeals of Nisar Ahmed and Rizwan Ahmed (Operation Pastie) and concedes the appeal of Mohammed Ramzan (Operation Dire). We agree with these concessions and will give our reasons for allowing the appeals later in this judgment. The reasons in these two cases reflect in very substantial measure notes to the Court prepared jointly by counsel for the appellants and the respondent. We are very grateful for those notes.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Although the grounds of appeal are expressed in different ways there is agreement that there are two different, albeit overlapping, routes, which would lead the Court in these cases to quash the convictions. It is agreed that the routes involve the court asking a number of questions. Route 1 was described during the hearing as the <span style="font-style:italic">Pendleton</span> route named after the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Pendleton</span> [2001] UKHL 66; [2002] 1 W.L.R. 72 [2002] 1 Cr App R 34. It applies the <span style="font-style:italic">Pendleton</span> test to determine whether the convictions are safe in the light of the discovery of undisclosed material which ought to have been disclosed or of fresh evidence. (In addition to <span style="font-style:italic">Pendleton</span> see also <span style="font-style:italic">Dial &amp; Anor v. The State (Trinidad and Tobago)</span> [2005] UKPC 4, which discusses <span style="font-style:italic">Pendleton</span>). Route 2 is concerned with what may be called gross prosecutorial misbehaviour and in particular the deliberate misleading of the Court.</p>

They are to be congratulated for the sensible manner in which they have approached an enormous task and they are to be congratulated for the huge amount of work which they have done in order to make the appeals manageable. Each operation had its distinctive core bundles for the purposes of the appeal. In addition to skeleton arguments, counsel produced many invaluable speaking notes, which reduced the amount of time spent on oral argument and which have been of considerable assistance in preparing these judgments. </p>

Overseeing this task fell to Mrs Sarah Rahim, a senior lawyer at RCPO, and it is not an exaggeration to say that in the month leading up to these appeals she worked every hour God sent.

A then presents himself to the DLO and the DLO offers him a reward in exchange for making a controlled and supervised delivery of the heroin. A cannot himself be the supplier because he must play no more than a minor role. The supplier must not know that A is in fact working for HMCE. If the supplier knew that A was working for HMCE then he would know that he was at risk both of being investigated by the ANF and would know that there was a considerable risk that he would not be paid for the goods delivered to the (to be arrested) purchaser. It also follows that the supplier must choose the purchaser and not A. Once the purchasers have been arrested, but not A, and the drugs seized, then the supplier must inevitably know that A has informed upon him.  If he had any doubts at that stage those doubts would vanish when A’s witness statement is served on the defendant purchasers. Since the supplier did not know that A was an informant, the supplier would realise that he was at risk of investigation by the ANF. Additionally the supplier would not have been paid for the drugs unless he can “persuade” someone to pay the debt owed by the now arrested purchaser. It would also follow that A’s life would be at considerable risk in Pakistan.</p>

Given the risk to a PI following the discovery by a genuine seller that he has been double-crossed, even though he uses a different name each time, his later CDs must be approached with caution. On the other hand we were given a fact that does not feature in the <span style="font-style:italic">Choudhery</span> judgment, namely the scale of the trade in heroin originating in Afghanistan. Afghanistan produced 197 metric tonnes of heroin in 1992 rising steadily to 460 tonnes in 2006. 95% of the heroin in the UK comes from Afghan opium. Approximately 25-30 metric tonnes of Afghan heroin are targeted for the UK, of which 20-25% comes direct from Pakistan, as did the heroin in the instant appeals. This means that the quantity of heroin coming into this country directly from Pakistan is substantial. </p>

The role of the Jirga remains shrouded in mystery (at least to us) but the Jirga nonetheless may enable a PI to escape with his life and live to do another genuine CD. On the other hand the involvement of the Jirga may need to be considered carefully when deciding whether a particular CD is a genuine CD. In particular one may need to know whether the PI is telling the truth about what he says happened at a Jirga.   </p>

In at least one of the cases there was a strong probability that the principal had been paid although, it appears, he had not paid the actual supplier of the drugs (Notorious). The supplier/principal who has received payment may be at risk of losing his reputation with importers here, but he may be less interested in obtaining compensation from the PI.</p>

Sabir was, on the prosecution’s case, the link between Aslam and Showers and provided the £11,000 required by Haji before he would make a partial delivery of the heroin. At a time when the proposed transaction was stalling in large measure because of a lack of money, Ahmed was sent to England from Pakistan by Aslam to assist the progress of the transaction.  Ahmed in effect admitted his role but said in interview that he intended to reveal all to C&amp;E. He tried, unsuccessfully, to paint himself as in a like position to Haji.

It was not alleged that the appellants were involved in a conspiracy to import, for example, gold or clothes which turned out to be heroin. They accepted that heroin had been imported. The defence of Showers was that he was no more than an innocent giver and receiver of telephone calls. Sabir’s defence was that he paid over the £11,000 in part payment for a house and not for drugs. Ahmed admitted, to all intents and purposes, his involvement in the conspiracy but said he was involved in order to report it. It is not surprising that the jury convicted all of them. </p>

However, it is clear that the information, which related in any event to what Ahmed had said, was before the jury and no harm was done. Mr Shafi attempted to draw conclusions from the omissions adverse to the respondent. It is now too late to find out why there were omissions - there could be innocent as well as less innocent explanations. Whatever they are, Ahmed’s conviction is not thereby rendered unsafe.  </p>

Whilst accepting that earlier prosecution statements did not reveal as much as they could have revealed and that more was revealed when Mr Leveson asked for more detail, the absence of detail comes no where near gross prosecutorial misbehaviour on the part of the DLOs or others. The security of the PI and the security of other operations may well justify a certain reticence or coyness, provided that there is compliance with the obligation of disclosure in the light of the facts of the case and the defence (if any) being put forward. Complaint is made that the Pakistan Narcotics Control Board (PNCB) was not given as much information as it should have been. Even if true, the failure to give that information comes no where near the kind of gross prosecutorial misbehaviour which might lead to a conviction being quashed.</p>

Mr Ullah contacted the British authorities in Pakistan and arrangements were made to monitor the transhipment of heroin. In February 1992, Mr Ullah was given 5 kilograms of heroin and instructed to take it to Manchester. The “contact” was given as “Azam” who would quote a code number before 3 kilograms of heroin would be handed over to him. Upon receipt of full payment, the remaining 2 kilograms would be released.

He was given two further telephone numbers which were later discovered to be back to back public telephone kiosks on Wilmslow Road. On the 18 March 1992, Mr Ullah finally made contact with “Azam” in a telephone conversation which was recorded. A meeting was arranged for the following day at 65 Edgeworth Drive.</p>

In addition to the video recorded meeting and transfer of heroin, the defendant was observed outside the telephone kiosks on the 18 March and was followed to 65 Edgeworth Drive on the 19 March. The defendant’s home at 88 Parkhill’s Road, Bury, was searched and pieces of paper containing the address of 65 Edgeworth Drive and the code number were discovered.</p>

He was a professional smuggler playing the British authorities who are rightly anxious to detect smuggling operations. However, it was doubted that the offence would ever have been committed by the defendant without the approach from Pakistan and the element of entrapment which Ullah lent himself to.

In 1988 when the person we call Haji was introduced to a DLO, Haji was using the name Bahadur.  There was clearly no obligation to disclose that fact (if remembered) in the light of the admissions and plea. How then, we ask, can it be categorised as gross prosecutorial misbehaviour (whether by misleading the Court or otherwise) to have omitted that detail in the witness statements? It comes no where near the kind of misbehaviour which could lead to the quashing of a conviction. It is said that the witness statements should have gone into much greater detail about Soofi and Amin, the “syndicate” to use Mr Friedman’s description.  Amin and Soofi were, it is said, acting as unregistered, unmonitored PIs. For reasons which we have given elsewhere in this judgment (paragraph 56), the failure to give more detail comes no where near satisfying route 2. Haji was supervised and the fact that Haji used associates to help him (a fact disclosed in the prosecution case papers) does not make this conviction unsafe. </p>

Secondly, it is said that the failure in disclosure was so substantial as to have amounted to serious prosecutorial misconduct. The consequence of keeping potentially relevant matters from the defence was to mislead the Court about the origins of the operation, the relationship between the supplier or suppliers and the informant, their relationship with C&amp;E, and the identification of other potential recipients in Operation Fleur-de-Lys.

It became clear in the course of submissions that, on the particular facts of Fleur-de-Lys, the issues relating to the two routes were substantially overlapping and interdependent, in that the nature and extent of non-disclosure, and the consequent disadvantage to the defence of the appellants which was said to have resulted, formed the basis of the submissions relating to each “route”.</p>

DLOs employed by C&amp;E were alerted to the proposed delivery by the participating informant known as “Haji” (a man familiar from other operations). In late March 1993, Haji had been told by a friend that a man called Ali Shah wanted somebody to take 5 kilos of heroin into the UK. The friend had given Haji a piece of paper, received from Ali Shah, on which three UK telephone numbers had been written. Haji had been told that the recipient in the UK was to be Mohammed Kurshid Khan.</p>

Shah told him he had spoken to Khan and suggested that Haji make contact directly, which Khan had declined, not wishing Haji to be given his number. Khan wanted Haji to phone Shah in Pakistan after his arrival in the UK with the drugs. Haji would then give his UK number to Shah, thereby enabling Khan to contact Haji himself.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It seems that C&amp;E suspected that a delivery of drugs to Yousaf’s address whilst he was in prison serving a sentence would be used to cast doubt on whether Yousaf had genuinely been involved in the importation leading to his conviction. Fearing it would be a set-up, they refused therefore to allow the delivery to go ahead.  It is submitted that a striking feature of this earlier proposed delivery is that the recipient was named as “Kurshid”.  A note in a DLO’s notebook dated 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 1992 says <span style="font-style:italic">“given UK address for Kurshid 87 Devon Street.” </span> A fax of the 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November makes it clear that a man called Kurshid<span style="font-style:italic"> </span> was to have been the recipient in the aborted delivery, and that the informant proposing the delivery was very disappointed with its cancellation.<span style="font-style:italic">  </span>There is no direct evidence that this Kurshid was the appellant Mohammed Kurshid Khan, or that the appellant was the intended object of the earlier operation. But it is submitted that there were grounds to believe that he may have been the same person as the appellant; thus there was all the more reason to disclose details of that operation to the defence. These grounds included not only the similar name, but his age (in his fifties), his previous drugs convictions, and the fact that a subsequent search of relevant telephone numbers revealed the subscriber at the Oldham address to be “Mrs N. Khan”, consistent with her having been the wife of the appellant Khan.</p>

Further, and as a separate complaint, Nowshad, as a supplier in the Fleur-de-Lys operation, was known by C&amp;E to be compromised, not only by his involvement in the previous proposed delivery, but by his close connection with Haji. In further notes of a DLO dated 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> June 1994, Haji was said to be a friend of a “Haji Shamal” who was, in another note of 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> July 1992 said by Haji to be the father of Nowshad, both father and son known by Haji to be “<span style="font-style:italic">big drugs suppliers”.</span></p>

Further, in December 1994, after Khan had absconded to Pakistan and been convicted in his absence, Haji is noted by a DLO as having told him that Khan had instigated a <span style="font-style:italic">jirga  </span>to seek redress for his losses as a result of Fleur-de-Lys.

These included failure to disclose material which indicated that there had been previous intended recipients in the operation, namely a “Mr S Gill” and a Kuwaiti business man; and material which suggested that Haji had failed to produce a recipient in the operation known as “Rainman 2”. Reliance was placed on other material affecting Haji’s credibility, for example: the close similarity between the facts of Fleur-de-Lys, and Operation Pastie, which the respondents have conceded was fatally flawed; and the failure to reveal that a man called Abdul Ghaffor had been present at the handover of the drugs in Pakistan, and that this man to the knowledge of C&amp;E had been involved with Haji in previous operations, acting in effect as an unregistered and unmonitored participating informant.</p>

The other two bags had been surreptitiously separated afterwards from the three said to have been recovered. These facts were deliberately and dishonestly concealed by tampering with the video recording of the transactions at the house. Khan had had possession of the original, unaltered video recording. Having fled to Pakistan, he entrusted it to Nowshad for safe keeping. When asked why it was not produced for the purposes of the present appeal, he did not reply directly, but said that if he was given a large sum of money, he could get it back. In cross-examination he was asked about the identity of alleged suppliers; he agreed that he had spoken to Ali Shah; but then denied it, saying that he had spoken with Nowshad.

The respondent, while accepting that Khan’s case had been put, in the alternative, on the basis that Haji himself was the owner of the drugs, invited the Court to reject this alternative basis, for a number of reasons.

There is no reason at trial, or now, to think that he knew that Haji was a participating informant; or if he did know, that he made Ali Shah aware of that. On either basis, there was good reason to think that he would not have told Ali Shah. Yet more important, argues the respondent, there was nothing reasonably to have put the DLOs on enquiry that any previous activity of Nowshad had any relevance.</p>

The Oldham address was that of a convicted drugs importer or dealer, and the link would have shown Khan as a proposed recipient of heroin – not necessarily the victim of a set-up.

Material of which the DLOs were aware, and which tended to undermine the prosecution case on that point, ought to have been disclosed, including matters relating to Haji’s credibility on the issue. However, the prosecution were not under a duty to conduct an extensive trawl of material relating to past transactions, whether involving Haji or otherwise, to see whether there was anything which might support a possible defence which might be advanced by Khan. Experience of drugs delivery operations shows that the names of many people are mentioned as having some connection with, or as having been in the company of, the principal players in the operation. In the absence of any specific defence advanced by a defendant, it would be unreasonable to  expect the prosecution to explore the history and antecedents of every name mentioned in the course of their investigations, in case some connection was revealed which might be of theoretical use to the defence. </p>

In the event, he was, as we have said, acquitted of the importation charge. We accept however, that if there is substance in the grounds advanced on Khan’s behalf, the fact that he was acquitted of the importation charge should not prevent Ryan from relying on them.</p>

It was only at that stage that it was advanced as a positive case that Haji was involved in setting up Khan by duping him into thinking that the consignment to be delivered was gold, not heroin. This suggestion, in the face of covert video and audio evidence, and all the other facts, can only be described as far-fetched. Shortly after it was made, and before the time came for Khan to give evidence, he absconded to Pakistan. Thus no evidence was given in support of the defence. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It follows that, prior to the cross-examination of Haji, the prosecution could not be criticised for failing to disclose matters which could support Khan’s defence. Should the prosecution reasonably have concluded that the material now relied upon undermined their case? We are not persuaded that they should have done. There was no reason to suppose that Ali Shah was other than genuinely involved as a supplier in the Fleur-de-Lys operation. He is referred to in Haji’s information as recorded by the DLOs. There was support for the existence of Ali Shah as supplier which relies only to a limited extent on Haji; in particular the series of telephone calls involving Haji, Khan, Seehra and the man referred to as Ali Shah. Seehra knew the name Ali Shah, and mentioned it before Haji did. Unless this was an elaborate charade, it points to Ali Shah being a real person, and confirms his involvement as a supplier. We accept Mr Bird’s submissions on this point. In our judgment, on analysis of the whole picture, it is inconceivable that there was an elaborate charade conducted by Haji.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The DLO’s notes quoted above confirm that Haji was telling him that Nowshad was causing him problems: but the tribal <span style="font-style:italic">jirga </span>convened to investigate what had gone wrong with the delivery was apparently concerned about whether Haji was working for C&amp;E, and found “that no blame rested with him”; and further that “there was nothing that Nowshad or Ali Shah could do even if proof were brought”. None of this  was consistent on the face of it with Haji being involved with the suppliers, or with him believing the suppliers to be involved in anything other than a genuine supply to the UK recipient. Nor would it be clear that Nowshad’s role in “making difficulties” for Haji gave rise to material which might undermine the case against Khan. In itself, it would not have led the DLOs to believe that Nowshad was a supplier, still less that as a supplier he was in league with Haji to make mischief for Khan.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Indeed, two aspects of Khan’s case as put at trial, and as supported by his evidence before this court, give the lie to the suggestion that Nowshad rather than Ali Shah was the real supplier, and was intent, with Haji, on “setting up” Khan. The first is Khan’s case, advanced at trial, that Ali Shah, or a man calling himself Ali Shah, was responsible for a proposed supply of gold to him, which led to an attempt to trick him into accepting heroin on the pretence it was gold. This implies an acceptance by Khan of Ali Shah’s existence as a supplier, albeit either a duplicitous one, or a supplier of gold.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second aspect arises from Khan’s evidence before us about the location of his videotape of the covert video surveillance. This assumed considerable significance. Khan asserted that his videotape proves that the videotape shown at trial has been tampered with, in that it would have shown that five rather than three parcels of heroin were handed over. When asked what has happened to it, he said that he had handed it to Nowshad in Pakistan for safe keeping. Khan’s evidence about the videotapes is fanciful. In the course of presenting this part of his case to us, he waived privilege, and disclosed the proofs of evidence taken from him by his solicitors at trial. They speak of three parcels being handed over: there is no mention of five.  The evidence that three were handed over is overwhelming, not only from the evidence of Haji, but also the officers and the forensic scientists. We are quite satisfied that the story about five parcels is a recent fabrication in a dishonest attempt to bolster Khan’s appeal. But the significance of  the story in the context of Nowshad’s role is that it shows that he was a man trusted by Khan and to whom he would turn in a matter of vital importance, having absconded in the course of his trial. That is wholly inconsistent with any notion of Nowshad’s involvement in setting up a bogus delivery with Khan as the innocent victim. It is however wholly consistent with Khan having been in earlier genuine contact with Ali Shah, the supplier; and with Ali Shah and Nowshad having been suspicious, on their own behalf and no doubt on Khan’s, about the role being played by Haji, as shown by Haji’s report of the <span style="font-style:italic">jirga.</span></p>

For reasons already given, we do not think that the DLOs were at fault in failing to disclose the material relating to the earlier delivery. Even after Khan’s cross-examination, the need to research and disclose material relating to Nowshad would not have been apparent. As is now clear from Khan himself, he knew Nowshad well. Had anything concerning Nowshad been of potential benefit to the defence, it would no doubt have been explored at trial – but nothing was said about him at trial.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We conclude on analysis that there is no support to be found for the appeal of either appellant in the material relating to Nowshad, whether under route 1 or route 2. The other points raised are in our judgment relatively less important. We do not consider that the prosecution was at fault in failing to disclose details of  “Rainman 2”. There was nothing in those details which tended to show that Haji was prepared to foist drugs on an unwilling recipient. The material available showed him to be acting as one would expect a genuine participating informant to do, but the operation was aborted for other reasons. The court was in our view not misled about the number of operations in which Haji had participated. As regards the previous intended recipients in Fleur-de-Lys, their existence did not in our view undermine the prosecution case nor assist any foreseeable defence. The comparisons sought to be made with the packaging and purity of the drugs in Operations Pastie and Jacinth respectively do not undermine the prosecution case and are in any event of little or no significance. The failure to disclose the name of Abdul Ghaffor as being a person present when the drugs were handed over is also of no significance. The jury were told by Bragg that one of those present had also been present in the course of Operation Pastie: thus the defence had the benefit of any point that arose relating to Abdul Ghaffor.  On any view, he played no more than a minor, if any, role in Fleur-de-Lys.</p>

Nor is any prosecutorial misconduct established. There is no fresh evidence which affects either issue to the advantage of the appellants. However, by way of footnote, we refer to fresh material which tends to confirm Khan’s guilt. He is named as the supplier in Operation Notorious, after he had absconded to Pakistan. Having sought redress from the <span style="font-style:italic">jirga </span>for his alleged losses arising out of Fleur-de-Lys, he then, according to material we considered in the appeal of Umar Masud, engaged in a drugs delivery conspiracy which bore similarities to Fleur-de-Lys, save that in that case he appears to have involved himself in the supply rather than the receipt of drugs.</p>

The handover of the drugs was, therefore, not observed but Haji later reported that it was Namdar who had handed over the drugs and that the instructions given to Haji were that he was to go to an hotel in the UK and then contact Soofi in Peshawar who would inform Jabbar.  The UK recipient would then contact Haji within three days. The purity of the drugs ranged between 75% and 80%: 3.85kgs of pure heroin by weight.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On his arrival in the United Kingdom Haji was taken to Custom House from where he phoned Soofi.  This conversation, like subsequent telephone calls to and from these premises, was recorded and later transcribed.  Soofi said that the suppliers in Pakistan were angry because of the delay which had occurred in the operation and were accusing Haji and Soofi of having stolen the drugs.  These tensions led to the involvement in Pakistan of a man named Aziz whose role appears to have been similar to that of a mediator who was to ensure that the competing concerns of the people involved were dealt with.  Soofi told Haji that a man named Bashir from Kashmir was involved in the deal and that the recipient in the UK was a man called Pervaz.  Soofi supplied a telephone number for Haji to contact Pervaz but the number given contained the wrong prefix and caused a delay in Haji’s making contact with the recipient.  This number was not corrected until the following day.  Soofi also supplied telephone numbers in Pakistan where he and others – Kurshid and Namdar – could be reached.  Pervaz was the name used by the appellant before he changed his name to Umar Masud.  The final handover of the drugs to the appellant took place in the early hours of 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June in a McDonald’s car park in Wood Green and was conducted by an undercover police officer who used the name “Tariq”.  Between the initial phone call and the handover there were numerous phone calls made from Custom House.  In one call on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> June between Haji and Masud, Masud said he wanted “a sample”.  An initial meeting between Tariq and Masud took place on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> June at the McDonald’s car park.  Conversations which took place in Tariq’s car were taped but conversations outside the car were not.  Tariq claimed that Masud referred to heroin in these untaped conversations but the appellant denied that at trial.  In conversations in the car Masud made references to “20 kilograms”, “5 kilograms” and used other words which could be interpreted as referring to drugs but the words “heroin” and “drugs” were not used.</p>

Tariq asked if Masud was going to check the drugs and Masud replied that he would and asked Tariq to get some.  Tariq then handed to Masud a white plastic canister with a sample of heroin in it which Masud took and handed to his companion Hussein who smoked it.  The prosecution referred to Hussein as a “human drug testing kit”.  A little later a bag apparently containing 5 kilograms of heroin was handed to Masud who put it in his car.  The tape recovered from Tariq’s car records Tariq saying “give him the 5 kilos of heroin”.  Hussein said in evidence on behalf of the prosecution that shortly after the handover, when the police swooped on the car driven by Masud, Masud told Hussein to throw the bag which had been given to him by Tariq out of the window of the car.  Hussein did that.  </p>

The people involved did not trust each other and the intention was, in all probability, that the drugs would be handed over in the United Kingdom more or less simultaneously with a payment of money in Pakistan.  Masud, who had been in Pakistan sometime previously and who had borrowed a significant sum of money from his father in order to purchase something in Pakistan had already paid Kurshid for the drugs. </p>

He had arranged with a friend in Pakistan called Bashir that Bashir would send to him samples of children’s clothing together with approximately £10,000 worth of rupees.  The rupees were to come from Mohammad Kurshid Khan and they were to be used as part of the appellant’s intended money changing business.  All of the conversations he had with Haji, Tariq and the people in Pakistan were concerning the clothing and rupees.  The reference to testing a sample was to checking a 100 rupee note which Tariq was to give him to ensure that the money was genuine. Tariq’s evidence of unrecorded conversations with the appellant about drugs was false and the reference to heroin on the transcript of the conversation in the car was hotly disputed; either the tape had been tampered with or Tariq had used those words when Masud was not in the car.</p>

Before the ex-parte hearing in chambers the defence set out the issues in the case and the matters upon which disclosure was sought; the appellant believed he was engaged in a business venture involving clothing and rupees and he had no knowledge of drugs.  His case was that he had been set up either by those involved in the original supply of the drugs or by Haji either for his own purposes or at the behest of the suppliers.  The appellant had been a police informer and this was floated as a possible motive for the set up.  An application by the defendant to exclude evidence of what was referred to as “entrapment” was flagged up.  The matters about which disclosure was sought included the roles of Haji and Soofi, and any rewards paid to Haji.  The relationship between Haji, Soofi and DLO Barker was a matter which the defence put in issue saying that they would argue that the importation was initially inspired by Haji and C&amp;E.  The credibility of Barker was said to be at stake and the summing up confirms that this matter was raised at trial.  The judge reminded the jury that the defendant’s case was that the DLOs were incompetent and dishonest.</p>

In the context of this appeal, the operation only works as a genuine controlled delivery if Mohammad Kurshid Khan did not realise that Haji was the courier.</p>

He followed me to Pakistan soon over the case”) indicate that it was, as do references in Soofi’s witness statement and in the transcript of the controlled telephone calls relating to the possibility of Mohammad Kurshid Khan and Haji recognising each other if they spoke on the telephone.

It is, therefore, not possible to identify with certainty which matters were advanced at trial as justifying that comment. However, Miss Brander submits that the DLOs knew that Operation Notorious was not a genuine controlled delivery.  In addition to the matters already referred to which go to their knowledge of the background to the operation, Miss Brander points to the content of the original witness statements of Haji and the DLOs.  By the time that each came to make his statement (Haji 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 1995, Barker 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> July 1995 and McElligott 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> September 1995) each knew of the involvement of Mohammad Kurshid Khan in this operation but none of them made any mention of the fact that he was involved.  From an entry in Barker’s notebook for 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 1995 it is clear that the DLOs were aware of Mohammad Kurshid Khan’s involvement and the potential significance of that involvement and their awareness of it is highlighted in telex number 92/95 of 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 1995.  After prosecuting counsel expressed concerns about the role played by Soofi in this operation a statement was obtained from Soofi.  The involvement of Mohammad Kurshid Khan in this operation is disclosed but its full significance is not.  In Soofi’s witness statement made on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 1995 Soofi describes a meeting on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 1995, the presence at the meeting of “a man called Kurshid Khan” and his (Soofi’s) surprise at Kurshid’s presence.

These telephone calls, which Haji presumably knew were being monitored, contained passages which refer to the need for there to be no contact between Khan and Haji lest Khan recognise Haji.  There is also reference to an occasion when they did speak to each other but disguised voices were used and recognition was, it seems, avoided.</p>

However, post trial disclosure has revealed detail of the background of this case of which the defence team at trial were wholly or largely ignorant and which they could not deploy before the jury in support of the defence case that the defendant had been set up.  The material now disclosed is relevant to questions such as: did Mohammad Kurshid Khan use the importation of clothes and rupees by the appellant to set up Haji and in so doing set up the appellant?  Was Haji party to a scheme with Mohammad Kurshid Khan to try to recoup for Khan the money he had lost in Operation Fleur-de-Lys and did that scheme involve setting up the appellant?

If the appellant had wanted to run the defence of duress then one would have expected a request for information about Azam.  It must be remembered that if duress could (unusually) have been run as a defence, it would (one might think) have involved the appellant in calling Saeed and London Azam, if not others.  It seems to us that the appellant’s legal advisers sensibly decided that whatever threat Chaudhry Azam may have issued, duress was not going to succeed.  If they had thought that it might succeed, a request to the prosecution for more information about Azam would have been forthcoming.  Such a request, if not met by the information gathered in June 1994, might have caused the respondent difficulties. That did not happen and there was, in our view, no failure to make proper disclosure on the facts of this case.</p>

If he had genuinely been at arm’s length from Abid/Amir Jan, then Jan would just have lost 4Kg of heroin through Waheed and had his UK customer arrested. It seems unlikely in these circumstances that Jan would have wished to immediately work with him again. But the job that Waheed was then advancing was for the very man whom he had earlier described as working with Jan. This point was obviously not lost on Waheed, because he told the note-taker in October 95 that “Gul and Abid do not know each other so doubts will not reach Gul’s ears.” This is to be compared with the phase I application in respect of the appellant’s operation which clearly describes Jan and Gul as partners – information which had earlier come from Waheed.</p>

It is correct to say that the statement is misleading when it claims that Soofi had ‘had no other dealings with Ali or anyone else regarding this matter’.  He had in fact attended the BHC with Haji on one occasion when Haji was passing information about this case (see for example 22 June).  It is submitted that this omission is not such as undermines the safety of the conviction following a guilty plea.

Soofi reported that he had been approached by a supplier named Fateh to take 4kgs of heroin to England.  Soofi explained that he did not want to give evidence in this case, but that he would introduce another informant, called Haji, to Fateh.  Haji would act as courier and would give evidence at any subsequent trial.</p>

This argument was advanced both in generic terms, as a matter or law, and on the basis that, on the particular facts of this case, it would be unfair to try the appellants, having regard to the way in which the matter was instigated.

What may not have been apparent to the Judge, although clearly known to Bragg, was that “Ali”, under a different name, had been a participant in three out of four of Haji’s previous HMCE controlled deliveries and had been described as Haji’s “partner” in Bragg’s witness statement in Operation Rainman.  The Crown make the point that the defence were in possession of a redacted copy of Bragg’s notebook which showed “Ali” referred to as a CI, and they appeared not to take the point.  However, the Crown accepts that the fact that “Ali” was clearly part of the “partnership” was not disclosed to the defence. The Crown does not accept that Bragg’s evidence was misleading.  The appellants make the point that Bragg’s evidence could have reinforced the misleading impression given by Haji and Soofi in relation to the status of “Ali”.</p>

It is also the case that the Judge had sanctioned the reference to “Ali” rather than to any other name.  In his memo of 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 1994 Ansell explained that he had substituted the pseudonym “Ali” on the redacted documents and went on: “I shall instruct Haji and Soofi to refer to him as Ali as well.”  This may have left the witnesses in a state of some confusion as to what to do when questions about “Ali” were asked.</p>

In the permission application, undisclosed to the parties or the court, he named the UK suspects, but did not name the supplier or provide his telephone number, both matters of which were known to Bragg at the time. The suggestion that the supplier and the PI were knowingly acting in concert with a view to sharing the reward was also not disclosed. PNCB permission was duly granted on 31 January.</p>

During this time Bragg was told by Mark that Nasim had withdrawn from any financial interest in the importation.   These events led to a further application for permission from London to allow the operation to proceed. This time the permission was granted in view of the ‘change of situation’.  So far as London was concerned, the changes appear to have been twofold; firstly that there were greater details in respect of the intended recipient, and secondly, that Nasim Khan was no longer financially involved in the operation.  Furthermore, London believed Mark had not been told of the earlier refusal of the operation and the reasons for it.  In fact, he had been told of the reasons for the refusal of the operation.  London therefore granted permission to proceed on a false basis. </p>

This is not accepted by the respondent, who points out that notes apparently maintained by the officer in the case during the trial, or preparation for the trial, make it plain that Bragg told the prosecution team that he had told Mark that it was OK for Mark to tell Nasim Khan that the importation was a controlled delivery. The appellant responds that if the significance of this had been appreciated by the prosecution team, the trial should not have taken the course that it did, and in particular, as will be seen, Mark’s lies should not have gone unremarked.  The explanation for these anomalies lay at the heart of an intended abuse of process issue raised by the appellant which, in the light of the Crown stance on the appeal generally, the Crown has not considered it necessary to resolve.</p>

The jury was allowed to believe that Nasim Khan was a genuine supplier, believing himself to have been involved in what was intended to be a genuine criminal importation of heroin. In fact for the reasons outlined above, Nasim Khan knew that the operation was a controlled delivery. The jury was left with an entirely false impression as to the instigation of the operation, and the motives of important players in the operation. </p>

The appellant sought to impugn the integrity of Mark and Nasim during the trial. His ability to do that was constrained by non-disclosure. Most obviously the telex sent by Bragg on 28 January 1991, which we have set out above would have assisted the appellant in showing that Mark and Nasim were acting in concert. </p>

The Court is obliged to proceed on the basis that the handwritten note is an accurate summary of the evidence given at trial, and neither party invites us to do anything other than that.  In the course of that cross examination, defence Counsel established in a passage quoted in full below, that Nasim had supplied Mark with heroin in Mark’s earlier controlled delivery operations.  That provided the background to the defence central suggestion, namely that Mark and Nasim were acting together.  It will be seen that Mark denied this.</p>
