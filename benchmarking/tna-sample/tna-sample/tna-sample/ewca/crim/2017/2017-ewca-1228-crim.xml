A violent confrontation took place a short way into Hamilton Road after its junction with the Mall.  It was observed by numerous witnesses; none of these saw knives used.  Bourhane claimed he saw Ferguson and Henry with a knife.  The deceased and Bourhane were both stabbed in the back.  This part of the incident was not captured on CCTV, but the police subsequently found the bottle of wine taken by Grant-Murray discarded in some bushes just off Hamilton Road.</p>

However, when Grant-Murray saw Ferguson and Henry had arrived in the Mall after he had crossed the road in pursuit of the deceased and his brother, he called for their assistance knowing they would be armed, as was their habit, with knives.  All four men were involved in a joint attack on the two brothers.  It was the prosecution case that the persons who stabbed were Ferguson and Henry. </p>

As regards Grant-Murray, his shouting out “you’re fucked now” after the arrival of Henry and Ferguson was powerful evidence that he appreciated that they were armed and would use the knives to kill or cause really serious bodily injury.

This could go to his “no comment” interview and to his comprehension of Ferguson’s intention to use the knife.  Without an awareness of Henry’s autism the jury would not have known how Henry’s mind and brain worked and how it might affect his behaviour, particularly when under stress; common sense inferences would not necessarily be drawn.</p>

The discretion to receive fresh evidence is a wide one focussing on the interests of justice. The considerations listed in <a href="https://login.westlaw.co.uk/maf/wluk/app/document?src=doc&amp;linktype=ref&amp;context=6&amp;crumb-action=replace&amp;docguid=ID4BB16A0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65">subsection (2)(a) to (d)</a> are neither exhaustive nor conclusive, but they require specific attention. The fact that the issue to which the fresh evidence relates was not raised at trial does not automatically preclude its reception. However it is well understood that, save exceptionally, if the defendant is allowed to advance on appeal a defence and/or evidence which could and should have been but were not put before the jury, our trial process would be subverted. Therefore if they were not deployed when they were available to be deployed, or the issues could have been but were not raised at trial, it is clear from the statutory structure, as explained in the authorities, that unless a reasonable and persuasive explanation for one or other of these omissions is offered, it is highly unlikely that the “interests of justice” test will be satisfied.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In determining the interests of justice we have therefore looked particularly at the information provided to Professor Baron-Cohen, his evidence and his reports, the circumstances in which the trial took place and what must have been known to those representing him and the effect such evidence would have had if it had been before the trial court.  We have also taken into account the well-known test in <span style="font-style:italic">Pendleton </span>[2001] 1 WLR 72 namely, whether, if such evidence had been before the jury whether it might reasonably have affected the decision of the jury to convict.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We have no doubt about the expertise and integrity of Professor Baron-Cohen.  However, in assessing his evidence, we have taken account of the fact that he expressed his views without obtaining the full history of Henry, considering it and analysing it for the benefit of the court.  It is in our view insufficient simply to say that the diagnosis of autism is often missed without, in a case such as this, carefully analysing and explaining why over a 10 year period, despite protestation by Dr Halsall to the professionals involved, those who had examined him and worked to try and help Henry had been so wrong.  Furthermore, although Professor Baron-Cohen told us that he had discounted Dr Halsall’s motivation, the information provided to him was limited by the fact that Henry had only lived part of his time with her; the much more significant material was that to be found by a careful and critical examination and detailed analysis of the information relating to the time he had spent with his father, as set out in the extensive history.  Even when Henry had spent time with his mother at Aylesbury in 2009, a report shows he had friends; those friends and a change of location had led to a considerable improvement in his behaviour. This was in contradistinction to his behaviour when he was with the friends and gangs with whom he associated in Ealing when living with his father who provided little, if any, supervision or structure to his life.  Henry was not a person on the materials before us who was of the type described by his mother as socially isolated or as someone who spent time in his room on his own.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally, we have assessed the two ways in which it is said that knowledge of the autism might have had an effect.  It seems to us, having regard to all the evidence, that it can have had no effect on the issue of Henry’s thinking process at the time of the murder in the respects identified by Professor Baron-Cohen.  Henry’s own evidence did not show he had any such difficulty; he explained he went to the aid of a friend and acted as he did to protect his friend and himself.  Even Professor Baron-Cohen accepted, as we have set out at paragraph 51, the autism which the Professor diagnosed “may mean that his decision making during the incident was not optimal”.</p>

Even if he were not a cooperative witness; that was the time at which to call him, not on an appeal.  It was therefore not fresh evidence.  Moreover, there was no statement from Ferguson; it was therefore difficult to understand what ‘fresh’ evidence exists that could be admitted at a new trial.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The prosecution case was that the behaviour of the applicants and their co-accused bore the hallmarks of a gang, calling themselves ‘the Laneheads’, and what they had in mind when they went after the deceased was to take part in or watch a revenge attack for an earlier stabbing of Dykstra.  The gang had a regular meeting place nearby on a cinder path where they kept and replaced weapons for their use whenever the need arose.  Although the jury might not be able to be sure who delivered the fatal stab wound to the deceased, they could be sure that they were separately and together lending themselves to an attack to which they knew a blade or blades would be taken and would be used or there was a real risk that they would be used.</p>

He joined the chase of the deceased because he was told to by a boy on a bicycle whom he would not name but was admitted to be Dykstra.  He followed the deceased into the laundrette.  Dykstra kicked at the backroom door, as did he.  Dykstra eventually kicked through the door and pulled a knife, which he later described as a ‘little machete’, out of his waistband.  He said he left as he did not wish to become involved and that he did not know any of those chasing was armed with a weapon.  He thought the group would chase the deceased, give him a beating and then let him go.  He sprayed the detergent on the floor to make the chasing group slip up and not to hinder the deceased.  The prosecution also relied on the CCTV recording of his behaviour by spraying liquid detergent on the floor, and spreading it around, kicking the door and poking at a letterbox in the door, and the evidence of Sara Overend, the teaching assistant, said the he had a knife and his friend had used it.  He did not give evidence. </p>

In his fourth interview, he said O’Shaughnessy had stabbed the deceased, poking him in the thigh more than once; he picked up the knife that had been thrown down by O’Shaughnessy, to provide cover for him.  In evidence, he said he followed others into the back room in order to watch the fight.  He saw the swordstick, which was pulled from its sheath by O’Shaughnessy, who prodded the deceased to his leg with it.  The deceased went out of the back door to the alleyway.  He followed Dykstra back through the laundrette picking up the sword from the floor, in order to protect O’Shaughnessy.</p>

It was contended that because he was not properly able to participate in the trial in accordance with procedures applicable to persons of his age he had been denied a right to a fair trial.  No application was made by his trial counsel, Stuart Driver QC and Miss L Birkett, for him to sit outside the dock.  Even if no application had been made the judge should have ordered him to sit outside the dock or given reasons for not so ordering.  As he had sat within the dock, he was unable to participate effectively in the trial; he had not given evidence because of the pressure he had been under from his co-accused whilst sitting in the dock.  In support of this ground, an application was made under s.23 of the 1968 Act to admit the fresh evidence of Dr Enys Delmage, a Consultant in Adolescent Forensic Psychiatry at St Andrews Hospital, Northampton.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">"All witnesses, including the defendant and defence witnesses, should be enabled to give the best evidence they can. In relation to young and/or vulnerable people, this may mean departing radically from traditional cross-examination. The form and extent of appropriate cross-examination will vary from case to case. For adult non vulnerable witnesses an advocate will usually put his case so that the witness will have the opportunity of commenting upon it and/or answering it. When the witness is young or otherwise vulnerable, the court may dispense with the normal practice and impose restrictions on the advocate 'putting his case' where there is a risk of a young or otherwise vulnerable witness failing to understand, becoming distressed or acquiescing to leading questions. Where limitations on questioning are necessary and appropriate, they must be clearly defined. The judge has a duty to ensure that they are complied with and should explain them to the jury and the reasons for them. If the advocate fails to comply with the limitations, the judge should give relevant directions to the jury when that occurs and prevent further questioning that does not comply with the ground rules settled upon in advance. Instead of commenting on inconsistencies during cross-examination, following discussion between the judge and the advocates, the advocate or judge may point out important inconsistencies after (instead of during) the witness's evidence. The judge should also remind the jury of these during summing up. The judge should be alert to alleged inconsistencies that are not in fact inconsistent, or are trivial."</p>

The court is required to take every reasonable step to encourage and facilitate the attendance of vulnerable witnesses and their participation in the trial process. To that end, judges are taught, in accordance with the Criminal Practice Directions, that it is best practice to hold hearings in advance of the trial to ensure the smooth running of the trial, to give any special measures directions and to set the ground rules for the treatment of a vulnerable witness. We would expect a ground rules hearing in every case involving a vulnerable witness, save in very exceptional circumstances. If there are any doubts on how to proceed, guidance should be sought from those who have the responsibility for looking after the witness and or an expert.”</p>

Tag questions are defined as making a statement with the addition of a short question inviting confirmation, for example, ‘John didn’t touch you, did he?’ or ‘John didn’t touch you, right?’. Questions of this kind are “powerfully suggestive and linguistically complex”.  This form of question should be avoided with children.  The direct question should be put instead, e.g. ‘Did John touch you?’; ‘How did John touch you?’</p>

Specific questions must be formulated and specifically put.  Some questions will simply be for information that is not apparent from the papers.  In other cases there will be implicit criticism; in such a case there can be no shying away from putting fairly and squarely the implicit criticism of those then acting for the applicant at the trial so that the appellate court has all the information before it when it commences the consideration of the application.

However, he was “only partially able to give evidence in his defence and did not have a good understanding of some possible types of defence such as duress”.  Duress would not have been a defence and in his evidence to us Dr Delmage explained the reference should have been to the defence of loss of control.  He thought that McGill would have struggled in a court setting and that might have affected his fitness to plead; when his evidence on fitness to plead was challenged in cross-examination, he was evasive and did not answer the questions put.  McGill’s lack of understanding was said to be due to his low cognitive functioning and inadequately treated ADHD.  Few attempts were made in the Crown Court to promote his ability to understand and participate in the proceedings.  Little account was taken of his age, level of maturity, intellectual capacity, or his additional difficulties related to his Hyperkinetic Disorder.</p>

The considerations were recorded by Mr Driver QC in a memorandum dated 26 March 2014.  McGill had said in interview to the police that he saw Dykstra produce a knife; he then left the room.  In instructions given to counsel, McGill said that he saw someone grab a knife and tried to stab the deceased in the neck twice, breaking the knife.  On 18 March 2014, he told his counsel that he saw Dykstra punching the deceased.  He said he had lied in interview when he said Dykstra had a knife; he was told of the difficulty that would cause, and said he would stick by what he said in interview.  This third version of events caused counsel to have grave doubts about calling McGill.  Prior to the decision made on 25 March not to give evidence, McGill had for some weeks been telling counsel and his mother he did not want to give evidence.</p>

It is therefore not necessary for us to set out our detailed view on Dr Delmage; it is sufficient to say that his evidence was not evidence to which we could attach any weight, particularly as it was in part based on inaccurate statements made to him by McGill.  Unfortunately, his willingness as an expert to opine on the basis of inaccurate, incomplete and partisan accounts appears to be yet another growing trend before this court.

The intermediary report of Naomi Mason, the intermediary for Corey Hewitt, raised the issue of sitting outside the dock (as we set out at paragraph 170 below).  This was handed to the judge.  Given the number of participants – defendants, lawyers, intermediaries, security staff and lawyers, the courtroom was not large enough to seat each of five defendants in the well of the courtroom with adequate security.  Furthermore, the behaviour of some of the defendants was extremely worrying; given the information supplied about his behaviour which we have summarised at paragraph 155 vii), it is difficult to see how it would have been practical to allow him to sit outside the dock.  We have noted that his remand in local authority accommodation had to be changed to secure accommodation on 6 March 2014 because the judge concluded that he was using social media to either interfere with witnesses directly or get someone else to do so for him.</p>

We do not recognise the complaints made of the judge by Ms Backen.  Far from resisting her ground rules, as she claimed, the judge was wholeheartedly supportive of them.  He had provided copies of the advocate’s toolkit for counsel in advance and could not have done more to emphasise their importance.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Her criticism of the judge for allowing ‘cross examination’ of the applicant to begin at 4 p.m. one afternoon, is misplaced.  It was the applicant’s counsel who asked if he might ask a few general questions in chief of the applicant because that is what the applicant wished.  The judge was initially opposed to the idea.  Ms Backen did not intervene and the judge agreed. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Whenever Ms Backen suggested a break that interfered with the planned timetable of breaks, the judge accepted her advice and that the applicant’s ability to concentrate may vary session from session.  When questioning ran over into a planned break he sought her agreement before continuing at counsel’s request.  When counsel played part of his taped interview to him and she objected to the amount of ‘auditory processing’ at the end of the day, the judge immediately adjourned. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We also note that in the hundreds of questions asked of the applicant, the vast majority were short simple and clear.  When counsel inadvertently slipped into error and failed to adapt their questioning sufficiently, the judge repeatedly supported Ms Backen and endorsed her interventions.  The judge on occasion took the initiative and directed counsel to re-phrase their question for example where defence counsel asked a question in these terms: “Well as a friend or a cousin or a mate or what would you…” The judge interrupted to reminded defence counsel of the ground rules.  However, before the question could be simplified the applicant provided a correct answer.  On another occasion, when counsel for the co-accused Dykstra felt Ms Backen’s intervention was not justified, the judge responded that he was “duty bound” when the intermediary invited him to ask counsel to re-phrase a question to draw it to counsel’s attention. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There were undoubtedly a number of tagged questions (as we have defined them at paragraph 114 above) and some over complex questions.  We accept it would have been preferable had counsel avoided them.  However, we note that of the 150 tagged questions now identified by Ms Backen on the transcript, she deemed it necessary to intervene on relatively few occasions which suggests she did not have the concerns she expresses now at the time.  Defence counsel Mr Fisher QC does not share her concerns.  He decided not to object because he was satisfied the applicant was well able to deal with the questions.  The judge himself was constantly alert to the possibility of a misunderstanding and intervened repeatedly to require counsel to re-phrase their questions.  Counsel then responded appropriately. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In any event, as Ms Backen herself recognised, tagged questions are not inherently an issue.  It depends on the content of the question and its structure.  Many of the questions to which exception is now taken were questions containing two positives and were not therefore complex or difficult to follow, even for an applicant with Corey Hewitt’s problems.  Those that did contain a positive and a negative in the question, in the context of the questioning as a whole, do not seem to have troubled the applicant.  He held his own and stuck to his account.</p>

At paragraph 52 the court concluded that on the particular facts of that case counsel’s cross examination was inappropriate and justified the judge’s interventions, but her questioning contained far more than simply tag questions.  Many were confusing, too long and too complex<span style="font-style:italic">.  </span>This is a very different situation.  The applicant was not confused or prevented from giving his best evidence by the form or structure of the questions asked. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We have borne in mind that there was one occasion when Ms Backen rightly objected to a tagged question from counsel for the co-accused containing a negative and counsel did not appear to accept her intervention, but, counsel’s response to her was not in the terms she remembered.  Furthermore, the judge supported her intervention.  Counsel asked “You will not just agree with anything I say, will you?”; the applicant answered: “No”.  Ms Backen raised her hand and counsel told her “You can raise your hand up all you want I think he understood”.  He did not say: “You can raise your hand all you like, I am just going to carry on” as she claimed.  The judge then directed counsel to avoid tagged questions.  Later in the same counsel’s questioning the judge insisted he stop so that the intermediary’s objection could be heard and again counsel re-phrased the question. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ms Backen’s memory of events is therefore not reliable.  She was not undermined and undervalued and repeatedly over ruled as she thought.  The vast majority of her interventions were upheld and in courteous terms.  Unfortunately, it became apparent to the members of this court during Ms Backen’s evidence before us that, for all her experience, she has become less than objective in her assessment of how she was treated and the applicant questioned.  We note for example her description of her time as intermediary for Corey Hewitt as ‘extremely traumatic’ and she claims she was treated as an ‘enemy of the court’.  There is nothing on the transcript or in any of the material before us that could come close to justifying that description objectively. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We fear that Ms Backen may have misunderstood her role. If so, she may not be the only one to do so. Intermediaries provide a very useful service to the court and to the vulnerable witness or defendant and we are grateful to them for their expertise. However, they are instructed to provide advice and guidance to the judge (and to the advocates), not to dictate to anyone what is to happen. Their role is to provide a report and, if required by the court, to provide assistance to a witness or defendant <span style="font-style:italic">as directed by the judge</span>. They should not interfere with the functions of others unless specifically directed to do so by the judge. It does not follow from the fact that a judge does not adopt every one of their suggestions or uphold every one of their interventions that a witness or defendant has been treated unfairly. Ultimately the burden rests on the trial judge to ensure the effective participation of a vulnerable person, not on the intermediary. </p>

These accept that many factual aspects of the trial procedure remain in dispute, but nevertheless express concern about the failure to provide support to young and vulnerable defendants.  It is argued that this apparent oversight is symptomatic of a wider problem within the criminal justice system of England and Wales that brings us into conflict with obligations under international law.  The judge should take an active role in ensuring compliance with the requirements of the Practice Direction in respect of young persons; in each case, for example, the judge should raise with the advocates the question as to whether a young defendant should sit in the dock, and if it was decided that the young defendant should, short reasons should be given.  This would reinforce compliance with the court’s duty.</p>

They include the provision of intermediaries for defendants when necessary, the extensive training of judges and advocates (a national roll out of the training of advocates is currently underway), the provision of and repeated judicial endorsement of advocacy toolkits for questioning vulnerable witnesses and the holding of ground rules hearings designed to ensure the particular needs of individual witnesses and defendants are met. </p>

It would be difficult to conceive of an advocate being competent to act in a case involving young witnesses or defendants unless the advocate had undertaken specific training.  That consequence should help focus the minds of advocates on undertaking such training, whilst the Regulators engage on the process of making such training compulsory.

(S) 10, the Court of Appeal Criminal Division considered provisions of the 2000 Act requiring the imposition of an automatic sentence of life imprisonment upon adults convicted of a second serious offence, unless there were “exceptional circumstances”.   The automatic life sentence introduced under that Act was for quite different circumstances from the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment for murder. In giving the judgment of the Court, Lord Woolf CJ upheld the provision, but gave guidance as to the way in which “exceptional circumstances” had to be approached in a proportionate manner so as to include a defendant who did not pose a significant risk to the public. </p>

The appellants sought to rely on <span style="font-style:italic">Offen</span> in arguing that a life sentence ought only to be imposed where a defendant posed a significant risk to the public. Several onerous features of life imprisonment were highlighted: (a) those convicted could not know when they would be released; (b) at the end of the tariff term it was for the prisoner to show that he was safe for release, the onus being on him; and (c) even after release the prisoner remained liable to recall for the rest of his days.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">These arguments were rejected. In giving the leading speech, Lord Bingham said that the court should not consider whether the mandatory life term was desirable, but whether it was lawful. The mandatory life sentence was quite different from the automatic life sentence under consideration in <span style="font-style:italic">Offen. </span>The life sentence for murder was only imposed on those who had taken a life, as adults, with the intention of doing so or causing really serious injury, and whose responsibility for their conduct was not found to be diminished. Any discussion about the future risk posed to the public inevitably took place in the context of a person who had been shown to commit violence with fatal consequences to another. The provisions relating to the automatic life sentence in issue in <span style="font-style:italic">Offen</span> were different.  Moreover, the complaints were not of sufficient gravity to engage Articles 3 and 5. They had been sentenced to tariff terms that reflected the judges’ views of the particular facts and circumstances of each case. The process had not been arbitrary. Moreover, it was doubtful that the burden was in truth on the prisoner to persuade the Parole Board to recommend release. It was an administrative process requiring the board to consider all the available material and to form a judgement. Any decision was subject to challenge. Finally, although a prisoner might prefer not to be subject to the threat of indefinite recall, no danger would exist in the absence of any resort to violence. In addition, any such recall would be subject to an independent assessment by the Parole Board.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Bennathan QC emphasised the position of Corey Hewitt; he was 13 at the time of the murder. In his case the fact that he had been convicted of murder did not mean he was either dangerous or likely to pose a risk to the public. The report of Dr Louise Bowers of the Forensic Psychologist Service dated 26 January 2017 showed the significant progress he had made; as a result of that progress in custody, his risk of engaging in future violence that could cause a risk of serious harm was very low.  There were similar considerations in respect of the others.</p>

It was a murder which took place in the context of gang violence in Liverpool, in which the deceased was hunted down, cornered and a knife and a swordstick used on him. It is clear that each of those convicted participated in the fatal attack upon him knowing of the presence of the weapons used to kill him. This is therefore a case where it can properly be inferred that each of the applicants at the time of their conviction posed a significant risk of committing serious violence that would cause serious harm, and that, for the protection of the public, the risk they pose must be reviewed at the conclusion of the minimum term. A period of licence was amply justified on the facts. We therefore reject the factual premise underlying the submissions made.</p>

For example, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child did not explain the basis for their concerns.  It was not clear whether the UN Committee understood the way that the provision of the minimum term and the assessment of release operated in practice. Similarly, the report of the UN Special Rapporteur does not address the fact that the sentence in each case is reflective of the individual circumstances. Nor is the information in respect of the EU States sufficiently clear to enable us to compare the regimes as operated in other States with the sentence of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure.</p>

The terms were proportionate.  The argument that the sentencing of juveniles should be based on individualised assessments ignored that this is precisely what happens under the sentencing regime for detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure. When the sentenced is passed, the minimum term is fixed on the basis of a detailed consideration of the circumstances of the offence and the offender. When the minimum term is reviewed at the end of the minimum term and when the licence conditions are fixed, the individual circumstances of the offender are again considered and the decision made on that basis. The only part of the regime that is not adjustable to the circumstances of the individual is the inability to curtail the life-long nature of two of the licence conditions to which we have referred at paragraph 244. </p>

It is particularly important in an appeal brought so long out of time that the court does not usurp the function of the Secretary of State. Although we see the force of the argument made by Mr Bennathan (based on the report of Dr Bowers and the other reports including the tariff assessment and sentence review reports and the YOT case manager’s reports) that it might be beneficial to Corey Hewitt to remain at Barton Moss and be released from there, that is a matter within the remit of the Secretary of State. He can reduce the minimum term and he can, as Mr Bennathan’s skeleton arguments points out, designate lower conditions of security.  It would not be right for us to interfere with the length of the minimum term to achieve our view of how the Secretary of State should carry out his duties.
