	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">To understand the case, we should set out the acronyms that are routinely used: (ii) primary ticket sellers - “<span style="font-style:italic">PTS</span>”: (ii) primary ticketing websites – “<span style="font-style:italic">PTW</span>”; (iii) secondary ticketing websites – “<span style="font-style:italic">STW</span>”.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The <span style="font-style:italic">modus operandi</span> of such businesses is relatively simple. Organisers of popular sporting and entertainment events (i.e. PTS) routinely impose restrictions on the tickets they sell limiting the number of tickets that any one individual can purchase and prohibiting resale.  They often also make plain that if these restrictions are breached, they reserve the right to cancel the ticket and refuse the ticket holder entry to the event. Some event organisers sell the tickets themselves, but it is common for organisers to use agents to sell the tickets for them.  In particular they use PTW.  As agents the PTW are required to respect the restrictions which their principals (the event organisers) have imposed, and which attach to the tickets sold via their websites. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The object behind the restrictions is to prevent the very activity that the appellants in this case were engaged in, namely the bulk purchase of tickets for an event with a view to resale at a substantial profit, usually amounting to multiples of the ticket face value, on STW to the detriment of consumers both as to price and risk. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Ticket touts circumvent these restrictions by the systematic use of “<span style="font-style:italic">bots</span>” and other software designed to make multiple applications to PTS and PTW when tickets become available.  These systems operate to represent falsely to the ticket vendor that these business purchasers are individual consumers who intend to use the tickets for their personal use.  The bots perform multiple simultaneous applications using false names and addresses and in so doing dupe the vendor into thinking that the sale is a genuine one by a consumer who will respect the restrictions set out in the terms and conditions of sale. This process is known as “<span style="font-style:italic">ticket harvesting</span>”.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Tickets acquired in this manner are then sold on STW invariably at a substantial mark-up on the ticket face value. STW act only as markets or platforms for ticket touts to sell, as principals, the tickets they have acquired.  They do not act as vendors themselves; they are a platform and nothing more.  They are rewarded in a variety of ways and normally take their cut out of the amount paid by the consumer for the ticket before remitting the balance to the tout.  There is some evidence that the cut might be as much as 25% of the ticket price.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The evidence at trial established that touts using relatively inexpensive bots and software, some obtainable from the dark web, could make huge profits from acquiring and reselling tickets. Evidence the prosecution gleaned from the appellants (based on PayPal sales and bank records) suggested that during the indictment period (of 30 months from June 2015 – December 2017) the appellants made an outlay of about £4m on acquiring tickets and obtained returns exceeding £10.8m.  Hunter in his oral evidence during the trial suggested that there were about 120 other businesses such as his.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Evidence before the jury also highlighted the significant practical difficulties confronting event organisers seeking to enforce these contractual resale restrictions.  They are concerned that allowing touts to sell tickets at hyper inflated prices causes them reputational harm but also that it is, simply put, deeply unfair on fans.  Some organisers go to considerable efforts to enforce the restrictions, and do so successfully. It follows that there is a real risk, albeit not a certainty, that a consumer who acquires a ticket on a STW and who presents it to obtain admission to an event will have the ticket cancelled and entry refused. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">One feature of the case is that neither the STW used by the appellants to sell tickets, nor the appellants themselves, ever made clear to consumers the risk attaching to the purchase of a ticket, namely that consumers were acquiring at inflated prices tickets that the event organiser might treat as null and void.  Had this been transparent then it can properly be inferred that purchasers might have been reluctant to spend large sums on tickets that might turn out not to permit entry to the event in question.  This lack of transparency is unlawful. In this connection, Regulations 5 – 6 of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 impose a duty on sellers of tickets not to present information about the existence or main characteristics of a ticket in a way that deceives or is likely to deceive a consumer. The Regulations define, in effect, the main characteristics of a ticket as including the benefits and risks attaching to it.  Regulation 6 imposes a duty not to omit information as to the main characteristics of the tickets that an average consumer needs in order to take an informed decision whether to buy or not.  It is the Prosecution case – which seems to us incontrovertible - that the appellants breached these statutory duties when selling though STW with no warning that the tickets were at risk of cancellation because of the manner in which they had been acquired by the appellants and because of the contractual restrictions attaching to them.  Indeed, it was a deliberate part of their business methodology that they kept this information quiet. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Counsel for the appellants in written submissions has described the issues arising on this appeal as “<span style="font-style:italic">landmark”</span>.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The Prosecution alleges that the appellants set up a business system which was designed to deceive tickets vendors into selling them tickets when, had they known the true identity of the purchaser and their intended use of the tickets, they would have refused to make the sale.  The Prosecution also alleges that in failing to warn consumers buying tickets on STW of the risk of cancellation, they were deceiving those consumers into believing that they were purchasing valid tickets. It was alleged that the central “<span style="font-style:italic">purpose</span>” behind the way in which the appellants carried on their business was dishonest and fraudulent.  The prosecution also charged the appellants with possession or control of articles for use in fraud contrary to Section 6(1) FA 2006, namely the software which was the engine room of the business, and which was central to the appellants ability to “<span style="font-style:italic">harvest</span>” tickets in bulk.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">This was the basic system as the Prosecution described it to the jury.  During the trial an important part of the defence of Hunter was that at least some PTS/PTW were not only aware that the appellants were purchasing tickets in order to sell them in bulk on STW, but actively encouraged such purchases and resale, for example by providing financial incentives to encourage bulk dealing. The appellants’ skeleton for this appeal put the issue in the following way: </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“This case is the landmark case brought by National Trading Standards (NTS) against the directors of BZZ Ltd (formerly Ticket Wiz Ltd) (‘BZZ’) through which it was alleged that the practice of secondary ticket seller (STS) businesses – buying tickets from primary ticket sellers (PTSs) and selling them on secondary ticket websites (STWs) - was fraudulent. The commercial sale of tickets by commercial STSs via the “big four” STWs - Stubhub, Seatwave, GetMeIn! and Viagogo – had been not merely tolerated, but encouraged, for many years, notwithstanding those most PTSs’ tickets were sold with purported restrictions ostensibly limiting the number of tickets that could be bought by one individual or household. Three of the big four were owned by, or operated in partnership with, PTSs. The STWs classified traders like BZZ as “trusted”, and it was acknowledged that they would circumvent the purported restrictions. One STW gave BZZ and other traders a bar code scanner so that they could resell digital tickets with a unique trader-STS-generated barcode. The Prosecution chose to indict “fraudulent purpose” fraudulent trading. It expressly contended that it was not alleging “deception” fraudulent trading and did not need to allege deception. The alleged fraud was predicated on the averment that the Ts and Cs restricting multiple purchases, which purported to govern the sale and use of the tickets, were lawful and effective.”</p>

If the appellants are correct and there are potentially hundreds of other operators all running businesses like theirs; and if they are also correct and there is connivance and collusion between ticket touts and the PTW and STW, then the ticketing market is one which appears to be characterised by a high degree of criminal fraud.  The evidence we have seen certainly suggests this possibility.  This appeal however focuses more narrowly upon the conduct of the appellants as buyers and resellers of tickets, and not on the possibility that fraud is also being perpetrated by others.  It will be for the prosecutorial authorities to consider whether other and broader enforcement action is necessary.</p>

By using this system BZZ and TW deliberately deceived ticket vendors (PTS/PTW) into believing that the purchaser was an ordinary consumer, not a ticket tout.  They set out, using this system, to breach the terms and conditions of the vendor, such as the prohibition on commercial or non-personal use and the restrictions on quantities of tickers permitted to be purchased. It was the Prosecution case that had the appellants been honest about who they were and what they intended to do with the tickets that the vendors would not have sold to them. </p>

It was said that the appellants knew that by virtue of the initial terms and conditions, tickets they resold were at risk of being cancelled and the ticket holders being refused entry to the event. Although it was difficult for genuine event organisers, promotors and venues to enforce the terms and conditions, consumers were nonetheless exposed to the risk that consumers purchasing from BZZ or TW would have their tickets cancelled or be refused entry to the event.  There was evidence before the Court that this was a real and material risk and that some vendors did seek to enforce resale restrictions, successfully. </p>

That listing for sale was in breach of the published terms and conditions of secondary sites which stated that secondary sellers must guarantee that they owned the tickets for sale. On the facts, the Prosecution alleged that there were proven instances where after securing a sale at an inflated price, the appellants would only then try to source the tickets. There was some, albeit limited, evidence of the appellants selling tickets which they were then unable to source.  In such cases the appellants operated upon the assumption that the secondary ticking website had to step in order to supply the purchaser with a ticket or pay compensation. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">9. Event organisers may restrict the resale market for tickets in a number of ways. Firstly, typical terms and conditions on ticket sales will prevent the purchaser reselling the ticket, by stating expressly that a ticket must not be resold. Breaching this term risks the ticket being cancelled if the organiser can identify the vendor or the ticket. How successful this policy is will depend on the effort the organiser is willing to make (including checking identities at the door of the venue). Adele’s management, for example, made a big effort to restrict resales for her recent UK tour by cancelling purchases from duplicate web, IP or postal addresses on tickets they controlled. </p>

Secondly, although event organisers may allow for “returns”, offering to resell purchasers’ tickets to other customers, there will be no guarantee of a sale and there may be an administrative charge. There are risks for the organisers that this will undermine total sales, because they may have other tickets unsold that are inferior to those being returned. This is not, therefore, commonly available. </p>

However, informal resale at ticket face value to an acquaintance may often be overlooked and accepted by event organisers.”</p>

The scale and motive behind their activity is different from individual purchasers selling tickets they can no longer use. They range from so called “bedroom touts” to sophisticated businesses. The secondary ticketing platforms make it easier for brokers to operate and may reward “power sellers” (those who sell tickets in large volumes with better terms, for example, early payment. UK consumer law requires that traders provide consumers with information about their identity, as well as certain other information as discussed in Chapter 2. This is because consumers have rights against traders that extend beyond the secondary ticketing provisions of the CRA e.g. under the CCRs and CPRs). The existence of the platform does not change this, but I found very little evidence of this information being supplied. This is in notable contrast with goods platforms such as Amazon and eBay. This makes it impossible for a consumer to avoid a reseller they have had a bad experience with and who may be offering tickets on a number of different platforms. In my view, the existence of guarantees on the platforms (see below) does not obviate the obligations on “traders” and the platforms should seek to display the details of volume sellers who it is reasonable to presume are acting as “traders” in the consumer law sense.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">It was the Prosecution case that the appellants and their staff used multiple names and identities of persons other than BZZ and TW to purchase tickets that were offered for sale to consumers via the website of primary ticket sellers such as AXS, Eventim and Ticketmaster. They used “<span style="font-style:italic">bots</span>” and other specialist software to enable them to access the websites of some of the primary ticket sellers and harvest tickets. A single bot could use multiple identities to buy a significant number of tickets. The appellants also used an internet browser called Insomniac which could create multiple tabs and mask the user’s IP address. As a result, one person could use different identities to purchase multiple tickets. Although the browser in itself was not illegal, the Prosecution’s case was that the appellants used it to buy tickets in breach of vendor’s terms to the detriment of consumers. As a result, they could then re-sell the tickets at inflated prices on secondary websites such as Viagogo, Seatwave, Stubhub and GetMeIn.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">2.17 A “bot” (derived from the word robot) is a computer programme that automates the process that a human would go through when buying a ticket, completing it much more quickly than a human. A bot can search for tickets, fill in identity details and payment information and select “purchase”. Bots are not just confined to ticketing but they are, for instance, used in online gambling to make instantaneous and rational decisions. In stock market trading, automated technology processes transactions in microseconds relying on algorithmic trading programmes. Here I use the term “bot” to encompass electronic means of rapid purchase more generally, except where it is important to be specific. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">2.18 Those seeking to buy a high volume of tickets for resale can be assisted by the use of bots or botnets which they use to apply for tickets from primary agents. The use of bots and botnets can (in theory at least) allow individuals to acquire large quantities of tickets in a short timeframe, by conducting multiple simultaneous transactions. The Independent Review of Consumer Protection Measures concerning Online Secondary Ticketing Facilities report from the Office of the New York State Attorney General (NYAG) suggests that to conceal large numbers of concurrent connections to a ticketing site, the perpetrator will purchase hundreds or even thousands of proxy IP addresses, with the “bot” then automatically rotating through their store of proxy IP addresses to bypass detection and blocking. The bot user can also register a high volume of email addresses to conceal the fact that a single purchaser is responsible for many concurrent transactions. </p>

TicketingBots, tailored to particular ticketing internet sites are available for sale on the internet. For example, a “bot” that claims to access royalalberthall.com is available from TicketBots for around £530.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">2.21 A “botnet” is a number of connected computers using bots. While there can be justifiable reasons for having a botnet (such as running a computer programme at different sites) and they are not illegal per se, the reality is that the most common uses are perceived as harmful. These include using a “botnet” for a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack on a computer system, causing a loss of service to users and sending massive amounts of bulk email, known as spamming. Computers can be co-opted into a “botnet” and execute malicious software (malware). This malware then installs modules that allow the computer to be commanded and controlled without the owner’s knowledge and become part of a network of infected computers. Hence the compromised machines are referred to as drones or zombies and the malware running on them as bot. A command and control server is then used to connect infected computers together to form a “botnet”.</p>

In relation to the Ed Sheeran concert evidence was given by Stuart Galbraith, producer and co-promotor for Ed Sheeran and Chief Executive Officer for Kilimanjaro Live (a company which organised live concerts). He gave evidence in relation to the Ed Sheeran’s 2018 Stadium tour and described the extensive efforts taken to regulate ticket sales which included the decision that tickets would be sold only to consumers with a strict limit of 4 per person, that no resales would be permitted save by consumers at face value plus fees through the Twickets website, and that any tickets otherwise resold would be void and entry would be refused. He also explained the practical steps taken to enforce such restrictions. Evidence was also given by Stuart Camp, Ed Sheeran’s manager, focusing upon the adverse effect upon fans of having to acquire tickets at inflated prices. It was their aim to keep prices down to consumers.  Both witnesses expressed their concern at seeing tickets for Ed Sheeran playing at the Teenage Cancer Trust charity event being sold by touts for up to £490 per ticket. They wished to keep the prices as low as possible to ensure that fans could attend the shows.  In 2018 Ed Sheeran played at 120 events to 9 million ticket buying fans. </p>

Accordingly, if a business purchased tickets, the Act would not apply as this was a trader/trader contract, not a consumer/trader contact.  He also gave evidence as to CMA guidance that a prohibition on resale might be unfair to a consumer unless (i) the prohibition was brought to the attention of both the consumers and STW and (ii) assistance was given to consumers who had purchased a ticket from a STW so that they could obtain compensation if they were refused entry to an event.

He explained that Roboform Software had been installed on the devices allowing the secure storage of multiple login, identity and credit card details for a variety of websites and which also allowed for multiple login details for installed software applications which enabled a user to fill out website forms in a single click as details were taken from this stored information. The software contained 105 identities including credit card details and physical addresses.  He also explained that internet bookmarks to a website called OmniChecker were found on each device. This website could be used to keep track of specific events on ticketing websites in order immediately to alert the user when tickets were on sale.  He also explained that they located on the seized software the remnants of software packages relating to spinner bots for Eventim, SeeTickets, and the Royal Albert Hall.  The search also discovered a dark web browser i.e., the part of the internet not searchable by a common tool such as Google or Yahoo and was often accessed via the Tor network.

The defence focused upon whether this business system was dishonest and fraudulent and as to this no one was deceived and no one was harmed - there were no victims.  Hunter accepted that he had adopted the practice of using different identities to gain more than the permitted number of tickets per individual but stated that this was not fraudulent as the PTS/PTW were aware of the practice and approved of it.  The business had used friends and family’s credit card to purchase tickets with their permission.  The tickets had been resold in the knowledge that the terms and conditions were never enforced, and he had relied upon guidance from the CMA which stated that the term prohibiting the resale of tickets was unfair. There was no real “risk” attached to sales to consumers over STW. There was no dishonesty in acting in the way that he did.   He accepted that speculative selling did on occasion occur, but he always acted in good faith and with the intention that he would be able to fulfil the order. In any event only 1 – 2% of the business operated on this basis. If he failed to acquire tickets to meet the order, then he knew that the secondary ticketing websites would step in to assist and there was no dishonesty involved in this practice. </p>

He was listed with Seatwave as a “<span style="font-style:italic">white list seller</span>” which status was afforded to large sellers only who had a good history of fulfilling orders. He had never experienced anyone being refused entry to an event. He was not exposing anyone to a risk of being refused entry. He denied that he was greedy.

On the facts there was no intention to deceive and/or no harm to any proprietary interest of any victim. It was also argued that when the jury considered dishonesty and fraud they would have to take into account that the restrictions sought to be imposed by event organisers and promoters and PTW, and which were at the heart of the Prosecution case, were ineffective either because they were invalid (for instance because of the operation of the fairness test in the CRA 2015) or because under common law and equity the restrictions became ineffective upon transfer of a ticket from the appellants to a consumer. </p>

The D company deliberately used these cards and names to acquire these tickets to overcome the difficulty of not being able to buy more than the maximum number permitted per credit card, per individual or per household. It is also the case that at no time, it was indicated to any of the PTSs that these tickets were being purchased on behalf of the D company, nor that the intention was to re-sell these tickets immediately for profit. Clear it is, had that been the case, some if not all the promoters / PTSs would have refused to sell these tickets to the D company. Common sense dictates that they would have not permitted it because promoters could, had that been their intention, have sold those tickets themselves at the higher price rather than setting a lower face value, and make a profit for themselves. We know in the case of Ed Sheeran tickets, that the same were being resold by the Ds within hours of the same coming into the market.</p>

The question arises was there a fraud, or fraudulent representation made in the acquisition of the tickets. The requirements of the offence of fraud pursuant to section 2 of the Fraud Act 2006 are: i) Dishonestly, making a false representation, ii) Intending, by making the representation to make gain for himself or another iii) And representation is false if it is untrue or misleading and the person making it knows it is or might be untrue or misleading iv) Representation may be express or implied.</p>

This, as mentioned at the outset, was the only business the D company conducted through the other two Ds and its employees. Subject to proof of dishonesty, which is a matter for the jury, it fulfils the requirement of the offence of fraud. It may be said, that thus far in this narrative, no one is actually losing out or that there is no victim. However, there are many frauds where there may be no obvious victims; the best example I can think of is the “mortgage fraud”. In most of the cases, the false representation relates to mortgagee’s ability to discharge the mortgage— where he exaggerates his income. He pays the mortgage as and when the instalments fall due and he might have even discharged the mortgage, with the financial institution suffering no loss, and yet, in law, he has committed a fraud.”</p>

It is said that this has emerged from a statement given by Mr Adam Webb in the context of a statement he has provided as part of evidence prepared for a trial which has yet to be heard.  It is argued that this evidence paints a very different picture to that which he presented in his evidence at trial and, assuming his latest evidence to be true, it creates a new factual matrix in which the appellants’ conduct was consented to by PTW and STW.  If, as this new evidence shows, the PTW and STW were supportive of the appellants’ business activity then their conduct cannot be dishonest because the PTW were not deceived, which is the Prosecution’s primary case. In these circumstances it is proper to admit this new evidence under section 23 CAA 1968 and, upon it being admitted, either to allow the appeal or to adjourn to allow further cross examination of Mr Webb upon the issue. </p>

The article states that the owners of Ticketmaster own several STW which took about 25% of the value of the ticket sold on their platform as commission. Hunter knew about this article because he engaged in a colourful WhatsApp exchange with the operator of a STW (who we refer to as “<span style="font-style:italic">MM</span>”), about the article during which they agreed that their business system enabled them to earn “<span style="font-style:italic">fucking loads</span>.”</p>

When the jury convicted, they did so in the knowledge of the evidence that PTW and STW had corporate links between them, and that Hunter had given evidence that he was financially incentivised to buy and sell tickets in bulk.  Even had they accepted this evidence they could in our view still quite properly have come to the conclusion that the offences were committed.  There was no evidence that <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">all</span> PTS and PTW were conniving with touts and to the contrary there was evidence that some took significant steps to preclude touts and enforce the contractual restrictions.

He told us that, upon the basis of the evidence that there was before the court, he would have been negligent to do so. We have some difficulty in understanding this but at the least it indicates that the decision not to seek to expand this evidence at trial was a deliberate judgment call made by counsel, no doubt for a good forensic reason. Nonetheless, the evidence now sought to be adduced cannot be said to be fresh. For these reasons it does not meet the elementary threshold of admissibility under section 23 CAA 1968.</p>

As we explain below (see paragraph [119]) the judge’s formulation was taken directly from classic case law. The appellants however argue that leaving a general dishonesty case to the jury in such terms was insufficient. Because of facts now known to be true (namely that PTS/PTW were not deceived) the only way in which the Section 933 CA 2006 offence could be established was by the Prosecution proving that the appellants deliberately put another person’s proprietary right in jeopardy.   A “<span style="font-style:italic">proprietary right</span>” in this context meant a right over or in respect of property that could be asserted against others, that was not personal to a given individual and which existed  by reason of and as an incident to ownership of other property.</p>

This being so the Prosecution had to prove one of the other heads of intent and as to these only possibility (iii) (harm to a proprietary interest) was even potentially relevant. The appellant’s case on this was that the PTS/PTW were not harmed since they sold all the tickets they owned; and, consumers were not harmed because no proprietary interest of theirs was harmed and in practical terms there was no sensible risk of ticket holders being denied entry to events. </p>

He concluded that authority <span style="font-style:italic">“… points, with some firmness and clarity, in favour of the proposition that, for a conspiracy to defraud based on economic injury to the object victim, the right or interest of the victim that is compromised must be proprietary</span>.”   He considered (paragraph [174]) that there were good reasons of principle and policy why that should be so; the law had to set boundaries of behaviour in commerce, and in the management of everyday life.  The upshot was that the judge dismissed a single charge upon which the Serious Fraud Office (“<span style="font-style:italic">SFO</span>”) had sought the trial of the six defendants. In the light of this ruling, there followed an application to the High Court by the SFO for a voluntary bill of indictment (<span style="font-style:italic">R v Evans</span> (QB)). There the principal criticism of Hickinbottom J was that he erred in law by adopting an overly narrow test when he ruled that agreement in the case could only amount to a conspiracy to defraud if it was proven that the defendants agreed dishonestly to prejudice another’s proprietary right or interests.

Where Parliament has defined the ingredients of an offence, perhaps stipulating what shall and shall not be a defence and has prescribed a mode of trial and a maximum penalty, it must ordinarily be proper that conduct falling within that definition should be prosecuted for the statutory offence and not for a common law offence which may or may not provide the same defences and for which the potential penalty is unlimited. … It cannot in the ordinary way be a reason for resorting to the common law offence that the prosecutor is freed from mandatory time limits or restrictions on penalty. It must rather be assumed that Parliament imposed the restrictions which it did having considered and weighed up what the protection of the public reasonably demanded. I would not go to the length of holding that conduct may never be lawfully prosecuted as a generally expressed common law crime where it falls within the terms of a specific statutory provision, but good practice and respect for the primacy of statute do in my judgment require that conduct falling within the terms of a specific statutory provision should be prosecuted under that provision unless there is good reason for doing otherwise.”</p>

Here the appellants use the common law tail to wag the Parliamentary dog in a way that is inconsistent with the reasoning underlying <span style="font-style:italic">Rimmington</span>. The reasoning of Lord Bingham when considering the relationship between common law and Parliament was focused upon two policy considerations.  First, the considerable caution and reticence that the courts applied to the incremental development of the common law; and secondly (and related), the primacy of Parliament when enacting and defining statutory offences.  It was for these reasons that ordinarily the courts should, in cases of overlap, charge the statutory offence rather than its common law counterpart. It is for the same reasons that in any clash as between the common law and Parliament it is the latter that takes precedence.  It accordingly runs counter to judicial policy for, as the appellants would have it here, the common law to drive and limit otherwise broad statutory language. That is the wrong way around. </p>

It is different in nature to the common law which concerns conspiracies and is not an offence which statutorily lifts the corporate veil to focus upon the carrying on of a business by those who manage and run it. </p>

It is routine in calls for evidence for the Commission to posit ideas and suggestions with a view to stimulating debate amongst consultees so that the Commissioners are better informed when they come to agree a final report. The Working Paper does not therefore have the same persuasive value as a final Law Commission report. Nonetheless, even as it stands the Working Paper is expressed with considerable circumspection.  It starts with the tentative position that it seemed “... <span style="font-style:italic">likely that the courts would interpret this phrase as requiring dishonesty, but again unlikely that the presence or otherwise of a deception would be relevant except in so far as it may be evidence of dishonesty</span>”.  In relation to the possibility that the common law requirement for proof of harm to a proprietary interest be read across it is equally diffident and postulates this only as a possibility: “<span style="font-style:italic">It may be that, by analogy with cases of conspiracy to defraud, fraudulent trading under this limb is trading with intent to injure, by dishonesty, some proprietary right of another</span>.”  It then says that it was “<span style="font-style:italic">arguable</span>” that fraudulent trading "f<span style="font-style:italic">or any fraudulent purpose</span>" “need not “<span style="font-style:italic">necessarily involve financial loss</span>”.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">However, insofar as this judgment is said to imply a narrow formulation of a proprietary interest its correctness has been doubted subsequently by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Hayes</span> [2015] EWCA Crim 46.  There the proceedings related to “LIBOR fixing”. What was alleged was that the applicant, along with others, conspired dishonestly at common law to manipulate and abuse the Japanese yen LIBOR rate between January 2006 and December 2010 when employed first at UBS and then at Citigroup. The motivation asserted was enhanced profits for his respective employing banks from such activities and thereby increased bonuses for himself. One of the arguments advanced to the trial judge and raised on appeal was that in a case of common law conspiracy to defraud of the particular kind alleged, the prosecution had to show actual prejudice, or a risk of actual prejudice, to a proprietary right or interest of another and that the prosecution could not do so on the agreed evidence. There was no evidence that any counterparty had been deceived or acted to its detriment in reliance on what was allegedly going on. The counterparties interest in their own funds was not put at risk and such contractual rights as the counterparties possessed were not proprietary rights, properly defined, that stood to be injured by the alleged combinations asserted by the Crown. Finally, such contractual rights as counterparties did have were also not put at risk.  Instead, it was the performance of such contracts that gave rise to any risk arising to the counterparties. The Court of Appeal rejected these arguments giving them short shrift.  They approved of the trial judge’s robust rejection of the defence proposition that there was no financial risk to counterparties. They then turned to the necessity of establishing injury to a proprietary interest and expressed considerable doubt that the narrow formulation in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Evans</span> was correct (see paragraph [39] below).  The Court concluded that causing a third party to sustain a financial loss was sufficient and that including causing injury to the “<span style="font-style:italic">value of contractual rights</span>” (see paragraph [35] below): </p>

In the latter case, reference is made by Lord Goff at page 276 to “an intention to act to the prejudice of another man's rights”. At page 277 he went on to refer to “the general principle that conspiracies to defraud are not restricted to cases of intention to cause the victim economic loss”.

Mr Convey, who argued this part of the case on behalf of the applicant, submits that that is not so in the present proceedings: because no deceit was alleged to be practised on the counter-parties as such to which they acted to their detriment. That is perhaps true in one sense. But we are not at all sure that, looking at matters more broadly, that accurately reflects the whole picture. Maybe no deceit practised on the actual counter-parties is alleged: but what is clearly alleged is that the submissions made via Thomson Reuters to the BBA for the purposes of the setting of the rate were false and misleading. That connotes that those ultimately setting the rate were being deceived, and that in turn would have an impact on those conducting their transactions by reference to the rate as set.</p>

But be that as it may, and assuming that a proprietary right or proprietary interest of the kind connoted by Viscount Dilhorne is required, one still has to consider what that phrase was intended to mean. It is a phrase constructed by judges for the purposes of setting the common law. There is no applicable statutory definition. If, at all events, one were to refer by analogy to section 4 of the Theft Act 1968 or section 5 of the Fraud Act 2006, the notion of “property” for those statutory purposes can be very broad indeed. As we see it, there at all events can be no reason whatsoever to confine Viscount Dilhorne's reference to “proprietary right” to the notion of beneficial or equitable interests or, for example, the kinds of interests needed to be shown to be able to launch a claim for an equitable tracing remedy. No right in rem as such needs to be shown for these purposes. There is no principled reason why it should be. </p>

As Cooke J pointed out, the property losses (potential, if not actual) to the counter-parties were obvious: they, whether or not they themselves had been directly deceived, stood to lose money, their money. It is said, indeed, by reference to the evidence that these ultimately were “zero-sum” transactions: the counter-parties' potential loss in essence would be the bank's potential gain.

Self-evidently, the rights and interests of the counter-parties — potential losers — were “proprietary” in nature for the purposes of what Viscount Dilhorne had in mind. That suffices. But in any event, the counter-parties' rights under the relevant trading contracts constituted a chose in action: a form of property. Those rights again self-evidently stood to be injured: in that the value of the contractual rights during the period of the contract, and therefore the value of the chose in action which they represented, stood to be diminished to the counter-party by reason of the consequences of the alleged dishonest conspiracy.

We only add on this aspect of the case that, as we see it, the applicant can obtain no support from the decision of Hickinbottom J, or the subsequent ruling of Fulford LJ, sitting as a High Court judge, in Evans. That case was decided on its own, and very unusual, facts. Moreover, it was decided by reference to the very particular way in which the Crown had chosen to frame the indictment, as Fulford LJ emphasised in his ruling. We should add, however, that our own view is that it is by no means to be assumed that, properly framed, the factual scenario arising in Evans was not capable of constituting a common law conspiracy to defraud. Indeed, we were rather surprised to note that it was apparently accepted before Hickinbottom J that no unlawful object arose in that case and that no unlawful means could be identified. One only has to consider the facts of that case, as alleged, in some detail to see how debatable those apparent concessions were. But as we say, the point ultimately was decided by reference to the particular way in which the indictment had been framed. </p>

Moreover, it may be noted that in paragraph 169 of his judgment, Hickinbottom J, amongst other things, said this, dealing with the question of proprietary rights and economic prejudice:  “The term appears to have survived as a result of two things: legal habit, and the fact that in most cases it is not in issue that the targeted right or interest is proprietary – the conspirators intend to relieve the victim of his money or such other property that he owns – and the only issue is dishonesty.” </p>

We should add, however, that in so far as Hickinbottom J went on to make some further observations with regard to what was connoted by the phrase “proprietary right”, we think that may require further analysis; and we should not be taken as necessarily agreeing with the relatively narrow view of the meaning of that phrase as (perhaps) indicated by Hickinbottom J. But for the purposes of this case, we need not say more. We add also that a further clear distinguishing factor from the Evans case is that in that case the rights of the relevant public bodies were to a very pronounced degree more contingent than was the case here.”</p>

The Court of Appeal held that being in possession of a licence was a prerequisite to the ability of the company to trade so that the process of applying for such a licence amounted to carrying on business and concealing relevant information from the regulator was fraudulently dishonest.  In relation to the transfer of funds out of the jurisdiction, just two months prior to the liquidation, the Court held that it was a proper inference to draw that this was a transaction with a fraudulent purpose. The Judge in the present case concluded that in <span style="font-style:italic">Philippou</span> at the time the transfer of funds occurred there was no deception on, or of, any actual person; it was simply a removal of funds from one account to another, but it nonetheless still had a “<span style="font-style:italic">purpose</span>” that was fraudulent. </p>

Some degree of attribution is needed.  A receptionist of a business that is being carried on for a fraudulent purpose will not, by the simple fact of sitting at reception, be carrying on the business.

This was the formulation used by the Judge in his directions on law to the jury. Later, in <span style="font-style:italic">Grantham</span> [1984] 1 QB 675, the Court of Appeal, in a case concerning an intent to defraud creditors, approved of a passage from the summing up in the earlier case of <span style="font-style:italic">Welham v DPP</span> [1961] AC 103 where the House of Lords had approved of a description of dishonest fraud as “… <span style="font-style:italic">stepping beyond the bounds of what ordinary decent people engaged in business would regard as honest</span>.”   Many judges have, whilst seeking to encapsulate the test in understandable language, cautioned against any judicial attempt to set out a definitive, all encompassing, legal definition.

In the present case if the Prosecution had charged the defendants after they had acquired the relevant bots and other software and the multiple credit cards and had set up a system for using an array of false identifies, but <span style="font-style:italic">before</span> the defendants had put that system into operation and used it to trick ticket vendors into selling them tickets and/or to place end consumers at risk, then the offence would <span style="font-style:italic">still</span> have been committed even though there was no actual fraud and no actual harm to end consumers and therefore no victims.  A fraudulent purpose would still be in existence and business acts to achieve that purpose would have been carried out. Of course, evidence of implementation might afford powerful additional evidence of the fraudulent purpose, but implementation of a fraudulent purpose is not an essential ingredient of the offence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In relation to Count 1 (acquisition of tickets from  PTS/PTW) the acts and omissions  relied upon by the Prosecution involved classic acts of deception and in particular the adopting of a method of business designed to overcome the restrictive terms and conditions imposed by ticket vendors which entailed failing to disclose to vendors the true identity of the purchaser and, in so doing, making false representations to ticket vendors as to the identity of the purchaser and as to the purpose behind the purchase (i.e. resale). The Judge explained that whether the false representations were express (an active lie) or implicit (a passive lack of candour) was irrelevant. In relation to Count 3 (sales via STW to consumers) the jury was focused upon the listing of tickets for sale on STW which as a matter of law were or might be at risk of being cancelled or refused, and the failure to warn the purchaser of this risk of invalidity. In relation to Count 4 (the spec sales) the deception lay in the appellants failing to inform consumers that in actual fact they did not own or possess the tickets they were purporting to sell. </p>

We have already rejected the argument that the Prosecution had to prove injury to a narrow proprietary interest (see paragraphs [96] – [98] above) and we have also made clear that it is the “purpose” that matters not the actuality. On the facts of the present case the Judge (and the jury) clearly concluded that there was real prejudice to the rights and interests of third parties. The Judge explained to the jury that fraud meant having as a purpose acting to the prejudice of the rights of another person or exposing that person to the risk of their economic interests being prejudiced.  He also explained that whether an end consumer had in real life been the subject of refusal of access to an event or cancellation did not make a difference because the prejudice lay in the <span style="font-style:italic">risk</span> not the actuality. He also pointed out that fact that some STW provided cover to consumers in the event that tickets were invalidated did not matter since not all STW offered full compensation (see e.g. paragraph [45] above) but whatever compensation was paid it still did not cover disappointment, inconvenience and associated and ancillary costs and expenses.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In our view on the facts of this case there were a variety of ways in which the purpose of the business prejudiced legitimate interests or rights. The most obvious was the placing of consumers at risk that the tickets they had paid for, at inflated prices, were cancelled.  The interests of ticket vendors also cannot be ignored. The evidence demonstrated that some went to considerable effort and cost to curb tickets touts and to avoid the reputational and consumer damage that might flow from fans being overcharged or refused entry. The appellants set out to undermine the business models of the vendors an important part of which were the rights they possessed to enforce contractual restrictions on sale. This was an attack upon a key component of the business model of genuine ticket vendors. The vendors were systematically deceived in circumstances where, had they known the truth, they would not have made the sales. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">There is also the conduct of the appellants themselves to bear in mind.  The appellants individually (but also in the context of the many other touts operating in the same way) sought to prevent consumers being able to use honest ticket sites to acquire tickets at face value by the process of harvesting tickets which sucked large numbers of otherwise available tickets out of the system.  Their conduct deliberately distorted and imbalanced supply and demand and created an artificially inflated demand which could be satisfied only by sales on STW at hyper inflated prices. The greed of the touts who forced consumers to pay for intrinsically risk laden tickets at high prices is, in our judgment, an important matter which also informs any decision about the nature of the prejudice arising out of the appellant’s conduct. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">We add one final caveat. The acid test for fraud is dishonesty.  It is not evident to us that there is any requirement for the Prosecution to prove that, over and above sufficient evidence of dishonesty, there is an additional, incremental, requirement to prove that the rights or interests of a third party are harmed in a relevant manner. <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">If</span> the appellants had been correct and on the facts it had not been possible to demonstrate, as part of a relevant purpose, that there were any victims who might suffer  prejudice of any sort, then that would not necessarily have been the end of the matter. We have not in this case had to address the situation of the so-called “victimless” fraud.  It is possible to identify a variant of the facts of this case where defendants: (i) use duplicitous/deceptive conduct (which might amount to a breach of contract and/or breach of statutory duty); (ii) persuade counterparties to act in ways that they would not if they were informed of the truth; and (iii),  thereby make significant profits that they would not otherwise have made had they acted in a candid, frank and lawful manner.  We do not rule out the possibility that a jury so directed could find that such conduct was dishonest and hence fraudulent under section 933, even if there was no tangible prejudice to a third parties’ interests behind the “purpose”. Some support for this analysis is found in the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Hollier v Booth</span> (ibid) – see paragraph [123] above. At all events since the present case is one where, on the evidence, there was real and proven harm to the rights and interests of others, and this was inherent in the relevant purpose, we do not have to express a concluded view on the point. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">First, when is a term unfair?  A term is unfair, under section 62 CRA 2015, if “<span style="font-style:italic">… contrary</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">to the requirements of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations under the contract to the detriment of the consumer</span>”.  Various indicia are then set out in the Act, one of which is the requirement that consumers be aware of the terms in issue; transparency is important.  The test however only applies to a “<span style="font-style:italic">consumer contract</span>”. This is defined in section 61 as “<span style="font-style:italic">a contract between a trader and a consumer</span>”.   A “<span style="font-style:italic">trader</span>” is defined in section 2 as “<span style="font-style:italic">… a person acting for a purpose relating to that person’s trade, business, craft or profession, whether acting personally or through another person acting in the trader’s name or on the trader’s behalf</span>”.  A “<span style="font-style:italic">consumer</span>” is defined as “<span style="font-style:italic">…</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">an individual acting for purposes that are wholly or mainly outside that individuals trade, business, craft or profession</span>”. Various exclusions are provided for. For example, section 66(1)(b) excludes “… <span style="font-style:italic">any contract so far as it relates to the creation of transfer of an interest in land</span>”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Secondly, what are the consequences of a term being held to be unfair?  If a term is unfair, in the statutory sense, it has the legal consequence of rendering the term voidable in civil law in the hands of the consumer under section 62 which confers upon the consumer the right not to be bound by the terms.  Though, under section 62(3), a consumer has a choice whether or not to rely upon the terms in issue. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Thirdly, who decides that a term is unfair?  Under section 71 CRA 2015 a free-standing duty is imposed upon “<span style="font-style:italic">courts</span>” to consider the fairness of contract terms in any proceedings which “<span style="font-style:italic">relate</span>” to the terms of a “<span style="font-style:italic">consumer contract</span>”.  This is a most unusual duty that arises irrespective of whether the parties raise the issue or indicate that they intend to raise it (see section 71(2)).   The Act does not define “<span style="font-style:italic">court</span>” or say how this works in a criminal case. It seems to us that in a criminal case, the determination is one for the judge, not a jury.   There are two main reasons for this. </p>

	  <num style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-decoration-line:none;font-size:12pt;color:initial;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:-0.50in">146.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The first is that the Act is concerned with consumer protection. The responsibility for enforcing the law lies with a range of specialist regulatory authorities (such as the CMA) and the courts.   The object behind Parliament imposing a free-standing duty upon courts to rule on fairness is that a ruling and declaration of unfairness then triggers the civil law consequence of voidness. The courts, like the regulators, are hence given a civil law role in consumer protection. The task of the court might be quite complex and nuanced. The nature and scope of resultant voidness might, in theory at least, be limited to some but not all circumstances, but legal certainty is provided for because these limits will be set out in a judgment. That ruling will then guide the approach others (regulators and courts) take to enforcement of like terms. A jury for its part could never give a ruling on fairness.  It is not a task that Parliament would have contemplated a jury would or could assume. All a jury can do is to arrive at a verdict of “guilty” or “not guilty” on the matters indicted which will never include an issue of fairness under the CRA 2015.  Even if (to test the proposition) a jury were to take fairness into account as a matter collateral to a criminal charge the jury's function would still not be to rule upon the issue as opposed to rendering a verdict on the charge.  In short, the task imposed under the CRA is a civil law one designed to regulate the past but also the future contractual rights of consumers.  Parliament intended this task to be carried out by a judge.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The second reason is that whether a term is unfair under the Act is an intertwined question of mixed fact and law. It might for instance turn upon the proper interpretation of the clause in dispute and as to the circumstances in which it applies or as to the adequacy of its accessibility in terms of transparency to consumers.  The test laid down in the Act of fairness involves the balancing of a potentially wide range of legal and evidential considerations. This is reflected in section 71(3) which curtails the duty on a court to rule on fairness where “… <span style="font-style:italic">the court considers that it has before it insufficient legal and factual material to enable it to consider the fairness of the term</span>”.  It would be artificial and counterproductive to the purpose of consumer protection to have to split up the legal and evidential parts of the test with one part being decided by the judge and the other by the jury.  And it is wholly unclear how a jury could ever form a view as to the adequacy of the legal and factual material that it needed to form a conclusion on fairness.  This is a yet further reason why the task in its entirety is one for the judge and not the jury. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">It follows that if and insofar as an issue arises of fairness under the CRA 2015 in criminal proceedings it is for the judge to determine the issue, and not an issue to be left to the jury. Any determination that the judge makes can then be placed before the jury as part of the directions of law if and in so far as it is germane to a jury issue.  It necessarily follows that it was wrong of the judge to leave the question of fairness to the jury.  Nonetheless, for reasons we explain below, this error worked to the appellant’s favour, not to their disadvantage. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">There was a considerable body of evidence before the court on fairness.  First there were 79 pages of terms and conditions emanating from a variety of different ticket vendors. Secondly, the Waterson Report set out a detailed review of the issue of consumer protection including fairness.  Thirdly, Mr David Perry a director from the CMA, gave evidence as to the approach that the CMA took towards the evaluation of terms and conditions of contract and as to the application of the law to the ticketing market. Various documents emanating from the CMA were also before the Court and included the CMA Guide to the application of the CRA 2015 and correspondence passing between the CMA and sellers of tickets about the application of the legislation to the sorts of terms in issue.  The position of the CMA was summarised in a letter it sent on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2019 to event organisers seeking to provide guidance as to the circumstances in which restrictive terms and conditions might be unfair and as to the steps to be taken to obviate that risk. The CMA had already, at this time, written an open letter to secondary ticket website operators reminding them of their obligations under consumer protection law. In an annex to the letter, the CMA set out what it described as a “<span style="font-style:italic">prioritisation statement on terms and conditions that restrict event ticket resale</span>”. The CMA observed that it was ultimately for the courts, not the CMA, to decide whether a term was fair or unfair. However, the CMA observed that terms and conditions that restricted a resale by event organisers had the potential to cause consumer harm by preventing consumers from recouping the money “…<span style="font-style:italic"> that they spent on tickets if they are no longer able to attend an event, or no longer wish to go”</span>. The CMA also identified as a potential problem “…<span style="font-style:italic">where end user consumers are prevented from entering an event for which they hold a resold ticket</span>”. Nonetheless, the CMA acknowledged that the terms and conditions that restricted resale were not automatically unfair. In broad terms, in reviewing the fairness of a restriction, the CMA would consider whether there was a legitimate reason for the imposition of a term, whether its use was necessary and proportionate to achieve the legitimate reason, and whether the restriction had been communicated with sufficient transparency. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">With regard to possible legitimate reasons for the use of restrictions, the CMA accepted that ensuring as many tickets as possible for an event were sold at a price affordable to the greatest number of consumers, was a legitimate objective where the alternative was: “<span style="font-style:italic">… being bought up by businesses to be resold at higher prices</span>”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In relation to both proportionality and transparency, the CMA emphasised that event organisers should provide a clear, upfront and consistent disclosure of the relevant restrictions to original ticket purchasers on all sale channels. They also considered that event organisers should either provide a full refund to original ticket buyers who were no longer able to attend the event or, alternatively, make arrangements which effectively permitted such purchasers to recoup or substantially reduce any direct financial loss. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">It thus follows that whilst it is true that the CMA considered that, in theory, restrictive terms and conditions imposed by ticket vendors could fail the test of fairness, nonetheless they also recognised that restrictions designed to prevent secondary markets emerging could serve a legitimate and proportionate purpose. </p>

In his legal directions to the jury the judge expressed the conclusion that as between the defendants as traders and the vendors of tickets the contract was a business to business contract and not a business to consumer contract.  The judge was correct.  Before us counsel for the appellants did not dispute this conclusion.

It was the appellants case that the sales were made by the STW as principals to consumers and were not direct sales by the appellants to consumers. The judge rejected this analysis holding that the STW’s acted merely as selling platforms but not as principals: see the citation at paragraph [57] above.  This was correct.  The judge did however in his ruling make the following somewhat puzzling statement: “<span style="font-style:italic">I hope it is clear from what has been said already that the contract between the Ds and the end user was not subject to the consumer protection legislation”.  </span>This suggests that a contract between the appellant’s business and an end user was not a consumer contract even though the selling company (e.g. BZZ) was acting as trader and the purchaser was a consumer.

Evidence at trial indicated touting and harvesting of tickets was widespread.  Hunter said in evidence that at least 120 other companies did what his company did. The collective effect of this upon the availability to end consumers of tickets could be very substantial. Mass harvesting by touts using bots is capable of extracting from a vendor’s system a very large number of tickets otherwise available to genuine consumers.  These harvested tickets are then, in rapid succession, placed for sale on STW at inflated prices. The tout adds nothing whatsoever of value to the service.  All that is achieved, to use the vernacular of Hunter and MM, was to make “<span style="font-style:italic">fucking loads</span>” for the touts (see paragraph [61] above). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In law a ticket is evidence or proof of two things.  First, a right to enter land as a licensee and not as a trespasser.  Secondly, as proof of a right to receive a service, namely that to be performed or provided on the land. The Judge was correct to conclude that a ticket was a contractual licence issued on terms and therefore a chose in action rather than merely a good. Authority for these propositions is found in <span style="font-style:italic">RFU v Viagogo Limited</span> [2011] EWHC 764 QB at paragraphs [37] [43] as approved by the Court of Appeal [2011] EWCA Civ 1585 at paragraphs [18] and [19] which addressed the arguments upon the basis of an arguability threshold (to obtain injunctive relief) test but, as articulated in the judgments, were propositions expressed with considerable confidence. That conclusion is consistent with the judgment of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Coombes, Eren and Marshall</span> [1998] 2 Cr App R 282 where, in the days before the digital verification of tickets and cards, the defendants were recorded on video obtaining tickets or travel cards for use on the London Underground and then, when the holder had passed through the ticket barrier, handing the ticket to a third party to be used again. They were charged under the Theft Act. The Court of Appeal started its judgment with the observation that the case had ramifications for all sorts of ticket touts. One argument advanced by the appellant was that the issuing of the ticket was analogous to the drawing of a cheque.  In both cases a chose in action was created which in the first case belonged to the customer and in the second to the payee. By parity of reasoning with the analysis of Lord Goff in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Preddy &amp; Others</span> (1996) 2 CLR 524 it was argued that the “<span style="font-style:italic">property</span>” acquired belonged to the customer and not London Underground and there can have been no intention on the part of the appellants to deprive London Underground of the ticket which would in due course (when surrendered at a ticket barrier) be returned into the possession of London Underground. The Court rejected the submission reinforcing the conclusion that when a ticket was transferred it did so retaining both contractual rights <span style="font-style:italic">and </span>restrictions:  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.18in">“A 'chose in action' is a known legal expression used to describe all personal rights of property which can only be claimed or enforced by action, and not by taking physical possession." (See <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Talkington -v- Magee</span> (1902) 2KB 427 per Channell at 230). On the issuing of an underground ticket a contract is created between London Underground and the purchaser. Under that contract each party has rights and obligations. Theoretically those rights are enforceable by action. Therefore it is arguable, we suppose, that by the transaction each party has acquired a chose in action. On the side of the purchaser it is represented by a right to use the ticket to the extent which it allows travel on the underground system. On the side of London Underground it encompasses the right to insist that the ticket is used by no one other than the purchaser. It is that right which is disregarded when the ticket is acquired by the appellant and sold on. But here the charges were in relation to the tickets and travel cards themselves and a ticket form or travel card and, dare we say, a cheque form is not a chose in action. The fact that the ticket form or travel card may find its way back into the possession of London Underground, albeit with its usefulness or 'virtue' exhausted, is nothing to the point.”</p>

The judge erred in rejecting this argument.  It was an argument which was material both to whether consumers suffered any economic prejudice when they purchased tickets from the appellants, and, whether there was dishonesty since if equity did intervene as described then this went directly to whether consumers were unwittingly deceived into buying tickets that placed their ability to attend the event at risk. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">First, the doctrine of equities darling is an explanation for the rationale behind the principle that a <span style="font-style:italic">bona fide</span> purchaser of real property for value can acquire good title to the property despite a prior fraudulent transaction in the conveyancing chain.   The classic case where the doctrine applies is where a fraudster sells a property to a <span style="font-style:italic">bona fide</span> purchaser (B) for value where the property has <span style="font-style:italic">already</span> been sold to a third party (A). The law focuses on how to allocate rights as between A and B, the two innocent parties.  To be such a <span style="font-style:italic">bona fide</span> purchaser the purchaser must have made “<span style="font-style:italic">such inspections as ought reasonably to have been made</span>”:  <span style="font-style:italic">Kingsworth Finance Trust v Tizad</span> [1986] 1 WLR 783.   Where this doctrine applies it attaches to real property transactions. There is nothing in case law to suggest that it applies to a licence such as that reflected in a ticket to attend an event. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Secondly, the doctrine seeks to allocate risk as between the two innocent parties and is not a device to scrub out the reprehensible and dishonest intermediate conduct of the fraudster.  That person’s conduct remains dishonest – and criminal - even though equity has to resolve the allocation of property ownership rights as between the fraudster's innocent victims.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">There is one final observation we would make. This is an argument dreamt up after the event to justify the unjustifiable. It is inconceivable that when the alleged frauds were being committed that the appellants thought that equities darling would come to the rescue of duped consumers or that any steward in attendance at an event or in a box office who was querying the validity of the tickets presented by a consumer had notions of equity at the forefront off their minds.  The truth of the matter was that the defendants knew full well that there was a “<span style="font-style:italic">risk</span>” which attended the purchase of tickets from them.

And you look forward to it, you choose an event which she would enjoy, or your parents would enjoy. You prepare yourself to get up in the morning when the tickets are going to go on sale; you are going to buy them. And you do, you sit at your desk, open your computer, log into the website at the right time. And then, whilst you are looking at which seats to buy and looking at prices, and by the time you get around, within say 20 minutes, to actually selecting the right sort of seats which are within your price range, as well as give a decent view of the performance, you realise that the tickets have gone, they are no longer there, you can't buy them.

For four you could pay £80 times four, plus the administration fee, but if it's doubled in price, it's £160 times four plus the administration price, which you can't afford. And then you say, right, hard luck. But, then you read in the paper, or you hear from someone, that actually you know when you were on the website trying 3 to buy from the primary ticket seller, there were others whose business it is to buy these tickets in bulk and then sell them at profit.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">First, the passage in question must be seen in context and as to this there are two sections of the summing up which preceded this passage which are relevant.  At the outset of the summing up, in the normal way, the judge directed the jury both orally and in written form to approach the evidence dispassionately, to not allow any views they may have of ticket touts to cloud their judgment, and to focus upon the evidence.  The judge’s comments which have been singled out for criticism must be seen in this contextual starting point.  Further, the passage must also be understood in light of the immediately preceding passage where the judge summarised the contents of Skype Chats where Hunter had referred to there being about 120 ticket sellers like him.  The passage objected to concerns the judge’s exposition to the jury of the cumulative effect of multiple touts harvesting and then reselling tickets. The passage is not specifically targeted at the appellants only. When asked, Counsel could not identify anything in the passage what was said to be inaccurate.  The criticism was at base one of style and linguistic tone.  In our judgment this was an entirely proper manner in which to direct the jury.  Whether the conduct indicted is dishonest is determined by the jury collectively using their own experience of what is normal, moral and acceptable. To this extent the legal test requires the jury to stand in the shoes of ordinary people.  It is true that the passage is crafted in somewhat rhetorical terms, but this is consistent with the test to be applied.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Secondly, we reject this argument because this is also an area where the discretion of the judge is called into question.  It is the task of a judge addressing a jury, especially in relation to maters of some complexity, to endeavour to make the issues accessible whilst, simultaneously, ensuring that the directions are accurate in law.  This can be a difficult task and, provided that no error of law is made, the appeal court will be slow to interfere.  If the overall tenor of the passage complained of can be viewed as critical then this is in the nature of the facts of the case and not something which flows from any attempt by the judge unduly to sway the jury.  The essence of the Prosecution case, and that placed before the jury for their consideration, was of a fraud directed towards the making of substantial gain from event goers by charging them inflated prices for tickets that had been improperly obtained from consumer facing websites.  There was no material dispute about any of the core facts. Jurors might well have formed an adverse view of such conduct just as they do in relation to other criminal cases which have far more unpleasant facts.  But that is nothing to the point. We reject this ground of appeal.</p>

Here, on the facts, the real issues at the heart of dishonesty were whether tickets vendors were deceived into thinking that they were selling tickets to consumers and the risk that consumers who purchased from STWs would have their tickets cancelled.  To make these matters plain to the jury did not require a detailed exposition of complex issues of civil law or equity.  We give two examples.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">First, (even assuming that fairness under the CRA 2015 was a jury issue) there was no need for the jury to grapple with the distinction between void and voidable when all that that issue went to was the <span style="font-style:italic">risk</span> that their tickets would be cancelled, and this risk was fully and adequately explained to the jury.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Secondly, there was no need for the judge to go through the substantial number of sets of terms and conditions and provide a commentary to the jury as to their substance and effect or to provide to the jury a detailed analysis of how they all fitted together.  The relevance of these multifarious terms and conditions was to show that it was routine for tickets vendors to impose restriction which prevented sales to traders for resale, which limited the numbers of tickets that could be sold to one person, and which reserved the right to the event organiser to refuse entry to consumers having  tickets purchased from touts. On our reading of the summing up the jury can have been in no doubt about these central matters. It would have been otiose for the judge to have gone into much greater detail.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">We return to a point that we have already made which is that, at base, the Prosecution case is relatively simple. It involves defendants who institute systems of business the purpose of which is dishonest.  On the facts the dishonesty lay in a system designed to deploy a deliberate and systemic lack of candour in dealings with sellers of tickets and buyers of tickets, all of which was intended to enable the appellants to charge grossly inflated prices to consumers for risk laden tickets and earn substantial profits thereby.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">We have reviewed the judge's directions on law and his summing up on the evidence very carefully.  We cannot identify any areas where the jury would have been confused or where a more detailed exposition of the law would have provided any greater clarity as to the “<span style="font-style:italic">real</span>” issues in the case. The judge in our view acted sensibly in boiling down the legal issues for the jury and in so doing he made no errors.  We reject this ground of appeal. </p>
