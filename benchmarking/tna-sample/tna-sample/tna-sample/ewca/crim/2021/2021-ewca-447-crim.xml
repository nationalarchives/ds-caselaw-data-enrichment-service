	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.00in">These appeals all raise technical issues concerning the relationship between the Magistrates’ Courts and the Crown Court and, in particular, about the powers which may be exercised by Crown Court judges by reason of section 66 of the Courts Act 2003 (“section 66”), and what procedures should be followed if exercising those powers.  They have been listed together so that the court can consider those issues in the light of what happened in these four different cases, which are otherwise quite unconnected.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.00in">The central issue is how far Crown Court judges can lawfully go to try and alleviate the unfortunate consequences of serious failures by the prosecution in charging criminal offences.  At a more fundamental level the cases involve consideration of the relationship between the jurisdictions of the Magistrates’ Courts and the Crown Court.  This relationship is an essential part of the criminal justice system.  In the modern era it is governed by a formidably complicated battery of statutory provisions which have been supplemented and amended by Parliament frequently over many years.  The issue involves consideration of the extent to which Crown Court judges may use the powers of a District Judge (Magistrates’ Court) (“DJ(MC)”) while at the same time respecting the jurisdictional limits of the different courts.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.00in">The first point which must be made is that it is the duty of the prosecution to stop making basic procedural errors.  The quality of decision making revealed by the first three of these four cases is extremely poor.  In the fourth the problem was created by what appears to have been a single typographical error which went unnoticed and is rather less culpable.  We have no reason to think that they are examples of a rare problem.  It is the duty of the Crown Prosecution Service to identify the cause of the problem and to solve it.  In each of these cases the judges of the Crown Court have tried to ensure that justice was done in order to bring the cases to a conclusion in the interests of victims and defendants.  They have tried to avoid adding to what in some cases was already unacceptable delay, often associated with long periods waiting for a postal requisition to arrive.  The fact that these charges, when eventually delivered, were defective is particularly unattractive.  It will shortly appear that some of the efforts made by the judges were more successful than others, but they are not to be blamed for trying to grapple with the consequences of mistakes made by others and to administer justice.  We hope that this judgment may make their task easier in the future if, as appears likely, it proves impossible to eliminate this kind of problem entirely.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.00in">After describing the applications before us, we shall first set out the key statutory materials with which we are concerned.  We shall then set out what happened in each of the four cases before us.  We shall then identify and deal with the common legal issues.  Finally we shall deal with the individual appeals separately.  Although they are listed together to deal with the technical points, they all concern individuals and will receive entirely separate attention when we come to decide the applications.  We shall refer to those seeking to appeal by their surnames in the body of this judgment.  This is for brevity and does not mark a lack of respect.  It also avoids the need to consider when referring to such a person whether he is, at that point, an appellant, an applicant, a claimant in judicial review proceedings or a defendant before one of us sitting as a DJ(MC).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.00in">Joshua Gould is now 25 years old.  He was sentenced to an extended determinate sentence of 18 years with a custodial term of 10 years by Her Honour Judge Leigh at Basildon Crown Court on 30 January 2019 for a series of sexual offences involving children.  He had pleaded guilty to all the offences.  Over a year later he sought leave to appeal against sentence and applied for an extension of time.  Those applications were referred to the full court by the single judge.  When they came before the full court on 28 October 2020 the Court of Appeal Office had identified the legal issues which have caused the case to come before us, and directions were given.  On 22 December 2020 an application was filed for leave to appeal against conviction and an extension of time.  The Registrar has referred that application to the full court.  It is those applications which are now before us.    </p>

He was sentenced for a number of offences of burglary on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"> </span>January 2020 by His Honour Judge Juckes, Q.C. at the Crown Court at Worcester.  The total sentence was 9 years’ imprisonment.  He was granted leave to appeal against that sentence by the single judge.  After that, the procedural issue was detected by the Criminal Appeal Office and the parties were informed.  An application for leave to appeal against conviction and an application for an extension of time was issued on 27 January 2021.  We therefore have those two applications before us, and if they fail, we will deal with the appeal on its merits.  </p>

He was sentenced by His Honour Judge Connell at the Isleworth Crown Court on 5 February 2020 to a total of 56 weeks’ detention for three offences of breaching two Sexual Harm Prevention Orders (“SHPOs”) and a breach of a suspended sentence order.  26 weeks’ detention was imposed for a breach of a SHPO which occurred on 15 October 2019.  12 weeks consecutive on two charges of breach of two different SHPO which both occurred on the same day in August 2019.  These two sentences ran concurrently with each other.  A further 18 weeks’ detention was imposed because by virtue of his convictions he was in breach of a suspended sentence order imposed on 8 July 2019 at Kingston Crown Court.  A new SHPO was imposed.  He sought leave to appeal against that sentence, and that application was referred to the full court by the Single Judge.  It was then appreciated by the Criminal Appeal Office that there had been an exercise of the power under section 66 in this case.  Although this could not be the subject of an appeal to this court, the matter has been approached on the basis that if we find that the proceedings were invalid we will deal with the matter as a Divisional Court.  </p>

He was sentenced to 27 months’ imprisonment for a single offence of fraud by Her Honour Judge Moore at the Norwich Crown Court on 23 October 2020.  He originally sought leave to appeal against that sentence and, while that application was pending, it was discovered by the Criminal Appeal Office and Mr. Blom-Cooper, who had not appeared in the Crown Court, that the sentence was passed after the judge had exercised powers under section 66 to correct a single number in a date in the charge from “8” to “6”, the effect of which was to extend the period of the offending by two years.  This led to Perfected Grounds challenging the conviction, which could only be dealt with by the Divisional Court and we will treat them as an invitation to this court to quash the conviction exercising that jurisdiction.    </p>

The same is to apply to deputy High Court judges and deputy Circuit judges. It is not expected that extensive use would be made of the provision, but it would be possible for a Circuit judge in the Crown Court to deal with a summary offence without the case having to go back to a magistrates’ court. At present, certain summary offences can be included in an indictment. If the person is convicted on the indictment, the Crown Court may sentence him if he pleads guilty to the summary offence, but if he pleads not guilty the powers of the Crown Court cease. It is intended in such cases that the judge of the Crown Court should be able to deal with the summary offences then and there as a magistrate. He would follow magistrates’ courts’ procedure.”  </p>

Part 2 of Schedule 4 to the 2007 Act provides that the Senior President of Tribunals has the function of assigning judges and other members to the chambers of the First-tier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal.  </p>

The establishment of Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service (“HMCTS”) on 1 April 2011 was designed to provide the Ministry of Justice with the opportunity to manage its resources more flexibly according to changing pressures and demands. However, the Lord Chief Justice and Senior President of Tribunals lack the ability to share judicial resource in order to respond to changes in demands. Section 21 introduces Schedule 14 which makes amendments that will enable the Lord Chief Justice to deploy judges more flexibly across different courts and tribunals of equivalent or lower status.”  </p>

He was arrested on 13 January 2018 because his internet connection had attracted suspicion that he had been accessing pornographic images of children.  This suspected activity occurred between May and October 2017.  His house was searched and three devices seized and interrogated.  There was an iPhone, an M3 external hard drive and a Lenovo Laptop.  Each was found to contain child pornography.  In addition to images which had been acquired from the internet, there were also videos and still images of children which he had filmed himself.  Those videos disclosed sexual offences against those children, including an offence of attempted oral rape of X, a two year old girl.  There were films of offences of sexual assault against her, and against another two year old girl, Y.  A video was also found showing Gould exposing his penis in the vicinity of Z, who may have been 7 years old at the time.  Z was hiding in a wardrobe playing hide and seek at the time, and could not see what he was doing.  Appreciation of this fact came late in the day, after it had been decided to charge the conduct as an offence of exposure, contrary to section 66(1) of the Sexual Offences Act 2003.  </p>

There was one category A image of her, showing the attempted oral rape, and three category B images.  These showed Gould pushing his fingers into his mouth and then hers, rubbing her head and neck and then her nappy and leggings around her vaginal area, and kissing her with his tongue.  There was also a video of Y.  Y was naked, and Gould was seen to be masturbating in her presence, rubbing his penis on her face and then ejaculating.  There was also the video of Z.  There were other images of these “live” victims (by which we mean they were directly attacked by Gould rather than shown in images or videos which he obtained from the internet) as well, so that in total there were 6 category B moving images of X and Y, and 14 still images of them in category C.  His access to Y and Z had also been possible because he was trusted by their parents for family reasons, but it is unnecessary to give any further details here.  </p>

He was concerned about the effect that delay would have on other people, and said that he wanted to help “others to move on without being reminded of what I’ve done.”  It was, however, necessary to interrogate his devices and these investigations call on finite resources.  It was not until 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> October 2018, after a letter of requisition requiring him to attend before the South Essex Magistrates, that he appeared before the court.  The charges he then faced were not the same as the final charges listed above.  Most strikingly, there was no allegation of attempted rape, or any other indictable only offence.  All the offences were triable either way.  There were then ten charges.  They included four sexual assault charges (as did the final tally), one charge of intentionally exposing his genitals to Z contrary to section 66(1) of the Sexual Offences 2003, three charges of possession or making indecent images of children, one charge of possessing extreme pornography (the dog images), and one charge of possession of prohibited images of children contrary to section 62(1) and 66(2) of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (pseudo-photographs, cartoons and the like).  The Magistrates, according to their record, went through the procedure stipulated by section 17A of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980, and then took pleas of guilty to all ten charges.  They committed Gould for sentence at the Crown Court under section 3 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000.  No criticism is made on this appeal of any of that, except that it is agreed that these ten charges were defective because they lacked any proper particulars.  The sexual assault charges in particular did not identify the victims, or give any other particulars to enable Gould, or anyone else, to know what he was alleged to have done.  </p>

Six months had elapsed between Gould’s letter of April 2018 and the delivery of the original ten defective charges.  Nearly three months had passed since Her Honour Judge Leigh had expressed concern about the state of the charges.  The judge was understandably concerned that the case had not been put into proper order despite her observations in October.  It was not Mr. Sawyer’s fault, but not acceptable.  We agree.  This was a serious case involving a paedophile, in which the arrest was by now over two years old.  The case was further adjourned after a number of issues had been mentioned.

When “sending” an indictable only offence, the court is not required to consider whether its powers are sufficient to deal with the case because it has no such power.  When committing for sentence following conviction, it is doing so because a judicial decision has been made that the sentencing court ought to have available the sentencing powers of the Crown Court.  There is, therefore, an important difference in substance between the two routes to the Crown Court.   </p>

This involves consideration not only of the scope of the section 66 power in principle, but also of its use in this case.  A DJ(MC) would not have been able to commit Gould to the Crown Court.  The only power was to send him for trial under section 51 of the 1998 Act because the list of charges contained an indictable only offence. Gould also submits that if sentence was passed lawfully, it was nevertheless manifestly excessive or wrong in principle.

The Magistrates’ Court had considered the two offences of dwelling house burglary and had concluded that Moffat qualified for the minimum sentence under section 111 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 and therefore sent him to the Crown Court under sections 51(1) and (2)(a) of the 1998 Act.  These became counts 1 and 4 on the Indictment.  They also sent under section 51(3) of the 1998 Act the offence of attempted theft and theft which became counts 6 and 3 respectively.  As has been pointed out above these are mandatory provisions.  When the Indictment came to be preferred in the Crown Court the prosecution added two further counts, numbered 2 and 5.  Count 2 is an offence of burglary by entering the garage of the house which was burgled at the same time, and is the subject of count 1.   Count 5 alleged theft of a motor vehicle using the car keys stolen in the Count 1 burglary.  The six count indictment numbered T20190419 therefore reflected the four offences which had been sent to the Crown Court under section 51 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 by the Magistrates’ Court on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> September 2019.

Count 4 was a further offence of burglary of a dwelling house.  These offences were perpetrated in June and July 2019.  Two of them, the burglary offences, were sent for trial on 7 January 2020 under section 51(1) and (2)(a) as being indictable because of Moffat’s previous record.  He was dealt with in that way because the justices still believed that he had two previous qualifying convictions for dwelling house burglary.  That process resulted in the creation of a second indictment which was listed for sentence at the same time as the first, on 27 January 2020.  </p>

Both prosecution and defence counsel invited the judge to sit as a DJ(MC) and to conduct a process by which he explained the plea before venue process to Moffat in ordinary language and asked him for his pleas.  This is the process required of the Magistrates’ Court in the case of either way offences by section 17A of the Magistrates’ Court Act 1980, and Judge Cartwright went through it properly.  He pleaded guilty.  The judge then asked him for pleas on the other four offences before him and he pleaded guilty to them.  He decided to commit them for sentence, and this is how the second case number, S20190381 came into being.  There was no objection to any of this by Mr. Smith who appeared for Moffat, as he now does before us.  Mr. Smith said to the judge that he did not ask for sentencing to take place then, because there were outstanding matters.

Moffat was arraigned on Indictment T202000012 and pleaded guilty to all four counts.  The committal for sentence was then put to him as if it had been in respect of four offences and had taken place on 21 September 2019.  That was the date of the sendings for trial in respect of the T20190419 Indictment, which had been overtaken by the events of the 21 October 2019 hearing.  The problem about those sendings was mentioned to the judge, but no reference to the lawfulness of the 7 January sending was made.  It does not appear to have occurred to anyone to wonder why Moffat had been sent for trial on 7 January 2020 as a “third strike” burglar when it had been agreed in October 2019 that he was not.  Section 111 of the PCC(S)A 2000 only bites where the new offence is committed after two earlier qualifying convictions.  The fact that at the date when the 7 January 2020 sending took place Moffat had by then been convicted on two separate occasions of qualifying offences did not trigger section 111 because the offences sent on that day had been perpetrated before he was convicted before Judge Cartwright on 21 October 2019.  </p>

Again, the case became procedurally complex entirely because of prosecution errors which went undetected until a late stage.  Attempts to solve the complexity using section 66 of the 2003 Act were made.  There were, in this case, two committals for sentence for offences of breach of SHPOs, and these convictions placed Brown in breach of a suspended sentence order.  It is probably simplest in this case to set matters out in chronological order.  </p>

He had been released from his custodial sentence on 11 February and he began to communicate with this victim on 13 February.  Sentencing was adjourned but on that day a further SHPO (“the May SHPO”) was made which, among other things, prohibited him from possessing or using any device capable of sending electronic messages unless he had prior approval from his police supervision team, and the device had the capacity to retain and display a history of communications, and which prohibited him from deleting its browsing history.  He was required to make the device available for inspection on request by the police.  It did not repeat the requirement to notify the police of any romantic relationships.

This outcome was no doubt influenced by the fact that Brown had spent time in custody prior to sentence, and by a psychological assessment dated 27 June 2019.  That is a bleak document which could only offer limited recommendations for sexual offending programmes because Brown, despite his pleas, denies responsibility for any sexual offending.  The suspended sentence order made on 8 July 2019 required, among other things, attendance for 25 days on a Horizon programme which was a programme which did not make acceptance of guilt a precondition.  Neither the psychologist nor the Pre-Sentence Report expressed any optimism about this course.  </p>

These allegations related to the 28 August 2019.  This mystifying document does accurately record that these allegations amounted to breaches of SHPOs, and correctly gave the dates of those orders, but did not charge them in that way.  The notification requirements do not prohibit romantic relationships without disclosure, or possession of mobile phones.  They are notification requirements, as their name implies.  Moreover, the February SHPO had ceased to exist at the moment when the May SHPO was imposed and it was not an offence of any kind for Brown to form romantic relationships without telling the police in August 2019.  </p>

As we have recorded above, in fact the SHPO was made on 17 May 2019, but the suspended sentence order was not imposed until 8 July 2019.  The committal order therefore contained an error as to the date of the suspended sentence.  The order was also in error in that it was on its face ineffective to give the Crown Court power to sentence for the substantive offence of breaching the SHPO.  It only gave the Crown Court power to deal with the breach of the suspended sentence order.  The Court of Appeal Office has attempted to secure clarification from the Magistrates’ Court as to the power it was exercising without success.  It is clear to us that the Magistrates must have intended to commit for sentence under section 3 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 in respect of the substantive offence as well as under paragraph 11(2)(a) of Schedule 12 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003.  This problem was not noticed by anyone until it was identified in the Criminal Appeal Office.

A hearing took place in chambers because Mugenzi was the subject of an assassination threat by the Rwandan Government in 2011 because of his campaigning for human rights and greater democracy in Rwanda, the country of his birth.  He had been given an <span style="font-style:italic">Osman </span>warning by the police because they gave credence to the threat, as they still do.  It was said that his name and address should not be published in case this gave his enemies the opportunity to carry it out.  In the course of that hearing, the prosecutor told the judge that the date in the charge was wrong.  The judge correctly said that this needed to be addressed in open court.  In the hearing which followed counsel who then appeared for the prosecution invited the judge to amend the charge, by substituting the number “6” for the first number “8” in it.  It was pointed out, correctly, that this could cause no prejudice to Mugenzi as he had known exactly what he was accused of, and had accepted it.  Defence counsel said that the committal was not invalid and invited the judge to sit as a DJ(MC).  The prosecution would apply to amend the charge, which should be put again and committed by the judge back to the Crown Court for sentence.  The judge asked for help from both counsel about the proper procedure and then she did as she was asked.  She remitted the case to herself sitting as a DJ(MC) under section 66.  In that capacity she granted an application that the existing plea should be vacated and the date amended.  She asked defence counsel whether he objected and said that he could not.  She explained to the defendant that the procedure which was being followed was to correct a technical error and said that the allegation was going to be put again “but between the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> of March 2016 and the 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> May 2018 and you’ll be asked to enter a plea”.  The charge was then put to the defendant who was allowed to speak to his counsel for a very short time, and then said “guilty”.  After that had been done, the judge considered her sentencing powers as a DJ(MC) and decided to commit the case for sentence.  She did not go through the mode of trial procedure which the Magistrates’ Court must go through when dealing with offences which are triable either way, which is set out in section 17A of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980.  </p>

At the start, the judge suggested that the committal for sentence should be put to Mugenzi, but counsel both agreed that this was not necessary because she herself had “sent” [sic] the case to the Crown Court and so the committal was not put.  The case then proceeded to sentence in the normal way.  The judge noted Mugenzi’s positive good character, and that about a quarter of the money taken had been recovered.  She said, in a finding which is now criticised, that a large proportion of the monies taken were from charitable donations.  It seemed that he had a gambling addiction, and had got into debt.  She said that the case involved a gross breach of trust and placed it in category 2 for the purposes of the guideline.  She noted the mitigation afforded by remorse, and the admissions and early plea.  She also said that there was “delay” of “something approaching a year”.  </p>

She said that it was a high culpability case in category 2 for guideline purposes, which provides a range of 3-6 years and a starting point of 5 years, based on a loss of £300,000.  She imposed a prison sentence of 27 months and postponed confiscation proceedings.  That was the result of discounting the starting point for mitigation, and then by something over one third because of the very early admissions.    </p>

The significance of that, and what should be done about it, are matters which should be considered by the Criminal Procedure Rules Committee in the light of this judgment.  Where a judge sitting in the Crown Court exercises the power of a DJ(MC) to make an order which the Magistrates’ Court could have made, or to make a new such order it is clear that this should be reflected in the records of the lower court.

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.00in">Section 66 is drawn in very wide terms.  It appears that the original intention, as divined from the original Explanatory Notes and the sub-heading before section 65, was to increase flexibility by allowing judges of the Crown Court to exercise powers of a DJ(MC) in order to avoid unnecessary complications caused by the separate jurisdictions, constitutions, and procedures of those two courts.  The Explanatory Note gives an example of a case where that power might be exercised, and suggests that it would be done in a case where the judge was also and at the same time exercising a power of the Crown Court.  In 2013, the list of those who might sit as a DJ(MC) was lengthened and is no longer limited to judges sitting in the Crown Court.  The purpose now, again as divined from the Explanatory Notes and sub-heading, was to enable judges from one jurisdiction to be deployed into another.  There was now no question of that deployment being limited to the exercise of functions ancillary to their principal function.  Neither the Master of the Rolls nor a judge of the Employment Tribunal has any functions which might require them to exercise a power of a DJ(MC).  The purpose can only have been to enable those judicial office holders to be deployed as DJs(MC) and to sit as a Magistrates’ Court in the, perhaps unlikely, event that this was thought desirable.  Part of the current list of judicial office holders appears to have been created for one purpose, and the other part for another.  Nevertheless, it would not be possible as a matter of construction to ascribe a different meaning to the provision depending on the part of the list which included a particular judicial officer holder.  If a Tribunal Judge, when deployed into the Magistrates’ Court, can exercise all the powers of that court, there is nothing in the section to limit the powers of the Crown Court judges or to require some formal process of deployment before they can exercise any of the powers.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.00in">This is an unhappy state of affairs.  The original version of section 66 was widely drawn and it was necessary to look at the Explanatory Notes to find any limit on the scope of the powers it conferred.  That problem became more acute after the amendment in 2013.  It is necessary now for this court to attempt to construe this provision as best it can.  In our judgment, the provision is now to be construed as a broad measure which enables the Lord Chief Justice and the Senior President of Tribunals to exercise their powers of judicial deployment without regard to the particular office a particular judicial officer holder holds.  Similar permissive provisions appear in relation to judges of the Family Court (see section 31C of the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984, inserted by Schedule 10 to the Crime and Courts Act 2013) and the County Court (see section 5 of the County Courts Act 1984, as substituted by Schedule 9 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013).  It does not follow from the fact that the Lord Chief Justice or the Senior President of Tribunals may lawfully deploy, for example, a Tribunal judge, into the Family Court that this will happen, or that the judge concerned may take that decision for themselves.  There are training and ticketing requirements which govern who may sit in these courts.  Nothing before us requires us to make any decision about any aspect of that system.  It is enough to observe that although section 66 is now of some age, and has frequently been used in the Crown Court and the Court of Appeal Criminal Division it has never been thought necessary for any training regime or ticketing system to be in place before a judge sitting in those courts can act under its powers.

In the words of the subheading of Part 2 of Schedule 14, they may be deployed “to the Magistrates’ Courts”.  That has clearly not happened to the Crown Court judges in the present case, but as we have said, no formal process of deployment is required as a matter of law to confer this jurisdiction.  As a matter of practice, the Crown Court and Court of Appeal Criminal Division judges are able to exercise this power when they decide it is appropriate to do so.  </p>

That power exists in relation to a person who is before the adult Magistrates’ Court, but <span style="font-style:italic">W </span>was not before the adult Magistrates’ Court.  He had been lawfully committed to the Crown Court and that Magistrates’ Court (adult or youth) was therefore <span style="font-style:italic">functus</span>.  Therefore, whether the Recorder of Leeds had been acting as a DJ(MC) or as a judge of the Crown Court no such power existed, as he correctly held.

Similarly, in <span style="font-style:italic">Frimpong</span> it was held that neither a Crown Court judge nor a DJ(MC) could make an order that a period of time in prison could operate to extinguish liability to pay the Criminal Courts Charge which arises under what is now sections 44-51 of the Sentencing Code<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

The powers of the Magistrates’ Court are circumscribed by a statutory scheme which is complex, prescriptive and restrictive.  It is not necessary that such a scheme should be quite as complex as it is, but it is obviously necessary for a court of limited jurisdiction to have those limits carefully defined.  It was not the intention of Parliament in enacting the 2003 Act and the amendments in 2013 to allow the judicial office holders mentioned in section 66 to ignore the rules which the DJs(MC) would be obliged to follow.  If they do not properly apply those rules, then this court (or the Divisional Court) will consider what has happened, applying the analysis in <span style="font-style:italic">R v. Ashton, Draz and O’Reilly</span> [2006] EWCA Crim 794, to determine whether the procedural flaws are so bad that they go to the root of the exercise of the section 66 power requiring the quashing of the orders, or whether they can either be overlooked or remedied if this causes no prejudice.

If the answer to that question is no, then the court should go on to consider the interests of justice generally, and most particularly whether there is a real possibility that either the prosecution or the defence may suffer prejudice on account of the procedural failure.

In our view Mr Perry, for the Crown, is correct, therefore, in arguing that the prevailing approach to litigation is to avoid determining cases on technicalities (when they do not result in real prejudice and injustice) but instead to ensure that they are decided fairly on their merits. This approach is reflected in the Criminal Procedure Rules and, in particular, the overriding objective. Accordingly, as indicated above at para.[4], absent a clear indication that Parliament intended jurisdiction automatically to be removed following procedural failure, the decision of the court should be based on a wide assessment of the interests of justice, with particular focus on whether there was a real possibility that the prosecution or the defendant may suffer prejudice. If that risk is present, the court should then decide whether it is just to permit the proceedings to continue.  </p>

Mr Perry drew attention to the approval of <span style="font-style:italic">Ashton</span> expressed by a number of distinguished academic authorities, who saw it as a victory of substance over formalism. It is always, of course, lamentable if defendants whose guilt there is no reason to doubt escape their just deserts, although the present appellants, refused leave to appeal (on other points) by the single judge in 1997 and the full court in 1998, have now served the operative parts of their sentences. Technicality is always distasteful when it appears to contradict the merits of a case. But the duty of the court is to apply the law, which is sometimes technical, and it may be thought that if the state exercises its coercive power to put a citizen on trial for serious crime a certain degree of formality is not out of place. In this case, as in <span style="font-style:italic">Crawford v HM Advocate</span> , above, the duty in question was easy to perform, although here the failure to perform it was entirely the fault of the proper officer”.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.00in">There were three cases before the court in <span style="font-style:italic">Ashton</span>.  The court in <span style="font-style:italic">O’Reilly </span>held that adding a summary count to an indictment in respect of an offence not included within the power in section 40 of the Criminal Justice Act, which had not been committed under section 41 of that Act, and which was not brought within the six month time limit for summary only offences was a jurisdictional failure.  The fact that the Crown Court judge had purported to permit this under section 66 was by the by, since no court should have permitted this.  The conviction was quashed.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Ashton </span>the appellant pleaded guilty to two offences in the Magistrates’ Court which were triable either way and was committed to the Crown Court for sentence under section 3 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000.  The offences required the consent of the DPP which the prosecutor wrongly thought was lacking.  The judge agreed to sit under section 66 to start the proceedings again, consent now being in place.  He did so, and went through the mode of trial procedure required by section 17A of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980, and committed for sentence again and then proceeded to sentence.  It was held that the judge had been entitled to do this, although it might usually be unnecessary in view of the approach explained in paragraph 4 of the judgment, which we have set out above.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Draz</span> the Magistrates’ Court had wrongly proceeded on the basis that he had two previous qualifying convictions for dwelling house burglary and that therefore the allegation of dwelling house burglary before them was indictable only by virtue of section 111(4) of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000.  They sent him to the Crown Court under section 51 of the </p>

The error was discovered, and the Crown Court judge proceeded under the then paragraph 7 of Schedule 3 to the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 which provided an equivalent procedure to that in section 17A of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 in cases where a sending under section 51 has occurred, but no indictable only count remains on the indictment.  He did not, however, require an indictment to be drawn up as was contemplated by paragraph 7.  The Court of Appeal held that this failure did not deprive the Crown Court of the power to sentence, and the House of Lords did not agree in the later decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Clarke &amp; McDaid</span>.  The statutory context of these decisions no longer exists, but the approach remains valid.

If errors are made which are of a kind which do not undermine the jurisdiction of the court, but which mean that there has been prejudice or a substantial risk of unfairness then the same result will follow.  Correction of errors of this kind is the province of the Divisional Court and where appeals to this court have been brought which involve such errors it has often been necessary for the judges in the Court of Appeal Criminal Division to sit as a Divisional Court.  The usual method is to dispense with service of a claim form, to extend time if necessary, to grant permission to seek judicial review and then to quash the offending decision and make any further necessary orders.

In deciding how to proceed, the judge must bear in mind that a Magistrates’ Court dealing with an either way offence might have decided that it should not be committed for sentence.  The fact that it has wrongly come before the Crown Court should not result in a defendant being denied that possible outcome.  A Crown Court judge should also be aware that Magistrates’ Courts, particularly Youth Courts, may have a different approach to sentencing and a defendant who would wish to be sentenced in the lower court should not be deprived of the possibility that this may happen because of procedural failures by the prosecution.  We consider that it is only in cases where it is quite clear that the case should be dealt with by the Crown Court, or where the exercise which is being contemplated is only designed to tie up loose ends and avoid hearings in the Magistrates’ Court which are clearly unnecessary, that the section 66 power should be used.    </p>

It is not necessary for a judge to “reconstitute” himself or herself as anything.  It is, however, necessary to explain, with reasons, exactly what powers are being exercised and why.  This is so that all concerned are aware of the extent of any powers which are being employed, and so that the lawfulness or otherwise of what is being done can be considered expressly at the hearing and subsequently if necessary, on appeal or judicial review.  The Crown Court judge, in cases where the appeal route is important, should consider whether the proposed use of the power will create difficulties in that part of the result might be appealed to the Crown Court and part to the Court of Appeal Criminal Division.  If exercising the power (and the original Explanatory Notes to section 66 of the 2003 Act suggest that this is not a bar to its exercise) the judge must be explicit and clear about which sentences are imposed as a DJ(MC) and which as a judge of the Crown Court.  That must appear in the Order and, as we have said, must also appear in the records of the Magistrates’ Court.  We suggest that rigorous thought about these questions will reveal at least some of the cases where it would actually be better to leave the Magistrates’ Court to deal with its own work.  </p>

If there is an obviously bad committal, the Crown Court has no power to do anything because the origin of its jurisdiction is a committal which is at least valid on its face.  If there is no such committal the case has never left the Magistrates’ Court where jurisdiction remains.  It will usually be a matter for the prosecution to have the case listed there so that it can be sorted out.  The Crown Court has no power to do anything by way of an order to remit a case.  It will no doubt inform the Magistrates’ Court what has occurred, but that is not the same thing as making an order in a case where there is no jurisdiction.  Whether the Crown Court judge, acting under section 66, may deal with the matter from scratch instead of leaving it to the justices is a separate matter to which we will turn in the case of Moffat.  Such a course is technically open because the Magistrates’ Court is not <span style="font-style:italic">functus </span>but this does not mean that it will always be appropriate to proceed in this way.  If that is what is done, then again, the Magistrates’ Court must be informed what has been done in its name.  </p>

It is also misconceived.  These charges were indeed incompetently drawn and lacked proper particulars.  Each of them did, however, charge an offence known to law in each case against a named person who accepted his guilt and did not want any more particulars.  It is quite clear from his letter of April 2018, months before the charges were drawn, that he knew what he had done.  He gives an explanation of the exposure charge involving Z and the hide and seek game in order to try and assist.  The problem with the charges, in reality, was that they charged as sexual assault an attack on X which the judge said should really be an allegation of attempted or actual penetrative sexual assault.  It was established that there was no penetration of the child’s mouth, which meant that the activity could only be charged as an attempt, which was then done at the judge’s suggestion.  There was a concern expressed by the judge about duplicity, where she said:-  </p>

In such cases, if the charge which is dealt with by the Crown Court judge is substantially the same as that which had been committed then the defendant will have had all the necessary safeguards and they are not undermined by whatever defect now required correction.  Did Parliament intend that a failure to follow this procedure in those circumstances would render everything which followed a nullity?  This issue arises most clearly for decision in Mugenzi, rather than in Gould for the reason just stated.  We shall deal with it when we deal with his case below.  </p>

Her Honour Judge Moore did this in the case of Mugenzi when granting a prosecution application that the guilty plea to the original unamended charge which had been committed for sentence should be vacated so that the charge with the proper date range could be put.  Again, there was no objection to this course.  In Gould, the committal was wrongly quashed which presumably was intended to vacate the pleas.  In Moffat the case had been (twice) wrongly sent to the Crown Court for trial under section 51 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, so there were no pleas to be vacated.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.00in">We are prepared to accept that the court has a power to direct that a guilty plea be vacated even when the person who entered it does not seek that course, or even opposes it.  The discretion to allow a change of plea from guilty to not guilty has long been recognised, see for example <span style="font-style:italic">Plummer </span>[1902] 2 KB 339, and the review of the position in <span style="font-style:italic">R. v. KC </span>[2019] EWCA Crim 1632.  The discretion does not originate in statute, but at common law and it appears to us that it would be wrong to say that there are no circumstances in which a court could direct that guilty pleas are vacated contrary to the wishes of the defendant.  The criminal process throws up novel situations constantly and it is unwise to say that something may never happen.  The facts of <span style="font-style:italic">R v. Palazu </span>show that cases can reveal many unusual situations, and a degree of flexibility is required to meet extraordinary cases.  Such a power, though, must obviously only be exercised sparingly and when the interests of justice so require.  It is unlikely to be appropriately used in order to rescue the prosecution from a muddle of their own making.  More usually in cases where it appears that an important element has been misdescribed in the charge, to the adventitious advantage of the defendant, powers of amendment are more likely to be deployed, when available.  That may cause a defendant to seek to be allowed to vacate a plea, which would no doubt often be allowed.  (See <span style="font-style:italic">R. v. JW </span>(CACD 21 April 1999), cited in <span style="font-style:italic">Love &amp; Hyde</span>).    </p>

We have considered whether to make an order postponing publication of this judgment in Gould’s case until the conclusion of any trial which may take place if he is charged again with attempted rape and pleads not guilty.  We have concluded that such an order is not necessary for avoiding a substantial risk of prejudice to the administration of justice in those proceedings (which are probably “imminent”).  That is because the nature of the permitted reporting is constrained by the strict liability rule, and by the limited scope of the defence in section 4(1) of the Contempt of Court Act 1981.  It is inconceivable that Gould’s convictions on the existing charges and his confession when pleading guilty to attempted rape before Her Honour Judge Leigh would be excluded from evidence on any such trial.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.00in">We have reservations about the process conducted by His Honour Judge Cartwright because he was dealing with a case which had been sent by the justices on a completely false basis.  He concluded that the sending which was before him was bad on its face, and that he should sit as DJ(MC) to start the proceedings again.  He had jurisdiction to do this under section 66 as we have explained, but in many cases it would be wrong to proceed in this way nonetheless.  We have, in the end, concluded that it can be upheld in this case because of the concession by Mr. Smith, who has appeared for Moffat throughout, that the justices would inevitably have committed for sentence had the proper procedure been followed.  That concession is properly made.  On the facts of this case it was clear that the use of the section 66 power could not deprive Moffat of any procedural protection.  It follows that in many cases this power should not be used.  An offender who pleads guilty to a single offence of burglary of a dwelling and has only one previous conviction for that offence, perhaps of some age, might properly be dealt with by the Magistrates.  A category 3 burglary has a guideline starting point of a community order, and the sentencing range only extends to 26 weeks. It would be wrong to expose him without argument before the justices to the powers of the Crown Court simply because the prosecution has misinformed the court about his record.  Moffat is not such a case.  He has a terrible record (although not for dwelling house burglary prior to present events).  The first sending involved three offences of burglary.  Offences (i) and (ii) in the list at [28] above involved the burglary of a house at 0430am while the occupants were asleep in bed.  They were not disturbed.  Offence (ii) involves burgling the garage of the property on the same occasion where valuable property was stolen.   Offence (iv) involved another burglary at night of a house whose occupants were asleep.  On this occasion a motor vehicle was stolen using stolen car keys, and Moffat was found in the act of trying to steal another.  He ran off.  Valuable property was stolen.  These facts show that Moffat must have had at least one accomplice who escaped in the stolen car.  The justices sent him for trial because they were misinformed about his record, but had they been correctly informed they would inevitably have committed him for sentence.  That being so, we accept that His Honour Judge Cartwright acted appropriately in using his power under section 66 to regularise the position.  He was careful to comply with the section 17A Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 procedure and, if he was right to exercise the power, he did it properly.   He did not have power to quash the original sending, but we do, exercising our powers as a Divisional Court.  The original sending must be quashed in the same way as that in Gould.  It was not necessary for this to happen before His Honour Judge Cartwright could lawfully sit under section 66 of the 2003 Act to start the proceedings again, and to commit the case for sentence having followed the section 17A procedure correctly.  We have suggested at [80] above that the Rules Committees should consider how these superseded committals or sendings might be efficiently tidied up.  </p>

That judge would hear any submissions which may be made and rule on them.  In view of what we say about Judge Cartwright’s decision at [127] above, it appears likely that the result would have been a committal of these cases to the Crown Court for sentence.  However, on investigation it has become apparent that there were four charges before the Magistrates’ Court on the 7 January 2021, and there are concerns about the state of the documentation.  There were two charges or burglary and two of theft.  The provisions of section 17A(1) and (3) of the Magistrates’ Court require an information and a charge which must be written down respectively.  The existence of these documents in proper form needs to be checked.  Further, as we have said above, there are no rules prescribing the way in which the Magistrates’ Court would record the decision of a judge of this court acting under section 66 of the 2003 Act, or how the Crown Court would record a committal for sentence made in this way.  A decision on bail would have to be made, and, if the committal were in custody, recorded properly and communicated to the prison.  The possibility of error in this respect is such that we have decided simply to quash the order made by the Magistrates’ Court on 7 January 2020 and all subsequent proceedings on it.  The effect of that is that the case remains in the Magistrates’ Court and the prosecution may serve proper documentation on Mr. Moffat and his legal advisers and have the case listed before the Magistrates’ Court so that, if it is considered proper, and if Mr. Moffat pleads guilty to them, he can be committed properly for sentence to the Crown Court.  That listing should take place within 14 days of this judgment being handed down.  If that is what happens, we would request that the subsequent Crown Court proceedings should be dealt with by His Honour Judge Burbidge, Q.C., the Honorary Recorder of Worcester.  This is an example of this court exercising the caution we have enjoined on all courts before exercising the powers of a DJ(MC) under section 66 of the 2003 Act.  </p>

The term is unaffected by the removal of one of the two sentences of 12 weeks detention for the two alleged breaches of the SHPOs in August 2019.  The breach which we have quashed related to an attempt to start a consensual relationship with an 18 year old woman.  The possession of a prohibited phone at the same time was a sufficiently serious breach to justify the sentence of 12 weeks on its own.  Its occurrence soon after the imposition of the suspended sentence order and shortly before the further October breaches involving phones required consecutive terms.  The contents of the reports on Brown show that there is no mitigation apart from youth, and, given the history, the time had come for a significant custodial sentence.  </p>

There was a serious and sustained breach of trust.  The starting point of 5 years fell to be reduced in the range because the starting point is based on a loss of £300,000, and the sum stolen in this case was a little over £220,000.  Further discounts were then to be made to reflect a series of separate matters of mitigation.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.00in">Second is the fact that Mugenzi has lived under a credible threat of assassination by the government of Rwanda since 2011.  He received an <span style="font-style:italic">Osman </span>warning then and has received regular police input ever since.  His family are at some risk, as well as him.  In extradition proceedings in London in 2015 he gave evidence in a public court, as is recorded in the decision of the Divisional Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Government of Rwanda v. Nteziryayo and others</span> [2017] EWHC 1912 (Admin).  The evidence was accepted.  It is inappropriate for a court in dealing with sentencing to express preference for one side or the other in a political argument, and it would be wrong to do so.  The <span style="font-style:italic">Osman </span>warning is a matter of record, however, and is to be taken into account as a seriously adverse event for Mugenzi and his family whatever the rights and wrongs of the political argument.  Further, the act of assisting in the system of justice in the UK is a laudable one, especially where it involved credit.  We consider that this is a matter of mitigation which was not sufficiently taken into account by the judge.  The strain of living under such conditions can only be imagined.  The cause of the offending appears to have been the development of a gambling habit.  There was, however, no evidence of any link between the assassination threat and the commission of this offence.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.00in">It is clear that the judge made a significant discount from the starting point of 5 years before allowing the plea discount.  That first reduction must have been itself about one third, to take the starting point down from 60 months to a little under 40 months.  The reduction for the guilty plea then reduced it further to the final sentence of 27 months.  It is clear that the judge had all the facts of the case and the matters which properly went to mitigate the sentence firmly in mind when reaching the sentence she did.  Theft of this amount of money, over this period of time, and from a Church when in a position of trust, would commonly attract a sentence of 5 years or thereabouts after a trial.  It was a matter for the judge to weigh up what she knew about the offence and the offender and to make an allowance for this mitigation, which she clearly did.  In our judgment, although we have given leave to appeal, the sentence was not manifestly excessive.  </p>
