The applicant Daniel Payne was sentenced to 18 years imprisonment with 366 days to count towards sentence. Payne also pleaded guilty to counts of producing a controlled drug, possession of ammunition without a certificate and possession of a prohibited weapon, to which he was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment of 2 years, 12 months and 12 months respectively. Of the co-defendants, Jamie Green was sentenced to 24 years imprisonment with 202 days to count towards sentence, Zoran Dresic was sentenced to 24 years imprisonment with 202 days to count towards sentence – he also pleaded guilty to a count of possession of a false identity document to which he was sentenced to a concurrent term of 12 months imprisonment – and Scott Birtwistle was sentenced to 14 years detention in a young offender institution with 66 days to count towards sentence.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.84in">On 31 May 2010, 250kg of cocaine was recovered from the sea in Freshwater Bay on the Isle of Wight. The drugs were wrapped and contained in rucksacks (waterproof camping holdalls) which were joined together by rope and attached to a buoy. It was the prosecution case at trial that the applicants and their co-defendants had been involved in the importation of the cocaine into the UK through ‘coopering’ in the English Channel. The cocaine was said to have been transported from Brazil by a commercial  container ship, the <span style="font-style:italic">MSC Oriane</span> (hereafter, “the <span style="font-style:italic">Oriane</span>”). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.84in">The applicants were said to have collected the cocaine from the sea, into which it had been jettisoned from the <span style="font-style:italic">Oriane</span>, using the fishing vessel <span style="font-style:italic">Galwad-Y-Mor</span> (hereafter, “the <span style="font-style:italic">Galwad</span>”). The co-defendant Green was a lobster fisherman and the owner and captain of the <span style="font-style:italic">Galwad</span>. The others on board were Payne and the co-defendants Dresic and Birtwistle. The evidence of a possibility of collection at sea by the <span style="font-style:italic">Galwad</span> came from the expert called by the prosecution, Paul Davidson, a master mariner and marine consultant, who was then with Brookes Bell, being a firm of marine, scientific and technical consultants and surveyors. His expert evidence was that the track of the <span style="font-style:italic">Galwad</span> crossed that of the <span style="font-style:italic">Oriane</span> shortly after the container ship passed by. The tracks of the two vessels and their alleged crossing at about 00.30 GMT on 30 May 2010 were plotted by Mr Davidson on an Admiralty chart which was before the jury. We should say that, throughout this judgment, when we refer to times, we shall use GMT for consistency. </p>

Jonathan Beere’s telephone was in contact with Jamie Green’s telephone soon after the <span style="font-style:italic">Galwad</span> had left Freshwater Bay on its return to the Isle of Wight and was in contact with a phone held by Austin (the ‘John Wilson’ phone) soon after the crew of the <span style="font-style:italic">Galwad </span>disembarked at Yarmouth and following their arrests. Daniel Dugic was named on the indictment but never arrested. Edward Austin was named on the indictment and convicted at a subsequent separate trial. The phones associated with Dugic and Austin and the 5034 phone stopped being used at the same time on 31 May 2010 in the vicinity of Gatwick Airport soon after Green, Payne and Dresic had been arrested.

Dresic was a Montenegrin national. He arrived in the UK on 27 May 2010 having travelled on the Eurostar from Brussels on a false passport in the name Veljko Protic. The passport showed he had left Sarajevo on 26 May 2010 and travelled to Brussels via Budapest. The prosecution case was that he was present to oversee the safe collection of and subsequent onward delivery of the cocaine on behalf of Austin and Dugic. </p>

At the time Green was on board the <span style="font-style:italic">Galwad</span> having sailed to Weymouth. The group left the restaurant and boarded a hovercraft bound for the Isle of Wight.

One was registered with the false details of John Wilson, 32 New Cross Road, London SE14. The prosecution case was that this phone was retained by Austin. The other phone was registered with the false details of Tony Perelli, 24 Knaresborough Place, London SW5. This phone was recovered from Dresic on his arrest. Upon examination it was found to have been in contact with only one number, listed under “Dexsa” in the contact list. The prosecution case was that the Dexsa phone was in the possession of Dugic.  </p>

The track of that vessel was plotted by Mr Davidson on the Admiralty chart using AIS data obtained from a Dutch company called QPS. The AIS data was derived from the <span style="font-style:italic">Oriane</span>’s external GPS transmitter which was almost certainly located close to the wheelhouse, in accordance with normal on-board practice, although no evidence was ever obtained from the <span style="font-style:italic">Oriane</span> itself. There was an 11-minute gap in the AIS data from QPS between about 00.26 and 00.38 possibly because the vessel was out of the range of the various shore stations from which the AIS data was collected. Mr Davidson plotted a “course made good” line on the chart between the two positions for which there was AIS data. The <span style="font-style:italic">Galwad</span> was fitted with an Olex Marine Navigation System (“Olex”) which used GPS technology to plot its position and record its past journeys. Mr Davidson accordingly used the data from the <span style="font-style:italic">Galwad</span>’s Olex to plot the track taken by the <span style="font-style:italic">Galwad</span>, including in the QPS data gap period, on the same Admiralty chart.  </p>

Attached to this rope were what appeared to be bags or life jackets. At one end the rope was attached to an orange buoy which he pulled onto his boat followed by one of the bags. He saw that it was a rucksack or holdall which appeared to have been closed with tape. Upon cutting it open he discovered a number a packages containing white powder. He then contacted the coastguard. When the police attended, they found a number of rucksacks floating in the water which had been tied together in the same configuration as is used in lobster fishing, where lobster pots are linked to a long length of rope (the ‘backline’) via shorter lengths of rope (‘legs’ or ‘stropes’). This configuration suggested that whoever had tied the holdalls together had some experience of lobster fishing. One end of the backline was attached to a buoy, the other end was attached to a makeshift anchor comprising a length of heavy chain and some iron plates. 11 rucksacks were recovered, containing a total of 255 packages, each containing approximately 1kg of cocaine powder, at between 74% and 92% purity. The estimated wholesale value of the cocaine was £13,387,500 and the estimated street value was £53,857,788.  </p>

After disclosure of the surveillance evidence, he admitted that he had lied and said that he had gone to Southsea at Green’s request to collect a new crew member. In fact there were three people when he got there and he travelled back with them to the Isle of Wight, where he took them to meet Green. Dresic had stayed with Green whilst Beere took the other two men to the ferry at Ryde. When the police told him about the two phones purchased in Newport, he then said that he had in fact dropped all three men in Newport and arranged to collect them an hour later. They had then all gone to a pub where they met Green. When told one of the phones was subsequently in contact with him, he said that having dropped the two men off at the ferry, they had then called to say they had missed it, so he had driven them to another port. He could not remember further calls.  </p>

In a subsequent interview he changed this account, saying the catch was “very very minimal”, about 20 to 30 crabs and a couple of lobsters. In fact, no fish were caught. </p>

Green maintained in evidence that Dresic was a casual labourer. During the trip he had been ill, making fishing difficult, so Green said that he had used the Olex to map the seabed, looking for ground which would be attractive to lobsters. He said specifically that the vessel’s movements in the shipping lanes were to do with mapping a ridge and some holes where lobsters might be found. We have already referred to the fact that, in his evidence, he did not deny that the <span style="font-style:italic">Galwad</span> had crossed in the wake of the container ship and made the particular very slow-speed movements in or near its wake, though he denied collecting the drugs, explaining the reason for these as mapping the seabed. He also denied jettisoning the drugs in Freshwater Bay, saying now that the items thrown overboard were rubbish bags as we have described. His explanation for the telephone calls whilst they were at sea was that Dugic was concerned about Dresic’s condition.  </p>

In its Final Statement of Reasons, dated 22 November 2017, the CCRC declined to refer the case, concluding that there was no real possibility that the Court of Appeal would quash the convictions based upon the submissions put forward. The CCRC also concluded that there were no further lines of enquiry that it could undertake which could lead to new evidence that could impact upon the safety of the convictions. It is not necessary to look at the detail of the Final Statement of Reasons since (a) many of the issues raised in the submissions are no longer pursued in the present applications and (b) the Final Statement was issued before the ECDIS data from the <span style="font-style:italic">Vigilant</span>, which forms the primary basis of the present applications, was made available to the applicants. </p>

An important aspect of the submissions made concerned alleged police misconduct within <span style="font-style:italic">Operation Disorient</span>. This focused on the inconsistencies in the evidence associated with the surveillance operation and the observations of DC Jeans and DC Dunne. This included criticism of the SOCA officers involved, DC Breen, the surveillance commander, and DC Parry, the loggist, and their involvement in the embellishment of the observation evidence. Reliance was placed upon the fact that, in an unrelated case <span style="font-style:italic">R v McGuffie </span>[2015] EWCA Crim 307, this Court allowed an appeal concerning incriminating observations by a squad which included Breen and Parry which were recorded by them by way of late-added addenda but which were disputed by the accused. That appeal was allowed on the basis that the failure to disclose in that case the difficulties with the Freshwater Bay observation evidence in the present case had deprived Mr McGuffie of a fair trial, by denying him the opportunity to rely upon the striking similarities so as to cast doubt on the honesty of some of the same officers.  </p>

The aircraft camera operator, Mr Whittall, did not mention flying over Freshwater Bay in his statement dated 15 June 2010, but radar records in the ECDIS data showed what was likely to be a single surveillance aircraft flying over the area at 18.02. The applicants’ case on this Ground is that, if this was the UKBA surveillance aircraft, its failure to notice 250kg of cocaine in the Bay, minutes after its alleged deposit by the <span style="font-style:italic">Galwad</span>, is so implausible as to exclude the possibility of, or at least cast doubt on, this central event alleged by the prosecution. The applicants rely upon a draft further witness statement for Mr Whittall, and what appears to be a final (albeit unsigned) version, dating from 2013 found in the papers for an Independent Police Complaints Commission (“IPCC”) inquiry into the conduct of the investigation. We deal with the detail later in the judgment but, in essence, the applicants argue that the first draft statement suggests the possibility that the plane may have taken off from Bournemouth Airport up to twenty minutes earlier than recorded in the aircraft’s surveillance log. This would make it a distinct possibility, it is said, that this was the aircraft seen on the radar flying over the Bay at 18.02. </p>

That is illustrated by the diagrams at Appendix 3 to this judgment. The yellow line is, again, a course made good line plotted from the ARPA-based positions for the <span style="font-style:italic">Oriane</span>. The orange parallel lines above and below it represent the outer bounds of the Gaussian (or Normal) probability distribution of error, treating the recorded point data as the distribution mean, to 3 standard deviations (over 99.5% certainty). The difference between the two diagrams is only that one assumes a slightly smaller range than the other for the inherent imprecision in azimuth bearing measurement by the <span style="font-style:italic">Vigilant</span>’s radar. </p>

Moreover, whatever the minute chance that that would be so, there would be an equal and opposite minute chance that she was on the lower orange boundary line. For example, Professor Stupples explained that even in the first diagram, with slightly larger assumed radar azimuth measurement error range, the Gaussian distribution calculation gives 95% certainty of being within ±26m of the yellow centre line, i.e. a 95% chance that at any given time the <span style="font-style:italic">Oriane</span>’s actual, exact position was between 26m ‘above’ and 26m ‘below’ the yellow centre line. </p>

We note that trial counsel for Mr Green, having been asked specifically about the black line, realistically accepted that using it rather than the red line would not have materially altered the defence or improved its prospects.

It was a major plank of the prosecution case that the <span style="font-style:italic">Galwad</span> crossed the wake of the <span style="font-style:italic">Oriane</span>, and conducted the allegedly suspect very slow speed manoeuvres near to that wake in the few minutes after the <span style="font-style:italic">Oriane</span> passed, having first positioned herself ahead of the <span style="font-style:italic">Oriane</span> to allow her to pass (bearing in mind that the <span style="font-style:italic">Oriane</span> was making way at a rate of knots far in excess of the <span style="font-style:italic">Galwad</span>’s capabilities – she would not have been able to get near to the path of the <span style="font-style:italic">Oriane</span> promptly to collect a drop if she had started from astern of the <span style="font-style:italic">Oriane</span>). We do not regard as credible the notion that the <span style="font-style:italic">Galwad</span> did not come close enough to the <span style="font-style:italic">Oriane</span> or her path for coopering ever to have been a possibility, or never crossed the <span style="font-style:italic">Oriane</span>’s wake, and yet Green accepted and testified to the jury that she did both. </p>

There is very little evidence for that. The agreed expert evidence is that the speed and steering pattern of the alleged coopering manoeuvre was similar to past seabed mapping patterns, but that is a different point. Green said in cross-examination that “<span style="font-style:italic">You do get times when the vessels get very close</span>”, and that his boat had been hit once. The <span style="font-style:italic">Oriane</span> was a laden deep sea container ship, nearly 300m in length and around 40m broad. The <span style="font-style:italic">Galwad</span> was a tiny dot in comparison, just 12m in length. It is not remotely credible that, on this final voyage immediately after which Green was arrested, the <span style="font-style:italic">Galwad</span> should never have come as close to the leviathan as the prosecution said, and yet Green, if innocent, failed to remember that and therefore failed to challenge the claim. </p>

However, as to (a) Professor Stupples did not in fact use all available data for when both targets were visible (and we prefer and accept in any event Mr Franks’ opinion that that was no valid basis for limiting the data comparison exercise), and as to (b) the <span style="font-style:italic">Galwad</span> did not get further from the <span style="font-style:italic">Vigilant</span> than at the start of Professor Stupples’ review period until considerably later than 01.00.  Because of that, we regard Professor Stupples’ <span style="font-style:italic">Galwad</span> data comparison as less valuable than Mr Franks’ comprehensive study, although the basic result – a variable azimuth error, on average 0.7º clockwise – is consistent with it. We add that since Professor Stupples was comparing ARPA-based ECDIS records with the <span style="font-style:italic">Galwad</span> Olex data, and it remains common ground that the latter are accurate and reliable, the azimuth error he found must come from the <span style="font-style:italic">Vigilant</span>’s ARPA system or the inputs it was using. </p>

It was not clear to us that the two data pairs had been chosen for any reason other than that they had that characteristic. We consider that the presentation by Professor Stupples of that spot check as if it evidenced or corroborated the accuracy of the ARPA record seriously undermined the credibility of his evidence. Appendix 4 includes Mr Franks’ Figure 6, a scatter diagram like his Figure 2 but for the <span style="font-style:italic">Kornati</span> only as target vessel. It is immediately apparent that a proper use of the available data should have led Prof Stupples to conclude that it could not be said that the <span style="font-style:italic">Kornati</span> ARPA record provided a good match with the AIS record, such that the former did not require correction, and indeed should have led him to realise the azimuth discrepancy pattern described and explained by Mr Franks. </p>

As we have already noted, Ground 2 concerns another vessel disclosed by the <span style="font-style:italic">Vigilant’s </span>ECDIS data, designated as radar target A50 on the data. The experts agreed that this could be a high speed small craft such as a RHIB. The applicants’ case was that this was either another suspect vessel or a law enforcement RHIB which then went on to check Freshwater Bay after the <span style="font-style:italic">Galwad </span>had passed through. A50 last appears on the ECDIS data at about 18.59 on 30 May 2010, travelling at about 46.5 knots in the general direction of Freshwater Bay, although it was lost on the radar before it reached the Bay. It is to be noted, therefore, that there is no evidence that A50 went into Freshwater Bay as opposed to moving in that general direction.

The <span style="font-style:italic">Vigilant’s </span>own RHIB was not deployed until much later, at about 21.00 as shown in her deck log entry for that time: <span style="font-style:italic">“Launch RHIB”</span>.

Mr Bennathan QC suggested that the Court should consider the evidence that there was no other law enforcement vessel in the vicinity with caution because there was some confusion about the presence of law enforcement planes, evidently a reference to the applicants’ case on Ground 4.

Furthermore, Green lied about this in interview, denying that anything had been thrown overboard, although he later accepted at trial that items had been thrown overboard as observed by DC Jeans and DC Dunne, whilst contending that these were rubbish and latrine bags, an explanation the jury rejected.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.84in">Yet further, even if it were arguable that the aircraft flew over the Bay minutes after the <span style="font-style:italic">Galwad </span>left and failed to spot the drugs, that would be only one piece of evidence which the jury would consider in the context of the other evidence. As we summarised at paragraph 160 above, there is strong, albeit circumstantial, evidence supporting the prosecution case that it was the <span style="font-style:italic">Galwad </span> which deposited the drugs in the Bay. </p>

Ground 4 cannot be considered in isolation. For the reasons we have set out in detail in relation to Grounds 1 and 3, the evidence now available in relation to the course of the <span style="font-style:italic">Oriane</span> considerably strengthens the prosecution case against these applicants. In all the circumstances, we do not consider that the evidence now available in relation to Ground 4 affords the applicants with any arguable ground of appeal.  </p>
