Leave was limited to Ground (iv)(c) – in which it was  asserted that the judge had erred in finding that a small parcel of land to the west of Silt Pit Lane in Wyberton, near Boston in Lincolnshire, which was worth £62,000, and which the Appellant had acquired in the spring of 2013 via a Mortgage Works (UK) plc (part of the Nationwide Building Society) interest only “Buy to Let” mortgage on a house at 64 Norfolk Street in Boston (of which he had been the sole registered owner since 2008), was (applying the property held assumption) part of the Appellant’s benefit from his criminal lifestyle. Immediately thereafter, and without inviting the attendance of the Prosecution, who had not been notified of the hearing of the renewed application, the Court proceeded to allow the appeal on that Ground, and thus reduced the amount of the confiscation order by £62,000 to £104,232.93 – see [2020] EWCA Crim 18.  </p>

The more so as , in the Respondent’s   <marker name="tab"/>Notice, which was before the Court, the Prosecution had stated in a recital   <marker name="tab"/>at the outset that: “<span style="font-style:italic">This document contains a summary of the Prosecution   </span><marker name="tab"/><span style="font-style:italic">submissions in response to the lengthy and numerous Grounds.

The principal point relied on by Mr Jeyes relates to the Judge’s finding on benefit, relating to the land adjacent Silt Pit Lane, where the benefit found was £62,000. This was land purchased with a mortgage on Norfolk Street, as to which the Judge’s conclusion was that the mortgage application was fraudulent in two respects. First, he found that the application failed to disclose that the beneficial interest in the property being mortgaged was the applicant’s mother,  rather than the applicant himself. That was indeed the applicant’s case – namely, that his mother had the relevant beneficial interest –  although, in fact, the judge did not accept that case. If that is so, there  is perhaps an element of inconsistency in saying that the mortgage application was fraudulent for failure to declare a beneficial interest which, in the event, the judge was not persuaded did exist. The judge also found that the application was fraudulent because the applicant failed to answer truthfully a question on the application form about any previous criminal convictions. He answered that he did not have such convictions, when in fact he did, although they were spent. The judge said that the only permissible, honest answer would either have been ‘Yes’, or else to decline to answer, on the basis that the lender was not entitled to ask for such information insofar as it might relate to convictions that were now spent. We accept that the judge was wrong in that respect. The applicant was entitled to answer ‘No’ to that question, because his convictions were, in fact, spent.  </span></p>

On the facts found by the judge, the mortgage funds were raised through a mortgage on the Norfolk Street property, in relation to which the judge also found that the assumptions were not rebutted, and therefore the Norfolk Street property had to be treated as part of the relevant property. A mortgage raised on that property, which is then used to buy adjacent property, would still be subject to the same considerations, meaning that the assumptions were not rebutted. Plainly, overall, the judge was not persuaded by the applicant’s evidence in relation to the properties in which he claimed that his mother had beneficial interests, and that affected the whole approach  to these properties and the judge’s conclusion that the relevant assumptions were not rebutted. </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">we respectfully agree with the observation of the court in Yasain that the jurisdiction of the CACD to re-open concluded proceedings is probably best confined to “procedural errors”. Indeed, at least generally, we see the Yasain jurisdiction as directed towards exceptional circumstances involving (as submitted by the Amicus) the correction of clear and undisputed procedural errors “where it is simpler and more expedient for the court itself to re-open the appeal and correct a manifest injustice without the need for further litigation”. Such an approach is healthy as it does not altogether exclude room for pragmatism in practice, while confining its scope to appropriately very limited circumstances, where, even if recourse to the CCRC was otherwise available, it would be a wholly unnecessary exercise. As it seems to us, fashioning the jurisdiction in this manner accords with authority, principle, practicality and policy – not least the great importance of finality in criminal proceedings;  </span>
