	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This judgment, to which each member of the court has contributed, concerns forty-two men and women who were employed by Post Office Limited, or its predecessors the Post Office and Post Office Counters Limited, as sub-postmasters, sub-postmistresses, managers or counter assistants.  They were all prosecuted by their employer and convicted of crimes of dishonesty.  Many years later, their cases have been referred to this court by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (“CCRC”).  We have to decide whether their prosecutions were an abuse of the process of the court and whether their convictions are unsafe.  In particular, we must consider issues as to the reliability of the computerised accounting system, “Horizon”, which was in use in branch post offices during the relevant period. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">For convenience, we shall refer to each of the forty-two persons as an appellant, and to each reference as an appeal.  For the purposes of these appeals, nothing turns on any distinction between the Post Office, Post Office Counters Limited and Post Office Limited, and nothing turns on any distinction between the positions of sub-postmaster, sub-postmistress, manager or counter assistant, or between the locations of the appellants’ places of work.  We shall therefore refer to all the appellants as “SPMs”, to their places of work as “post offices” or “branches”, and to their employer as “POL”.  As POL was the prosecuting authority in each case, we shall use the same abbreviation when referring to the respondent to these appeals. </p>

Often, the branch post office is situated inside a shop or other business, and the SPM is also, but separately, the proprietor of that business.  Branch post offices, and their SPMs, play a key role in the lives of local communities.   </p>

All prosecutions in this country are brought in the name of the Queen, but each of these cases was commenced and pursued  by POL acting as a private prosecutor.  Royal Mail Group was the prosecuting authority prior to 1 April 2012, when POL became a separate body and took over the prosecutorial function.  However, nothing turns on that change.  The appellants were variously charged with offences of theft, fraud and false accounting.  They either pleaded guilty to, or were convicted of, such offences.  Inevitably, their convictions resulted in not only the sanctions imposed by the court, including in many cases sentences of immediate imprisonment, but also the loss of their previous good character and consequent social disgrace.  Very sadly, three of the appellants – Julian Wilson, Peter Holmes and Dawn O’Connell – have not lived to see the outcome of their appeals. </p>

POL’s stance was that it was up to an individual SPM to prove that a shortfall was not his or her responsibility: if the SPM could not do so, he or she would have to make good the shortfall.

Those to whom the report was copied included POL’s Head of Criminal Law.  In summary, the report stated that Horizon (both Legacy and Online) was robust, and that the prosecutions which had given rise to adverse comments were cases in which “we remain satisfied that this money was missing due to theft in the branch”.  It noted that the record of prosecutions supported the assertion that the SPMs had been guilty rather than Horizon being faulty, but observed that this “does not stop speculation about the system”.  It went on to consider the merits of an independent review, not because of any doubt about Horizon but in order to help give others “the same confidence that we have”.  The decision was that, no matter what opinions might be obtained, “people will still ask ‘what if?’ and the defence will always ask questions that require answers beyond the report”.

It will draw on evidence from Fraser J’s judgments and the experiences of affected SPMs and will identify what key lessons must be learned for the future.  It expects to submit its findings and recommendations later this year.  The terms of reference of the Inquiry do not include POL’s prosecution function or matters of criminal law. </p>

Some of these are identified at [542] above. The first document in that paragraph of this judgment dates from November 2000. At [41] I deal with part of an internal Post Office report from as recently as June 2014 – other parts have been redacted – that make it clear that steps had to be taken within the Post Office to “ensure consistency of accounts and enable a higher chance of detecting errors in accounts due to problems with Horizon”. The Post Office’s position in this litigation remains that Horizon is what is called “robust” and that none of the Claimants experienced shortfalls or discrepancies in their branch accounts due to problems caused by Horizon. Further consideration of this will occur in subsequent judgments and after the Horizon Issues trial.” </p>

Fraser J at [911] accepted that it was not necessary to consult the audit data in every case where a transaction correction was considered.  But, he said, it should be consulted when there was a dispute between POL and an SPM about a branch account and about who or what was to blame, and he could think of no sensible reason not to consult the audit data in such a scenario.

The management information is confusing, contradictory, has been shown to be wrong and requires numerous assumptions or a “take it from me” type of approach on the part of a questioner.

Mr Latif had been a trainer, entrusted by POL to train other SPMs.  His evidence was nonetheless challenged by POL, whose witness on this point asserted that the sum could not have disappeared as Mr Latif had described.  Fraser J accepted Mr Latif’s evidence and at [928]-[929] expressed his view as follows:  </p>

The approach by the Post Office to the evidence of someone such as Mr Latif demonstrates a simple institutional obstinacy or refusal to consider any possible alternatives to their view of Horizon, which was maintained regardless of the weight of factual evidence to the contrary. That approach by the Post Office was continued, even though now there is also considerable expert evidence to the contrary as well (and much of it agreed expert evidence on the existence of numerous bugs). </p>

It is nonetheless possible for fresh evidence to be admitted and for an appeal to be allowed in such circumstances: see <span style="font-style:italic">R v Jones</span> [2019] EWCA Crim 1059 at [25].  In <span style="font-style:italic">R v Togher and others</span> it was held that a conviction may be quashed on grounds of abuse of process even when a guilty plea has been entered, though only if “it would be inconsistent with the due administration of justice to allow the pleas of guilty to stand” (see paragraph [33]).  In a case in which a defendant who has pleaded guilty appeals against his conviction on grounds of non-disclosure, the court must consider whether the plea was entered in ignorance of evidence going directly to his guilt or innocence.  As it was expressed in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Togher and others</span> at [59], the question is whether the guilty plea was “founded upon” the irregularity of non-disclosure.  In <span style="font-style:italic">R v Early and others</span> [2002] EWCA Crim 1904 at [18] the court emphasised the crucial importance of a prosecuting authority making full relevant disclosure before trial.  It held that a defendant who pleaded guilty at an early stage should not, if adequate disclosure had not been made, be in a worse position than a defendant who, as a consequence of an application to stay the proceedings as an abuse, benefited from further orders for disclosure culminating in the abandonment of proceedings against him. </p>

In relation to its duties as a private prosecutor, POL accepted that in cases where the reliability of the ARQ data was essential to the prosecution case, it had a duty to assess that data; and that in view of the limitations on the extent to which SPMs could investigate discrepancies in Horizon, POL had a duty to investigate to ensure that the evidence was accurate and to pursue reasonable lines of enquiry raised by the SPM.  It was further accepted that Fujitsu had the ability to insert, inject, edit or delete transaction data or data in branch accounts; had the ability to implement fixes in Horizon that had the potential to affect transaction data or data in branch accounts; and </p>

The three exceptions in group C are cases in which POL contends that the reliability of the Horizon data was not essential to the prosecution case.  The appellants concerned argue to the contrary, and we shall address their respective cases later.  POL accepts that if the court rejects its primary submission, and finds that the reliability of Horizon data was essential to all or any of those three cases, then the same concessions as to category 1 abuse would be made in their cases as in the other 39 cases.  Thus the three cases in group C do not involve any departure from POL’s concessions as to failures in investigation and disclosure: they are distinguished from the other cases on the basis that they are not “Horizon cases” at all. </p>

The basis of the objection was that POL’s contract with Fujitsu placed limitations upon the number of requests for ARQ data which could be made each year.  In short, consideration of the data for disclosure to the defence appears to have been resisted, not on the grounds that it was not required by law, but on the grounds that POL’s contractual arrangements with Fujitsu made it costly and inconvenient to comply with its legal obligations as a prosecutor. </p>

The item was described as “Article relating to integrity of Horizon system, supplied with accompanying letter by defendant”.  The reason for sensitivity was said to be “Could be used as mitigation, ie to blame Horizon system for loss”.  Given that the item appears to have been a document supplied by the defence, the appellant was not in fact deprived of material she should have seen; but the important point for present purposes is that a POL employee acting as Disclosure Officer felt it appropriate to treat a document as sensitive, and withhold it from disclosure, because it could be used to assist the defence.  Such an approach to disclosure is plainly wrong, but it does not appear that any action was taken by anyone on behalf of POL to correct the officer’s serious error. </p>

They submit that these are not cases of “simple” non-disclosure: the non-disclosure was caused by apparent institutional reluctance on the part of POL to investigate and disclose anything which would or could compromise the perceived integrity of Horizon.  But for POL’s conduct of the investigations and prosecutions, the appellants would not have been prosecuted.  There was no urgency for these cases to be prosecuted, and nothing mitigates the conduct of POL in prosecuting the appellants whilst failing to investigate obviously relevant matters and failing to make necessary disclosure.  No fine balance of competing public interests is necessary in the circumstances of these cases: everything about POL’s conduct undermines public confidence in their role as prosecutor, and the public interest in prosecuting serious crime was largely extinguished.   </p>

They point out that when the appellant said in cross-examination at his trial that he did not know whether money was missing or there was an accounting problem, it was put to him by prosecution counsel that he knew there was no accounting problem and he was a thief.  They emphasise that POL was victim, investigator and prosecutor in respect of the alleged crime, with a financial interest in a successful prosecution.  They submit that POL was motivated by a desire to preserve a false confidence in Horizon, even if that might lead to miscarriages of justice, and the reality was only revealed after the High Court litigation which POL fiercely contested. </p>

The fact that there had been those issues does not mean that POL knew or believed there were other issues which continued after rollout.  POL was entitled to rely on Fujitsu’s assurances that the identified issues had been resolved.  They therefore submit that conduct by POL which might result in an adverse finding in relation to a prosecution in 2010, when awareness of Horizon issues had grown, should not necessarily result in an adverse finding in relation to a prosecution in 2001.  They suggest that the CCRC adopted a broad-brush approach to all the cases, which this court should not take.  They point out that particular bugs in Horizon, identified at particular times, were resolved by Fujitsu and could not affect later cases.  They concede that the past existence of such bugs remained relevant because they should in later prosecutions have been considered for disclosure.  But, they ask rhetorically, at what point did it become no longer reasonable to rely upon what Fujitsu was saying about Horizon being robust?  They point out that Fraser J in his judgments did not need to consider, and did not consider, who in POL knew precisely what about Horizon, and when.  They submit that category 2 abuse does require consideration of the level of knowledge of a prosecutor in a particular case: it is submitted that there is a world of difference, so far as category 2 is concerned, between a prosecutor who was negligent or incompetent, and one who wilfully avoided the duties placed upon him.  No large-scale computerised system such as Horizon can be expected to be entirely bug-free, and the principal issues here relate to disclosure.   </p>

Those concessions relate to failures of investigation and disclosure in all the “Horizon cases” across a period of 12-13 years.  In each of those cases, there was no independent evidence of an actual shortfall, and it was essential to the prosecution case that the Horizon data was reliable.  We accept and adopt Fraser J’s findings that throughout the relevant period there were significant problems with Horizon, which gave rise to a material risk that an apparent shortfall in the branch accounts did not in fact reflect missing cash or stock, but was caused by one of the bugs, errors or defects in Horizon.  POL knew that there were problems with Horizon.  POL knew that SPMs around the country had complained of inexplicable discrepancies in the accounts.

In short, POL knew that there were serious issues about the reliability of Horizon.  If POL needed further information, it could have obtained it from Fujitsu.  It was POL’s clear duty to investigate all reasonable lines of enquiry, to consider disclosure and to make disclosure to the appellants of anything which might reasonably be considered to undermine its case.  Yet it does not appear that POL adequately considered or made relevant disclosure of problems with or concerns about Horizon in any of the cases at any point during that period.  On the contrary, it consistently asserted that Horizon was robust and reliable.  Nor does it appear that any attempt was made to investigate the assertions of SPMs that there must be a problem with Horizon.  The consistent failure of POL to be open and honest about the issues affecting Horizon can in our view only be explained by a strong reluctance to say or do anything which might lead to other SPMs knowing about those issues.  Those concerned with prosecutions of SPMs clearly wished to be able to maintain the assertion that Horizon data was accurate, and effectively steamrolled over any SPM who sought to challenge its accuracy.    </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">These pervasive failures of investigation and disclosure went in each case to the very heart of the prosecution.  Whatever charges were brought against an individual appellant, and whatever pleas may ultimately have been accepted, the whole basis of each prosecution was that money was missing from the branch account: there was an actual shortfall, which had been caused by theft on the part of the SPM, or at best had been covered up by false accounting or fraud on the part of the SPM.  But in the “Horizon cases”, there was no evidence of a shortfall other than the Horizon data.  If the Horizon data was not reliable, there was no basis for the prosecution.  The failures of investigation and disclosure prevented the appellants from challenging, or challenging effectively, the reliability of the data.  In short, POL as prosecutor brought serious criminal charges against the SPMs on the basis of Horizon data, and by its failures to discharge its clear duties it prevented them from having a fair trial on the issue of whether that data was reliable. </p>

But these are remarkable appeals, and the fact that similar considerations apply to numerous cases is not in these circumstances a bar to a finding of category 1 abuse. </p>

The appellants were denied the material which could have been used to question that assertion.  They were, moreover, in the very difficult position of being charged with offences of dishonesty committed in breach of their employer’s trust.  They are likely to have been advised that imprisonment is very often imposed for such offences, and that the mitigation which would be available to them if they pleaded guilty could therefore be of particular importance.  Many may well have felt that they had no real alternative but to plead guilty on the most favourable basis which could be agreed with POL. </p>

Within the exceptional class of case in which an issue of abuse of process is raised, it will often be abuse in one category only; and where both categories are raised, there may in practice often be a distinction between the matters relied on in each category.  It is not possible to generalise.  But as a matter of principle we see no reason why the same misconduct cannot provide the basis for a finding of both categories of abuse.  We therefore accept the appellants’ submission that, depending on the nature and degree of the abusive conduct, the same acts and/or omissions may both render a fair trial impossible (thus, category 1) and make it an affront to the conscience of the court to prosecute at all (and thus, category 2).   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">First, we reiterate that POL deliberately chose not to comply with its obligations in circumstances in which its prosecution of an SPM depended on the reliability of Horizon data.  It did so against a background of asserting that SPMs were liable to make good all losses and could lose their employment if they did not do so.  It did so despite the fact that POL itself had selected the SPMs as suitable persons to hold their position of trust.  In the High Court proceedings, one of the agreed facts was that POL “incurs expense and time-costs in recruiting (including advertising for applicants and assessing and selecting applicants) and training new Subpostmasters”.  Yet if Horizon showed a shortfall which an SPM did not accept as correct, POL invariably accepted the position shown by Horizon, refused to countenance any possibility that the apparent shortfall may be the result of an error or bug in the system, and was quick to assume dishonesty on the part of the SPM.  As we have seen, in internal documents relating to at least some cases, an SPM who attributed a shortfall to a system error was dismissed as “jumping on the Horizon bandwagon”.  These were very serious failures by POL to fulfil its obligations as a prosecutor.  We are driven to the conclusion that throughout the period covered by these prosecutions POL’s approach to investigation and disclosure was influenced by what was in the interests of POL, rather than by what the law required.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, whilst we agree in principle that any issue of abuse of process must be considered in the light of the facts and circumstances relevant to the specific individual case, we are faced in these appeals with clear evidence of systemic failures by POL over many years.  Given that the same failures occurred in case after case, year after year, we think that later events shed legitimate light on the approach of POL to earlier prosecutions.  We note that even the four cases in group A cover a period of 5 years, with the appellants being convicted between 2006 and 2011.  We also note that no document has been shown to us in which any POL employee or official made any adverse comment upon the incorrect approach demonstrated in the documents to which Fraser J, and we, have referred.  Nor have we seen any contemporaneous document criticising the misconduct which has caused POL to make concessions as to Ground 2 in relation to the four appellants in group A.  We see powerful force in the points that as late as summer 2013 it was still necessary for Mr Clarke to spell out basic principles, and that the response to his advice of at least some personnel was to suggest that information should not be recorded, in the hope that it would therefore not be disclosable.  We think it clear that throughout the relevant period, POL as prosecutor demonstrated, as Fraser J found in the Horizon Issues judgment at [928], “a simple institutional obstinacy or refusal to consider any possible alternatives to their view of Horizon, which was maintained regardless of the weight of factual evidence to the contrary”.  Moreover, the longer that approach persisted, the more POL was able to, and did, rely upon its own past abusive conduct by asserting that no previous challenge to Horizon had succeeded. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In those circumstances, we are unable to accept POL’s submission that in relation to Ground 2 there may be a distinction to be drawn in POL’s favour between the seriousness of its conduct at an earlier time, and the seriousness of its conduct at a later time.  POL knew that there were problems with Horizon which delayed its rollout.  It knew, as Fraser J found, that SPMs were reporting unexplained discrepancies and shortfalls from 2000 onwards.  The persistence of those reports made it impossible to assume that all the initial problems, and any subsequent teething problems, had been resolved.  It was able to obtain all relevant information from Fujitsu if it wanted to, and the fact that its own contractual arrangements meant that it would have to incur expense in doing so could not possibly justify its repeated failures to comply with its legal duties.  Moreover, to borrow Fraser J’s phrase (the Horizon Issues judgment at [1018]), POL “ought to have known how its own system works”.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, POL as prosecutor knew that the consequences of conviction for an SPM would be, and were, severe.  Later in this judgment we will mention individual cases, but it is important here to state that many of these appellants went to prison; those that did not suffered other penalties imposed by the courts; all would have experienced the anxiety associated with what they went through; all suffered financial losses, in some cases resulting in bankruptcy; some suffered breakdowns in family relationships; some were unable to find or retain work as a result of their convictions – causing further financial and emotional burdens; some suffered breakdowns in health; all suffered the shame and humiliation of being reduced from a respected local figure to a convicted criminal; and three – all “Horizon cases” – have gone to their graves carrying that burden.  Inevitably, the families of the SPMs have also suffered.  In each of the “Horizon cases” it is now rightly conceded that those human costs and consequences were suffered after the denial by POL of a fair trial.  We unhesitatingly accept and endorse Mr Moloney’s submission that these were far more than cases of “simple” nondisclosure. </p>

If the full picture had been disclosed, as it should have been, none of these prosecutions would have taken the course it did before the Crown Court.  No judge would have been placed in the unhappy position of learning – as some judges (or retired judges) will do if they read this judgment – that they unwittingly sentenced a person who had been prevented by the prosecutor from having a fair trial. </p>

The charges were serious, but in all the “Horizon cases” the foundation of the charges – namely, that there was an actual shortfall – would have been in issue if the full picture had been known.  There was no reason why a prosecution had to be hurried through as a matter of urgency, and no excuse for POL’s failure to fulfil its duties.  Moreover, whilst it is not necessary for an accused who relies on category 2 abuse to prove that the prosecutor acted in bad faith, we are troubled by contemporaneous internal documents in which POL expressed concern that disclosure in one case of problems with Horizon could have an impact on other cases.  Public confidence in the criminal justice system would be severely damaged if a prosecuting authority were permitted to give priority to such a consideration over compliance with its duties as a prosecutor.   </p>

We are in no position to make, and it is not necessary for us to make, any finding as to whether any individual involved in any of the prosecutions genuinely believed that Horizon was entirely robust and could safely be relied on in every case, or entertained doubts as to its reliability which were suppressed through fear that any breach of Horizon’s claimed impregnability would create serious difficulties in many other cases.  Whatever an individual’s state of mind in that regard, it was POL which brought and conducted the prosecution; and there can be no doubt that POL as a corporate prosecutor was under a duty to investigate the claims of SPMs that there were problems with Horizon, and to consider and make appropriate disclosure of such problems.    </p>

Denied any disclosure of material capable of undermining the prosecution case, defendants were inevitably unable to discharge that improper burden.  As each prosecution proceeded to its successful conclusion the asserted reliability of Horizon was, on the face of it, reinforced.  Defendants were prosecuted, convicted and sentenced on the basis that the Horizon data must be correct, and cash must therefore be missing, when in fact there could be no confidence as to that foundation. </p>

We regard this as even more alarming in circumstances in which POL’s own investigator had reported there was no evidence of theft.  It was irrational and unjust to require Mrs Hamilton to recognise that she had “had the money short of theft” when theft was not to be pursued if the pleas to false accounting were acceptable.  POL’s conduct gives a firm impression that the condition of repayment in return for POL dropping the theft charge placed undue pressure on Mrs Hamilton.   It gives the impression that POL was using the prosecution process to enforce repayment.  </p>

On 29 September 2006, in the Crown Court at Caernarfon, he pleaded guilty to one count of false accounting.  From the incomplete case documents that remain, it appears that a charge of theft, relating to an alleged shortfall of £48,450.87, was dropped.  Mr Thomas’ written basis of plea stated that no blame was attached to Horizon and that he accepted there was a shortage which he was contractually obliged to make good, but he did not know how it had come about.  On 6 November 2006, he was sentenced to 9 months’ imprisonment.  Although the documentation no longer exists, Mr Thomas recalls that he was ordered to pay £9,000 to POL.  As a result of the proceedings against him, he was forced to file for bankruptcy.     </p>

In our judgment, the prosecution of each of the group B appellants was a category 1 abuse and unfair.  We also consider that the prosecution of each appellant was a category 2 abuse as being an affront to justice.  In each of the group B cases, the factors which underpin POL’s concession on category 1 are sufficiently egregious to establish category 2 abuse.  Our general conclusions on POL’s category 2 misconduct – which we have set out above and which we do not propose to repeat – apply to the facts of each case.  We add the following details.      </p>

In a voluntary interview on the day of the audit, he made no admissions to theft or to overclaiming the pension and allowance submissions made to the Department of Work and Pensions.

He was shown other potentially incriminating information relating to pensions and allowances, such as information collated by a third party on behalf of the DWP.

In her basis of plea, Ms Buffrey accepted that she had committed the offence “knowingly and dishonestly” and that she had misrepresented the figures in her branch accounts in order to postpone the day when she would have to make good her losses.  She accepted that the branch had incurred a trading loss of £21,256.63 during the indictment period.  She accepted that she was responsible for making good that loss to POL.

We disagree.  This is a “Horizon case” to which our general concerns apply.  Further, as Mr Patel submitted, when Mr Parekh pleaded guilty, Mrs Misra’s trial had very recently concluded.  In her case, the integrity of Horizon was specifically addressed as an issue in the trial with evidence from Gareth Jenkins.  Any reasonable prosecutor, concerned with the interests of justice, would have had questions about Horizon at the front of its consideration.  Mr Parekh was 51 years of age at the time of conviction and (like other appellants) of previous good character.

During the audit, she admitted the shortage and said that she could not explain how it had occurred despite having tried to identify the cause.  In her interview under caution, she stated that the issue had begun with an initial shortfall of £10,000 in July 2007.  Over time, the deficit had accumulated to approximately £45,000.  She admitted declaring cash which was not there in order to “buy time” and protect her job.  She denied theft but accepted falsifying the accounts.

A POL audit of Mr Yates’ branch had taken place on 6 March 2003 and he was interviewed under caution on 7 March 2003.  At interview, he admitted to inflating his cash figures over three to five years in order to conceal an ever-increasing shortage, due to his expenditure exceeding his income.  This had included the period before Horizon was installed at his branch on 11 July 2000.  Mr Yates claimed that the cash was used to pay for (among other things) personal bills and loan repayments.   </p>

Giros are sent out by post to customers and each giro has a date on it showing the earliest date that it can be cashed. When a cheque is presented at a counter for payment the clerk must check that it is valid for payment. Cheques are valid for a month. The clerk checks that the words and numbers on the cheque agree and that it is permissible for it to be cashed at that office. Proof of identity must be produced if the giro is for more than £100. The cheque must be signed on the reverse by the payee (and the agent if an agent is collecting the money on a customer's behalf). The clerk date stamps the giro on the front and then enters the amount into the Office computer system by touching the green giro icon on the computer screen. The screen will then show the amount to be paid to the customer. The cash is handed over and the transaction is completed on the screen. The giro is retained by the clerk in their ‘stock’. This is the name for the Post Office property (cash, receipts, stamps etc) for which a particular member of staff is responsible.” </p>

Elsewhere it has been described as occurring when a branch records a payment on Horizon but does not remit the associated giro (i.e. an amount is claimed as paid but there is no giro to support the claim).  For example, if a customer cashed a single giro, but the SPM put the giro through Horizon twice, Horizon would register two payments in.  This would create a cash surplus, because only one giro had been paid to the customer.  This would allow the SPM to take the money which had purportedly been paid out for the “second” giro. </p>

Having correctly performed the giro transaction through Horizon the clerk retains the giro rather than despatching it and then re-cashes it in another week. The giro is date stamped when the reintroduction takes place. It is then sent off with the summary and because it appears on the summary and it has the date stamp for the appropriate week it has a legitimate appearance, even though the genuine transaction has taken place in an earlier week. If a genuine mistake had occurred where a cheque was cashed in one week but not accounted for until the next it would be expected that the Horizon accounts would show a loss for the first week and a gain in the second. This would be because in the first week cash would have been given out but there would be no document to account for the payment, thus producing a loss.

She obtained the cash for those giros, but Mrs Cousins did not date stamp them then.  She retained them for the witness’s next visit on 9 October.

The second schedule set out the giro transactions.  The schedules were based on copies of all the giros and the transaction logs from Horizon.  The schedule revealed a pattern of reintroductions and overclaims.  By way of example, over a period of 81 weeks the first of the witnesses to whom we have referred appeared to have cashed 97 cheques.  One cheque was for £350, not her normal amount.

However, as explained, we need not take up time addressing these points and can focus instead on the central issue, namely whether Horizon evidence was essential to POL’s case against Mrs Cousins.  As to that issue, Mr Moloney’s submission is straightforward.  It is, in essence, this: that there was no evidence which safely pointed to how, or by whom, the reintroductions had been made; nor even, Mr Moloney suggests, whether reintroductions had, in fact, occurred.  Mr Moloney submits in this context that the procedures for processing Pension and Allowance (‘P&amp;A’) vouchers were fundamentally flawed.  </p>

Mr Moloney submits that, as he put it, “the reality of those procedural flaws” was borne out by the fact that reliance had to be placed by Ms Allen on identical sums being recorded on the Horizon system and those sums then being linked to individuals because of the sum involved.  That, he submits, was the underlying rationale for a central aspect of the case against Mrs Cousins since there was nothing further to confirm that a sum had actually been introduced.  The basis of the analysis undertaken by Ms Allen, Mr Moloney submits, has been fundamentally undermined by the discovery of examples of payments being established as being to a person other than the person assumed by POL.  </p>

We agree with Miss Johnson that it has not been demonstrated that Horizon reliability was essential to the case against Mrs Cousins.  This is not a case involving a Horizon-generated shortfall which Mrs Cousins, as the SPM, had to make good.  It is not a case, in simple terms, in which the amount of cash or stock held at the branch did not match what Horizon recorded should be present.  The case against Mrs Cousins was as described in prosecution counsel’s opening note, which we have quoted earlier.  It was a case which was concerned not with any shortfalls in Mrs Cousins’ accounts but with the discrepancies between the data Girobank received from Chesterfield showing how much money had been paid out for giros, on the one hand, and the number of pouches received, on the other.  It was, as prosecution counsel put it, a case which was concerned with “missing pouches”.  The prosecution’s case was that Mrs Cousins had committed the theft by making some overclaims (“a claim for a giro that never existed”) and many reintroductions (“the reintroduction of a legitimately cashed giro”).  This had nothing whatever to do with Horizon and everything to do with what was done, physically, with giros, specifically with regard to signatures and date-stamping and the evidence of customers as to their usual habits and how they would not, as Miss Johnson put it, store up giros and cash more than one at once. </p>

Mr Henderson’s criticism was, on analysis, as Miss Johnson submits, a criticism as to the design of Horizon, specifically the fact that Horizon did not allow individual customers to be identified.  That, however, does not make this a case in which Horizon can be said to be essential to the case against Mrs Cousins.  In any event, as Miss Johnson further points out, this was a deficiency which was known about at the time that Mrs Cousins was prosecuted; it is not something which has only later emerged.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It is right to acknowledge that Mr Henderson also floated the possibility that there was a phantom bug responsible for multiple giro entries.  This was, however, little more than speculation based on the fact that Fraser J concluded that there were bugs in Horizon, including a phantom transaction bug.  Indeed, when it was put to him in crossexamination by Miss Johnson that the phantom transaction bug identified by Fraser J had been fixed in 2001, all that Mr Henderson could say was that it should be borne in mind that bugs “can manifest themselves in many different ways” whilst accepting that what he was saying about a phantom transaction bug was, indeed, speculation.  As he put it: “Who knows whether such bugs, errors and defects could have had the consequence that I have highlighted”.  Given Mr Henderson’s acceptance that he was engaging in speculation, we feel quite unable to conclude that there was any such phantom transaction bug.  However, even if there had been, what is clear is that it would have manifested itself at the time to Mrs Cousins.  As she herself stated in interview, each Wednesday, after the branch closed at 5.30 pm, she reconciled the physical giros in her branch with what Horizon recorded as having been paid out.  In view of this, she would have been bound to have become aware of any bug, not least because if a bug had led Horizon to record extra giro payments being made, there would have been a surplus in the cash till because Mrs Cousins would not have paid this money to a customer.  Mrs Cousins did not describe this happening.  Nor did Ms Allen find any evidence of a surplus.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In conclusion, we agree with Miss Johnson when she submits that Mrs Cousins has tried to shoehorn this case into a Horizon matrix by arguing that Horizon capability was poor when the real question is not as to its capability but as to its reliability and, then, as to whether it can properly be said that that reliability was essential to the case which was brought against Mrs Cousins.  This is not such a case.  Nor, it follows, is it one of those exceptional and rare cases in which it would be appropriate to conclude that Mrs Cousins’ conviction is unsafe on either of the abuse of process grounds which are advanced.  Mr Moloney, we record, accepts that if we were to decide that this is not a category 1 abuse case, it would inevitably follow that nor is it a category 2 abuse case.  Mrs Cousins’ appeal must, therefore, be dismissed. </p>

Ms Bailey spoke to Mr Fell and told him that she was there in order to check the cash, as it was not matching up with what the Horizon computer system was showing.  She printed off an office snapshot which showed that the branch should have had £28,819.97 in cash.  Mr Fell counted all of the notes and coins in front of her.  It became clear that there was a large shortfall of cash.  The actual cash present was only £9,420.67, leaving a shortfall amounting to £19,399.30.  Ms Bailey asked Mr Fell if he could explain the shortfall.  He said that he could not do so.  Ms Bailey asked Mr Fell if he could think of a reason for the loss.  He said that he could not, before adding this: “If I was to give you a cheque for the shortage, would that be the end of it?”.

There was also a witness statement from Penelope Thomas of Fujitsu, which made reference to the Horizon transactions for the period from 27 September 2006 to 25 October 2006 which Mr Longman had obtained ahead of the interview and which set out the way in which the Horizon system stored information and providing evidence of the integrity of the system.  She confirmed that the Horizon system was installed at the branch on 16 February 2001.  She produced an ARQ, which she had received from POL investigators on 8 November 2006.  The ARQ requested a report of all transactions and events for the post office branch within the date range 27 September 2006 to 25 October 2006.  Ms Thomas undertook extractions of data held on the Horizon system in accordance with the requirements of the ARQ and produced the resultant CD, which she forwarded to the POL investigation section. </p>

He used the transaction log and some of the cash declarations to examine the cash flow within the post office to see whether he could verify if any of the cash declarations made by Mr Fell were correct.  The first he examined was printed by user SFE001 at 18.28 hours on Saturday 21 October 2006.  The cash declaration purported to show that the post office had £18,107.35 in cash.  Mr Longman interrogated Horizon for Monday 23 October 2006 and produced a schedule in which all the transactions involving cash in and out were added or subtracted from the £18,107.35, up to the point where Ms Bailey closed the office on 23 October 2006.  The schedule showed that, if the cash declaration figure for Saturday 21 October 2006 had been correct, then, the cash on hand figure when Ms Bailey closed the office should have been £19,770.85.  Only £9,276.99 in cash was, however, in fact, on hand.  There was, therefore, a discrepancy of £10,493.86.  This proved, Mr Longman suggested, that Mr Fell’s cash declaration for Saturday 21 October 2006 had been false. </p>

It was Mr Stein’s submission that, Mr Fell having pleaded guilty at a time when the extensive nature of the concerns about the Horizon operation system had not yet come to light, his is a case in which the plea of guilty operates as no bar to a successful appeal.  He highlighted in this respect how in her witness statement Penelope Thomas described the system as operating properly.  He submits that Mr Fell was prosecuted, and required to decide how to plead, in circumstances where, as Mr Stein characterises it, due to POL’s corporate attitude of placing the protection of Horizon above the reputation of people such as Mr Fell, his legal team had incomplete and, indeed, misleading information about the reliability of Horizon.  </p>

Before the audit leading to his prosecution, indeed, Mr Fell had made up for “discrepancies” on four occasions between 2005 and 2006.  This is what he told Second Sight when interviewed for the purposes of the Post Office Mediation Scheme (see the report dated 5 December 2014 at paragraph 2.2).  There is no evidence, Mr Stein submits, that POL disclosed to Mr Fell’s then legal team that he had been putting money into the system in order presumably, so Mr Stein suggests, to make it balance.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Stein submits that, all in all, Mr Fell can be forgiven for not knowing that if he had told his legal team about the discrepancies and that the system had thrown his accounting out of balance, they could have used that to support applications for disclosure and gone on to consider further legal arguments such as an application to stay, the exclusion of computer evidence or to support a defence that he was not acting dishonestly.  Mr Stein submits that, had Horizon’s failings been known to Mr Fell, he would have not taken “such a fatalistic approach” as he did on 23 October 2006 when talking to Ms Bailey or in interview or when facing the subsequent criminal proceedings, and he might have raised the concerns and issues that he had with the Horizon system.  Mr Fell’s “fatalism” could, Mr Stein suggests, have been countered by his union representative and his legal team if they had been informed by POL of Horizon’s bugs, errors and defects.  The denial of information about the Horizon system, Mr Stein submits, failed to allow Mr Fell’s legal team the opportunity to fully and properly advise him as to his options, what disclosure might be requested and why that might assist his case or undermine the prosecution case. </p>

We remind ourselves, in the first place, that, as made clear by Rix LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Kelly and Connolly</span>, it will be an exceptional and rare case where an unequivocal and intentional plea of guilty will be overturned.  This is because, as Potter LJ put it in <span style="font-style:italic">Bhatti</span> at [30] (as cited by Rix LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Kelly and Connolly</span> at [118]), a plea of guilty “represents a voluntary recognition of guilt”.  Secondly, and critically in this case, we are not persuaded that this is an exceptional and rare case since we agree with Mr Altman that this was not a case which was concerned with Horizon, more specifically its reliability.  As such, we do not accept that Mr Stein can be right when he submits that there was an obligation to disclose material going to Horizon reliability.  It follows that Mr Fell’s guilty plea cannot be said to have been undermined by what has subsequently emerged concerning Horizon.  It further follows, therefore, that Mr Fell’s conviction cannot be regarded as being unsafe. </p>

It is not what he told Ms Bailey; nor is it what he told Mr Longman in interview; nor is what he put in his defence statement; and nor is it what was stated in his written basis of plea.  The latter confirmed, indeed, that he had “borrowed” the money from POL in order to prop up his retail business, having entered into a contract with a supplier (1st Choice Ltd) to stock his shop with a minimum spend of £2,000 every week.  He stated, in terms, that he “did not have the finances to meet the stipulated term” and so he “began to borrow Post Office funds in order to meet the shortfall and keep the shop afloat”.  Again as stated in the written basis of plea, “This took place over roughly the same period as set out in the charge [i.e., 1.6.06 – 24.10.06]”.  </p>

What he told Second Sight some years later in the course of the mediation process was not what he was saying at the time that the investigation was being conducted and at the time that he was prosecuted.  As Mr Altman submits, that includes the suggestion made by Mr Fell to Second Sight that he informed POL of shortages on several occasions.  He had previously made no mention of having told POL this. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Matters do not stop there, however, since, as already observed, far from putting forward Horizon-related explanations, Mr Fell made a series of comments during the course of the investigation which entailed his express acceptance of wrongdoing.  Thus, at the time of the audit he admitted to having taken the money and stated that he had not intended to, but circumstances had led him to do it.  He, then, denied theft in the prepared statement which he produced at the time of his interview, in which he referred to “the burden of my actions” and his “financial negligence”, apologised and stated that he did not steal because “it has always been my intention to repay the money to the Post Office”.  His position, in essence, was that, although he admitted taking the money, there was a lack of intention permanently to deprive.  He repeated this in his defence statement, going on to explain that “he used the Post Office monies to keep the adjoining shop afloat having suffered a decline in the trade of the Post Office and having mismanaged the stocking of the shop resulting in financial difficulties in meeting the overheads of the business”.  As Mr Altman submits, there was no word about having to make good shortages in the past as his reason for borrowing the funds and covering it up by fraudulent accounting.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It is clear, furthermore, although hardly surprising in the circumstances, that in his solicitor’s letter to him dated 6 July 2007, which was disclosed as part of the Second Sight mediation process, reference is made to there having been a full conference at court at the PCMH on 29 June 2007 with counsel, the solicitor and Mr Rudkin and to Mr Fell having been given full advice regarding his plea.  That letter states: “You have always accepted that you were guilty of false accounting by way of creating false cash records to disguise the monetary loss to the Post Office caused as a result of you taking funds to keep your shop afloat”.  There was clearly no suggestion on Mr Fell’s part that Horizon was responsible for any shortfall.  On the contrary, he was putting forward a positive reason for what had happened which did not involve any suggestion that it was Horizon-related.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Furthermore, although Mr Stein seeks to rely upon the CCRC’s reference to Mr Fell having “on four occasions between late 2005 and October 2006 … made good defaults generated by Horizon”, as the final Second Sight report of 5 December 2014 made clear, these totalled just £1,110.87 and so very much less than the £19,583 which appeared in the indictment to which Mr Fell pleaded guilty.  It follows that the four discrepancies he made good during that period cannot explain the scale of the losses with which this appeal is concerned.  Although Mr Stein submits that there is no evidence that POL disclosed the fact that Mr Fell had made these payments, we agree with Mr Altman that this is not a matter for criticism in this case given that Mr Fell himself knew that he had made those payments.  Indeed, if anything, as Mr Altman submits, the fact that Mr Fell did not tell his legal team is consistent with recognition by him that those four incidents had nothing to do with why he took the money.  His case, we repeat, was that the reason why he did what he did was to fund his shop having made a bad stock supply arrangement.  </p>

It follows that his is not one of those exceptional and rare cases in which it would be appropriate to conclude that his conviction is unsafe on either of the abuse of process grounds which are advanced.  We should add in this context that we reject Mr Stein’s submission that, were we to decide that this is not a category 1 abuse case, we could nonetheless decide that it is a category 2 abuse case.  We see no basis on which it would be appropriate so to decide, as Mr Moloney correctly concedes in Mrs Cousins’ case.  Mr Fell’s appeal must, therefore, also be dismissed. </p>

The transaction had been made by someone using the ID code NHU004 and was shown to have been settled to cash.  Mr Longman subsequently made contact with the purchaser of the bond, a woman in her eighties, who explained to him that on 13 August 2009 she withdrew £50,036.82 by cheque from her West Bromwich Building Society Account made payable to her and went directly to West Bromwich post office, having already completed a growth bond application.  She told Mr Longman that she had been served by the manageress of the post office (Ms Hussain), who advised her that there was an error in her application form for the growth bond and so the manageress completed a new application form on her behalf.  Although she had left the branch with a receipt for the growth bond, she had still not received her growth bond some weeks later.  The customer, therefore, made inquiries with the Post Office helpline.  They referred her to the Bank of Ireland, the bank operating the growth bond scheme.  The Bank of Ireland representative told her that there was no record of any growth bond transaction in her name.  Mrs Green knew that the cheque which she had cashed had been debited from her account on 16 August 2009.  She decided to confront Ms Hussain and did so on 6 October 2009.

During the call, Ms Hussain gave the impression that she had dealt personally with the growth bond transaction.  She told the Bank of Ireland representative that she remembered the transaction in question, that the customer had made a mistake and so she “filled in the form for the lady and processed it and gave her a receipt”.  She explained that she had reversed the application after the customer had left the branch as no appropriate identification details had been entered on to the application document.  However, she said that another staff member had processed the customer’s cheque which had been sent off.  She explained that “it made my till go up £50,000”.  She explained that the money had been kept in the safe with the application form for the growth bond.

Ms Hussain told her that her brother, Shamhir, was purchasing a house and that somebody might query where he had got the money from.  On 13 October 2009, Ms Hussain returned the first cheque to her colleague and wrote out a second cheque for £8,000, again signed by her in the name of the colleague’s husband.  This cheque was made payable to Shamhir Hussain.  The colleague subsequently received a letter from her bank dated 16 October 2009 returning the cheque marked “refer to drawer” and explaining that the cheque could not be honoured due to there being insufficient funds.  </p>

She denied, in particular, responsibility for creating stock unit GG and for making any of the transfers to stock unit GG.  She denied using the other staff member’s user ID to make a transfer or telling her that she had made the transfer.  She said that other staff members had access to both her user IDs and would use them.  She maintained that any deficits might be due to accounting errors or losses or thefts by other counter staff.  She explained that her monthly trading statements did not reveal any errors or losses; counter staff could overstate the cash being held in their till or safe when providing a balance and cover up their theft.  Since the monthly trading statements did not require physical checks to be made of the cash held in tills or safes, she took the balances on trust and failed to pick up errors or thefts by others.  She said that she was in the process of buying the business from Mrs Dhadda and suggested that she had been set up by others who did not want her to buy the branch.

His submission is that POL, in effect, made Ms Hussain’s case a “Horizon case” by choosing to serve this witness statement.  Accordingly, he submitted that, in the circumstances, it was not possible for Ms Hussain to have received a fair trial because a legitimate line of defence had been unfairly and improperly closed to her, notwithstanding her having raised accounting error as a possible explanation for what happened.  Mr Millington submits, as a result, Ms Hussain was unable properly to advance the defence which she had raised and was driven instead to plead guilty when that ought not to have been the case. </p>

It is, in particular, not changed by the fact that in that witness statement reference was made to ARQ data which had been requested on Ms Hussain’s behalf since that does not make it a case in which the reliability of Horizon data was essential to the case which POL brought against her.  What was essential was the fact that, as Ms Hussain now accepted but which she disputed in her defence statement, it was she who created the GG stock unit and it was she who made all 5 transfers.  That is what the Horizon record showed, and it was what she (now at least and anyway by her guilty plea) accepted having done: that the GG stock unit was created on 16 October 2009 by her using her user ID NHU004, and that the transfers were made in the space of three weeks between the middle of October and early November 2009, the first transfer being on 16 October 2009 itself. </p>

It follows from this that there cannot conceivably be the abuse of process which has been suggested because the failure of disclosure of the full and accurate position on Horizon was not material where the reliability of Horizon data was not essential in the context of the evidence in the case.  Put differently, there can have been no failure of disclosure concerning Horizon because Ms Hussain accepted (and accepted by her guilty plea) that she did, after all, create the GG stock unit and make the relevant transfers.  The Horizon records were, in fact and as a result, reliable.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This is sufficient to dispose of this appeal.  However, it is worth having in mind other aspects which we consider underline the lack of merit of Ms Hussain’s appeal, indeed, which point strongly towards Ms Hussain having created a sophisticated scheme to take money from the branch where she was working and which she was in the process of buying at the same time as her brother was trying himself to buy a property.  We propose, in the circumstances and since we have already set out the background in some detail, to address these matters only briefly.  However, it is significant that, during the audit on 13 November 2009, Ms Hussain sought to explain the shortfall by saying that she had lost a cheque, not that she had suffered any Horizon-generated loss.  It was for this reason that she wrote a cheque on a work colleague’s cheque book for £85,000, having told the colleague that a customer had come in to purchase an £85,000 growth bond but she had been unable to put the customer’s cheque through as she had lost a cheque.  That cheque was later found during the audit.  It was dated 2 August 2009 (apparently corrected from September) and, as we have previously noted, attached to it was a piece of paper on which was written “chq to put in system - growth bond” and “To put in system - sent application - growth bond”.  Later, in December 2009, Ms Hussain admitted to a colleague responsibility for making the second transfer on 17 October 2009 using her RMA002 user ID, telling her she had done so because she had lost a cheque and if she had not transferred the funds, there would have been a shortage in the accounts.  As Mr Altman puts it, this was, therefore, not an unexplained but an explained shortfall.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Furthermore, the suggestion made on Ms Hussain’s behalf in her grounds of appeal that she created the phantom GG stock unit to cover up a Horizon-generated shortfall, specifically, as it is put, that “she created a balancing account i.e., she created stock unit GG as a balancing account to address the losses which were showing on Horizon” (an assertion which was not made in her defence statement) is undermined by her dealings with the growth bond for £50,036.82 in August 2009 since those dealings suggest that she was not then, or indeed later when she created the GG stock unit and making the transfers, covering for any Horizon-generated shortfall.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Nor is what Ms Hussain actually did as regards the growth bond consistent with her seeking to cover up a Horizon-generated shortfall.  As previously explained, she conducted the bond transaction on 13 August 2009, before reversing it out of the system two hours and ten minutes later.  The following day, she entered a cheque for £50,036.82 into Horizon, and cash to the same value was shown as paid out.  These were physical acts with, as Mr Altman submits, no explanation.  The effect of entering the cheque on to the system was to increase the stock value by £50,000.  Since as far as Horizon was concerned cash had been paid out, the cash value would have decreased by £50,000 in the accounts.  If Ms Hussain did not remove the cash, when she came to balance Horizon, her accounts would show a £50,000 surplus that would need explanation.  It would need to be declared as a positive discrepancy.  However, the records show that there was no cash surplus in the accounts at the relevant time.  As Mr Altman explains, Ms Hussain’s explanation to the Bank of Ireland representative as to what happened, in particular that using the stock unit to process the cheque “made my till go up £50,000” and so the “money” was put in the safe with the application form for the growth bond where it remained until the transaction was again put through Horizon on 6 October 2009 when it was shown as having been settled to cash, demonstrates that the growth bond cannot explain any shortfall that required covering up and certainly not one of £83,000.  Taken together with Ms Hussain’s requests to work colleagues for cheques, the returned payment into her brother’s account of the cheque for £8,000, as Mr Altman submits, this amounts to strong circumstantial evidence supporting Ms Hussain’s guilt. </p>

Again, we reject the submission that, were we to decide that this is not a category 1 abuse case, we could nonetheless decide that it is a category 2 abuse case.  It follows that Ms Hussain’s appeal is also dismissed. </p>
