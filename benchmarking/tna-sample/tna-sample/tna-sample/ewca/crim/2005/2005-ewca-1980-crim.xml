	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In these four appeals, which have been heard together, four carers, as they have been described, appeal against convictions for manslaughter, Lorraine Harris; murder, Raymond Charles Rock; manslaughter, Alan Barry Joseph Cherry; and s.20 inflicting grievous bodily harm, Michael Ian Faulder. The victims were Patrick McGuire, aged 4 months, in the case of Harris; Heidi Smith, aged 13 months, in the case of Rock; Sarah Eburne-Day, aged 21 months, in the case of Cherry; and N, aged 7 weeks, in the case of Faulder. Throughout this judgment we shall refer to the victims by their christian names and to the appellants by their surnames. Patrick was the son of Harris; Heidi was the daughter of Rock’s partner; Sarah was the daughter of Cherry’s partner; and N was Faulder’s son. At the time immediately before each of the victims became seriously ill each was in the sole care respectively of Harris, Rock, Cherry and Faulder.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">All of the appellants were convicted following trials. On 7 September 2000 at Nottingham Crown Court Harris was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 3 years imprisonment. On 21 September 1999 at Chelmsford Crown Court Rock was convicted of murder and sentenced to imprisonment for life. On 9 October 1995 at Birmingham Crown Court Cherry was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 2 years imprisonment. On 28 April 1999 at Teesside Crown Court Faulder was convicted of s.20 inflicting grievous bodily harm and sentenced to 30 months imprisonment. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Following the judgment of this Court in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Cannings </span>[2004] 2Cr.App.R.7 the Law Officers set up an Interdepartmental Group to review convictions of defendants in alleged “battered babies” cases. As a result of that review letters were sent to Harris and Cherry advising that each might feel it appropriate for the safety of her or his conviction to be considered further by the Court of Appeal. Each lodged notices of appeal and sought extensions of time in which to apply for leave. Each has been granted an extension of time and leave to appeal. Rock had already lodged a notice of appeal. He appeals with the leave of the Court. In the case of Faulder his appeal comes to this Court by way of a reference from the Criminal Cases Review Commission. Mr Michael Mansfield QC is leading counsel for all four appellants. Mr Richard Horwell leads for the Crown in each appeal.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">These appeals have involved the court receiving (by agreement of the parties) evidence from ten medical expert witnesses called on behalf of the appellants and eleven called on behalf the Crown. We also received the written evidence of four further witnesses. In general terms the issues between the two sets of medical expert witnesses are as follows. First, the evidence called on behalf of the appellants relied on recent research which it is said demonstrated that long held medical opinion of the conventional signs giving rise to inferences of unlawful assaults on infants and very young children is unreliable. The basis of this challenge was a hypothesis based on recent research. However there were also other associated medical issues. The Crown’s medical witnesses do not accept that the hypothesis is correct or that it is supported by the new research. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly the Crown do not accept that the fresh evidence in relation to other specific issues in any way renders the convictions of these appellants unsafe.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Harris faced a single count of manslaughter. In summary the evidence was as follows. Patrick was born on 13 August 1998. He was the son of Lorraine Harris and Sean Maguire all of whom lived in the same house with two daughters of Harris from a previous relationship. The evidence showed that, although the pregnancy was not planned, both Harris and Maguire were happy about the impending birth. After his birth, Patrick gave every indication of being a thriving and much loved baby. Maguire described Harris as being as happy as he had ever known her. Harris received support from Maguire’s mother and her own mother. There were no financial difficulties and health professionals said that the family gave the impression of perfection.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On 4 December 1999 Harris took Patrick for his third immunisation. The rest of the day passed without any significant event. Maguire was on night shift and Harris remained in the house with Patrick. Shortly before 1.00 a.m. on 5 December 1999 Harris noticed that Patrick was having difficulty breathing and called Dr Barber, the general practitioner. Whether or not this was in evidence at the trial, it is agreed that in the telephone call Harris said to Dr Barber:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Dr Barber stated that on arrival Harris appeared calm and controlled. Dr Barber had formed the opinion that Harris was an experienced and sensible mother. He examined Patrick. Patrick’s eyes were normal and he had all the appropriate reflexes. He recorded Patrick’s temperature as 38.2, mildly raised. There were no signs of abuse or bruising. Patrick’s chest was clear and although he was a little “snuffly” Dr Barber concluded that there was nothing wrong with him. He left the house at 1.30a.m.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At 2.34am Harris made a 999 call to the emergency services and reported that Patrick would not wake up. An ambulance arrived seven minutes later. The crew endeavoured to resuscitate Patrick. They recorded that Patrick did not have a pulse and was making no respiratory effort although he was still warm. Patrick and Harris were taken to Derby Children’s Hospital arriving at 3.15am Patrick was put on a life support machine. The evidence was that Harris was “plainly in considerable stress and crying.” Patrick was noted as having fixed and dilated pupils and retinal haemorrhages.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Patrick was seen by Dr Dodd a consultant paediatrician, who examined him at approximately 4.30am He described Patrick as having widely dilated pupils enabling him to make a clear examination of the retina. He found gross preretinal haemorrhages which were so extensive that he could not recall seeing any that were worse. There were no external injuries. He was so concerned about Patrick’s condition that he arranged for him to be transferred to the specialist unit at Nottingham. In Nottingham a blood sample test was taken. The test showed that there was marked hypofibronogenemia. Despite the best efforts of the medical team caring for him Patrick died on 6 December 1999. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The prosecution called a number of expert medical witnesses both as to fact and also opinion evidence. Those witnesses were Dr Bouch, a Pathologist, who had conducted a post mortem on Patrick. He concluded that Patrick had died as a result of a shake which caused bleeding into the skull around the brain. He described what he meant by a “shake” as much more than rough handling. Professor Green, a paediatric pathologist, with a special interest in ophthalmic pathology gave evidence that there was extensive bleeding in the vitreous of the left eye and extensive haemorrhaging of the retina. The bleeding in the right eye was less extensive. His conclusion was that his findings were those typically seen when shaking or, shaking and an impact had occurred. A consultant haematologist, Dr Giangrande, who specialised in blood diseases, gave evidence to the effect that the low level of fibrinogen in the Patrick’s blood system, in his opinion, was the result of an injury sustained by Patrick and not a pre-existing condition. However he was unable to rule out the possibility that that condition was present before the brain injury was caused. Finally, the prosecution called Mr Punt, a consultant paediatric brain surgeon. His evidence was that the amount of blood over the surface of the brain shown on the scan and the description of the amount of blood over the surface of the brain at post mortem was not sufficient to cause Patrick’s death. In his opinion it was injury to the brain itself which caused death; and that the brain injury was caused either by shaking or an impact or a combination of both. In his opinion whatever caused the injury to the brain was likely to have been in consequence of an incident after Dr Barber had left the home at 1.30a.m. In his view it was extremely improbable that the injuries were the result of a bleeding disorder.</p>

Her evidence was that on the evening of 4 December 1998 Patrick became “chesty and grunty”. Because he had difficulty in breathing she called out Dr Barber. After his visit she put Patrick in his cot. He seemed to have settled a bit. When she awoke approximately an hour later she checked him. His arms were on the top of the covers; he was a bit pale and cold. When she picked him up he was floppy. She said that she panicked and put him down in the cot. She telephoned her mother and then the ambulance. She vaguely remembered bouncing him on her knee whilst she was on the telephone. At interview she had said that she had Patrick on her knee when she telephoned the ambulance and that she remembered her knees “were going ten to the dozen.” In evidence she said that she found it difficult to remember the sequence of events because she had tried to put it out of her mind. She accepted that she had told the doctor on the telephone that Patrick had stopped breathing in order to make him hurry. She said she was unable to offer any explanation for his injuries.</p>

They were Dr Batman, a consultant histopathologist; Dr Jones, a consultant paediatrician; and Dr Macdonald, a consultant neuropathologist. Dr Batman thought that there were three possible causes of Patrick’s death. They were (a) natural causes such as bleeding from a blood disorder; (b) shaking with or without impact; and (c) re-bleeding of an old blood clot. He regarded the latter as the least likely of three. In evidence, Dr Jones stated that his conclusion was that the findings were entirely consistent with a bleeding disorder. However he conceded that one would have expected more blood than was present if there was a blood disorder. He accepted that the findings were consistent with Patrick having been shaken and he agreed that he had never seen a child with fibrinogen deficiency which had died. Dr Macdonald concluded that Patrick’s injuries were not the result of a severe non-accidental injury although he conceded that the extent of the haemorrhages inside the vitreous jelly of his eye equated to a quite severe shaking. But the fact that there was no bleeding on the optic nerve of the right eye was a contra-indication.</p>

Lisa Hudson’s relationship with James Smith did not last long and by March 1998 she was living at the home of Rock. Rock was aged 26 and had previously been married with two children of his own.

However, Lisa Hudson said in evidence that Rock had a temper. She spoke of an incident about two weeks before Heidi’s death when Heidi was grizzly and would not settle. She said that on that occasion Rock held Heidi to his face and said “shut up” in what she thought was a nasty fashion. On another occasion Rock complained that “Its Heidi this and Heidi that”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On 2 June 1998, Lisa’s mother, Thelma Hudson, was looking after Heidi. At 6.30pm Thelma took Heidi back to Rock’s home after he had returned from work. Lisa Hudson was still at work. Thelma Hudson placed Heidi in her cot at 6.35pm. She said that when she left Heidi was asleep and breathing normally. At 7.08pm Thelma Hudson telephoned Rock and spoke to him. From approximately 7.00pm Lisa Hudson could not get a response from the telephone at Rock’s home. A next door neighbour, Gail Banham, said that some time between 7.05pm and 7.10pm, from her kitchen, she could hear screaming coming from one of the homes at the back of her house. She said that the screaming sounded like a very sustained temper tantrum of a child aged between nine months to eighteen months. She also heard someone shouting at the child. It was a male and youngish. He was swearing and told the child to “fucking shut up”. The screaming did not stop. She went to the front of her house where she could hear nothing but then returned to her back kitchen. The screaming continued and she heard the same voice telling the child to shut up. The screaming continued but as she finished dishing up a meal it stopped and went completely silent. Her evidence was that this occurred at 7.20pm. In the unused material there were statements from police officers concerning an experiment conducted by them to see if shouting in one house could be heard in the other. The result of this experiment was inconclusive. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, Rock, in evidence, agreed that he had told Heidi to shut up but it was in the context of a longer sentence in which he said “you heard your mum, you’ve got to shut up”. He said that after Thelma Hudson had telephoned him he checked that Heidi was asleep and went downstairs to watch a video. During this time he heard loud crying. He went upstairs and found Heidi sitting up in her cot, red-faced and very upset. He said that he picked her up by her armpits and placed her in the crook of his right arm with his left hand under her bottom. He then rocked her from side to side at the same time trying to wind up the mobile on the top of the wardrobe. Heidi slipped through his arms onto the floor. He said that he saw Heidi hit the floor; she did not bang her head but did not stop crying. He immediately picked her up. She was completely still and not breathing. He patted her on the back saying “come on Heidi sweetheart”. He then held her in front of him but did not violently shake her. He shook her lightly by placing her on the floor where she was having the occasional spasm. He tried to give her mouth to mouth resuscitation but on the fourth occasion she began to vomit. He took her to the bathroom, held her face down over the sink and banged her back to allow the sick to come out. His evidence was that she began vomiting again. Seeing this he ran downstairs with Heidi and dialled 999. His telephone call was timed at 7.27pm. The paramedics arrived at 7.37pm. They found Heidi lying on the floor in a dimly lit room. Rock told them that he had dropped Heidi onto her bottom whilst he had been trying to wind up a clockwork toy. He told them that Heidi had not hit her head on the floor as he had been able to catch and support her head before it hit the floor. He then picked her up and she had gone limp and stopped breathing. He told them that he had tried mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and Heidi had vomited. One of the paramedics saw signs of vomit around Heidi’s mouth. He said that on the way to the hospital in the ambulance Rock had asked questions such as “has she got brain damage?” “Has she got lung damage?” On arrival at the hospital Heidi was taken straight to the resuscitation room. She was subsequently transferred to the Intensive Treatment Unit as she was having spasmodic fits; both her eyes were rolling to the left; she was pale but breathing and unconscious.</p>

His explanation of the incident was much the same as that which he gave in evidence. He maintained that Heidi did not bang her head when she fell and he told no one that he had shaken her. To Lisa Hudson he said “I am so sorry, I dropped her on her bum”. And later in the hospital chapel, “I killed her, I killed her. Please God let her live, save her.”</p>

A consultant ophthalmic surgeon said that he examined Heidi’s eyes when she was comatose and on a ventilator. He found massive retinal haemorrhaging at all layers on both retinas. There was also tenting/pulling forward of the major retinal vessels or folds. He concluded that in the absence of any specific medical condition the haemorrhages and tenting were the result of severe acceleration and deceleration forces. He said that he had never seen such severe damage to a person’s retina. Dr Jaspan, a consultant neuroradiologist (one of the expert witnesses called by the Crown in these appeals) examined a CT scan taken at 10.25pm on 2 June 1997. He found a thin layer of blood lying along the falx and within the brain at the back of the head. In his opinion these findings were consistent with trauma. In his view the disrupted delicate blood vessels in the brain had been damaged and the damage was profound and irreversible. He concluded that the trauma was so severe as to render Heidi immediately unconscious and that the injuries were highly characteristic of violent shaking. In his opinion dropping a child on its bottom was inconsistent with Heidi’s injuries.</p>

The brain was swollen and there was bleeding on the surface of the brain. There was no skull fracture. He said that in his opinion the head injuries in conjunction with the retinal detachment in both eyes were consistent with shaken baby syndrome (SBS). In his view the cause was shaking or shaking plus an impact which caused injuries to the brain. He said that the force required was “shaking as hard as you can”. Further, he concluded that the changes which had occurred to Heidi’s eyes meant that there must have been several shakes back and forth with acceleration and deceleration.</p>

Apparently, it had been Sarah’s habit to stand on the yellow chair in order to look out of the window at the front of the house. He explained that when he returned he found Sarah lying on the floor motionless and making gurgling noises. He said that he picked her up and described her body feeling like a rag doll. She did not respond and therefore he telephoned her grandfather to ask him to telephone for an ambulance. He explained that she must have become suddenly ill and fallen from the chair.

In her opinion the five smaller bruises were consistent with pressure from fingers. In cross-examination she did not accept that the injuries could have been caused by falling from the yellow chair. She said that the injuries were more consistent with Sarah’s head being forcibly put against something. In her opinion it was highly unlikely that Sarah could have injured herself by banging her head against the floor although that was not impossible. She said it was unlikely the injuries could have been caused by a single fall because there were two separate areas of impact and two separate bruises, although she could not exclude this absolutely.</p>

The accepted hypothesis depends on findings of a triad of intracranial injuries consisting of encephalopathy (defined as disease of the brain affecting the brain’s function); subdural haemorrhages (SDH); and retinal haemorrhages (RH). For many years the coincidence of these injuries in infants (babies aged between 1 month and 2 years) has been considered to be the hallmark of NAHI. Not all three of the triad of injuries are necessary for NAHI to be diagnosed, but most doctors who gave evidence to us in support of the triad stated that no diagnosis of pure SBS (as contrasted with impact injuries or impact and shaking) could be made without both encephalopathy and subdural haemmorhages. Professor Carol Jenny, a paediatrician and consultant neuro-trauma specialist called by the Crown, went further and said that she would be very cautious about diagnosing SBS in the absence of retinal haemmorhages. In addition, the Crown points to two further factors of circumstantial evidence, namely that the injuries are invariably inflicted by a sole carer in the absence of any witness; and that they are followed by an inadequate history, incompatible with the severity of the injuries. </p>

In the third paper “Geddes III”, the team put forward a new hypothesis, “the unified hypothesis”, which challenged the supposed infallibility of the triad. It was called the unified hypothesis because it relied on the proposal that there was one unified cause of the three intracranial injuries constituting the triad; that cause was not necessarily trauma. It is important to note that the new hypothesis did not seek to show that the triad was inconsistent with NAHI. It did, however, seek to show that it was not diagnostic.</p>

Dr Geddes, at the beginning of her cross-examination, accepted that the unified hypothesis was never advanced with a view to being proved in court. She said that it was meant to stimulate debate.

There may also be other pathological signs such as subarachnoid bleeding and injuries at the cranio-cervical junction. Further, there may be injuries to nerve tissue (axonal injuries) and external signs of broken bones, bruising and other obvious injuries such as extradural oedema (bruising).

The hypothesis was that brain swelling combined with raised intracranial pressure (ICP) could cause both subdural haemorrhages and retinal haemmorhages. Thus, it was argued that any incidents of apnoea (cessation of breathing) could set in motion a cascade of events which could cause the same injuries as seen in the triad. It will be appreciated that there are many events which could accidentally cause an episode of apnoea.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The criticism of Geddes III is that it is not hypoxia and/or brain swelling which causes subdural haemorrhages and retinal haemorrhages but trauma. As an example of why the hypothesis is not correct Dr Jaspan, giving evidence in the appeal of Rock, demonstrated that CT scans taken of Heidi’s brain showed that there was little or no brain swelling at a time when subdural haemorrhages and retinal haemorrhages were shown to be present. As a result of critical papers published in the medical journals, as we have already stated, Dr Geddes when cross-examined frankly admitted that the unified hypothesis could no longer credibly be put forward. In cross-examination she accepted that she could no longer support the hypothesis that brain swelling was the cause of subdural haemorrhages and retinal haemmorhages. She did, however, state that she believed that raised intracranial pressure (ICP) might prove to be an independent cause of both lesions. When asked by Mr Horwell if she had published a paper on this hypothesis she said that she had not and that her research was still incomplete. It was clear from subsequent questions in cross-examination that this work was still in its early stages and that many questions remain, as yet, unresolved.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In our judgment, it follows that the unified hypothesis can no longer be regarded as a credible or alternative cause of the triad of injuries. This conclusion, however, is not determinative of the four appeals before us. There are many other medical issues involved in cases of alleged NAHI. Further, there remains a body of medical opinion which does not accept that the triad is an infallible tool for diagnosis. This body of opinion, whilst recognising that the triad is consistent with NAHI, cautions against its use as a certain diagnosis in the absence of other evidence. These four appeals raise different medical issues and do not necessarily fail because the unified hypothesis has not been validated. But it does mean that the triad, itself a hypothesis, has not been undermined in the way envisaged by the authors of Geddes III. </p>

On the evidence before us we do not think it possible for us to do so. Whilst a strong pointer to NAHI on its own we do not think it possible to find that it must automatically and necessarily lead to a diagnosis of NAHI. All the circumstances, including the clinical picture, must be taken into account. In any event, on general issues of this nature, where there is a genuine difference between two reputable medical opinions, in our judgment, the Court of Criminal Appeal will not usually be the appropriate forum for these issues to be resolved. The focus of this Court will be (as ours has been) to decide the safety of the conviction bearing in mind the test in fresh evidence appeals which we set out below. That is not to say that such differences cannot be resolved at trial.

Dr Squier produced a slide taken from the brain of a four week old baby which she said demonstrated blood oozing from the dura into the subdural space. In her opinion this showed that intradural haemorrhages could leak into the subdural space and could be mistaken for subdural haemorrhages caused by shearing of the bridging veins. In that respect it challenged the diagnostic value placed on subdural haemmorhages by the triad. Mr Horwell asked for the slide and other slides made in respect of the same brain to be released for examination by the Crown’s experts.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Although, for the reasons already explained, the unified hypothesis can no longer stand as a credible alternative to the triad, a number of issues of general importance in respect of the triad remain. So far we have made no mention of the first two papers produced by Dr Geddes and her co-authors, which we will refer to as Geddes I and Geddes II. These papers represent conclusions reached in respect of research into a cohort of infants all of whom died from inflicted head injuries. Using a technique pioneered by Dr Geddes, the authors sought to identify axonal damage (damage to the nerve tissues) in the brains of these infants. The technique involved detecting the presence of beta-amyloid precursor protein (<span style="font-family:'Arial Narrow'">β</span>-APP) (a protein that builds up where axons have been damaged). The research showed that widespread axonal damage, interpreted as vascular rather than traumatic, was present in 13 of the 37 cases. Conversely, widespread traumatic axonal damage was found in only 2 cases and in both cases there were other very clear signs of trauma (for example bilateral skull fractures). The authors concluded that their findings strongly suggested that severe traumatic axonal damage is a rarity in infant NAHI unless there is considerable impact, and that the diffuse brain damage which was responsible for loss of consciousness in the majority of cases was caused by starvation of oxygen (hypoxic) rather than direct trauma to the brain.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The principle conclusion of Geddes II was that shaking an infant might cause a stretching injury at the cranio-cervical junction to nerves which control the child’s cardio-respiratory system. In all the cases analysed the stretch injury itself was survivable, what was life-threatening was the consequent hypoxic injury and brain swelling that followed as a result of the damaged cardio-respiratory nerves failing to function. The minimum degree of shaking force required to produce such a stretch injury is unknown and a death may be caused in the manner suggested by much less force than hitherto supposed. Although the results of this research, as we understand it, are not challenged by those who criticise the unified hypothesis, Mr Horwell submitted that its effect was limited. For instance he submitted that it had no application to, and could not explain, cases involving subdural bleeding and/or retinal haemmorhages.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This leads on to a very important issue which arises in these appeals and will no doubt arise in many cases where the triad of injuries are present. It is the question of how much force is necessary to cause those injuries. There is a measure of common ground between the doctors on this issue. Generally it is agreed that there is no scientific method of correlating the amount of force used and the severity of the damage caused. To state the obvious, it is not possible to carry out experiments on living children. Further, experience shows that the human frame reacts differently in different infants to the same degree of force. However the medical opinion on this issue appears to be divided into those who maintain that severe injuries can confidently be ascribed to a traumatic cause, for example (but not only) Dr Rorke-Adams, a very experienced paediatric neuropathologist, and those who maintain that very little force may cause very serious injuries, for example Dr John Plunkett, a distinguished anatomical, clinical and forensic pathologist.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is quite impossible for this court to make any finding on this issue beyond referring to some general propositions with which both counsel agreed. First, common sense suggests that the more severe the injuries the more probable they will have been caused by greater force than mere “rough handling”.

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, as Mr Peter Richards, a very experienced neurosurgeon with a speciality in paediatrics, pointed out, if rough handling of an infant or something less than rough handling, commonly caused the sort of injuries which resulted in death, the hospitals would be full of such cases. In our view this points to the fact that cases of serious injuries caused by very minor force such as might occur in normal handling or rough handling of an infant, are likely to be rare or even extremely rare.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">But, thirdly, as Dr Plunkett demonstrated by his research and in particular by reference to an amateur video of a child falling from a 3 foot high railing, described as part of a play tree-house, which resulted in catastrophic injuries, there will be cases where a small degree of force or a minor fall will cause very severe injuries. We shall have more to say about Dr Plunkett’s research later in this judgment, but at this stage we repeat that the evidence suggests that cases where this occurs are likely to be very rare.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Fourthly, although the younger the infant or child, the more vulnerable it is likely to be, it is not possible to conclude that age is necessarily a factor in deciding whether injuries are caused by strong force or a minimal degree of force or impact. The balance of the evidence is that, although an infant’s skull is more pliable than that of an older child, the internal organs and vessels are as robust as those of an older child. The vulnerability of an infant arises from the fact that its head is generally larger in proportion to its body than in an older child and its neck muscles are weaker and not as well developed as in older children, hence the significance of injuries at the site of the craniocervical junction.</p>

Where fresh evidence is adduced on a criminal appeal it is for the Court of Appeal, assuming always that it accepts it, to evaluate its importance in the context of the remainder of the evidence in the case. If the court concludes that the fresh evidence raises no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused it will dismiss the appeal. The primary question is for the court itself and is not what effect the fresh evidence would have had on the mind of the jury. That said, if the court regards the case as a difficult one, it may find it helpful to test its view “by asking whether the evidence, if given at the trial, might reasonably have affected the decision of the trial jury to convict”: <span style="font-style:italic">R v Pendleton</span>[2002] 1<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>WLR 72, 83, para 19.

We have read bundles of reports from numerous experts of great distinction in this field, together with transcripts of their evidence. If we have derived an overwhelming and abiding impression from studying this material, it is that a great deal about death in infancy, and its causes, remain as yet unknown and undiscovered. That impression is confirmed by counsel on both sides. Much work by dedicated men and women is devoted to this problem. No doubt one urgent objective is to reduce to an irreducible minimum the tragic waste of life and consequent life-scarring grief suffered by parents. In the process however much will also be learned about those deaths which are not natural, and are indeed the consequence of harmful parental activity. We cannot avoid the thought that some of the honest views expressed with reasonable confidence in the present case (on both sides of the argument) will have to be revised in years to come, when the fruits of continuing medical research, both hear and internationally, become available.

Dr Squier was of the opinion that the injuries shown in the photographs 1 and 3 and damage to nerve tissue at the cervicocranial junction were probably not caused by trauma and were consistent with herniation of the brain at the foramen magnum. She said herniation was caused by the pressure of the swelling brain when it impacted with the narrowing channel of the foramen magnum. As to the blood shown in photograph 2 Dr Squier said this was intrafalcine bleeding (bruising) within the membrane, seen at post mortem which was an extremely common finding in babies who have suffered from failure from blood or oxygen supply. </p>

She said that it was local tissue necrosis causing bleeding exacerbated by a clotting disorder (DIC).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In our judgment there are difficulties with the evidence of both these doctors in respect of their findings. The problem so far as Dr Squier is concerned is three-fold. First her explanation of herniation as the cause of haemorrhages in the area of the foramen magnum is, on the evidence we have heard, to say the least controversial. Dr Rorke-Adams dismissed this explanation as impossible. Mr Peter Richards said that in his 20 years experience as a surgeon he had never seen a case of herniation of the brain causing haemorrhaging at this site. He described Dr Squier’s evidence on this point as astonishing. Secondly, Dr Squier can provide no explanation for the mechanism that triggered these injuries. All she can say is that the primary source of the injuries was some form of brain swelling, but she was unable to give any precise cause for the swelling. In her view the most likely explanation was sepsis or infection; and the least likely was trauma. Beyond that she frankly admitted she did not know. Thirdly, Dr Giangrande, whose evidence was not challenged, said that there was no question of DIC playing any part in any of these injuries.</p>

First, the injury to the brain which she described by reference to photographs G-H 1, 2 and 3 are not referred to in the post mortem report of Dr Bouch. Secondly, her explanation of a rupture of the vertebral artery may not be entirely consistent with there being no evidence of a soft tissue injury to the neck. But, as she pointed out, at post mortem the vertebral arteries were not dissected. Thirdly, subdural haemorrhages of the spine would appear to be very rare. Fourthly, the subdural haemorrhages described by her are neither thin-film nor situated in the classic position for SBS namely at the top of the head. </p>

And we should also refer to the evidence of Mr Peter Richards. Dr Anslow and Dr Jaspan agreed that the CT scan taken at 11.50am on 5 December at the Queens Medical Centre showed a swollen brain. The sole issue between them was whether the scan showed subdural haemorrhages in the area of the posterior falx (photograph G-H 2). Dr Jaspan concluded that it was subdural; Dr Anslow that it was intradural. In the end this dispute was resolved by Dr Rorke-Adams stating that the photograph taken at post mortem, rather than the scan, showed interdural bleeding or interfalcine bleeding that is bleeding between the two dural layers in and either side of the falx. </p>

Dr Rorke-Adams had described the retinal haemorrhages as severe and towards the top end of the scale. This description was similar to descriptions given by other witnesses. There was also no dispute that on their own retinal haemorrhages findings were not diagnostic of SBS. Next, it was agreed that a sharp surge in ICP could cause retinal haemorrhages although the degree of raised ICP necessary to cause such injuries was not agreed. We have already referred to Mr Richards’ experience of carrying out brain surgery procedures designed to increase venous pressure substantially, but which had not caused  retinal haemorrhages (see paragraph 99).</p>

She said fixed and dilated pupils were a clinical sign of brain swelling. Brain swelling caused stretching of the third nerve which in turn affected the pupils of the eyes. In her opinion the retinal haemorrhages were caused by raised intercranial pressure, a more probable cause than shaking. However, she said that in the absence of evidence of brain swelling the cause of retinal haemorrhages may well be shaking. On the question of the force necessary to cause retinal haemorrhages she said that the fact that the injuries were at the top end of the scale did not provide any information as to their aetiology and “You have to look at the whole picture.” </p>

In evidence, Dr Jaspan said one to two hours after an apnoeic incident one can start to see mild and subtle signs of swelling. The swelling may then progress swiftly in relatively few hours; or in other cases it could take twenty-four to forty-eight hours. Mr Richards said that ICP is normal for some hours after an apnoeic incident, possibly four to five hours before it starts to rise slowly. Mr Gregson also disagreed with Dr Adams on this point. He said that the more likely explanation was at that time, in a period of cardio-arrest, the part of the brain which controls the pupils had become hypoxic (Patrick was noted as pulseless). This would have caused the pupils to become fixed and dilated. This explanation was put to Dr Adams, she said her explanation was more probable and that the explanation given by Mr Gregson was one which only occurred when the infant was near death.</p>

Although he described the retinal haemorrhages findings in Patrick’s case as typical of those found in cases of alleged NAHI, Professor Luthert was one of those doctors who was concerned that the triad was a hypothesis and that the full aetiology of the injuries comprising the triad was not “necessarily known.”</p>

Of course, as Mr Mansfield QC properly pointed out, a defendant faced with an allegation of unlawfully shaking an infant so as to cause injury or death, does not have to provide evidence of, let alone prove, an alternative cause. Nevertheless in cases such as this both prosecution and defence will seek to prove respectively either that there was no alternative cause or that there was one. Not surprisingly we have heard a good deal of evidence on the issue of whether or not Patrick’s condition might have been caused by some form of infection. We have already noted Dr Squier’s opinion that the primary cause of brain swelling in this case was or may have been infection. To deal with this issue we heard evidence principally, but not exclusively, from Professor Morris and Dr Sunderland called on behalf of Harris; and Dr Carole Jenny, Professor Klein and Dr Mark Peters called on behalf of the Crown.</p>

In the end Professor Morris was driven to suggest that there was a possibility that the ambulance crew arrived at the precise moment when Patrick was suffering an unexplained episode from which he would not have recovered.

The triad of injuries was established and there was no credible alternative cause of these injuries. In addition, Dr Rorke-Adams’ evidence of injuries to the brain should be accepted. He submitted that her evidence together with the evidence of the doctors dealing with the ocular injuries demonstrated that unlawful force had been used. He argued that Harris was asking the court to accept that the cause of death was a series of coincidences involving two unlikely syndromes.

If Dr Squier may be right, such evidence of subdural bleeding as she accepts was present was small; untypical of the usual thin-film subdural haemorrhages found in triad cases; in the sense that it was not found at the top of the head and probably not caused by trauma. Secondly, if Dr Squier is, or may be, right there is no pathological evidence of trauma. At one stage Mr Horwell in cross-examination, suggested to Dr Squier that she had lost objectivity in her evidence in this appeal. This was a bold assertion and one which we find difficult to accept. It was put at the end of her evidence when Dr Squier was describing subdural haemorrhages in another case which she said represented bleeding seeping from the dura into the subdural space (see paragraph 71 to 73 above). As we have said already we find it impossible to conclude that on this issue Dr Squier’s evidence is plainly wrong and that Dr Rorke-Adams must be correct.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The importance of Dr Squier’s evidence is that it throws doubt on the significance of such subdural haemorrhages as there are; and it throws doubt on the evidence of injuries to the brain described by Dr Rorke-Adams. We are far from saying that we accept Dr Squier’s evidence in preference to that of Dr Rorke-Adams. Indeed, in view  of the weight of evidence disputing her opinions we have reservations about whether Dr Squier can be right. But equally, in all the circumstances of this case, the differences between them are ones which the jury would have had to have assessed in the light of all the evidence in the case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, although the evidence of the findings of retinal haemorrhages is powerful supporting evidence of shaking, on its own it is not diagnostic of shaking. If the subdural haemorrhages are undermined, the retinal haemorrhages findings will not fill the gap although we recognise that both can be considered together. There is also the issue of whether Dr Adams may be correct in her view that fixed and dilated pupils seen by the ambulance crew was a sign of brain swelling at that time. </p>

This knowledge, and  to an extent Geddes I and II, in our judgment, have had the effect of moderating to some extent the conventional view that strong force is required to cause the triad of injuries. In this case Dr Bouch rejected as an explanation for the injuries he found, shaking by Harris to revive Patrick. Today he might have taken a less firm stance. This knowledge might also have acted as a counter-balance to the evidence given at trial by Professor Green on the amount of force necessary to cause the retinal haemorrhages. </p>

In summary, Harris was described as a careful and caring mother. She called out Dr Barber late at night because of her concerns for Patrick. Dr Barber described her as being calm and controlled at that time. The prosecution’s case at trial was that in the interval between Dr Barber leaving the house and 2.30am when Harris telephoned the emergency services she must have violently and unlawfully shaken Patrick. In our judgment this history combined with the absence of findings of bruises to any part of the head, face or body; and the absence of fractures or any other sign apart from the triad of injuries, does not fit easily with the Crown’s case of an unlawful assault based on the triad of injuries, itself a hypothesis.</p>

First, there is no dispute that Rock did shake Heidi; there is likewise no dispute (given the full thickness bruise to the back of the head) that she suffered an impact.  Secondly, there is no realistic suggestion that disease or infection could possibly have played a role in Heidi’s death. The thrust of the appeal was instead that the conviction was unsafe in the light of research subsequent to the trial, calling into question the minimum degree of force necessary to cause the pathology in this case.  Rock, it was submitted, was not safely convicted of any offence; at the very least, his conviction of murder was unsafe and a conviction of manslaughter should be substituted. </p>

The surrounding circumstances and the injuries suffered amply supported the safety of the conviction.  While conceding in terms that if there had been the “triad” and no more, “that was unlikely ever in itself to be sufficient” to support a charge of murder (as distinct from manslaughter), here it was contended that there were additional features which justified the jury’s verdict – bearing in mind that the intention to cause grievous bodily harm could be both rapidly formed and almost instantly regretted. </p>

The first CT scan, taken on the 2 June 1998 at about 10.21 pm, some 2 ½ hours after Heidi’s admission into hospital, showed a minimally swollen brain but the presence of subdural blood.  On the 4 June, some 39 hours later, the second CT scan revealed a very different picture. This showed, apart from cerebellar tonsillar herniation and established hypoxic ischaemic brain damage, a grossly swollen brain but the same small amount of subdural bleeding – notwithstanding a “huge” (Dr Jaspan’s word) increase in pressure.  Dr Anslow accepted that subdural bleeding at a time when there was no evidence of raised intra-cranial pressure (“ICP”), was a “very strong indicator” of trauma.  On the assumption that Geddes III did not apply, he could think of no cause other than trauma to account for the subdural bleeding.</p>

As we have already indicated such disputes between reputable experts potentially give rise to difficult issues on an appeal of this nature.  In the event, notwithstanding the powerful nature of Dr Jaspan’s evidence in this regard, it is unnecessary for us to resolve this dispute.

She could not be certain which of the three actually happened.  The first scenario involved a low-level fall in which Heidi, among other things<span style="font-style:italic">,</span> knocked the back of her head, resulting in hyperflexion of the neck which damaged her brain stem. The second, also involved a fall, followed by a resuscitative (i.e., well-intentioned) shake by Rock, causing damage to her brain stem.  In both these scenarios, damage to the brain stem resulted in Heidi’s breathing stopping, her brain swelling rapidly and consequential subdural and retinal bleeding.  The third scenario involved an assault on Heidi. We are bound to observe that the suggested sequence of the first two scenarios is troubling, given the apparent conflict with the radiology evidence (see above).  Moreover, Dr Geddes was closely cross-examined as to the factual basis for the first scenario, involving a departure from Rock’s own account of events – in which he was adamant that Heidi had <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> struck her head.   Pressed on this point, Dr Geddes said that she was duty bound to point out that there was impact (given the bruise at the back of Heidi’s head); she thought that Rock must have been wrong in his account but had not given the matter attention when writing her 1999 report; she was (notwithstanding the factual evidence) prepared to speculate to this degree in now giving her evidence to the Court. </p>

Once again, it is not necessary to resolve this dispute and, we proceed on the assumption that Dr Geddes might be correct.

The retinal injuries were at the very top of the range or not far from it. There were in addition para-macular retinal folds, a type of detached retina.

In his report of 14 April 1999, he was of the opinion that, absent any alternative explanation, severe trauma, such as shaking combined with impact, was the most likely explanation for the pathological findings in Heidi’s eyes.  In his letter dated 12 January 2005, he maintained the view that such trauma (i.e., shaking, impact or both) was the most likely cause of Heidi’s death and the condition of her brain and eyes.

Pressed, unsurprisingly, on this point, he ultimately accepted that a fall onto her bottom would not be expected to cause injuries of this nature.  Although he said that he had seen “more severe” retinal injuries, he further accepted that these were “highly significant”, a description which he later amplified as meaning “extremely significant and abnormal pathology”.  While he did not view the presence of para-macular folds as diagnostic of shaking, he agreed that they could not “in their entirety” have been artefactual – a necessary concession, as they had been noted during Heidi’s lifetime.  He agreed in cross-examination that the “most likely explanation” for Heidi’s retinal injuries was shaking.  In re-examination, Professor Luthert said that a version of the facts, in effect based on Dr Geddes’ first two scenarios, was not fanciful.   </p>

We accept of course that Rock was a man of good character and that in general, he had been very good with Heidi.  But there was also evidence of some hostility towards her, prior to the events of the 2 June 1998.  Perhaps more tellingly, there was the evidence from the neighbour, Ms Banham, that, on the night, she heard Heidi screaming for a significant period of time and Rock shouting at her to “fucking shut up”; then it all went quiet.  For completeness, we do not think that the reliability of Ms Banham’s evidence is called into question by the mere fact of there being some unused and untested material from police officers, apparently saying that they could not hear shouting between the two houses.</p>

We are, moreover, unable to accept that Rock’s version of events was innocently mistaken, along the lines that he had simply not seen her strike her head. As set out above, he was adamant that he had prevented her hitting her head.  We naturally have regard to the burden of proof resting on the Crown throughout. That burden may however be satisfied by reliance on such inferences which it is proper to draw from Heidi’s injuries, taken together with Ms. Banham’s evidence and the absence of an explanation from Rock, with whom Heidi was alone at the relevant time. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As has been seen, the presence of subdural haemorrhages was common ground between the relevant experts. It was also indisputable that the subdural haemorrhages preceded the development of brain swelling and that there was no evidence of any increase in subdural bleeding notwithstanding the rise in intracranial pressure following the swelling of the brain. Pausing there, these features would themselves have gone a very long way to undermine the credibility of Geddes III, had that hypothesis not in any event been withdrawn in the manner already described. Matters do not end there.  Without Geddes III, Geddes I and II cannot suggest a mechanism to explain the subdural haemorrhages; strikingly, as we have seen, Dr Geddes in her evidence could not explain them.  There is accordingly no realistic challenge here to the “traditional” mechanism of the tearing of bridging veins.  If so, it necessarily follows that Heidi was subject to a degree of force sufficient to tear those veins. </p>

On the totality of the evidence, we are sure that these were at the top end of the scale (Dr Gregson and Dr Adams) and we are not deterred from that conclusion by anything said by Professor Luthert, if indeed he ultimately disagreed. We cannot necessarily infer from the severity of those injuries, including the presence of the para-macular folds, that any precise or specific degree of force was used; we are acutely conscious both of “thin skull” cases on the one hand and of “lucky” victims on the other.    We have, however, no realistic doubt that the force used must have been – as even Professor Luthert was minded to agree – in excess of anything generated by a reasonable person in the course of rough play. We further have no real doubt that the cause of those injuries was shaking or shaking plus an impact; if anything, we favour the latter given the presence of the bruise at the back of the head.  In all the circumstances, we regard as fanciful the notion that Heidi’s retinal injuries can be explained by a fall in which she struck her head and was then the subject of a well-intentioned resuscitative shake (Geddes, first and second scenarios).</p>

First, there is no proper factual foundation for Dr Plunkett’s evidence; his opinion rests on a version of events relying on Rock’s account of an accidental fall but departing from it so as to account for Heidi striking her head when falling.  Secondly, Dr Plunkett’s suggestion that the bruise at the back of Heidi’s head caused her death, lacks credibility.  Quite apart from more general considerations as to the relevance of Dr Plunkett’s study to cases such as these (see below, when dealing with Cherry), his thesis here does not begin to address the subdural haemorrhages and retinal injuries.</p>

Apart from the bruises to the neck, no other injuries were found. As the judge said, an intent to do serious bodily harm may be quickly formed and soon regretted; but so may a less serious intent, simply to stop a child crying by handling him in a way any responsible adult would realise would cause serious damage or certainly might do so.

A brief period of violence (going beyond even rough play) was all that was required to cause Heidi’s fatal injuries; such violence undoubtedly furnishes the mental element necessary for a conviction of manslaughter; but it does not necessarily demonstrate an intention to cause grievous bodily harm, the relevant intention if the conviction of murder was to be upheld. </p>

She said that the possibility of Sarah suffering a fatal injury as a result of falling from the chair had to be considered afresh in the light of Dr Plunkett’s research.  The “primary brain pathology” was due to lack of oxygen; this hypoxic-ischaemic injury could have been caused as a result of primary injury to the brain, causing Sarah to stop breathing and/or as a result of “vomiting with inhalation of vomit into the lungs”. She would “still to some extent be unhappy as regards the scalp bruises arising in a fall but it has to be a considered possibility that Sarah’s head impacted against some other surface as well as the ground”. </p>

She agreed that Sarah had up to a maximum of 22 bruises; she was “concerned” about that number of bruises.  They were probably “more than” fair wear and tear for a 21 month old.  In the absence of proper explanation, they were highly suggestive of abuse.  There had been no developments in science between the trial and the appeal to alter her view as to the relevance of the two sites of scalp bruising.  Her view at the trial (and she was the person who had conducted the post-mortem) was that those two areas of bruising had been caused at about the same time.  She had herself identified traumatic injury to the brain.  She accepted that the subdural bleeding occurred because of the tearing of bridging veins. </p>

Sarah’s injuries were caused by “trauma”; the “pattern of injury” was characteristic of both shaking and impact; it was a combination of both.   Although the degree of injury could not be correlated with the degree of force, considering the injuries as a whole, they must have been caused by “strong force”. </p>

There was some dispute between these two witnesses as to whether further injury to the brain, which it is unnecessary to detail, was also attributable to trauma or was artefactual in origin.  Impressed as we were by Dr Rorke-Adams’ evidence in this regard (the coincidence relied upon by Professor Whitwell seemed unlikely), this is another of those areas where we do not think it would be right simply to discount a reputable expert’s contrary views.  We therefore proceed with this appeal on the assumption (in favour of Cherry) that the brain damage suffered by Sarah did not extend beyond the areas of agreement between Professor Whitwell and Dr Rorke-Adams, summarised above.</p>

Over 11 ½ years, he had identified 18 fatalities from head and neck injuries involving falls. None of the children (or infants) in his study had formal retinal examinations. These cases included falls from swings, which, he agreed were complex or complicated falls.  He further agreed that none of these cases were similar to a shaken baby case.

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“ A 23 month-old was playing on a plastic gym set in the garage at her home…She had climbed the attached ladder to the top rail above the platform and was straddling the rail, with her feet 0.70 metres (28 inches) above the floor. She lost her balance and fell headfirst onto a 1-cm (3/8 inch) thick piece of plush carpet remnant covering the concrete floor. She struck the carpet first with her outstretched hands, then with the right front side of her forehead, followed by her right shoulder. Her grandmother had been watching …. And videotaped the fall. She cried after the fall but was alert and talking…However, approximately 5 minutes later she vomited and became stuporous…. A CT scan indicated a large right-sided subdural haematoma…. The haematoma was immediately evacuated. She remained comatose postoperatively, developed cerebral oedema with herniation, and was removed from life support 36 hours after the fall…..”</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.50in">Dr Plunkett suggested that, as her head had been some 42 inches above the ground when the fall began and as her body length was some 30 inches, it was equivalent to her falling from a chair 12 inches high.   We confess some difficulty with this reasoning but we nonetheless continue with our consideration of Dr Plunkett’s evidence.  We do acknowledge that we felt, as indeed Dr Anslow  later expressed it, “shocked” that a fall, as captured on the video (which was shown to the Court), could have resulted in a fatality; this, indeed, may be the strength of Dr Plunkett’s evidence, so far as it goes.  Nonetheless, it is pertinent to record the following:  (i) It transpired, as explained by Dr Plunkett in his oral evidence following the playing of the video, that the rail from which the child fell was in fact 39 inches above the floor, not 28 inches;  (ii) she fell a sufficient distance for her to rotate and so as to fall onto her head with some 2/3 of her body weight contributing to the impact; (iii) there was a lucid interval after the fall (unlike the cases before us); (iv) the haematoma was large and lop-sided (again unlike the thin film haematomas encountered in cases such as the present); Dr Plunkett agreed that the mass effect of this haematoma caused the child’s death.  Notwithstanding all these factors, Dr Plunkett continued to maintain that the Case 5 fall was “exactly comparable” to a 12 inch fall.  The velocity was relevant and what was not known was the “minimal impact velocity” required to cause these types of injuries.  </p>

In any event though for a time it seemed that Dr Plunkett was resistant to the suggestion, the distance of a fall is a necessarily relevant consideration.  Dr Plunkett’s own formula for impact velocity was as follows:  Velocity (V) squared = 2 x Acceleration (A) x Distance (D). From this it must follow that, all other things being equal, a reduction in D will result in a reduced V. </p>

Dr Thibault, whose approach to ‘injury thresholds’ we have described earlier, considered that the forces applied to the head in a 3 foot impact fall onto carpet represented approximately 50,000 radians per second squared, whereas the injury threshold associated with subdural haemorrhage and diffuse axonal haemorrhage were between 8,000 and 12,000 radians per second squared. A 3 foot fall therefore, in Dr Thibault’s view, is well within the physical context in which subdural bleeding and DAI may occur. Dr Thibault identified the primary point of impact to be the occipital region. The cause of subdural bleeding is accepted to be rupture of bridging veins, but such a rupture could occur, in Dr Thibault’s opinion, as a result of the substantial internal rotational forces that arise when a child falls and impacts her head. He concluded that whilst deliberate inflicted injury cannot be ruled out, the injuries were entirely consistent with the mechanics of the speculated accidental fall.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Dr Bertocci explained that her habitual starting point when asked to determine whether a given account fits the resulting injuries is to begin with an assessment of any bruising found on the child: ‘bruising represents points of force application and a roadmap to the child’s exposure’ to force. Dr Thibault considered that the two apparently separate sites of impact could be explained by a fall inducing a well-distributed contact load across the occipital region resulting in dynamic in-bending of the skull and contusion to the outer left and right margins of the total contact area. The presence of bruising on two opposite sides of the head indicated to Dr Bertocci two very different lines of force applied from differing directions, and is not consistent with a fall from a chair. Further, Dr Bertocci observed that the size of the scalp bruises at 2.5cm and 3.5cm are much larger than bruises found in children injured through accidents. Finally, Dr Bertocci summarised published research and her own unit’s experiments with an automotive “12 month old” crash test dummy. Her conclusion, which is again in total contrast to that of Dr Thibault, was that a 12 month old falling from a 9 inch vertical position impacting their head on a padded carpet surface would produce head accelerations that are well below published biomechanical injury thresholds. She concluded that Sarah’s injuries are not attributable to a fall from a 9 inch chair.</p>

With regard to the latter, there is no dispute here that they were caused by the tearing of bridging veins.  Two elements of the “triad” are thus present.  For reasons already set out, although there were retinal haemorrhages (the third element of the triad), these are neutral and do not advance the argument of either party on the appeal. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">Even if (contrary to the above) it was thought that Dr Plunkett’s study did mean that a fall from the chair here was capable of furnishing a realistically possible innocent explanation for Sarah’s death, it remains necessary to address the two separate sites of scalp bruising. Professor Whitwell conducted the post-mortem; as she agreed in her oral evidence, her impression (at least at the time of the trial) was that the two separate areas of scalp bruising had been caused at about the same time.   Inevitably and as Professor Whitwell further agreed, no scientific developments since the trial could alter the relevance of these two separate sites of bruising.  Accordingly, for the fall to be capable of providing an innocent explanation of these injuries, it was necessary to postulate two impacts (window and floor) in the course of the same fall.  As it seems to us, this is pure speculation and stretches credibility altogether too far. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">We have set out earlier Mr Richards’ observations (i) that if such falls did generate severe injuries, casualty departments and the like would be inundated; but (ii) that in more than 20 years of practice he had never encountered a severe head injury in a child of this age arising from a 6 inch fall.   Some caution is necessary in approaching these observations; first, there is no claim that serious injury is the inevitable result of falls of this nature; secondly, “never” is an unfortunate word.  Nonetheless, when this evidence based on practical experience is considered cumulatively with reasons i) – iii) above, it furnishes powerful support for the conclusion that the notion of an accidental fall in this case, causing or contributing to Sarah’s death, is simply fanciful.</p>

This is a complex, developing and (as yet) necessarily uncertain area of scince, as illustrated by the stark divergence of opinion between Dr Bertocci and Dr Thibault.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Pulling the threads together, this is a case of a sudden collapse of a 21 month old child.  Cherry was alone at home with her. His factual account cannot explain her injuries and death.  Upon analysis, the possible explanations advanced on his behalf on the appeal do not carry credibility. The case cannot be one of SIDS, given, as is undisputed, her traumatically caused subdural haemorrhaging.  As it seems to us, in the light of those subdural haemorrhages and the separate sites of scalp bruising, the inference can properly be made that her injuries and death were attributable to a combination of shaking and impact.  On any realistic view (and in this case we are of course only concerned with a count of manslaughter), the force involved must have been such that the risk of some harm to Sarah would have been foreseeable to all sober and reasonable people.  In the circumstances, unless there is anything in the argument as to the shift in the Crown’s case between trial and appeal rendering the conviction unsafe (see below), we are amply satisfied of the safety of Cherry’s conviction for manslaughter.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We are fortified in this conclusion by the evidence as to up to 22 bruises on Sarah’s body. As Professor Whitwell was driven to agree, these were highly suggestive of abuse, in the absence of proper explanation of which there was and has been none. In approaching this evidence, we have thought it right to proceed with caution; as the summing-up suggests, at the trial, Cherry was treated as a good stepfather and there had been no suggestion of any improper behaviour towards Sarah or any of the other children. But on the state of the evidence at the trial, there may have been no need for the Crown to explore this wider area.  Cherry, having introduced new lines of inquiry on the appeal, cannot, we think, complain at all the evidence being revisited. While even then we would have hesitated long and hard before treating this question of bruising as determinative of the appeal, in this appeal we see no unfairness in taking it into account as an additional reason pointing towards the safety of the conviction. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally, we turn to Mr Mansfield’s submission that the conviction was unsafe because of the shift in the Crown’s position between trial and appeal; at trial, this had been a case of impact; now it was one of both shaking and impact. Cherry did not have a fair opportunity to deal with the “new” case; nor did the jury consider it.   With respect, we cannot agree.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First, as a matter of principle and as already foreshadowed in dealing with the evidence of bruising to Sarah’s body, once an appellant has introduced new evidence on the appeal, he can hardly complain if such evidence is answered or rebutted by the Crown.  Unavoidably, in such a process, the nature of the case may take on a different hue and there may be some change in the manner in which the Crown puts its case.  But it cannot be, that on this ground alone, a conviction must be regarded as unsafe; fresh evidence, once admitted, may serve to confirm, not only to undermine, the safety of a conviction. Accordingly, if on all the evidence before this Court, the only reasonable conclusion is that, considered in the round, the conviction is safe, the Court should give effect to that conclusion:  <span style="font-style:italic">R v Hanratty (Dec’d)</span> [2002] 2 Cr.

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, however, this principle is qualified by consideration of fact and degree.  In an individual case where an issue of this kind arises, it may be that the Crown’s change of position between trial and appeal is such that the conviction cannot be considered safe. Whether it does or not will necessarily depend on the facts of the particular case.  Here, we see nothing in the development of the Crown’s case on the appeal that renders Cherry’s conviction unsafe.  The essential question for the jury was whether Sarah’s death was accidental or the result of some unlawful act on the part of Cherry. That was the fundamental divide; in this case, given the nature of Cherry’s evidence, the mechanism was necessarily of secondary importance. It is true that the mechanism favoured by the Crown at trial was one of impact. It is further true that on appeal the Crown’s case as to mechanism has evolved to one of a combination of shaking and impact. That evolution, however, cannot have caused Cherry any prejudice.  Moreover, any suggestion here that a well-intentioned shake was capable of giving rise to a possible defence depended on the credibility of the explanations we have already dismissed, namely those relating to the low-level fall and/or the aspiration of vomit. </p>

Firstly the publication of Geddes I and II which, it is said, provides a basis for questioning the explanations previously advanced for N’s injuries, and, secondly, a judgment given by Mr Justice Eady in a libel case, <span style="font-style:italic">Reed and Lillee v Newcastle City Council</span> [2002] EWHC 1600 (QBD) in which Dr San Lazaro, a key prosecution expert witness in the Faulder case, had been severely criticised. In addition the Notice of Appeal relies upon a new explanation, the MORO reflex, which might explain N’s sudden movement and subsequent fall from Faulder’s outstretched arm. Finally, the Notice relies upon fresh expert evidence from Professor Whitwell, which calls into question the Crown’s view at trial that this was primarily a shaking injury, her opinion being that there was evidence of a number impacts (which might fit Faulder’s account) and that the primary cause of collapse was likely to be cessation of breathing and consequent brain damage, rather than primary brain damage due to direct trauma.</p>

As the Commission’s statement observes, “within this paradigm, Mr Faulder’s explanation is inadequate.” The Commission refers to Geddes I and II and postulates that Faulder’s explanation becomes more plausible if the cause of N’s collapse is cessation of breathing.

He drew attention to the fact that the skull of a 7 week old infant differs fundamentally from that of an older infant or adult. A scalp impact to a 7 week old would cause the skull to bend inwards or deform, with a consequent deformation or movement within the brain itself. This movement, Dr Plunkett advised, could cause subdural haemorrhages and functional brain damage, for example breathing difficulties. Both Dr Plunkett and Professor Whitwell accepted that the subdural haemorrhages were assumed to have been caused by tearing of bridging veins. The minimal impact velocity needed to cause these injuries is not known, but as N did not have any skull fracture or brain contusion, Dr Plunkett postulated that the impact velocity was extremely low. In this manner, Dr Plunkett considered that all of N’s injuries could be explained by the account of the fall given by Faulder. Dr Plunkett did not however accept that N had as many as 6 external head injuries believing that there were only three. In particular Dr Plunkett considered that marked swelling seen on the scans was a manifestation of the triangular shaped bruise seen earlier over the top of the occipital bone which, he explained, had migrated to the back of the head by reason of gravity. This explanation and the further explanation proffered by Professor Whitwell that the two forehead bruises were caused during treatment, were rejected by each of the relevant experts for the Crown. In so far as may be necessary we were not persuaded by Dr Plunkett or Professor Whitwell on these issues and, having seen the relevant photographs, scans and medical notes, have no difficulty in finding that there were indeed six separate sites of external head injury as listed above at paragraph 219.</p>

It was therefore surprising that it was only after a substantial number of questions in cross examination that Dr Sunderland responded to junior counsel for the Crown by saying “I am allowing you to develop your proposition. At some point I must help you. I do not think the MORO reflex is relevant to Faulder. But I am cutting in, you develop your proposition.” We found Dr Sunderland’s contribution in this regard fell short of that which is required by the court from an expert witness.</p>

Dr Thibault’s opinion is however upon the basis that there were only two impacts: one being the linear bruise above the left ear (number (iii) in our list) and the other which caused both of the marks above the right eye (numbers (iv) and (v)). Dr Thibault discounted the swelling on the back of the head (number (vi)) which is only visible on the scan on the basis that if this had been traumatic one would have expected the treating clinicians to have noted it and, further, there is no note of any surface marking at the same location indicating an impact. The report does not consider the area of erythema located directly on top of the head ((i)) or the triangular fresh bruise 2cm by 2cm above the forehead ((ii)), these marks are shown in the photographs, however the photographs were not made available to Dr Thibault.</p>

The fall as described by Faulder would, according to Dr Thibault, have been sufficient in magnitude to deform the skull and cause shifting and deformation of the underlying bridging veins and neural tissue thereby producing acute SDH. He also postulated the temporary deformation causing a temporary herniation at the cranio-cervical junction leading to consequent interference with the respiratory system and thereby hypoxic-ischaemic injury.</p>

He considered that the most substantial impact was that which caused swelling to the right parietal region, with the other bruises resulting from injuries of lesser magnitude. Dr Jaspan, in a balanced report, drew attention to the fact that only four of the eight elements that would normally constitute a diagnostic ‘full house’ for inflicted injury were present in this case, namely: unexplained encephalopathy, scalp bruising, subdural haemorrhages and secondary hypoxic-ischaemic injury. He therefore considered that accidental trauma could not be entirely excluded, but some form of inflicted injury was the most likely cause.</p>

If such a fall took place, Mr Richards would have anticipated a hairline skull fracture or a fractured clavicle. On the other hand, such a fall was unlikely to cause such severe brain substance injury and subdural haemorrhages. He concluded that it was highly likely that N suffered inflicted NAHI.</p>

Dr Rorke-Adams was the only witness to put forward this interpretation of the evidence. As a pathologist Dr Rorke-Adams was at a similar disadvantage to Professor Whitwell in this case. Equally, Dr Rorke-Adams is not a radiologist. Dr Jaspan in a very thorough report on the series of scans does not identify any particular difference in presentation between the two sides of the brain. We are therefore cautious about placing undue weight about Dr Rorke-Adams’s conclusion that there was a focal (as opposed to a diffuse) brain injury. </p>

At some stage N arched his back, slipped off the arm and fell, catching his back on a push-chair and his head on the bar of a high-chair before hitting the floor headfirst. At trial, Dr San Lazaro did not accept that a 7 week old child could make sufficient jerking, arching or rolling movement to propel itself from a carer’s arm. That was also the position of a number of the Crown’s experts on paper at the start of this appeal. During oral evidence, as we have already noted, Mr Richards came to accept that N may have fallen in the manner described by Faulder simply as a result of a gravity roll from his insecure position lying along Faulder’s arm.

His opinion was that the subdural haemorrhages and brain injury were the result of shaking and were the sort of injuries seen “in older children who have been hit by a car at 40 mph, spun round and eventually hit the floor”. He described the mechanism for the brain injury by imagining that the brain was similar in substance to porridge, with the shaking causing the brain to accelerate and decelerate many times causing a spinning effect which was “just like putting a food mixer inside the brain.” He further postulated that the trauma to the brain may have interfered with breathing, thereby causing further brain damage. Dr San Lazaro, at trial, explained that only “very severe forces” or “severe massive deceleration forces” would account for the brain injuries which were caused by “violent shaking and slamming down”. In the CCRC report for this appeal, Dr Lazaro and Dr Alexander are quoted as stating in letters written to the CCRC in 2001 that N’s injuries included “brain contusions”.</p>

There is no challenge to the primary evidence of fact given by Dr San Lazaro. If Dr San Lazaro had remained the leading Crown expert in the case, there might well have been some concern arising from Eady J’s findings, however the wealth of medical evidence that has now been acquired indicates that even were her evidence to be totally ignored there is a substantial body of expert opinion that supports the Crown’s case as it is now cast.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Coming to a conclusion about the external head injuries is, however, a very much more straightforward task compared to consideration of the internal injuries. Having heard all of the evidence we are not in a position to reject Professor Whitwell’s opinion that the key event was a nerve injury at the cranio-cervical junction. That opinion is based on the Geddes I and II research, which has been largely accepted by the scientific community. If that opinion is correct, then the severity of the brain injury does not arise from the degree of force used, but from the extent to which the brain is starved of oxygen and/or blood. Questions of degree of force, on the Whitwell basis, are confined to the minimum force needed (a) to cause the cranio cervical junction nerve damage and (b) the subdural haemorrhage.</p>

Dr Jaspan considered that only four of a possible eight signs for NAHI were present. We would add that of those four, only two are direct evidence of a primary event involving force (scalp bruising and subdural haemmorhage) whereas the other two are, or could be, secondary consequences of the primary event (unexplained encephalopathy and secondary hypoixic-ischaemic injury).</p>

In relation to Faulder’s appeal we are troubled by Dr Plunkett declining to accept that N had more than three sites of injury. Our approach has been to evaluate each case by considering all of the symptoms as a whole, as well as individually. Dr Plunkett’s inability to include and account for the six sites of injury must devalue, but not eliminate, the importance of his evidence in this particular case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In conclusion we are struck in this appeal by the very radical change in the Crown case; the jury considered one case, shaking, yet that case is now rejected and we have been asked to consider a totally different allegation of multiple blows to the head. During the summing up at trial the jury were told that Dr San Lazaro was “very, very experienced” and “specialises in child protection and abuse” cases. They were also reminded that Dr San Lazaro had said “I am as certain as you can be in medicine” in her opinion that this was a shaking injury. This “certain” opinion from the Crown’s principal witness is now rejected by Crown experts who are equally firm in their own opinion. We have to consider the evidence in its totality, both at trial and before us. There are, as we have observed, now five different explanations put forward by experts for N’s injuries. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In relation to Cherry’s appeal we have stressed that the mere fact that there has been some change in the manner in which the Crown puts its case will not automatically lead to a conclusion that the conviction is unsafe. It will be a matter of fact and degree to be considered in each individual case. In contrast to Cherry’s case, the turnaround in the Crown’s case in Faulder could hardly be more substantial. This factor, coupled with the introduction of potentially credible alternative explanations presented by the defence experts, drives us to the conclusion that, despite the number of bruises found, this conviction must now be considered unsafe. We therefore allow the appeal and quash the conviction.</p>

In cases involving allegations of child abuse the judge should be prepared to give directions in respect of expert evidence taking into account the guidance to which we have just referred.
