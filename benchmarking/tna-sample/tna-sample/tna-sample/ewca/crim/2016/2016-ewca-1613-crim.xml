	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">This group of cases are not connected save for the need to consider, individually for each case, the impact on convictions (mainly, but not entirely, for murder) of the decision of the Supreme Court on 18 February 2016 in R v Jogee, Ruclclock v The Queen [2016] IJKSC 8. [2016] 2 WLR 681 ("Jogee") in relation to the issue of joint enterprise as a consequence of the reversal of the pre-existing law laid down in Chan Wing-Siu v The Queen [1985] AC 168 and R v Powell, R v English [1999] 1 AC l.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">Had the change of law identified in Jogee been set out in statute (as opposed to judicial decision of the Supreme Court), there would be no question of re-visiting any such convictions: the new law would apply only prospectively. On the basis that the Supreme Court identifies the law both prospectively and retrospectively, however, review requires consideration of the concept of safe conviction as well as the impact of late (out of time) appeals in circumstances where it is not suggested that judges at <img src="image6.jpg" style="width:0.003334426946631671in;height:0.006667760279965004in;"/>trial did not faithfully follow the law as then articulated by the House of Lords but whose directions, as a consequence of Jogee, no longer comply with what the present common law dictates.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">In approaching appeals in respect of convictions prior to the decision in Jogee consideration has to be given to the extent to which the verdict could only properly be interpreted in accordance with the common law principles of joint enterprise (two or more people setting out to commit an offence, crime A, or intending to encourage or assist in the commission of that offence) rather than parasitic accessory liability. As Jogee explains (at [2]), the latter arose (following Chan Wing-Siu v The Queen and R v Powell, R v English) where, in the course of that joint enterprise to commit crime A <img src="image7.jpg" style="width:0.023336614173228347in;height:0.043336614173228344in;"/>one of the co-adventurers DI, commits another offence, crime B: the others involved in the original joint enterprise were guilty as an accessory to crime B if they or any of them had foreseen the possibility that DI might act as he did, As Lord Hughes and Lord Toulson go on to explain, the law, as then formulated, was that:</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">In that context, for murder, the law also required consideration of whether a weapon used to cause death was "fundamentally different" from any weapon of which D2 had knowledge although, in Powell &amp; English, Lord Hutton added that if the contemplated weapon was "different to. but as dangerous as" the weapon used, D2 should not escape conviction if he foresaw that the different weapon might be used to kill (or, presumably, cause serious bodily injury): see [1999] 1 AC at 30. The effect of Jogee, however, is that save when death is caused by some overwhelming supervening act,</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:-0.00in">relegating what had gone before to history, there would "normally" be no occasion to consider the concept of "fundamental departure". Lord Hughes and Lord Toulson observed (at [98]):</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.03in;margin-right:0.99in;text-indent:0.01in">"What matters is whether D2 encouraged or assisted the crime, whether it be murder or some other offence. He need not encourage or assist a particular way of committing it, although he may sometimes do so. In particular, his intention to assist in a crime of violence is not determined only by whether he knows what kind of weapon DI has in his possession. ... If that crime is murder, then the question is whether he intended to assist the intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm at least <img src="image9.jpg" style="width:0.10668088363954506in;height:0.020002187226596677in;"/>Knowledge or ignorance that weapons generally, or a particular weapon, is carried by DI will be evidence going to what the intention of D2 was, and may be irresistible evidence one way or the other, but it is evidence and no more."</p>

After Jogee, however, even if <img src="image11.jpg" style="width:0.020002187226596677in;height:0.046671041119860014in;"/>the facts of any individual case raise concern as to the safety of a conviction for murder, a conviction for manslaughter does not depend on knowledge of the weapon. The test (articulated at [96]) is put in this way:</p>

So also if he participates by encouragement or assistance in any other unlawful act which all sober and reasonable people would realise carried the risk of some harm (not necessarily serious) to another, and death in fact results: R v Church [1965] I QB 59, approved in Director of Public Prosecutions v Newbury [1977] AC 50() and very recently re-affirmed in R v F (J) &amp; E (N) [2015] EWCA Crim 351: [2015] 2 Cr App R 5. The test is objective. As the Court of Appeal held in Reid, if a person goes out with armed companions to cause harm to another. any reasonable person would recognise that there is not only a risk of harm, but a risk of the violence escalating to the point at which serious harm or death may result. Cases in which D2 intends some harm falling short of grievous bodily harm are a fortiori. but manslaughter is not limited to these.<img src="image12.jpg" style="width:0.06334208223972003in;height:0.04000437445319335in;"/></p>

What is critical is that the verdict is thereby rendered unsafe. Indeed, s. 2(2) emphasises that position by underlining that the court shall allow the appeal if they "think that the conviction is unsafe" but "shall dismiss such an appeal in any other case". Thus, the decision in any case must be fact sensitive: a <img src="image14.jpg" style="width:0.0033333333333333335in;height:0.006667760279965004in;"/>misdirection of law which was not, in reality, in relation to a true (or real) issue in the trial, does not thereby (and certainly not necessarily) render a conviction unsafe. That much was made clear in the series of appeals that followed R v Preddy [19961 AC 1 15 which also modified previously understood common law. In R v Graham &amp; other cases [1997] 1 Cr App R 302, Lord Bingham CJ put the matter in this way:</p>

But if, for whatever reason, the court concludes that the appellant was wrongly convicted of the offence charged, or is left in doubt whether the appellant was rightly convicted of that offence or not, then it must of necessity consider the conviction unsafe.

The error identified, of equating foresight with intent to assist rather than treating the first as evidence of the second, is important as a matter of legal principle, but it does not follow that it will have been important on the facts to the outcome of the trial or to the safety of the conviction."</p>

In that regard, the appeal of Moises is a clear example of a case where the application for leave to appeal on grounds based on the decision in Jogee was brought within the requisite time period but it did not follow that the conviction was unsafe Applications for exceptional leave</p>

Indeed, in that case, the decision generally to allow those being questioned access to legal advice was specifically limited when applying the law of Scotland by the principle of legal certainty such that it was made clear that cases which had been finally determined (without such access having been granted) should not be reopened.</p>

That court has power to grant such leave, and may do so if substantial injustice be demonstrated, but it will not do so simply because the law applied has now been declared to have been mistaken. This principle has been consistently applied for many years. Nor is refusal of leave limited to cases where the defendant could, if the true position in law had been appreciated, have been charged with a different offence. An example is Ramsden [1972] Crim LR 547, where a defendant who had been convicted of dangerous driving, before Gosney (1971) 55 Cr App R 5()2 had held that fault was a necessary ingredient of the offence, was refused leave to appeal out of time after that latter decision had been published. The court observed that alarming consequences would flow from permitting the general re-opening of old cases on the ground that a decision of a court of authority had removed a widely held misconception as to the prior state of the law on which the conviction which it was sought to appeal had been based. No doubt otherwise everyone convicted of dangerous driving over a period of several years could have advanced the same application. Likewise in Mitchell [1977] 1 WLR 753, 757, (1977) 65 Cr App R 185, 189, Geoffrey Lane LJ re-stated the principle thus:</p>

That said, the decision provides valuable illumination of the need to emphasise that appeals against conviction in change of law cases involve significant social and public considerations which go well beyond a narrow focus of an individual conviction."</p>

If crime A is a crime of violence which the jury concluded must have involved the use of a weapon so that the inference of participation with an intention to cause really serious harm is strong, that is likely to be very difficult. At the other end of the spectrum, if crime A is a different crime, not involving intended violence or use of force, it may well be easier to demonstrate substantial injustice. The court will also have regard to other matters including whether the applicant was guilty of other, though less serious, criminal conduct. It is not, however, in our view, material to consider the length of time that has elapsed, If there was a substantial injustice, it is irrelevant whether that injustice occurred a short time or a long time ago. It is and remains an injustice.</p>

Such an approach is consistent with the approach the court took in relation to observations made by judges in life sentence cases when it was their practice to make reports to the Home Secretary for the purposes of the determination of the tariff: see Jones [1998] 2 Cr App R 53 and Dillon [1997] 2 Cr App R 104.</p>

It was submitted by Mr Moloney QC that the observations of Hughes LJ at paragraph 40 of R vR and others [2006] EWCA Crim 1974, [2007] 1 Cr App R 10 in respect of the practice to be followed in applications for leave to appeal after the reinterpretation of a statute by the House of Lords in R v Saik meant that the consideration of substantial injustice should begin with the primary consideration of whether the conviction should now be regarded as unsafe. It is clear from what Hughes LJ said and from the authorities cited, that the task of the court is first to determine whether there may have been a substantial injustice which involves the wider considerations to which we have referred. Having said that, if the threshold required to justify exceptional leave to appeal is reached, it is likely to be difficult to conclude that the conviction remains safe.</p>

It was claimed that the two Johnson brothers and the co-accused Mitchell approached the deceased in his car in the early hours to sell him drugs. The deceased wrongly feared he was about to be attacked and started to kick and punch them. As Asher Johnson sought to defend himself, the deceased reached for and got hold of a knife which was eventually turned on him by Green who used it in self-defence.</p>

After a short discussion on the jury note where counsel for Lewis Johnson and Asher Johnson made submissions to the judge, the judge slightly expanded the direction he gave in response to the jury note, It appears from the transcript that the result of the discussion resulted in a direction which appeared satisfactory to all. In any event the judge did not misdirect the jury or fundamentally alter the way the case had been put. The expanded version was always a possible route to verdict and one of which experienced trial counsel were no doubt aware. If any counsel needed more time to assist the judge on answering the jury note they should have pressed the judge for more time.</p>

Yet, the prosecution in cross-examining the co-accused appeared to suggest that Terrelonge was the stabber o Mr Lakha QC complained that this amounted to a volte face on the part of the prosecution and undermined Terrelonge's decision not to give evidence based as it was, in part, on the state of the case at that time.</p>

The test to be applied is a simple one: have the applicants satisfied the burden on them to establish that no reasonable jury applying their minds properly to the facts of the case could arrive at their conclusions? (per Fanning and others [2016/ EVVCA Crini 550). In our view, a reasonable jury could properly distinguish between the men in the docka The jury was not bound to follow the approach advocated by the prosecution. Here there were differences in the cases and in the evidence against each of the accused. Terrlonge bore the deceased a grudge and recruited the others to attack the deceased. Terrelonge equipped Carnegie with a bottle. Terrelonge's case was that they intended to fight the deceased with fists, feet or a bottle. Burton knew Terrelonge intended a "confrontation" with the deceased. Both Burton and Terrelonge were at the forefront of the attack and both repeatedly assaulted the deceased. Dyer was also there but it is reasonable to assume that when he gave evidence, his account raised a doubt in the minds of the jury whereas Burton did not. Terrelonge did not give evidence.</p>

It was the prosecution case that Hore's role was to lure the deceased to a rendezvous on a disused railway (known as the "loop line"), where the deceased thought Hore would hand over the cannabis whereas, in truth, the plan was to attack him.</p>

Hussain had something in his hand which appeared to be a bladed weapon; Hussain said it was his phone. In relation to the attack, the deceased was brought to the ground with a series of blows.

Khan had been left with the deceased and was still <img src="image94.jpg" style="width:0.003334426946631671in;height:0.006667760279965004in;"/>assaulting him with a weapon covered by a blue plastic carrier bag. The deceased was trying to grab at the bag. Shiuly Begum and Mr Islam tried to restrain Khan but he made a further fifteen to twenty strikes at the deceased using both hands. Ms Begum and Fahim Khan then walked back down Costin Street. Members of the public gathered to assist the deceased.</p>

A mixed DNA profile found on a meat cleaver handle recovered from the scene (which had been used to attack Shajidur Rahman) was predominantly that of Fahim Khan, but the profile suggested at least three, possibly four, contributors of DNA one of whom could have been Javed Miah. This could have come from direct transfer through handling of the cleaver by him or by secondary transfer through the cleaver coming into contact with a surface which had Javed Miah's DNA on it.

He applied in April 2016 for an extension of time of eighteen months in which to apply for leave to appeal against conviction on the one ground that the judge misdirected the jury in relation to joint enterprise in the light of Jogee; in support of this grounds, he sought to rely on other criticisms of the summing up which are very similar to those made by Javed and Rubel Miah. He contended that the principals to the killing were the man in the white t-shirt and Hussain. There was no evidence of participation by him. He also seeks leave to appeal on the basis that the ground of appeal on manslaughter was incomplete and inadequate.</p>

At 01:46 on Sunday 28 January 2007 Craig Powell ordered a taxi to collect him and his girlfriend, Claire Francis, his brother Dean and Dean's girlfriend from the King's Head public house, Bradford. When the taxi arrived, probably about two minutes later in the car park, it waited for a few minutes. Michael Hall and his co-accused then came out and took the taxi. The taxi driver realised they were not his fare and asked them to leave. At the same time Craig Powell came out and he, too, asked them to get out. By that time, ail concerned had had drunk substantial quantities of alcohol.</p>

Others, including Holmes and Hall and a friend, Carl Wood, at first tried to calm her down. However, as Mitchell continued to be violent, Holmes, Hall and Wood also became violent, in particular towards Craig Powell. The violence involved the use of fists and feet to punch and kick. Laura Mitchell joined them. Claire Francis went to fetch Dean Powell from the public house. Craig Powell slipped but did not fall to the ground. He was repeatedly kicked and punched. Dean Powell and the deceased, Andrew Ayres, came out. Dean Powell pulled one of the attackers away, probably Hall, and Laura Mitchell jumped on Powell's back. He shrugged her off, but then was attacked with kicks and punches by her and her co-defendants. The evidence of John Walsh, an independent witness who had gone into the car park of the King's Head when the taxi arrived, was that Hall, Holmes and Mitchell were engaged in a determined attempt to get both Powell brothers to the ground and were kicking and punching them. It was the prosecution case that the only conceivable purpose was to kick them with shod feet whilst they were on the ground.</p>

He stepped back and Carl Holmes sprayed Dean Powell with gas: he had no prior knowledge anyone had a CS spray or any other weapon. Dean Powell ran off, chased by three or four others including Carl Holmes. He had been at the side of the King's Head all the time; he was not at the front of the pub where the deceased was killed. After being told that everyone had gone to Fawthrop's house, he went towards Buttershaw Lane where he saw Laura Mitchell and then onto Fawthrop's house.</p>

He then inflicted unlawful violence to Dean Powell with Ballantyne and Holmes in the second phase of the incident. He accepted he saw Holmes use a CS canister on the Powell brothers. It is the clear inference from the forensic evidence that the knuckleduster was used in that attack.
