	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On 26 February 1991 in the Cardiff Crown Court, the appellants were convicted of the murder of Karen Price. On the same date the trial judge, Rose J., (as he then was) sentenced Charlton to imprisonment for life with a minimum tariff of 15 years and ordered Ali to be detained at Her Majesty’s Pleasure. They both appealed. On 11 November 1994 this court dismissed Charlton’s appeal but allowed Ali’s appeal and quashed his conviction. A retrial was ordered. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On the 21 December 1994 Ali pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Karen Price. He was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment and having served the equivalent term was released. He did not attempt to appeal against his conviction. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In August 2009 Charlton made an application to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (“CCRC”). It decided to investigate and concluded there were grounds to refer his conviction to this court. They then invited and received an application from Ali. They concluded that exceptional circumstances existed justifying referral of his plea of guilty, despite the absence of any previous attempt by Ali to appeal his manslaughter conviction. Accordingly, both appeal again against conviction upon references by the CCRC under s.9 Criminal Appeal Act 1995 on the basis that there is a real possibility that the Court of Appeal will consider that the appellants’ convictions are unsafe.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On 7 December 1989, workmen digging in the back garden of 29 Fitzhamon Embankment, Cardiff, uncovered the skeleton of a young female, wrapped in carpet tied with electric flex. There was a plastic bag over her head and items of clothing remained. Her hands appeared to have been tied behind her back with flex.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Numbers 27 and 29 were in the middle of a row of terraced properties and subdivided into flats or bedsits.  An alleyway ran alongside the back gardens separated from the gardens by walls or fences. Access to the garden of number 29 was through the house or through a gate from the alleyway. Between June 1981 and February 1982 Charlton was the tenant of the basement flat with direct access to the garden. The body was found within feet of his back door. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The first task of the investigators was to identify the body. This proved difficult but a facial reconstruction artist produced an excellent likeness of Karen from her skull. This was published widely and members of the public contacted the police to identify the likeness as that of Karen Price (“KP”). Further examination confirmed KP’s identity to the satisfaction of the experts consulted and the police. Police officers set about discovering everything they could about her lifestyle, her friends and associates and her movements. They discovered the last time she was seen alive by anyone in authority was July 1981 when she had absconded from a local authority assessment centre (Maes-yr-Eglwys) in Pontypridd.  At that time she was nearly 16, Ali was 16 and Charlton 21 years of age.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Unsurprisingly the police investigation thereafter focussed on tracing those who might have known her at Maes-yr-Eglwys and those who had access to the garden at the relevant time, namely the occupants and past occupants of the flats or bedsits in numbers 27 and 29. Tracing the occupants of this multi occupancy building was not an easy task. A statement was taken from Alan Charlton in December because of his connection with the basement flat. Tracing the former residents of Maes-yr-Eglwys was not as difficult but produced little by way of leads, other than the possibility that KP may have absconded with others and resorted to selling sexual services to survive. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">During the evening of 15 February the BBC “Crimewatch” television programme included a piece on the KP murder investigation. Detective Chief Superintendent Williams appealed for further help from any members of the public who might have seen KP or associated with her. Footage was shown of an actress looking like and dressed as her in some of KP’s known haunts. The second appellant saw Crimewatch and contacted the police that night.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">D was 13 in 1981. She told the jury that she often ran away from the Maes-yr-Eglwys centre but never with KP. Her friends used to hang about outside Astey’s café in Cardiff and she met KP there on several occasions. They sniffed glue. When on the run (and as a vulnerable child) D provided sexual services for money and sometimes gave Ali half her proceeds. She knew Charlton as Alan: he was a doorman at the Xcel and she had seen him outside Astey’s. She had sex with him in the ground floor flat at 29 Fitzhamon Embankment and gave half the money he paid her to Ali. She met Charlton a week later outside Astey’s. They went back to the same room and when she refused to behave in the way he wished, he cut her leg with a pen-knife. Also, he wanted to replace Ali as her ‘pimp’.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A few days later she and KP went with Charlton and Ali to the same room at 29 Fitzhamon Embankment. There was more glue sniffing. Charlton asked her and KP to get on the bed naked to pose for photos. D refused and Charlton slapped her face. KP intervened; he turned on her and punched and slapped her till she fell. Ali tried to pull Charlton off but he kept on hitting KP. D was too scared to watch. When Charlton stopped there was blood from KP’s mouth and she did not respond. Charlton said she was dead. He put her on the bed, went out and returned with what looked like white curtain wire.  He turned KP over, tied her hands and put a carrier bag over her head. He removed her pants and had sex with her. He told Ali to do the same. Ali did but looked as if he wanted to be sick.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Charlton then brought in what looked like a rug.  Both Ali and Charlton lifted KP from the bed on to the rug and carried her outside.  D was in the corner crying when both men returned after about ten minutes with dirty hands. Charlton warned D to say nothing or she would die the same way. Ali advised her to say nothing and seemed as scared as she was. She did not tell anyone because she was afraid. She did not see either Charlton or Ali again.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">She was questioned at length at trial about what she told police in January and February 1990. She denied making up a story to accord with Ali’s version. The prosecution pointed to the fact there were a number of things he said with which she disagreed.  These included her assertions that: she did not attend a blue film party at 29 Fitzhamon Embankment, she did not tell Ali that KP was a prisoner, she did not help bury the body four days later and she had not seen Charlton strangle KP. After three days of robust questioning by counsel for the defence, she continued to insist that her third statement to police made on 23 February 1990 was a true account, save for the fact that she had failed to mention in it Charlton and Ali’s sexual activity with KP after she had been killed or assaulted. We consider later the detail of what she told the police and the circumstances in which her third statement was made.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">He was seen by police on 16 February 1990 and interviewed as a witness over five or six hours. Over the next seven days he gave various accounts. In a witness statement made overnight on 19/20 February he gave an account of glue-sniffing, drug-taking and casual sex during the summer of 1981. He mentioned D but not KP’s death. On the afternoon of 22 February he saw his brother then returned to the police station where he spent the night. His solicitor was with him during an evening session of questioning but the officers continued into the early hours after the solicitor had left. At 4.00 am on 23 February Ali made another statement. He described meeting KP and Charlton in a public house in the first week of July 1981. He went with 2 girls to a sex party in the basement flat at the invitation of Charlton. He did not describe KP’s death. The police told him that they knew his account to be untrue because they had a statement from D. Parts of her statement were read to him. When asked if he had taken part in KP’s death he admitted holding her hands while Charlton strangled her.</p>

In evidence he claimed that much of what he said was untrue. First, he stated that D told him KP was captive at Fitzhamon Embankment. He went to the flat and saw her on the bed. Charlton jumped on her and strangled her; Charlton punched Ali and made him hold her hands. They put the body in the cupboard and four days later Ali helped to bury her. On the next tape, he confirmed his earlier account and added that D had been with him when he saw KP tied to the bed but not when he and Charlton buried her.</p>

He spoke with the police; Detective Inspector Mouncher took notes. He claimed that he was now telling the whole truth. On the evening of 23 February he had a supervised visit with Rachel Angove (his wife by the time of the trial). She encouraged him to tell the truth. He repeated, in the presence of PC Mitchell, what he had previously said in front of Mouncher. He identified Charlton and stated that he was scared of him.</p>

He repeated that his association with KP included sex, glue-sniffing and prostitution. On Tape 7 Ali stated that on the day of her murder KP was on the bed and her legs were tied with bootlaces.

He stated that Charlton had invited him into the bedroom; that KP’s hands were tied and that he untied her hands. He spoke to his solicitor alone. On Tape 9, Ali said that he had been punched to the floor by Charlton and assaulted. He held KP’s hands above her head and Charlton strangled her to muffle her screams. She was killed because she was going to ‘grass’ on everyone. Charlton untied KP after he had killed her. He and Charlton had broken her bones when they took her from the cupboard. Again he was challenged. Ali stated he would tell the full story if he was granted immunity. He then stated that KP was ranting and raving about going to the police, Charlton then flipped and gripped her by the throat. D had held KP’s legs and been present at the burial.</p>

She was badly bruised. Charlton wanted to run the girls but KP asked to be let out. She blamed Ali for being kept there and threatened to go to the police. Charlton flew into a rage and punched and kicked her in the face. She was concussed and rolled up into a ball. Charlton dragged her by the hair and knocked Ali to the floor. Charlton started to strangle her; when Ali tried to intervene, Charlton back-handed him. Charlton made Ali hold her hands; and D her legs. This interview ended at 11.30pm. He was allowed a shower.</p>

In relation to the killing, Ali said that KP’s face was smashed up, that when he and D held her she was unconscious.

She threatened to go to the police and Charlton was punching her in order to stop her. When she was either dead or unconscious Charlton strangled her while Ali held her hands and D held her feet. No knife was used. Ali denied that stripping for photographs was the reason for the assault as alleged by D. He repeated that Charlton made him strangle and cut her.

He stated that Charlton tried to force him to have sex with her and got angry when he refused. Charlton had sex with her (while she was alive) and Charlton forced Ali to kill her. Ali put his hands around her throat and squeezed. Her hands were tied behind her back. Ali stated that he cut her cheek with a knife; that D cut her, both forced by Charlton. D was as involved in the death as he was. Charlton did not go out and get a carpet, and there was no curtain wire. The body was left in the cupboard for four days. All three of them buried her.</p>

Charlton was on the same landing as him in prison and he, Charlton, suggested alleging police pressure and to make out that KP died from drug abuse.

The court accepted that there was considerable material upon which to attack the admissibility of some of interviews. It was critical of the way the officers questioned Ali, a ‘voluntary witness’, after his solicitor had left and into the small hours. Further, they found breaches of the Code as to Ali’s treatment as a suspect, doubted the purpose of the Mumford visit to the cell and described 14 tapes as excessive and demanding of an explanation. Nevertheless, the court accepted the explanation of the decision by Mr Backhouse QC (who had represented Ali at his trial) not to challenge the interviews (a tactical decision which had been discussed with Ali) as reasonable. He explained that not all the confessions were necessarily inadmissible and the defence in the recent case of Miller (the Lynette White murder trial), in which he was also involved, failed to persuade the trial judge to exclude evidence despite allegations of graver police misconduct.  </p>

On a small number of occasions thereafter they gave him half of their modest earnings. D gave him £5.00 on two occasions. He did not lead either of them into prostitution.

Idris Ali, Charlton, Karen Price and D were at Charlton’s flat when Charlton asked Karen and D to get into bed together so that he could take photographs of them. When D refused he slapped her. Karen tried to help her whereupon Charlton struck her to the floor and proceeded to slap and punch her. Idris Ali caught hold of the back of Charlton and tried to pull him off of Karen. Charlton was too strong for him. He struck Idris Ali a number of times and then forced him, under the threat of violence, to hold Karen’s hands whilst he continued to slap and punch her. Idris Ali did so for a very short time. He did not intend to cause Karen serious harm nor did he intend that Charlton should cause her serious harm. He acted as he did out of fear of Charlton. Charlton attempted to force Idris Ali to have sexual intercourse with Karen Price when she was unconscious or possibly dead. In fact, Idris Ali simulated sexual intercourse with her. He did not want to do so and felt sickened by it. Charlton also forced Idris Ali to assist him in burying Karen Price in the garden of this home.</p>

He lived in fear of Charlton and was afraid that he had been implicated in her death. On the evening of the 15th February 1990 he viewed the Crimewatch programme. Shortly thereafter he contacted the Police and informed them that it was his belief that the remains of a girl that had been found buried near the back door of the basement flat at 29 Fitzhamon Embankment were those of Karen Price. If he had not done so her death might have remained a mystery.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Phillip Saunders was attacked and robbed at his home at Anstee Court, Cardiff on the night of 12 October 1987 at about 11.20pm. In June/July 1998 Darren Hall, Michael O'Brien and Ellis Sherwood were tried for robbery and murder. Hall pleaded guilty to robbery and offered to plead to manslaughter but this was not acceptable to the prosecution. The jury convicted O'Brien and Sherwood of the robbery and all three of murder by 10-2. In 1990 their renewed applications for permission to appeal against conviction were refused. The CCRC referred their cases to the Court of Appeal Criminal Division (“CACD”) and the appeals were decided in January 2000. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The prosecution case was that all three went to Mr Saunders's home, took part in the robbery and killed him with blows to the head. The case against Hall was based principally on his answers in police interviews and alleged admissions to a prison officer while on remand and in conversation with a man called Ricky Forde. Against Sherwood, the prosecution relied on alleged admissions to Christopher Chick and his partner Helen Morris, and others to Catriona Morgan, Robert Bradley and Ricky Shane Forde. Paul Lewis said he borrowed a jacket from Sherwood which had traces of blood on it. What the CACD described as 'the final and most powerful piece of evidence against Sherwood' was from DI Lewis (involved in the present case) of an overheard conversation between Sherwood and O'Brien. O'Brien allegedly said he could not hold out much longer and would have to tell the police the truth. He asked Sherwood why he did not tell the police what had happened and received the answer 'I can't, can I? If Hall hadn't opened his mouth we wouldn't be here.' Against O'Brien the prosecution relied on that and alleged admissions to Chick and Morris. </p>

In the case of the three appellants, there were clear breaches of PACE including unexplained entries in the custody records, unaccounted for periods in custody when O’Brien claimed he had been interviewed off the record, and the possible handcuffing of O’Brien and Hall to radiators. The court was particularly concerned that a number of important original documents had gone missing. It also considered allegations of misconduct made against police officers (including DI Lewis) at the trial of R v Griffiths in 1983, known as the Welsh Bomber’s trial. Mr Elias, who had been junior counsel for the Crown at the Griffiths trial, conceded that it was clear at the Griffiths trial “there had been some monkey business” in relation to typed copies of manuscript notes by someone, albeit not necessarily by members of the South Wales police. </p>

The evidence of Hall’s admissions to the police would only have been admissible if s.76 of PACE was satisfied. The conclusion of the CACD seems to have been that they were not satisfied it was. If the jury had heard the admissions and the new evidence, the court felt they would probably have taken a different view of the reliability of what Hall had said (both against his own interests and the interests of his co-accused).

	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ColorfulGrid-Accent11" style="margin-left:1.00in">“The vice of the practices followed at Canton Police Station at that time are that it becomes impossible for a court to be sure that admissions have been fairly and properly obtained, or, when the admissions are made by vulnerable persons, that the admissions represent the truth. In this case, it cannot be seen that in the substantial periods of time unaccounted for in the custody and interview records, the appellants were not being interviewed "off the record", as O'Brien claimed in his evidence to the jury happened to him, or that Hall was not having his "ego massaged" as was suggested by Mr Mumford when he gave evidence. Nor can this court be sure that admissions were not made by Hall because of the pressure of being interviewed several times whilst being held "incommunicado", and because he believed that the admissions he was making represented the playing by him of a minor role in the robbery and murder of Mr Saunders which would lead to a short prison sentence. It is not the fact that the codes were breached that is important; it is the reality of what occurred or may have occurred. It is for the respondents to satisfy us so that we are sure that the confessions by Hall and the admissions by O'Brien of having been to Anstee Court were not obtained in consequence of anything said or done which was likely in the circumstances existing at the time to render unreliable that confession, see s. 76(2) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, 1984. The appellants were interviewed without their solicitors being present. The exact whereabouts of the appellants prior to several of the important interviews are unknown because those whereabouts were not recorded. Implementation of the codes not only protects detainees it also assists the police in that where admissions are made, it becomes highly unlikely that those admissions will not be given in evidence and accepted by the jury and the court or that such admissions could be undermined on appeal.”</p>

He said that both cases also showed misbehaviour by police officers including DI Lewis. At a case management conference HHJ Graham Jones (sitting as a DHCJ) allowed O’Brien to rely on this evidence.

The CACD say they were “horrified” at the way in which Miller was bullied and hectored by DC Greenwood during that interview, including shouting at him what the police wanted him to say. The court observed: “Short of physical violence, it is hard to conceive of a more hostile and intimidating approach by officers to a suspect.”  The CACD concluded that it was significant that in the very next interview (tape 8) Miller was persuaded to concede that under the effects of drugs, it was possible he was there and did not remember it clearly.  The CACD concluded that, having considered “the tenor and length of the interviews taken as a whole”, they would have been oppressive, and confessions obtained in consequence of them, would have been unreliable, even with a suspect of normal mental capacity.  On that point, the evidence on the voire dire from Dr Gudjonsson was that he was on the borderline of mental handicap with an IQ of 75.  The CACD also noted that, although tape 7 was played to the judge, it was only played up to page 17 of the transcript and the bullying and shouting was from page 20 onwards.  There was no explanation for that and the CACD said that, if the judge had heard the rest of the tape, he would not have admitted the contents.</p>

More widely, the CACD note that Miller was crying and sobbing but was given no respite.  Although he said he was happy to continue, it appeared clear that that was because he wanted to get to the end of the questioning.  His solicitor was criticised for failing to intervene.  </p>

Those interviews were wrongly admitted. The CACD concluded that what remained, even taking account of the evidence of the two women who visited him subsequently, could not safely support a conviction.   </p>

There was material to suggest that, although the judge directed the jury not to have regard to Miller’s interviews when considering the case against Paris and Abdullahi, they did just that. In addition, the evidence against Paris and Abdullahi, leaving aside the interviews, was “by no means compelling”.</p>

In particular, the CCRC describe DI Lewis as the officer in the case in both the Karen Price and Phillip Saunders investigations and subject to criticism by this court in the O’Brien appeals. DI Mouncher was the senior officer allegedly behind the “fictitious Lynette White murder scenario” and was also “centrally involved” in the KP murder inquiry at the crucial time. Essentially, it is said he spoke to potential witnesses “off the record”, was behind the case theory that Charlton was guilty, conducted research into D’s background and according to his desk diary spoke to her “off the record” for fifteen minutes at 15.30 on 23 February 1990 before her arrest. DS Rogers was centrally involved in the Saunders inquiry. He was accused of taking false evidence from witnesses, interviewing a witness “off the record” immediately before he provided an incriminating statement and, with DI Lewis, pressurising a witness to change her evidence. </p>

In a statement taken the next day, dated 9 February 1990, she stated that she, Williams, had run away from Maes-yr-Ewglys on 29 July 1981 with D, that D was the leader and KP the follower, that D and KP had sniffed glue together and that D had taken KP to a flat in Riverside but that KP had “played up”. Further she claimed that D had shown her the house on Fitzhamon Embankment where Alan lived, that D had said that they could stay at the premises in either Alan’s flat or another flat there and that she had seen D talking to Alan on the door at the Excel Club when they had run away in July 1981. She described Alan consistent with the Appellant’s general appearance. The changes between these two statements included:  knowledge of “Alan’s” address and place of work and having met him personally. During this statement taking process it is apparent that Williams had extensive contact with the police over three consecutive days, during which time her evidence changed.

On 7 March 1990 Jane R gave her fourth statement. This statement states that she has been talking with DC Griffiths (criticised in the other murder enquiries) and for the first time she gives details of the Appellants being her ‘pimps’; claims that she was infatuated with the first Appellant; that she was raped by the Appellants and a third man, and at the conclusion of the rape Ali had threatened that she would be killed if she told anybody what had happened. This part of her account was not given before the jury. The significance of it is said to be that it shows a similar pattern of statement-taking which mirrors that with respect to D and other witnesses in all three murder enquiries. Her contact with the police produced a stream of changing evidence which helped the police theory as to the murder of KP. </p>

Debbie Myles made her first statement on 27 January 1990 to DC Tooby (involved in the investigation of the murder of Lynette White).  She was a resident at Maes-yr-Ewglys and may have come across KP there. She ran away with another girl, (whom the police believed was KP). When she and the other girl ran away, they met a boy called Adrian, who was white, slim with brushed back blonde hair. DC Tooby and DC Haines (also involved in the investigation of the murder of Lynette White) drove this witness around Cardiff in an attempt to identify important places with regards to “Adrian”. Ms Blackwell argued that, two weeks or so later, the second Appellant in his first statement of 19th February 1990 effectively placed himself as “Adrian”, albeit he is not white. </p>

She was taken to a location (Moira Park, Cardiff) by DCs Tooby and Haines which she claimed to recognize as the place to which she went with “Adrian” to see his mother. Ali’s mother did not live in this area. On 6 February 1990 she made a third statement dealing with the other girl being KP and on 15 February 1990 she made a fourth and final statement. It seems likely that this statement was made earlier in the day on which Idris Ali phoned the police after the Crimewatch programme. The content was more general and in it she stated that she did not know D or Jane R, nor could she add to the details of “Adrian” which she had already given. </p>

She repeated that “Adrian” was white and the name Idris Ali was unknown to her.  Police officers arranged a meeting between her, Debbie Myles, and Idris Ali at the police station. The confrontation took place on either 16 or 19 February 1990. In the event, Debbie Myles did not recognize Idris Ali, however Idris Ali had said “I know you Debbie”. </p>

The suggestion is that the police then used Ali’s identification of D against her, even though, by the time that confrontation took place, they knew that he had claimed to know another witness Myles who denied knowing him.</p>

The importance of this evidence, given that it was not heard by the jury, is said to lie in the manner in which such evidence came to light and was developed by contact with similar police officers.

Having made an ‘innocuous’ statement, she claims she was visited by officers and questioned when tired from working nights as a nurse. There are doubts about the reliability of some of the details she has provided in the new statement but the important point we have been invited to consider is that she describes how one of the officers (possibly DI Mouncher) tried to bully her into changing her account to suggest she went out with Charlton and he “roughed her up”.

On any view D had suffered an appalling childhood of abuse. Although twenty one and a married woman at the time she was questioned, she was being asked to re-live extremely traumatic events. She may also have been concerned about her husband discovering the true extent of her past. On that basis, Ms Blackwell categorised her as a vulnerable witness and referred us to the steps that would be taken today to protect her. Back in 1990 she was put under, what Ms Blackwell insists, was intolerable pressure by police officers who were bent on getting incriminating evidence from her against the appellants. She took us through the history of how D was treated and the information used to put pressure on her. </p>

On 5 February 1990 DCs Cullen and Taylor submitted a report which had D at its heart. The report suggested interviewing a Teresa S in order to gain information about D. That day Teresa S made her statement. The next day DC Cullen reported to her Detective Superintendent on the Social Services Records of D. DS Fenton also reported to the Superintendent. As a result of these reports and the conferences which followed them, more enquiries were put in hand re D. On 19 February 1990 DI Mouncher submitted a thirty seven page report showing an extensive knowledge of D and her lifestyle. The report postulates that KP and D ran away together, worked as prostitutes out from the Excel Restaurant, and knew the first appellant. </p>

She criticises the officers for using the material to persuade her, an already vulnerable witness, to give statements which would assist the police. Throughout large parts of her time at the police station, D knew that the police had access to her husband. During her interviews, she was encouraged to have contact with her husband, thereby (so it is said) ‘increasing pressure’ on her.

From the contents of later interviews, it seems that by midnight she had admitted being a witness to the murder of KP. It then took several hours to complete her written statement. This was finished by about 5.00-5.30am. By then she had been at the police station and in the company of DCs Cullen and Taylor for nearly 12 hours, through the night, without sleep.

She contends that the jury would have been affected in their deliberations (and so should the court) by the knowledge that many officers who were instrumental in obtaining the account of D were likely to have acted in a similar and unlawful way in other murder enquiries. What the jury did not know was that a number of these officers, and most significantly DI Mouncher, had investigated a case where at least three witnesses were prevailed upon, by the police, to give statements and ultimately evidence of an eye witness account, which subsequently was proven to be a tissue of lies. </p>

His conviction was quashed. Both he and his lawyers knew that there was a reasonable prospect of obtaining a ruling that at least some of his confessions were inadmissible at his re-trial. Furthermore, the material as to Ali’s mental capacity was in the hands of those lawyers at the time he pleaded guilty. We pressed Mr Hughes, therefore, to identify the true basis of Ali’s appeal in the light of his unequivocal basis of plea. He fell back upon the CCRC’s suggestion that, if we allowed Charlton’s appeal, it would be unfair and unconscionable for Ali to be bound by his plea of guilty to manslaughter, in the context of the police investigation which led to that plea. He contends that police misconduct in this investigation, even where directed at one particular appellant, undermines the integrity of the entire investigation. </p>

The responsibility for deciding whether fresh material renders a conviction unsafe is laid inescapably on this Court, which must make up its own mind. Of course it must consider the nature of the issue before the jury and such information as it can gather as to the reasoning process through which the jury will have been passing. It is likely to ask itself by way of check what impact the fresh material might have had on the jury. But in most cases of arguably fresh evidence it will be impossible to be 100% sure that it might not possibly have had some impact on the jury’s deliberations, since ex hypoethesi the jury has not seen the fresh material. The question which matters is whether the fresh material causes this court to doubt the safety of the verdict of guilty. We have had the advantage of seeing the analysis of <span style="font-style:italic">Pendleton</span> [2001] UKHL 66; [2002] 1 Cr. App. R. 34 and <span style="font-style:italic">Dial</span> [2005] UKPC 4; [2005] 1 WLR 1660 made recently by this court in <span style="font-style:italic">Burridge</span> [2010] EWCA Crim 2847 (see paragraphs 99 – 101) and we entirely agree with it. Where fresh evidence is under consideration the primary question “is for the court itself and is not what effect the fresh evidence would have had on the mind of the jury.” (<span style="font-style:italic">Dial</span>). Both in Stafford v DPP [1974] AC 878 at 906 and in Pendleton the House of Lords rejected the proposition that the jury impact test was determinative, explaining that it was only a mechanism in a difficult case for the Court of Appeal to “test its view” as to the safety of a conviction.

There was revealed a catalogue of malpractice which included physical abuse, the generation of false confessions, the planting of evidence and the mishandling of informants. At least 33 convictions resulting from tainted evidence given by members of the squad have been quashed by this court including some convictions emanating from the work of officers who were or became members of the Serious Crime Squad as early as the mid-1970s, the most notorious of which were the convictions of the Birmingham Six (see <span style="font-style:italic">McIlkenny and Others [1991] 93 Cr App R 287</span>; see also <span style="font-style:italic">O'Toole and Murphy [2006] EWCA Crim 951 ; Wilcox [2010] EWCA Crim 1732</span> ; and <span style="font-style:italic">Dunne and Others [2001] EWCA Crim 169 </span>).</p>

Two distinct forms of abuse of process were identified. The first is where the accused cannot have a fair trial, in which case there is no question of any balancing exercise. The second is where “the court's sense of justice and propriety is offended if it is asked to try the accused in the particular circumstances of the case”. An application under the second form requires the judge to perform a balancing exercise. In so doing, the Board stressed that it is necessary to keep in mind that an infinite variety of cases can arise and how the discretion should be exercised will depend on the particular circumstances of the case. It confirmed that it is “not in general the function of criminal courts to discipline the police”. Despite the fact that the police were guilty of “grave prosecutorial misconduct” and the most reprehensible behaviour in bringing Warren before the court, the Board upheld a refusal of the trial judge to stay the proceedings. </p>

There are exceptions and they have been enlarged since the trial of these two appellants, notably by the Criminal Justice Act 2003, but the basic position remains. If the witness’s statement is challenged, it is not admissible unless and until the witness gives evidence orally in court. Statements made by a defendant (at least if adverse to his or her interests) are different. They are admissible, subject to s.76 of Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.</p>

There were two robbers, a man and a woman. The robbery was captured on CCTV. A police officer who viewed the footage identified the appellant as the female robber. She was arrested, shown the footage, agreed that she was the woman and agreed that she had committed this and a number of other robberies.  She pleaded guilty. There were two women customers in the shop at the time. They were not asked to attend any kind of identification procedure. However, after the appellant was sentenced, both wrote to say that they knew the appellant and she was not the robber. On further investigation, there was some uncertainty as to whether the police officer who had identified the appellant had been looking at stills from the robbery or some other part of the day. When the appellant was re-interviewed, she said she could not remember whether she had committed this offence or not. On appeal, the prosecution accepted that the two customers’ statements should be admitted and were capable of belief.

Given the overlap between officers in those cases and officers involved in the Karen Price murder investigation, we agree with the CCRC that the circumstances of Charlton’s conviction merited full and careful consideration and we are grateful to them for the extraordinarily thorough analysis they have put before the court. They have left no available stone of the investigation unturned. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, our task is different. We must assess the impact of what they have discovered upon the safety of the convictions. The mere fact that inquiries made in the Karen Price investigation were carried out by officers who were also involved in the Lynette White and Phillip Saunders investigations and that criticisms can be made of the investigation in all three cases does not automatically undermine the safety of the Appellant’s conviction and/or suggest that the case would be stayed as an abuse of process. What was described as the ‘lamentable’ history of the operations of the South Wales Police during this period does not mean that in every case in which a member of the South Wales Police has given evidence or been involved in an investigation, the conviction should be deemed to be unsafe. Each case has to be considered on its merits. On the facts here, we must analyse what is new and how it could have been deployed, if at all, by defence counsel at trial and therefore how, if at all, it impacts upon the safety of the conviction. No approaches have been made to either counsel who appeared for the Appellants at trial as to what they did know (they both appeared in one of more of the other cases) and or what they would have done differently if they had been in full possession of the facts. That is unfortunate, and we are obliged to proceed therefore without their assistance. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We begin with a few general comments. First, as Mr Whittam QC for the Crown observed, there are highly significant differences between this case and the other two cases. Those differences have been wrongly dismissed as irrelevant by Ms Blackwell.  None of the prosecution witnesses in this case has retracted their evidence, in contrast to the cases of O’Brien, Hall and Sherwood and Paris, Abdullahi and Miller. In particular, the main prosecution witness who was present at the time KP was killed (D) has not retracted her evidence. The CCRC, who did not apparently seek D’s comments, speculate that she would not now retract her evidence for fear of the consequences. With respect, that is a leap in the dark and one for which we can find no justification. There is absolutely no reason to suppose that D, many years on, would not admit, had it been true, that her evidence to the jury was false and extracted from her under intolerable pressure.  Furthermore, we have no clear breaches of PACE and its Code in the treatment of the Appellants of the kind that troubled the courts in <span style="font-style:italic">O’Brien and others</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Paris and others.</span> There are no failures of disclosure and nothing to suggest documents may have been altered or deliberately mislaid. If the handwritten version of a statement of a witness (D’s third statement) is missing and other records are no longer available there appears to be a perfectly legitimate explanation for that fact: the passage of time.  It does not raise the suspicions suggested in the CCRC report or by Ms Blackwell. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, however closed the minds of officers in the Saunders and White investigations, we consider that the investigation into KP’s death was extraordinarily thorough. Approximately 80 officers were seconded to the inquiry and every relevant expert consulted. The HOLMES database revealed many hundreds of potential witnesses spoken to, 733 statements taken, 252 reports made, 644 other documents produced, 495 messages logged and 3550 actions listed. The senior officer in overall charge of the case (who is not the subject of any criticism) participated in a Crimewatch programme in February 1990 featuring a reconstruction of KP’s usual movements. The appeal was for any information that might assist. This does not suggest a close minded investigation. We further note that the very thorough inquiry has been examined in depth by the CCRC and by counsel for the appellants; they have not identified a single significant lead that was not pursued. The fact that officers continued to gather more evidence after Charlton had been identified by D is in no way deserving of criticism. We would be surprised if that was not the case. Gaps in the evidence are often filled in this way. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, the fact that Charlton featured prominently in the investigation is hardly surprising given the location of the grave. The officers would have been failing in their duty if they had not considered him of significant interest given his occupancy of flat, and closeness to where the body was found. Nevertheless, they investigated as best they could the identity and whereabouts of all occupants of the house, eventually tracing all rent paying occupants. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Fourthly, we are also not surprised that the police formed the view D was central to their investigation. There appeared to be an interesting link between her and KP, their absconding from the home and their lifestyles. A further and possibly significant link then became apparent between Charlton and D. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Fifthly, a number of Ms Blackwell’s submissions were based on pure speculation, no doubt because she was relying on the CCRC’s findings and they frequently used the expression “it is possible to speculate” to justify those findings in their report. Speculation is no basis for an appeal. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Sixthly, Ms Blackwell (and the CCRC) invited us to draw the inference from the fact of police misconduct in other investigations that there must have been police misconduct in the KP investigation so that all the evidence against Charlton is tainted.

Arguably, it would be anomalous to take a different view of D’s treatment that night, merely on the basis of any legal distinction between the treatment of a defendant and the position of a witness.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is not anomalous to treat witnesses and suspects differently for the reasons we have endeavoured to explain under the heading ‘Legal Framework’. So, for example, officers may speak to potential witnesses “off the record” in a way they would not be able to do with suspects. As a general rule they do not need to provide a witness with legal representation or keep records of their time at a police station in the same way they keep custody records. They should, of course, treat all those they interview with respect and dignity and ensure vulnerable witnesses in particular receive appropriate consideration. However, their duties towards witnesses and suspects are different. With respect, both Ms Blackwell and the CCRC repeatedly failed to acknowledge sufficiently this clear distinction in law and practice. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The nature of questioning that elicited an account from either a witness or a defendant may, of course, be relevant. It may go to the admissibility of the evidence. It may go to its reliability. But, because of the different regimes as to admissibility discussed above, the only way in which the evidence of D could have been kept from the jury would have been by making an application under section 78. Mr Elias did not make such an application; for good reason in our view. There was not sufficient material to justify excluding her evidence but there was considerable material with which to attack her credibility and reliability. Mr Elias knew at the time of trial the extent of D’s vulnerability, the pressure she was under, the fact that she had been inconsistent and that, in her retraction period, she had accused the officers of heavy handed tactics. He deployed this to good effect in robust cross-examination of her over three days. As Rose J. noted in his summing up ‘[D], says Mr Elias, has much to hide about her role, and this, coupled with her suggestibility in the hands of the police totally destroys her credibility’. </p>

It would necessarily involve a voir dire on which D would be cross examined. If the application was unsuccessful and D gave evidence before the jury, she would be cross examined for a second time and be fore-warned as to at least some of the lines of attack. Given D’s attitude at trial and her ability to withstand days of questioning, there is nothing before us to suggest she would have admitted lying in the third statement. On the contrary, we infer from her manner in the witness box on the last occasion she would have held her ground.

He could question DC Cullen as to whether her conduct generally was influenced by the allegedly prevalent culture and about the fact she had been accused of pressurising a witness to make a statement in another case. He could ask DC Taylor whether he had been influenced by the allegedly prevalent culture. He could explore with them both the details of the time D was at the station. He could ask the officer in charge about the possibility of a close minded investigation, but he would have been in grave difficulties in putting to the officers, in the absence of material to justify it, that they had treated D improperly before she made her third statement and that they had fed her all the details of the murder. </p>

She also claimed the interviewing officers told her something of what Ali had said. They denied this but, even if they had revealed parts of Ali’s then account, we note that she never suggested the officers provided her with the full graphic detail of the murder.

We accept that, with hindsight, it was unfortunate that she remained in the station overnight for the written statement to be taken, but it was understandable that the officers wished to record in writing what she had witnessed. As for the claim made by Ms Blackwell that she was effectively being detained against her will (and should have been accorded the rights of a suspect), we have nothing from D today to suggest this was the case. </p>

She was still a witness not, at that stage, a suspect and so nothing was recorded. We have noted that DI Mouncher made an unexplained visit to her in the afternoon shortly before her arrest but it is not clear to us how that advances the appeal. He was not on duty the night before when D made her third statement. Even crediting him with the most dishonourable of motives, when he came on duty on the morning of the 24 February, as we have been invited to do, whatever he said to her that afternoon did not cause her to return to her third statement.

We very much doubt that any officer would believe it right to treat a witness or suspect in that fashion today especially one with such a troubled past. Had D been charged with any offence, anything she said under caution may well have been the subject of an application to exclude. It is a moot point whether it would have succeeded. D held her own, whatever the pressure, for many hours. We have listened to some sample tapes. In our view the officers were insistent and unfortunately allowed their frustration to surface from time to time, but we were not ‘horrified’ in the way the court was in <span style="font-style:italic">Miller</span>. By the time she did revert to her third statement she had been allowed to rest (whether or not she was able to sleep) had been offered food and drinks, the opportunity to smoke and speak to her husband.

The weaknesses of her testimony were considered by this court at the first appeal. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ali was interviewed in a way the court undoubtedly found troubling. They considered it possible that some of his interviews might be excluded under section 76 of PACE. However, they did not conclude that all his admissions would be excluded and they did not (could not) suggest the trial judge could have prevented Ali giving evidence in his own defence whether via s.78 (since that only applies where it is the prosecution which proposes to adduce the evidence in question) or otherwise. Thus, Ali’s account, undoubtedly prejudicial to Charlton, would have been before the jury in any event. The judge gave the jury an express and full warning about how to treat Ali’s various accounts in so far as they impacted upon Charlton. Rose J. properly cautioned the jury to accept Ali’s evidence only if they found it to be corroborated elsewhere.  Even accepting, therefore, that the appellants’ could establish a culture of police misconduct in two other investigations, unknown to the defence at the time of trial, the new material adds nothing significant in this respect.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There was no dispute as to the location.  KP’s grave was some 20 inches below the surface, very close to the back door of Charlton’s flat and overlooked by his kitchen window. In the first appeal, it was suggested that this was not something which was capable of corroborating D’s evidence.  This court rejected that argument.  The CCRC acknowledge that this was capable of amounting to corroborative evidence and was “untainted” by any of the other points raised in their report. We have seen photographs of the back garden. It was agreed that it was insecure, in that access to the garden could have been effected by anyone from the rear lane, given that there were broken walls and insecure gates along both sides.  The trial judge dealt with this at page 8 of the second day of his summing up (Tuesday 26 February 1991) in these terms:  </p>

Whether that risk extended to an unnoticed stranger digging a grave which must have been 3 feet or so deep, close to the rear door of the basement flat and within the view of anyone in that flat who happened to look out through the half-glass door, is another matter and you must consider it.”</p>

If a non-resident was burying a body in the garden of No. 27 or No. 29, it is highly improbable that they would choose to bury the body, not away from the house, but in that part of the garden closest to the rear of the house and just a few feet from the half-glazed back door.  </p>

Witnesses stated that the carpet around the body was the same pattern as the carpet which had been laid in the basement flat in September 1980 and which remained in place until removed during the 1989 building works. An off cut had been stored in the house, possibly in the cupboard of the basement flat. Mrs Ball who had chosen the carpet remembered seeing off-cuts. Mr Pethers recalled a roll of carpet underneath the stairs tied with string but the judge warned the jury that he was hopelessly confused about dates. Mr Pitcock, the carpet fitter, relying on measurements provided to him, was of the view that there would have been a large piece left over of about the same size as the carpet around the body. Further, the body and the carpet bundle were tied with two different kinds of electric cable. Mr Robst shared the basement for a short time in 1981. He kept his tools in the cupboard and noticed two kinds of black cable one of which was similar to the cable round the body.  </p>

There were three witnesses who gave evidence that supported D’s account and which was, on any view, unhelpful to Charlton.  Mr Wells noted that in July 1981, the area of the grave had been cleaned up: all the weeds had been taken up and it was generally dug around. Charlton had told him that he intended to clean the garden up and put plants in.  Mr Pethers gave detailed evidence about the work in that part of the garden and in particular the conversation that he had had with Charlton, as they looked at the garden in which Charlton had said that he had planted vegetables. Mr Pethers also gave evidence about a rake with a new handle that he had seen in Charlton’s flat.  Ms Pesticcio noticed that the garden had been recently dug in that area in the autumn of 1981.  She had mentioned this to Charlton and he said that anybody could dig in the communal garden and that he had a garden spade. These witnesses were all challenged in cross-examination.  The trial judge’s summary makes plain that, if the evidence was accepted, there was a clear connection between Charlton and the cultivation of the garden at the relevant time.  Furthermore, the judge noted that, although the evidence of Mr Pethers was challenged extensively, Charlton did admit that he may well have bought a new handle for his rake at about that time. </p>

In relation to Ms Pesticcio, as with Mr Wells, there is some criticism in the report about her evidence relating to the connection between Charlton and KP, and we deal with that below.  But again, no criticism is made in the CCRC report of her evidence about Charlton’s connection to the garden. We note that her evidence about this, which was in her first statement, was taken by an officer who had no involvement in the Lynette White or Philip Saunders enquiries.  It is fair to add that the trial judge said in his summing-up that the jury might not find Ms Pesticcio’s evidence about Charlton and the garden ‘particularly helpful.’</p>

That officer was neither a Category A nor Category B officer and the report does not suggest that there was any misconduct in the taking of that statement.  Accordingly, beyond the points as to the reliability of Mr Pethers’ evidence generally, which were all fairly summed up by the judge, we are confident that there is nothing new relating to the reliability, or otherwise, of Mr Pethers’ evidence.  </p>

She was cross-examined, although, critically, as the judge pointed out in his summing up at page 32, “it was not suggested that she did not know Charlton”.  In addition, she said that she had known Idris Ali for years “and that was not challenged”.

Although it is difficult to discern what precisely the criticisms are (if any) of his statements, we have considered the circumstances in which they were taken. His first statement, dated 26 February 1990, was taken by DC Thomas Mitchell who is a Category A officer. This was the first link provided between Idris Ali and Charlton and it may be the CCRC considered this suspicious.  His second statement, which confirmed his positive identification of Charlton at an identification parade held on 5 March 1990, is not itself the subject of express criticism but we note that he was taken to the parade by two officers, one of whom is DC Toobey (Category B).  However, there were in fact two officers called DC Toobey in the Lynette White investigation and the CCRC is not able always to distinguish between the two.  </p>

We have already set out our view that it is not enough simply to say that a statement was taken from an officer who had an involvement in one of the other tainted investigations.  There was no evidence to suggest that DC Mitchell put improper pressure on Mottram when taking his statement; nor is this a case in which Mottram could be said to have changed his account when identifying the connection between Charlton and Ali, given that the statement of 26 February 1990 was his first.

Again, although she was dealt with by a number of Category A or Category B officers, there is no specific evidence of oppression or improper conduct.  The highest that it is put by the CCRC is at paragraph 360 of their report when they say that:</p>

The criticism appears to be that, although in his second statement, he said, by reference to the photograph of KP wearing the trilby hat, she was “not unlike” the girl that he had seen talking to Charlton, and gave a description of that girl, he made a third statement some two months later in which he gave more detailed evidence about the incident. He expressly mentioned for the first time that the girl on the wall was wearing a trilby hat, because he had jokingly said to her that he would buy the hat from her because it went with his suit.  </p>

There would only be some additional point about Mr Wells’ third statement if there was a suggestion of oppression or coaching in the making of that statement; but there is not. His statement was given to PC Ashby, who was neither a Category A nor Category B officer.

As the judge said in his summing up, the crucial question for the jury was whether they could rely on Harries’ identification of Karen Price, bearing in mind the comparatively short period of time that she would have been clearly visible to him, the many years which had elapsed, and the fact that he had no recollection of her when first seen by the police.  </p>

It is difficult to see where either of these criticisms go.  Mr Harries gave three statements, dated 29 December, 31 January and 13 July.  There was other contact with the police, such as on 8 and 9 February, but no statement was taken then, presumably because of Mr Harries’ drunkenness.

The judge warned the jury that they had to be very wary of relying on his identification of KP “because in cross-examination he told you that he had first identified her to the police from two photographs of her which were shown by the police to him.  That was a wholly unsatisfactory way for the police to proceed, because the danger is that the witness’s memory will be tarnished and contaminated by being shown only one photograph rather than having a choice from several, and if recollection is tarnished and contaminated in that way, his evidence may be wholly unreliable.”  </p>

She was cross-examined about her stormy relationship with Charlton and it was suggested that she was lying about seeing a photograph of KP in Charlton’s wallet out of bitterness, a suggestion which she rejected.

Her second statement, dated 8 March 1990, explained that she did not recognise the actress playing KP on the Crimewatch broadcast in February, but when she saw the photograph of KP in the South Wales Echo, she recognised her as the girl in the photograph in Charlton’s wallet.

There was no suggestion of any improper conduct in their dealings with Ashong (unlike the evidence that emerged in connection with the other investigations into the murders of Lynette White and Phillip Saunders).  Thereafter, although there were further dealings between the police and Ashong, nothing untoward is said to arise from those dealings.

It cannot have put undue pressure on D that other people were talking about her lifestyle in 1981 when those elements of that lifestyle were accurately recorded.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The statements of Debbie Myles contained similar accounts to the statements of Rees and Williams.  The same points that we have already made apply again. However, Debbie also gave evidence of then man she called Adrian. In our view the submission that, in some way, Idris Ali’s later adoption of himself in the role of Adrian was a consequence of the inappropriate police investigation fails at every level.  First, no criticism can be made of Debbie Myles’ statements, or the truthfulness of her account.  Indeed, on that point, we note that, at the appeal in 1994, Charlton called evidence from Debbie Myles in support of his appeal and the court accepted that evidence, but regarded it as completely irrelevant to the issues in the case.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, we do not think that it is fair to say that Idris Ali cast himself in the role of Adrian.  There were some similarities, but some differences between Ali’s description of what had happened, compared to that of Debbie Myles.  Thirdly, to the extent that Ali did adopt the role of Adrian, then that may result from his intellectual impairment and personality traits but that is precisely why this court quashed his conviction for murder in 1994.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ms Blackwell also suggested that the evidence of Debbie Myles was important because it fed into the report of DI Mouncher of 19 February 1990, which focused on the possibility that KP and D were together at the relevant time, working as prostitutes, while frequenting the Excel Bar.  In that regard, they had the opportunity to meet Charlton.  She said that this report indicated the close-minded nature of the investigation.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We disagree.  By the time he wrote his report on 19 February 1990, DI Mouncher had a good deal of evidence to show that KP and D could well have been together in Cardiff at the relevant time.  There was also plenty of evidence to show that both girls worked as prostitutes and frequented the Xcel Bar where Charlton worked.  This was therefore an important element of the investigation.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">What her submissions ignore is the fact that the report indicates other suspects who also represented leads.  The fact that D was a central witness, being the first person who might have a direct link to KP one way, and Alan Charlton the other, was simply as a result of the statements taken thus far.  Whatever else might be said about DI Mouncher, it cannot be said that his report of 19 February 1990 represented a close-minded investigation.  We wish to emphasise we have not set out all the matters the CCRC suggested are indicative of a closed mind but we have considered them all with care. As it seems to us they indicate an attempt to pursue all proper lines of inquiry. We do not consider that any of the other points have any bearing whatsoever on the safety of Alan Charlton’s conviction.  We therefore decline to address them further in this judgment.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It follows that we see no substance in the other two remaining grounds. Ground x (that Ali’s evidence should have been excluded from the trial) was abandoned in the course of oral submissions. We are surprised it ever made its way into the grounds of appeal, even if advanced by the CCRC. It was totally misconceived. As Ms Blackwell for Charlton properly conceded, there is absolutely no basis in law for arguing that the judge had the power to prevent Ali from giving evidence in his own defence because it was prejudicial to his co-accused. It is a common feature of “cut throat” trials that evidence of one accused may be detrimental to another. There is no basis for ordering separate trials or using section 78 of PACE in the way suggested by the CCRC. The trial process is well equipped to deal with such situations fairly to both, as it did here. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ground xi (the proceedings should have been stayed as an abuse of process) was pursued with little enthusiasm, probably because in our view this too was misconceived. Both Ms Blackwell and Mr Hughes recognised that a court will only stay proceedings on the grounds of abuse of process in exceptional circumstances. They both struggled to establish that the misconduct alleged in the KP investigation (even if established to our satisfaction) amounted to the kind of exceptional conduct that justified a stay. Again the trial process is well equipped to deal with a situation such as this. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We turn to Ali’s appeal. Had we decided that the reliability of D’s evidence has been significantly undermined by the new material so that Charlton’s conviction is unsafe, there would have remained two additional hurdles for Ali. D’s evidence far from being central to the case against Ali was helpful to him and did not require undermining as far as he was concerned and, most importantly, he pleaded guilty. The CCRC Statement of Reasons and Mr Hughes’ submissions somewhat gloss over these facts. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is true that a plea of guilty does not deprive us of jurisdiction to examine the safety of Ali’s conviction of manslaughter. As with any other appeal against conviction, our task is to decide whether the conviction is safe. Undoubtedly, there are cases where this Court has quashed a conviction as unsafe notwithstanding an unequivocal plea of guilty and we have considered the examples cited to us. However, there are significant distinctions to be drawn on the facts of this case. There is here no evidence someone else committed the crime and nothing of any substance to suggest the second appellant’s confession was untrue. We agree with Mr Whittam that ‘the authorities relied on are a far cry from the circumstances of this case.’ </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Furthermore, the facts that the appellant was fit to plead and pleaded guilty unequivocally are highly relevant to the Court’s task: see <span style="font-style:italic">R v Lee (1984) 79 Cr. App.R. 108 CA</span>. It has not been suggested that Ali was unfit to plead and Mr Hughes on Ali’s behalf expressly disavowed any argument that his plea had been equivocal. This is not a case where the Appellant pleaded guilty after an adverse ruling on a point of law by the trial judge; nor is it a case where the Appellant claims to have been misled as to an available defence by his trial counsel. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ali’s claim to the CCRC is simply that he was bullied into admitting something he had not done and pleaded guilty to gain immediate release from custody. Since he has not waived privilege, we cannot know how much of what he has said to them, if anything, was in his original proof or any other proof before Mr John Charles Rees. There seems to have been no challenge to the admissibility of his confessions to the police under s.76 of PACE at trial, which would be surprising if he had told his trial counsel of his mistreatment in the cells. The account he gave in evidence of his dealings with KP and the last time he saw her, would also seem to be quite different from what he told the Commission. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We have done what we can to assess what he now says, and to do so in the light of Dr Gudjonsson’s opinion, but we note all the medical evidence upon which reliance is now placed was available to very experienced counsel at the time of plea. There is nothing new in it. In any event it does not come close to providing a basis for arguing he did not know what he was doing or might have been induced improperly to plead guilty.  As for the assertion he pleaded guilty to something he did not do, so as to be released as soon as possible, we are entirely confident he would have been advised in full and fair terms by Mr Rees and we note that Ali himself provided the instructions for his basis of plea.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The law is clear: only in exceptional circumstances will the court entertain an appeal against a conviction based on an unequivocal plea of guilty. There is nothing exceptional here. Whatever may have led to Ali’s admissions while in police custody, according to Mr Rees, Ali was put under no pressure by anyone prior to entering his plea, which he did of his own free will. He was street wise and experienced in the criminal justice process. He was fit to plead, knew what he was doing, intended to plead guilty to manslaughter and did so without equivocation having received proper advice from counsel and solicitors. That advice would not have been significantly affected by the new material. He was offered no inducement and placed under no pressure by anyone. Mr Rees went through the basis of plea with him line by line. His plea confirmed the evidence of D and what he said to others in an unpressurised situation. He made no attempt to appeal his conviction until the CCRC contacted him and with nothing to lose and possibly with a lot to gain he accepted their invitation to examine the circumstances of his case. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In those circumstances the only way in which an appeal could succeed is if we were to find that the prosecution offended the court’s sense of justice and propriety to the extent that it amounted to an abuse of process.  As we have indicated, we do not. The police misconduct in this case proven or alleged was not such as to offend our sense of justice or amount to an abuse of process.  </p>
