But it is no part of a fair trial that questions of guilt and innocence should be determined by procedural manoeuvres. On the contrary, fairness is best served when the issues between the parties are identified as early and as clearly as possible.  As Lord Justice Auld noted, a criminal trial is not a game under which a guilty defendant should be provided with a sporting chance. It is a search for truth in accordance with the twin principles that the prosecution must prove its case and that a defendant is not obliged to inculpate himself, the object being to convict the guilty and acquit the innocent.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.00in;text-indent:-0.50in">1A.2<marker name="tab"/>Further, it is not just for a party to obstruct or delay the preparation of a case for trial in order to secure some perceived procedural advantage, or to take unfair advantage of a mistake by someone else. If courts allow that to happen it damages public confidence in criminal justice. The Rules and the Practice Directions, taken together, make it clear that courts must not allow it to happen.</p>

This includes enabling a witness or defendant to give their best evidence, and enabling a defendant to comprehend the proceedings and engage fully with his or her defence.

In relation to young and/or vulnerable people, this may mean departing radically from traditional cross-examination. The form and extent of appropriate cross-examination will vary from case to case. For adult non vulnerable witnesses an advocate will usually put his case so that the witness will have the opportunity of commenting upon it and/or answering it.  When the witness is young or otherwise vulnerable, the court may dispense with the normal practice and impose restrictions on the advocate ‘putting his case’ where there is a risk of a young or otherwise vulnerable witness failing to understand, becoming distressed or acquiescing to leading questions. Where limitations on questioning are necessary and appropriate, they must be clearly defined. The judge has a duty to ensure that they are complied with and should explain them to the jury and the reasons for them. If the advocate fails to comply with the limitations, the judge should give relevant directions to the jury when that occurs and prevent further questioning that does not comply with the ground rules settled upon in advance. Instead of commenting on inconsistencies during cross-examination, following discussion between the judge and the advocates, the advocate or judge may point out important inconsistencies after (instead of during) the witness’s evidence. The judge should also remind the jury of these during summing up. The judge should be alert to alleged inconsistencies that are not in fact inconsistent, or are trivial.</p>

There are exceptions but these ‘have to be justified by some even more important principle.’  However, the practical application of that undisputed principle, and the proper balancing of conflicting rights and principles, call for careful judgments to be made.  The following is intended to provide some assistance to courts making decisions when asked to provide the public, including journalists, with access to or copies of information and documents held by the court.  It is not a prescriptive list, as the court will have to consider all the circumstances of each individual case.</p>

The supply of information under CrimPR 5.8(7) is at the discretion of the court, and court staff must ensure that they have received a clear direction from the court before providing any information or material under rule 5.8(7) to a member of the public, including to the accredited media or their legal representatives.</p>

As such, a representative of the media or a legal commentator who wishes to use live text-based communications from court may do so without making an application to the court.</p>

CrimPR 10.2(5) provides that an indictment may contain any count charging substantially the same offence as one sent for trial and any other count based on the prosecution evidence already served which the Crown Court has jurisdiction to try.  Where the prosecutor intends to include in the draft indictment counts which differ materially from, or are additional to, those on which the defendant was sent for trial then the defendant should be given as much notice as possible, usually by service of a draft indictment, or a provisional draft indictment, at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>

But the court will not allow the prosecution to proceed on both indictments.  They cannot be tried together and the court will require the prosecution to elect the one on which the trial will proceed.  Where different defendants have been separately sent for trial for offences which can lawfully be charged in the same indictment then it is permissible to join in one indictment counts based on the separate sendings for trial even if an indictment based on one of them already has been signed. Where necessary the court should be invited to exercise its powers of amendment under section 5 of the Indictments Act 1915.</p>

Where defendants on trial have a variety of offences alleged against them then, in the interests of effective case management, it is the court’s responsibility to exercise its powers in accordance with the overriding objective set out in CrimPR Part 1.  The prosecution may be required to identify a selection of counts on which the trial should proceed, leaving a decision to be taken later whether to try any of the remainder.  Where an indictment contains substantive counts and one or more related conspiracy counts, the court will expect the prosecution to justify the joinder.  Failing justification, the prosecution should be required to choose whether to proceed on the substantive counts or on the conspiracy counts.  In any event, if there is a conviction on any counts that are tried, then those that have been postponed can remain on the file marked “not to be proceeded with without the leave of the court or the Court of Appeal”.  In the event that a conviction is later quashed on appeal, the remaining counts can be tried.  Where necessary the court has power to order that an indictment be severed.</p>

This will ensure that the defendant is aware at the earliest possible opportunity of what the prosecution propose and of the proposed association of counts in the indictment.  It is undesirable for a draft indictment in the usual form to be served where the prosecutor expects to apply for a two stage trial and hence, of necessity, for permission to amend the indictment at a later stage in order that it may be in the special form.</p>

In these cases, a ‘multiple incidents’ count may be desirable.  If on the other hand, the complainant is able to identify particular incidents of the offence by reference to a date or other specific event, but alleges that in addition there were other incidents which the complainant is unable to specify, then it may be desirable to include separate counts for the identified incidents and a ‘multiple incidents’ count or counts alleging that incidents of the same offence occurred ‘many’ times.  Using a ‘multiple incidents’ count may be an appropriate alternative to using ‘specimen’ counts in some cases where repeated sexual or physical abuse is alleged.  The choice of count will depend on the particular circumstances of the case and should be determined bearing in mind the implications for sentencing set out in R v Canavan; R v Kidd; R v Shaw [1998] 1 W.L.R. 604, [1998] 1 Cr.

The certificate of full argument is produced by the magistrates’ court’s computer system, Libra, as part of the GENORD (General Form of Order).  Two hard copies are produced, one for the defence and one for the prosecution. (Some magistrates’ courts may also produce a manual certificate which will usually be available from the justices’ legal adviser at the conclusion of the hearing; the GENORD may not be produced until the following day.) Under CrimPR 14.4(4), the magistrates’ court officer will provide the defendant with a certificate that the court heard full argument.  However, it is the responsibility of the defence, as the applicant in the Crown Court, to ensure that a copy of the certificate of full argument is provided to the Crown Court as part of the application (CrimPR 14.8(3)(e)).  The applicant’s solicitors should attach a copy of the certificate to the bail application form.  If the certificate is not enclosed with the application form, it will be difficult to avoid some delay in listing.</p>

The resulting delays impact on victims, witnesses and other court users and also waste costs.  A defendant’s failure to surrender affects not only the case with which he or she is concerned, but also the court’s ability to administer justice more generally, by damaging the confidence of victims, witnesses and the public in the effectiveness of the court system and the judiciary.  It is, therefore, most important that defendants who are granted bail appreciate the significance of the obligation to surrender to custody in accordance with the terms of their bail and that courts take appropriate action, if they fail to do so.</p>

In order to minimise the disruption to the court and to others, particularly witnesses if the case is listed for trial, the defendant should notify the court through his legal representative as soon as his inability to attend court becomes known.</p>

This is likely to be practicable in the magistrates' court where cases can easily be transferred from one magistrates' court to another.  Practice is likely to vary in the Crown Court.  If the defendant appears before a different court, for example because he is charged with offences committed in another area, and it is not practicable for all matters to be concluded by that court then the defendant may be remanded on bail or in custody, if appropriate, to appear before the first court for the outstanding offences to be dealt with.   </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.00in;text-indent:-0.50in">14F.1<marker name="tab"/>A surety undertakes to forfeit a sum of money if the defendant fails to surrender as required. Considerable care must be taken to explain that obligation and the consequences before a surety is taken. This system, in one form or another, has great antiquity. It is immensely valuable. A court concerned that a defendant will fail to surrender will not normally know that defendant personally, nor indeed much about him. When members of the community who do know the defendant say they trust him to surrender and are prepared to stake their own money on that trust, that can have a powerful influence on the decision of the court as to whether or not to grant bail. There are two important side-effects. The first is that the surety will keep an eye on the defendant, and report to the authorities if there is a concern that he will abscond. In those circumstances, the surety can withdraw. The second is that a defendant will be deterred from absconding by the knowledge that if he does so then his family or friends who provided the surety will lose their money. In the experience of the courts, it is comparatively rare for a defendant to fail to surrender when meaningful sureties are in place.</p>

It is possible that any defendant who apparently absconds may have a defence of reasonable cause to the allegation of failure to surrender.  If that happens, then any surety or security estreated would be returned. The reason for proceeding is that the defendant may never surrender, or may not surrender for many years.  The court should still consider the sureties’ obligations if that happens. Moreover, the longer the matter is delayed the more probable it is that the personal circumstances of the sureties will change.</p>

The starting point is that the surety is forfeited in full. It would be unfortunate if this valuable method of allowing a defendant to remain at liberty were undermined. Courts would have less confidence in the efficacy of sureties. It is also important to note that a defendant who absconds without in any way forewarning his sureties does not thereby release them from any or all of their responsibilities.  Even if a surety does his best, he remains liable for the full amount, except at the discretion of the court.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.00in;text-indent:-0.50in">16C.1<marker name="tab"/>The interrogation of suspects is primarily governed by Code C, one of the Codes of Practice under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (‘PACE’). Under that Code, interviews must normally be contemporaneously recorded.  Under PACE Code E, interviews conducted at a police station concerning an indictable offence must normally be audio-recorded.  In practice, most interviews are audio-recorded under Code E, or video-recorded under Code F, and it is best practice to do so.  The questioning of terrorism suspects is governed separately by Code H.  The Codes are available electronically on the Home Office website.</p>

In the magistrates’ court, the Bench sometimes retire to read the interview themselves, and the document is treated as if it had been read aloud in court.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.00in;text-indent:-0.50in">18C.1<marker name="tab"/>Witnesses are entitled to refresh their memory from their statement or visually recorded interview. The court should enquire at the PTPH or other case management hearing about arrangements for memory refreshing. The witness’s first viewing of the visually recorded interview can be distressing or distracting. It should not be seen for the first time immediately before giving evidence. Depending upon the age and vulnerability of the witness several competing issues have to be considered and it may be that the assistance of the intermediary is needed to establish exactly how memory refreshing should be managed.</p>

An intermediary may be present to facilitate communication but should not act as the independent person designated to take a note and report to the court if anything is said. Where the viewing takes place at a different time from that of the jury, the witness is sworn just before cross-examination, asked if he or she has watched the interview and if its contents are ‘true’ (or other words tailored to the witness’s understanding).</p>

If not already done, a respondent defendant should serve a defence statement under section 5 or 6 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996, so that the court is fully informed of what is in issue.  When a defendant makes an application for a witness anonymity order the prosecutor should consider the continuing duty to disclose material under section 7A of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996; therefore a prosecutor’s response should include confirmation that that duty has been considered.  Great care should be taken to ensure that nothing disclosed contains anything that might reveal the witness’ identity.  A respondent prosecutor should provide the court with all available information relevant to the considerations to which the Act requires a court to have regard, whether or not that information falls to be disclosed under the 1996 Act.</p>

Where, for example, the witness is an investigator who is recognisable by the defendant but known only by an assumed name, and there is no likelihood that the witness’ credibility will be in issue, then the court may indicate a provisional decision and invite representations within a defined period, usually 14 days, including representations about whether there should be a hearing. In such a case, where the parties do not object the court may make an order without a hearing.  Or where the court provisionally considers an application to be misconceived, an applicant may choose to withdraw it without requiring a hearing.

At common law a judge has a residual discretion to discharge a particular juror who ought not to be serving, but this discretion can only be exercised to prevent an individual juror who is not competent from serving. It does not include a discretion to discharge a jury drawn from particular sections of the community or otherwise to influence the overall composition of the jury.  However, if there is a risk that there is widespread local knowledge of the defendant or a witness in a particular case, the judge may, after hearing submissions from the advocates, decide to exclude jurors from particular areas to avoid the risk of jurors having or acquiring personal knowledge of the defendant or a witness.</span>

This might apply, for example, to a parent whose childcare arrangements unexpectedly fail, or a worker who is engaged in the provision of services the need for which can be critical, or a Member of Parliament who has deferred their jury service to an apparently more convenient time, but is unexpectedly called back to work for a very important reason.

The power to do this is implicit in section 16(1) of the Juries Act 1974.  In unusual cases (such as an unexpected emergency arising overnight) a juror need not be discharged in open court.  The good administration of justice depends on the co-operation of jurors, who perform an essential public service.  All such applications should be dealt with sensitively and sympathetically and the trial judge should always seek to meet the interests of justice without unduly inconveniencing any juror.</p>

Any discussion must, however, be between the judge and the advocates on both sides.  If an advocate is instructed by a solicitor who is in court, he or she, too, should be allowed to attend the discussion.  This freedom of access is important because there may be matters calling for communication or discussion of such a nature that the advocate cannot, in the client's interest, mention them in open court, e.g. the advocate, by way of mitigation, may wish to tell the judge that reliable medical evidence shows that the defendant is suffering from a terminal illness and may not have long to live.  It is imperative that, so far as possible, justice must be administered in open court.  Advocates should, therefore, only ask to see the judge when it is felt to be really necessary.  The judge must be careful only to treat such communications as private where, in the interests of justice, this is necessary.  Where any such discussion takes place it should be recorded, preferably by audio recording.</p>

The objective of the <span style="font-style:italic">Goodyear</span> guidelines is to safeguard against the creation or appearance of judicial pressure on a defendant.  Any advance indication given should be the maximum sentence if a guilty plea were to be tendered at that stage of the proceedings only; the judge should not indicate the maximum possible sentence following conviction by a jury after trial.  The judge should only give a <span style="font-style:italic">Goodyear</span> indication if one is requested by the defendant, although the judge can, in an appropriate case, remind the defence advocate of the defendant’s entitlement to seek an advance indication of sentence.</p>

If there is a basis of plea agreed by the prosecution and defence, it must be reduced into writing and a copy provided to the judge.  As always, any basis of plea will be subject to the approval of the court.  In cases where a dispute arises, the procedure in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Underwood</span> should be followed prior to the court considering a sentence indication further, as set out above.  The judge should not become involved in negotiations about the acceptance of pleas or any agreed basis of plea, nor should a request be made for an indication of the different sentences that might be imposed if various different pleas were to be offered.</p>

The statement gives victims a formal opportunity to say how a crime has affected them. It may help to identify whether they have a particular need for information, support and protection. The court will take the statement into account when determining sentence.  In some circumstances, it may be appropriate for relatives of a victim to make a VPS, for example where the victim has died as a result of the relevant criminal conduct.  The revised Code of Practice for Victims of Crime, published on 29 October 2013 gives further information about victims’ entitlements within the criminal justice system, and the duties placed on criminal justice agencies when dealing with victims of crime.</span>

The decision about whether or not to make a VPS is entirely a matter for the victim; no pressure should be brought to bear on their decision, and no conclusion should be drawn if they choose not to make such a statement.  A VPS or a further VPS may be made (in proper s.9 form, see below) at any time prior to the disposal of the case. It will not normally be appropriate for a VPS to be made after the disposal of the case; there may be rare occasions between sentence and appeal when a further VPS may be necessary, for example, when the victim was injured and the final prognosis was not available at the date of sentence.  However, VPS after disposal should be confined to presenting up to date factual material, such as medical information, and should be used sparingly.</p>

If the victim, or one of the victims, is a business or enterprise (including charities but excluding public sector bodies), of any size, a nominated representative may make an Impact Statement for Business (‘ISB’). The ISB gives a formal opportunity for the court to be informed how a crime has affected a business.  The court will take the statement into account when determining sentence.  This does not prevent individual employees from making a VPS about the impact of the same crime on them as individuals.  Indeed the ISB should be about the impact on the business exclusively, and the impact on any individual included within a VPS.</span>

A person making an ISB on behalf of a business, the nominated representative, must be authorised to do so on behalf of the business, either by nature of their position within the business, such as a director or owner, or by having been suitably authorised, such as by the owner or Board of Directors.  The nominated representative must also be in a position to give admissible evidence about the impact of the crime on the business.  This will usually be through first hand personal knowledge, or using business documents (as defined in section 117 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003).  The most appropriate person will vary depending on the nature of the crime, and the size and structure of the business and may for example include a manager, director, chief executive or shop owner.</p>

In considering the seriousness of the offence, the court must have regard to the general principles set out in Schedule 21 of the Act as amended and any guidelines relating to offences in general which are relevant to the case and not incompatible with the provisions of Schedule 21.  Although it is necessary to have regard to such guidance, it is always permissible not to apply the guidance if a judge considers there are reasons for not following it.  It is always necessary to have regard to the need to do justice in the particular case.  However, if a court departs from any of the starting points given in Schedule 21, the court is under a duty to state its reasons for doing so (section 270(2)(b) of the Act).</p>

Such an order should only be specified where the court considers that the seriousness of the offence (or the combination of the offence and one or more other offences associated with it) is exceptionally high.

The court should then take into account what credit the offender would have received for a remand in custody under section 240 or 240ZA of the Act and/or for a remand on bail subject to a qualifying curfew condition under section 240A, but for the fact that the mandatory sentence is one of life imprisonment. Where the offender has been thus remanded in connection with the offence or a related offence, the court should have in mind that no credit will otherwise be given for this time when the prisoner is considered for early release.  The appropriate time to take it into account is when setting the minimum term.  The court should make any appropriate subtraction from the punitive period it would otherwise impose, in order to reach the minimum term.</p>

As paragraph 9 of Schedule 21 makes clear, the judge retains ultimate discretion and the court may arrive at any minimum term from any starting point.

Where the court has departed from that starting point due to mitigating or aggravating features, it must state the reasons for that departure and any aggravating or mitigating features which have led to that departure.  At that point, the court should also declare how much, if any, time is being deducted for time spent in custody and/or on bail subject to a qualifying curfew condition.  The court must then explain that the minimum term is the minimum amount of time the prisoner will spend in prison, from the date of sentence, before the Parole Board can order early release.  If it remains necessary for the protection of the public, the prisoner will continue to be detained after that date.  The court should also state that where the prisoner has served the minimum term and the Parole Board has decided to direct release, the prisoner will remain on licence for the rest of his life and may be recalled to prison at any time.</p>

Though it is the prosecutor’s responsibility to the court to prepare any such document, if the defendant pleads guilty, or indicates a guilty plea, then it is very highly desirable that such sentencing information should be agreed between the parties and jointly submitted. If agreement cannot be reached in all particulars, then the nature and extent of the disagreement should be indicated. If the court concludes that what is in issue is material to sentence, then it will give directions for resolution of the dispute, whether by hearing oral evidence or by other means. In every case, when passing sentence the sentencing court must make clear on what basis sentence is passed: in fairness to the defendant, and for the information of any other person, or court, who needs or wishes to understand the reasons for sentence.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;text-indent:-0.49in">Q.4<marker name="tab"/>If so directed by or on behalf of the court, a defendant must supply accurate information about financial circumstances. In fixing the amount of any fine the court must take into account, amongst other considerations, the financial circumstances of the offender (whether an individual or other person) as they are known or as they appear to be. Before fixing the amount of fine when the defendant is an individual, the court must inquire into his financial circumstances. Where the defendant is an individual the court may make a financial circumstances order in respect of him.  This means an order in which the court requires an individual to provide a statement as to his financial means, within a specified time. It is an offence, punishable with imprisonment, to fail to comply with such an order or for knowingly/recklessly furnishing a false statement or knowingly failing to disclose a material fact. The provisions of section 20A Criminal Justice Act 1991 apply to any person (thereby including a corporate organisation) and place the offender under a statutory duty to provide the court with a statement as to his financial means in response to an official request. There are offences for non-compliance, false statements or non-disclosure.  It is for the court to decide how much information is required, having regard to relevant sentencing guidelines or guideline cases. However, by reference to those same guidelines and cases the parties should anticipate what the court will require, and prepare accordingly. In complex cases, and in cases involving a corporate defendant, the information required will be more extensive than in others. In the case of a corporate defendant, that information usually will include details of the defendant’s corporate structure; annual profit and loss accounts, or extracts; annual balance sheets, or extracts; details of shareholders’ receipts; and details of the remuneration of directors or other officers.</p>

This will give the prosecution the opportunity to assist the court should the court wish it. Usually accounts need to be considered with some care to avoid reaching a superficial and perhaps erroneous conclusion. Where accounts or other financial information are deliberately not supplied the court will be entitled to conclude that the company is in a position to pay any financial penalty it is minded to impose. Where the relevant information is provided late it may be desirable for sentence to be adjourned, if necessary at the defendant's expense, so as to avoid the risk of the court taking what it is told at face value and imposing an inadequate penalty.”</p>

It is the defendant’s responsibility to disclose to the court such information relevant to his or her financial position as will enable it to assess what he or she reasonably can afford to pay. If necessary, the court may compel the disclosure of an individual defendant’s financial circumstances. In the absence of such disclosure, or where the court is not satisfied that it has been given sufficient reliable information, the court will be entitled to draw reasonable inferences as to the offender’s means from evidence it has heard and from all the circumstances of the case.</p>

However, in relation to the listing of appeals, the Court of Appeal takes precedence over all lower courts, including the Crown Court. Wherever practicable, a lower court will have regard to this principle when making arrangements to release an advocate to appear in the Court of Appeal. In case of difficulty the lower court should communicate with the Registrar. In general an advocate’s commitment in a lower court will not be regarded as a good reason for failing to accept a date proposed for a hearing in the Court of Appeal.</p>

Where the time estimates are considered by an advocate to be inadequate, or where the estimates have been altered because, for example, a ground of appeal has been abandoned, it is the duty of the advocate to inform the Court promptly, in which event the Registrar will reconsider the time estimates and inform the parties accordingly.</p>

Those contemplating an appeal should seek advice and should remember that a notice of appeal without grounds is ineffective and that grounds should be substantial and particularised and not a mere formula. When leave to appeal has been refused by the single judge, it is often of assistance to consider the reasons given by the single judge before making a decision whether to renew the application. Where an application devoid of merit has been refused by the single judge he may indicate that the Full Court should consider making a direction for loss of time on renewal of the application.  However the Full Court may make such a direction whether or not such an indication has been given by the single judge.</p>

Every application must be carefully scrutinised with close attention paid to what the relevant statutory provision requires of the applicant and to what it permits.

What is needed will depend upon the circumstances. The Rules require that a record of the ‘gist’ be retained.  The purpose of such a record is to allow the sufficiency of the court’s reasons for its decision subsequently to be assessed. The gravity of such decisions requires that their exercise should be susceptible to scrutiny and to explanation by reference to all of the information that was taken into account.</p>

However, there are some hundreds of powers of entry, search and seizure, supplied by a corresponding number of legislative provisions. In any criminal matter, if there is no form designed for the particular warrant or order sought, the forms should still be used, as far as is practicable, and adapted as necessary.  The applicant should pay particular attention to the specific legislative requirements for the granting of such an application to ensure that the court has all of the necessary information, and, if the court might be unfamiliar with the legislation, should provide a copy of the relevant provisions.  Applicants must comply with the duties of candour and truthfulness, and include in their application the declarations required by the Rules and must make disclosure of any unfavourable information to the court.</p>

The court should consider whether it is appropriate to release the person or whether it must exercise its powers to fine the person or to commit the person to custody under section 12 (2) of the 1981 Act.  In deciding how to deal with the person, the court should have regard to the period for which he or she has been detained, whether the conduct was admitted and the seriousness of the contempt.

In courts with more than one judge, the paragraph numbering continues sequentially through each judgment and does not start again at the beginning of each judgment.  Indented paragraphs are not numbered.  A unique reference number is given to each judgment.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.00in;text-indent:-0.50in">G.8<marker name="tab"/>The use of production orders and search warrants involve the use of intrusive state powers that affect the rights and liberties of individuals.  It is the responsibility of the court to ensure that those powers are not abused.  To do so, the court must be presented with a properly completed application, on the appropriate form, which includes a summary of the investigation to provide the context for the order, a clear explanation of how the statutory requirements are fulfilled, and full and frank disclosure of anything that might undermine the basis for the application.  Further directions on the proper making and consideration of such applications will be provided by Practice Direction.  However, the complexity of the application must be taken into account in listing it such that the judge is afforded appropriate reading time and the hearing is given sufficient time for the issues to be considered thoroughly, and a short judgment given.</p>
