	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">As long ago as 20 August 2009, after a lengthy trial at Leeds Crown Court before His Honour Judge Hoffman and a jury, each of the appellants Slade, Pearman and Baxter was convicted of counts of conspiracy to murder, criminal damage, handling and arson. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">After that trial they faced a further trial (along with the appellant Hudson) on two counts of conspiracy to rob and two counts of robbery. At various stages Baxter changed his plea to one of guilty on three of the counts which he faced and Hudson pleaded guilty to one count of robbery and one count of conspiracy to rob. After that second trial (also before Judge Hoffman and a jury at Leeds Crown Court) Slade and Pearman were on 1 February 2010 convicted of all four counts and Baxter was convicted of the remaining count of robbery which he faced. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Each of Slade, Pearman and Baxter was sentenced to imprisonment for life on both indictments. In sentencing, the judge made clear that he had considered both indictments together in making his assessment of dangerousness. He described them as callous, dangerous and ruthless and engaged in “Premier League crime”. Slade was assessed as the leader, with Pearman and Baxter described as “loyal henchmen”. They were sentenced to life terms with consecutive notional determinate terms of 23 years (first indictment) and 20 years (second indictment) in the case of Slade; 21 years (first indictment) and 18 years (second indictment) in the case of Pearman; and 21 years (first indictment) and 18 years (second indictment) in the case of Baxter. The resulting specified minimum terms were 21<span style="font-family:'Courier New'">½ </span>years, 19<span style="font-family:'Courier New'">½</span>years and 19<span style="font-family:'Courier New'">½</span>years respectively, with time spent on remand in custody being directed to count towards sentence. A Serious Crime Prevention Order was also made against Slade. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Hudson, who had pleaded guilty at a late stage on the two counts which he faced, was described by the judge as not being a core member of the gang.  He did not attract a finding of dangerousness. He was sentenced to a term of 9 years imprisonment, with time spent on remand in custody also being directed to count towards sentence. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The appeal hearing before us however, was confined to the appeals, with leave of the single judge, of Slade, Pearman and Baxter against their convictions on the first indictment, the arguments focusing on the convictions on the count of conspiracy to murder. It ultimately was common ground before us that the various appeals against sentence would need to be deferred for further consideration depending on the outcome of the appeals against conviction on the first indictment; and the appellant Hudson (who we gather has now been released on licence) made no objection to the hearing of the appeals against sentence being adjourned for this purpose. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">A great part of the appeals against conviction has concerned the appellants’ applications to this court to adduce fresh evidence. The fresh evidence is of two kinds. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.04in">The first relates to CCTV evidence (taken with mobile phone and cell-site analysis). It is said that the proposed fresh evidence demonstrates that critical timings shown on the CCTV recordings at Slade’s home at 2 Sandmoor Drive was consistently, over the relevant period, some 22 minutes slow as compared with real time. When that factor is then also linked to an analysis of mobile phone usage and cell-site and other evidence, the result is, so it is said, that it is shown that some or all of Slade, Pearman and Baxter could not have been in an Audi RS6 car engaged in conspiring to murder at the times and locations forming a central part of the Crown’s case at the trial. We note at this stage that much of the argument on this point rested not simply on fresh evidence as such but also on a redeployment (albeit with what appear to be a fresh analysis and considerable amplification) of evidence and arguments available to be advanced at trial. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.04in">The second relates to voice recognition evidence. Such evidence had been given at trial. But it is said that there have subsequently been developments in the relevant science such that new evidence in the form of Automatic Speaker Recognition technology – being evidence of a kind not previously deployed in the courts of England and Wales- should now be admitted. It is said that such evidence demonstrates not only that the assertion of alleged consistency of voices recorded on the relevant occasions in the RS6 car with the voices of Slade, Pearman and Baxter (as advanced by the Crown at trial) was in fact erroneous, but also that the presence of the appellants in the car on such occasions can positively be excluded. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">That, however, is not the only ground for these appeals. Other grounds are advanced.  It is said that the Judge should have acceded to an application to discharge the jury.  It is said that the Judge erred in failing to accede to submissions of no case to answer made on behalf of all three appellants at the close of the prosecution case. It is further said that thereafter the summing-up to the jury was unfair, unbalanced and heavily slanted in favour of the prosecution and against the defence. Very late in the day, an argument was also sought to be raised on behalf of Baxter to the effect that there was unfair non-disclosure at trial by the Crown of material said to be highly relevant to the defence case. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">At trial, all the defendants were represented by experienced leading and junior counsel. Since trial, however, there have, for various reasons, been changes in the legal representation, sometimes more than once. Before us, Slade was represented by Mr Tim Owen QC with Mr Stephen Vullo QC; Pearman was represented by Mr Henry Blaxland QC leading Mr Derek Duffy; and Baxter was represented by Mr Kieran Vaughan QC leading Mr Aaron Watkins. The Crown was represented by Mr Paul Greaney QC leading Mr Nicholas de la Poer.  Mr Greaney (then as junior counsel being led by Mr Robert Smith QC) and Mr Duffy had appeared at trial: none of the other counsel appearing before us (or the solicitors instructing them) had been involved in the trial. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">To a very great extent the delays have been occasioned by the various changes in the legal representation for the appellants that have occurred from time to time and the sheer complexity of aspects of the fresh evidence sought to be obtained by the appellants since trial, together with associated funding problems. Further, some of the applications for leave to appeal, whether on the first indictment or second indictment, had in fact been brought out of time (the necessary extensions thereafter being granted).  In the event, some grounds were then abandoned at various stages, others added. Directions had previously been given by Hughes LJ (then Vice-President of the Court of Appeal, Criminal Division) during 2011 and 2012 which were not, for various reasons, fully complied with. Even by the beginning of 2014 the cases were still a long way away from being ready: and indeed only then, by direction of the Registrar of Criminal Appeals, was the representation order extended to Slade’s new legal team to enable it to instruct voice recognition experts and to prepare the new schedules comprising the CCTV and mobile phone and cell-site evidence. Final perfected Grounds of Appeal, superseding all previous Grounds, were lodged by the appellants during the course of 2014.  Further, directions were given at various stages during the year by this Court designed to ensure that the matter came on for hearing in a properly prepared state by the end of the year. </p>

They were in a black Audi RS6 car. It had been stolen a considerable time previously.  Some of the men got out of the car and smashed the windows of a Vauxhall Vectra car, parked in the street, belonging to a man called Maluch. He was a neighbour of Roberts. Mr Maluch looked out of the window and saw the RS6 being driven off at speed. The police had been waiting nearby.  They intervened when the sounds of the breaking glass, which were picked up on a covert audio device placed in the RS6, caused them to think that shots had been fired. In the event, the RS6 car and the men in it were not apprehended. But the police at this time also surrounded a black Audi A4 car, which previously had been parked in Ivy Crescent with its engine running, some 320 metres away from Roberts’ house, at around the time the RS6 car had driven up near to Roberts’ house. Inside the A4 car were Slade, Pearman and Baxter. The evidence was that the A4 car had been driven to the area at the same time as the RS6 car and, even if not taking an identical route, had been in “virtual convoy” with it, as the Crown was to put it.  </p>

No weapons of any kind were found on them or in the A4 car itself. However, subsequent examination showed that within the car were, among other things, a black bin liner bag containing clothing and a pair of binoculars; a rucksack of a colour and kind Slade had been observed often to carry, containing dog and cat repellent and a frequency recorder; a Tupperware box containing four car keys and a electronic fob and a yellow card (Slade’s fingerprints were on the box); gloves; a magnet; a plastic bag containing adhesive straps, with two blades; and a tracker (MAC4) with batteries attached and which had Slade’s fingerprints and DNA on it. The tracker was found on the rear nearside floor (where Pearman had been sitting): when arrested, Slade, who had been sitting in the front passenger seat, had been observed turning to place something at the feet of where Pearman had been sitting. The appellants were taken to separate police stations. A mobile phone attributed to Baxter was found in the car and mobile phones were also seized from Slade and Pearman.  All had had their batteries removed – as the Crown was to say, with the perceived view of frustrating any subsequent cell-site analysis.  In this regard, there was evidence that Pearman, from previous criminal proceedings, had had experience of the use of such cell-site evidence.  Further, a mobile phone jammer and other anti-avoidance materials were subsequently found at Slade’s house and there was evidence of accessing by computers belonging to Slade and Baxter of anti-avoidance and jamming techniques.  Literature relating to mobile phone jamming was also found in Baxter’s Mercedes ML car. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The Crown also adduced evidence of the recordings of the CCTV cameras at Slade’s house (of which there were four, with a centralised control).  These showed, among other things, Slade during this period being variously picked up and dropped off at 2 Sandmoor Drive by the Mercedes ML associated with Baxter.  In this regard, the evidence gave rise to an important issue.  Police evidence was adduced relating to their attendance at 2 Sandmoor Drive later on 4 March 2008 after the appellants had been arrested.  That evidence, if not entirely precise, established that on that date the clock on Slade’s CCTV showed a time some 22 minutes slower than real time.  That matter played an important part at trial and has in turn played an important part in the arguments before us.  The CCTV evidence taken from cameras at Slade’s house in Sandmoor Drive was to the effect that Baxter in the Mercedes ML car would regularly pick Slade up (Slade often taking with him a rucksack and bag) and then would return him in the same car some time later.  It was common ground at trial, as we were told, that the Mercedes ML was driven always by Baxter. </p>

It was stressed at all events by the experts that the opinions had to be used in conjunction with all the other evidence.  In the case of Baxter, the joint finding, by reference to the selected recordings, was one of consistency.

She accepted, however, that consistency could mean consistency with thousands of voices.  She also accepted that “moderate distinctiveness” was of limited assistance in voice identification.  She further accepted that if independent evidence showed that one of the defendants was not in the car when said to have been speaking on the recording then that would indicate that such defendant was not speaking then or on any other occasion attributed to that same defendant by the voice recognition evidence. </p>

(3) However, most importantly the question is whether <span style="font-weight:bold">a</span> reasonable jury, not <span style="font-weight:bold">all</span> reasonable juries, could, on one possible view of the evidence, be entitled to reach that adverse inference.  If a judge concludes that <span style="font-weight:bold">a</span> reasonable jury could be entitled to do so (properly directed) on the evidence, putting the prosecution case at its highest, then the case must continue; if not it must be withdrawn from the jury.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">That the Crown’s case was essentially a circumstantial one is plain.  It had, as we have already said, a number of different, albeit linked, strands.  The conversations recorded in the RS6 provided evidence to the jury of a conspiracy to kill.  As to the question of whether the appellants were party to such a conspiracy there were, among other points, these factors.  First there was the clear evidence of regular association between Slade, Pearman and Baxter.  Second, there was the abundant evidence of association between them with both the RS6 (a stolen car frequently used with false number plates) and the Toyota Hiace (a vehicle converted into a surveillance vehicle and frequently used with false number plates); as well as their association with the premises where they were stored (as evidenced by the finding of the fob and keys and so on).  Third, there was the evidence of their use of the Toyota Hiace, adapted for surveillance purposes, sometimes in conjunction with the RS6.  Fourth, there was the evidence of the RS6 being regularly in the East End Park area during the period of the alleged conspiracy and also, on occasion, being involved in what could be concluded to be the tailing of Roberts’ Toyota Avensis.  Fifth, there was the evidence of the Toyota Hiace, with three men in it, being in the East End Park area when the RS6 was not being used on 1 and 3 March 2008.  Fifth, there was the evidence of the A4 in effect going to the East End Park area in what could be said to be virtual convoy with the RS6 on 4 March 2008 itself.  Sixth, there was the indisputable evidence that the three were arrested in the A4 on that date when parked just 320 metres or so from and at the same time as the incident involving the men in the RS6 car damaging Mr Maluch’s car in the street outside Roberts’ house.  Seventh, there was the evidence of the trackers, magnets and other potentially incriminating items found in the A4 car at the time, along with the mobile phones with the batteries removed.  Eighth, there was the conduct of the four men in the RS6 burning the car and then departing in the circumstances witnessed by the boy.  Ninth, Slade and Baxter gave no comment interviews.  There were various other matters as well, which we need not rehearse here. </p>

In this regard, the recorded conversations, with their reference to a gun, to “clipping”, to the gun jamming, and to heavy duty cartridges and so on – all covered by evidence adduced by the prosecution – spoke for itself.  It could properly be inferred that those conversations indicated a conspiracy to murder.  Further, there was evidence from those conversations, which the jury could accept, that two of the men, as recorded, were acting on the instructions of another.  Yet further, there was evidence from those conversations, which the jury could accept, of a reference to “Den” and to “Rich”. </p>

But even there the prosecution were able to point to the observation evidence showing Pearman at Primley Park View very close to the RS6 on the evening of 26 February 2008 in circumstances where, it could be inferred, he was checking on it. </p>

But, as the prosecution throughout fairly and rightly accepted, such expert evidence could not, even taken at its highest, identify the men in the RS6 on those occasions as the appellants.  Her evidence was, in effect limited to saying that the voices were (in her opinion) consistent with those of Slade, Pearman and Baxter and with varying degrees of distinctiveness.

However Mr Greaney told us, with commendable candour and fairness, that that correctly described the position.  He confirmed that it was indeed a “central plank” of the case then being advanced at the trial: and no alternative position was being advanced.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly, as it seems to us, as a matter of fairness the question of whether or not the submission of no case to answer was rightly rejected by the judge has to be assessed by reference to the case then being advanced: which case included the proposition that the three voices in the RS6 were those of the appellants.  That it may not, in truth, have been crucial to establish a case against the appellants on that particular basis is thus, for present purposes, neither here nor there.  If what was being presented to the jury by the prosecution as “crucial” to the proof of its case did not, on analysis, represent a conclusion properly open to the jury on the evidence, then as we see it the submission of no case to answer had to be decided accordingly.  It thus follows that it is not for this court, in the circumstances of these particular appeals and in assessing whether or not these particular convictions were safe, to approach the matter on an alternative basis (viz that actual presence of the appellants in the RS6 on the disputed occasions was not, in truth, necessarily crucial to the prosecution case) which was not advanced to the trial judge by the prosecution and which was not in accordance with the way the case was in fact conducted at trial.  Nor did Mr Greaney, for the purposes of the present argument, seek to contend otherwise before us.  He maintained that – taking all the evidence as a whole – there was indeed evidence from which a reasonable jury could properly and safely infer that the men recorded on these occasions in the RS6 by the probe were Pearman and Baxter and also (on two of the occasions) Slade. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">But we also add this.  The judge’s task was to assess the submission of no case to answer by reference to the arguments addressed to him and to the evidence thus far deployed at the trial.  There was, in our view, no obligation on the judge to review for himself all the evidence in order to see if there were yet other possible arguments or evidential points available to the appellants, even if they were not then actually advancing them in support of the submissions of no case to answer.  We say this because, as we will come on to identify further, aspects of the submissions made to us – notably those of Mr Vullo – undoubtedly involved an analysis of the materials and a much wider ranging factual appraisal (and in some respects deployment of factual matters not raised at trial) which went well beyond the analysis and argument undertaken on behalf of the appellants before the trial judge on the submissions of no case to answer.  We should, however, make clear that no ground of appeal is advanced before us based on inadequate representation by trial counsel: indeed any such suggestion was in terms disclaimed. </p>

Again, on 24 February the CCTV showed Baxter’s Mercedes ML picking up Slade at 2 Sandmoor Drive between 18.02 and 18.05: when the RS6 is shown on the tracker as being on the A64 in Leeds, a considerable distance away.

But he considered that an explanation could be found in the evidence that the cell-site analysis could only show the location of the phone in question: it could not show in whose hands the phone actually was at any given time.  He coupled that with reference to the prosecution point that, as evidenced by the appellants’ searches on the computers concerning jamming, the removal of batteries from their phones on 4 March 2008 and so on, the appellants could be taken as cell-site “savvy”; thus consistent with the phones having been placed in other hands at the relevant times.

As the judge said, on the evidence adduced at trial the only sure fact with regard to the CCTV timing was that on 4 March 2008 it was some 22 minutes slow compared to real time.  It did not follow, as an inference, that it must likewise have been 22 minutes slow on each day in the intervening period from 21 February 2008.  Nor did it follow that it showed the real time on those days either.  As the jury had heard and could conclude, the appellants were surveillance “savvy”: and one question the jury could properly ask themselves, in the absence of explanation, was as to how and why the CCTV timing at Slade’s house came to be out by 22 </p>

To a significant extent the points now advanced to us do make, albeit with much more elaboration, points sought to be advanced to the trial judge on the submissions of no case to answer.  But they also go very much further.  For one thing, they focus on the CCTV timings (both on the basis that they were 22 minutes slow throughout and on the alternative basis that they show the real time throughout) with a view to positively demonstrating that the CCTV clock was indeed consistently 22 minutes out on each day in the alleged conspiracy period.  This was done in much more detail than was advanced to the trial judge – where the defence stance had been confined in effect to arguing for an inference as to CCTV timings.  Further, this exercise was also conducted before us in relation to days (not simply 22, 24 and 26 February 2008) other than those on which the judge had been addressed.  This was with a view to, as Mr Vullo explained, showing a consistent pattern throughout this period as to the CCTV timings: a potentially very important point.  A yet further development was deployment by Mr Vullo (and, in one instance, Mr Vaughan) of telling materials which, although based on evidence available at trial, do not appear to have been advanced in evidence or argument before the judge. </p>

The judge’s “Who knows?” position with regard to the CCTV times – taken at the stage of the submissions of no case to answer and then as put to the jury in the summing-up – has now been shown to have been wrong.  When one links that – now demonstrated – fact with the other arguments that were and remain available (the “alibi” evidence of the phones, the “Div” texts, the accessing of the computer at Baxter’s house on 25 February 2008), and as further confirmed by other points advanced to us, in our view it is established that the central plank of the Crown’s case, as advanced at trial, was one that was not available.

Indeed, that aspect of the Crown’s case may – adversely to the appellants – have potentially achieved still greater prominence in the minds of the jury by that stage, given the prosecution’s and judge’s understandable repeated emphasis on the fact that none of the appellants had given evidence, or (for the most part) answers in interview, to provide any explanations. </p>

Yet further, this material was, as Mr Vullo submitted, to be put in the context both of the “alibi” phone occasions and also of the texts from Baxter’s relevant mobile phone to that of Div.  On this last point he relied – as had been done on behalf of Baxter at trial – in particular on the entries relating to 26 February 2008, which showed a series of exchanges between 18.04 and 19.38 (when the RS6 was in use, but when the relevant phone was in a location elsewhere than at the location of the RS6, being at or near 2 Sandmoor Drive) as well as such Div texts on other dates.  In this regard he was also entitled to re-iterate the point which had been made at trial: that the highly personal nature of such texts is not readily consistent with anyone other than Baxter being the user.   </p>

Mr Vaughan, on behalf of Baxter, submitted that, from those, it was demonstrated that on 24 February 2008 at 20.41.30, at a time when the RS6 was tracked to the East End Park area, Baxter’s Mercedes ML was in fact identified at a location in Leeds over five miles away.  This too is evidence of a kind which was available at trial but was not used (perhaps because it was overlooked).

Moreover he did so, it is said, in trenchant and dismissive terms.

The judge was here dealing with a highly tactical defence case, where all the indications are that leading counsel for the appellants at trial had perhaps taken to the limit what might properly be advanced in closing speeches in the absence of any answers in interviews, any defence case statements or any evidence at trial from the appellants themselves; and when the prosecution had by then, of course, made its own closing speech and had no further right of response.  The judge had to deal with that situation arising.  We can accept that some passages of the summing-up might in places have been better framed or balanced or have been put in somewhat different language.  But overall we are not persuaded that this summing-up was unfair or unbalanced to such an extent as to render the convictions unsafe. </p>

The first – to which we have previously alluded – is that it is incumbent on a defendant to present his whole case at trial (the one trial principle).  It is, in general terms, contrary to the proper administration of justice for a defendant to advance on appeal a case different from or other than the case he is able to present at trial.  The second, however, is that it is generally abhorrent to the proper administration of justice that a defendant may have been wrongfully convicted.  The court has to weigh these matters and all other relevant matters (including those specified in s.23(2)(a) to (d)) in deciding whether or not to receive the proposed fresh evidence.  At all events, the impression sometimes is given by appellants – and, on occasion, perhaps was sometimes given in the arguments advanced before us on behalf of the appellants in this case – that if only the fresh evidence may afford a ground for allowing an appeal then that of itself justifies its reception into evidence.  But demonstrably the consideration has to be wider than that: the ultimate question being whether it is necessary or expedient in the interest of justice to receive the evidence. </p>

That was a New Zealand case, whereby the underlying principles were broadly comparable to (even if not identical to) those set out in s.23 of the 1968 Act.  It was a striking case, in that expert evidence was, in the circumstances of that case, permitted to be received in evidence by the Privy Council even though its availability had for the most part been known to counsel at trial.  Mr Owen referred in particular to the observations of Lord Kerr at paragraph 120 of his judgment and to his observation in paragraph 128 that “where the new evidence presents a direct and plausible challenge to one of the central elements of the prosecution case, this factor [the one trial principle] ceases to be of such importance”.  Ultimately, however, as we see it, just where the balance lies in assessing what is necessary or expedient in the interests of justice has to be decided by reference to the particular circumstances of each case; and in this regard (as emphasised in <span style="font-style:italic">Chattoo</span> at paragraph 70), the appellate court must, among other things, be careful not to allow the trial process unjustifiably to be subverted. </p>

It will be recalled that the evidence given at trial was that, and the entire trial was conducted on the basis that, as at that date (4 March 2008) the CCTV time clock was some 22 minutes slow compared to real time.  The tests Mr Abraham was asked to perform were undertaken with a view to showing that the clock had been similarly slow – that is, 22 minutes slow – in the days and weeks before 4 March 2008.  If that was so, then that, as will be gathered, undermined the prosecution case of Baxter’s and/or Slade’s presence in the RS6 (as recorded) and corroborated the “alibi” arguments advanced by the defence.

Mr Abraham said that was to be explained by the CCTV system having been entirely switched off in the interim and the battery’s power in consequence having become degraded.  He did, however, agree in cross-examination before us that something must have happened to cause the clock to be 22 minutes late on 4 March 2008 – for example, as one possibility, interference by the user. 132.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>The appellants therefore say that Mr Abraham’s evidence is very important evidence.  If, as was the unchallenged evidence, the CCTV clock was indeed “out” by some 22 minutes on 4 March 2008 then the evidence of Mr Abraham goes positively to confirm the defence case at trial: that it would indeed likewise have been “out” by some 22 minutes in the preceding weeks and days.  And, if that were so, then such timings – by reference in particular to the CCTV showing Baxter in his Mercedes ML variously picking up or dropping off Slade at 2 Sandmoor Drive – demonstrated the defence point that Baxter and/or Slade simply could not have been in the RS6 on various of the occasions relied on by the prosecution at trial.  That, of course, was precisely the point Mr Vullo was seeking to make. </p>

This, however, was something he and his team only undertook, as we were told, after trial.  The consequence of that subsequent review was that two breaks in continuity were noted for 1 February 2008 – something Mr Greener attributed to the “overwriting” of the footage, since the recording runs continuously and after a period of time new material overwrites and obliterates earlier material on, as it were, a first in, first out basis.  No other breaks in continuity, however, were noted by him or his team in the period 1 February 2008 to 4 March 2008. </p>

Mr Greener had not been instructed at the time to make the further investigations to which he had alluded nor had he been asked to give evidence at trial.  The evidence thus was, or reasonably could have been, available.  It was submitted to us that the defence could properly have taken it – and it was said that Slade’s trial counsel did take it – that the Crown was not disputing that the CCTV time was around 22 minutes out throughout the relevant period.  But the Crown clearly had not accepted that as a fact.  Further, one can envisage that the defence tactically might prefer to make their points – as they did – by reference to inferences which they asserted might be drawn rather than, for example, exposing Mr Greener to the possibility of cross-examination – for example as to how the CCTV time came to be out by 22 minutes on 4 March 2008, with a potential suggestion that Slade (as enduser), and against the background evidence that the appellants were surveillance “savvy”, could have re-programmed the clock each day accordingly. </p>

From that comparison the expert witness forms an opinion as to how far the two recordings are consistent with having originated from the same speaker.  The usual methods of comparison are auditory analysis and acoustic analysis.  The former usually involves the expert witness repeatedly listening to the recording through highpowered headphones, and making a judgment.  The latter involves the application of computer software to make a computerised analysis which may include spectograms of specific sounds and formant measurements (that is, computerised measurements of resonance or areas of high energy in the recorded speech).   </p>

She also took the view that formant measurements cannot reliably be used, and could be misleading when the recording concerned had not been made in clear conditions free of interference.  She acknowledged that in this respect she is in a minority amongst practitioners in the field: the majority use a combination of auditory and acoustic analysis.   </p>

This involved considering – by intensive listening over many hours – the fine detail of articulation of vowel and consonant sounds, rhythm, pitch, intonation and voice quality (“timbre”), and marking on the scale how many of those features, and to what extent, were judged to be distinctively similar across the reference and questioned samples.   </p>

These differences give rise to acoustic differences: namely, differences in the structure of the resonance frequencies found across the speech of individuals.  ASR systems take the recorded voices of individuals, perform complex mathematical operations on them and reduce them to statistical models.  A statistical model is made of the known sample and the questioned sample, and the two are compared to produce a measure of the similarity or difference between them.  In order to determine whether the measure is indicative of their having come from the same or different speakers, the extracted features are also compared with a set of statistical models from a reference population of other speakers held within the system.  The characteristics of the reference population, including gender, language and recording conditions, should ideally be the same as those of the suspect’s recording.   </p>

A likelihood ratio of more than 1 means that the evidence would be more likely to occur if the speaker were the same; a likelihood ratio of less than 1 means that the evidence would be more likely to occur if they had come from different speakers.  </p>

He therefore had access to the Batvox system at the time of the trial of these appellants.  However, he took the view that at that stage it had not had sufficient testing with samples of English voices for him to use it in his forensic work.  He said that his subsequent testing included tests which showed the Batvox system to be sensitive to regional accents, but without large differences, and further testing in circumstances in which the quality of the sample recording was less clear.  The results of those tests, and testing of the system by others, led him to regard it as a system which could be used in casework by the end of 2010/start of 2011.  He has not, however, used the system in any of his forensic work other than this case.   </p>

From that population the software automatically chose a smaller subset on the basis of their statistical models matching most closely that of the suspect.  That subset could be as low as 20; but they had set the system so that a subset of 35 was used.  It was not altogether clear from their evidence which 35 sample voices the system chose for comparison with each of the appellants nor why a figure of 35 was selected.

Mr Harrison explained that the software’s reference population of 100 is not to be thought of in the same way as the database used for DNA analysis.   He said that the purpose of the reference sample is to assess how usual or unusual a feature of speech is, and so to show whether the score is what one would expect as between the questioned and the reference samples.  He said that there is no regional variation in vocal tracts, and therefore it was not particularly important to know where the persons in the reference sample came from.  He also said that their work had been peer-reviewed; and there had been no criticism of the size of the reference population.  </p>

He said that Batvox reflects, mathematically, the resonance characteristics of the vocal tracts.  That is the only aspect of the voice which is measured.  It is possible that two men may have similar vocal tracts, but differ for example in accent or pitch; therefore use of ASR alone “could give a false hit”.  He accordingly felt it better to use Batvox in conjunction with testing of other characteristics which Batvox was not designed to test.  He accepted in cross-examination that whereas in relation to his conventional testing he could explain to a jury what distinctive features he had found, in relation to Batvox he could only explain that the system identified differences in the geometry of vocal tracts: but he would not be able to say precisely what those differences were.   </p>

However, he conceded that in one of his tests, which compared the voice of Mr Harrison with the voice of Pearman, the result had been a likelihood ratio of 0.8, and he further conceded that he could not say whether a different system might have given, for example, a likelihood ratio of 1.1.   </p>

His objections are based on principle, not (as he openly accepted) on technical knowledge of the machine.  His objections therefore relate to all ASR systems.  The nub of his objection is that it is asserted that Batvox relates to the geometry of the vocal cord; but he regards that as speculation.  If it does so relate, then the properties of the vocal cords do not correspond directly to the sounds of speech.  He regards the presentation in mathematical form as spurious science, a misleading portrayal of quantitative data.  He was not satisfied there has been a sufficient testing of the Batvox system; because a proper evaluation would in his view require a comparison of hundreds of speech samples under conditions similar to those in this case.  Although he was much criticised by the appellants’ counsel on the grounds of lack of objectivity and of lack of expertise in relation to ASR systems, he was, in our view, entitled on the basis of his expertise in the field generally to set out those objections of principle for the court’s consideration.   </p>

We accept the submission of the Crown that it has not been sufficiently convincingly demonstrated in this appeal that a group of 20 or 30 speakers adequately covers all the possible features of the geometry of human vocal cords.  The outcome of the testing, in which a likelihood ratio of more than 1 was incorrectly found in over a third of the tests, does not inspire confidence.  Professor French gave evidence that he was not troubled by those results, because he was focusing on the use of the system to exclude, rather than include, a suspect.  We do not share that response.  Whichever way the error goes, it is an indication of fallibility which has not been satisfactorily explained.  In the context of evidence which is said to enable the categorical exclusion of a suspect, on the basis of a comparison with the voices of 20 or 30 speakers whose ages and accents may differ substantially from those of the suspect, such fallibility is troubling.  The fact that ASR systems are, as we were told, used for forensic purposes in other jurisdictions does not resolve those concerns; because we heard no evidence as the purpose for which the technology is used in those jurisdictions, or as to whether its use there is subject to any qualifications or limitations.  Further, such jurisdictions might have quite different rules of evidence compared to those pertaining in England and Wales. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, in a number of respects it seems to us that the evidence ultimately amounts to little more than a bare assertion that the software is so designed as to ensure the right results: with no explanation of how the court can be confident that is so.  For example, the selection by the software of the subset of voices from the reference population has not been explained; and no clear reason has been shown why the court should simply accept the assertion that the system has made the best choices.  It does not seem to us to be a sufficient answer to this concern to say that it is only proposed that ASR should be used in conjunction with other forms of analysis.  In this case, indeed, it is apparent that Professor French was caused to adjust his opinion by the results of the Batvox testing, which – in his words – took him beyond his original conclusion that the voice of M1 was very unlikely to be that of Mr Pearman.  It is also apparent that the Batvox results, amounting effectively to categorical exclusion or elimination with a fairly high degree of confidence, were inconsistent with the evidence of Mrs McClelland and with the views (so far as made known to this court) of Dr Holmes and Mr Duckworth.  The court therefore has to consider that it is being asked to admit what in actuality is advanced as decisive evidence, not simply supportive evidence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, we are concerned that counsel for the appellants were unable to give any satisfactory answer to the question of how evidence of this nature should or could appropriately be presented to a jury.   It seems that even a witness as distinguished as Professor French would in reality be telling a jury that the system had produced a certain result, with no real explanation of what features had contributed to that result and therefore no real scope for cross-examination.  How are the jury to evaluate such evidence?  What, for example, are a jury to make of the proposition that the results of the Batvox tests are 38 times more likely if the suspect was not the man whose voice can be heard in the questioned recording than if he was?   Are they to regard “38 times more likely” as significantly high or insignificantly low?   The absence of any satisfactory answer to such questions reflects the fact that the system simply produces a result, expressed in a mathematical formula (with the attendant danger of a potentially misleading appearance of certainty), but without any explanation of which features of similarity or dissimilarity have contributed to that result.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Fourthly, it seems clear from the evidence before this court that different ASR systems may produce different results from testing of the same samples, if only because one system is “more conservative” than another.  The submissions on behalf of the appellants were unable to satisfy us as to how a jury should approach such a conflict.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Lastly, making every allowance for a proper wish to test the system and for the fact that the outcome of this appeal was awaited, it was not clear why Professor French and Mr Harrison had not thus far used the Batvox system in any other trial or in other casework, if only for their own purposes and by way of a cross-check on their other analyses.  Professor French’s answers on this, when raised with him, were, with respect, hesitant.  Nor was it clear to us why the fortuitous availability of the recordings in the Peugeot car was regarded as a reason to use the system in this case even though it was not being used in other cases.  These troubling features of the evidence suggested a certain lack of confidence in the system, and in particular in the adequacy of the system’s own reference population.  This is only reinforced by the insistence that evidence based on such a system should only be used in conjunction with other auditory recognition/acoustic evidence. </p>

It might be said that, on one view, the handling count relating to the RS6 at all events potentially stood on a different footing from the other counts (indeed Pearman and Baxter at trial did not make any submission of no case to answer on that count).  But we note that the period specified in the indictment for that count was the same period as that specified for the count of conspiracy to murder.  Accordingly we do not think it right to reach any different conclusion on that count.  Nor did Mr Greaney invite us to. </p>
