Each specified a minimum term.  In each case there was psychiatric evidence before the court with a view to a judge considering making a hospital order under s.37 of the Mental Health Act 1983 (MHA) as amended with a restriction under s.41 of the same Act.  The sentencing judge did not make such an order, but each was subsequently transferred to hospital under a transfer direction made by the Secretary of State under s.47 of the MHA.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As we shall explain in more detail a major effect of the decision of a judge to impose an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment as opposed to making a hospital and restriction order under s.37/41 of the MHA is that the decision for release is made by the Parole Board, whereas if a hospital and restriction order had been made under s.37/41, the decision would be made, if the person is detained in England, by the First-tier Tribunal (Health, Education and Social Care Chamber (Mental Health) (FTT) or, if the person is detained in Wales, by the Mental Health Review Tribunal for Wales.  The difference between England and Wales is due to the fact that mental health in Wales is a devolved competence under Schedule 7 to the Government of Wales Act 2006.  However,  there is for the purposes of determination of the issues in such cases as these no material difference between the powers and duties of the FTT and the Mental Health Review Tribunal for Wales.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In each of the criminal cases the outcome which each of the appellants seeks to achieve is to have the release and the terms of release determined by the FTT under the MHA and care after release being provided through health services, rather than having a determination on release and the terms of release made by the Parole Board and the regime after release superintended by the applicable licence regime and supervision by the Probation Service.  The route by which each appellant seeks to achieve this objective is by appeal against sentence to the Court of Appeal Criminal Division in respect of the original sentencing decisions made in each of the cases in reliance on fresh evidence which each seeks to have admitted under s.23 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We therefore have to determine in each of these cases whether fresh evidence should be admitted and, if so whether, on the basis of that evidence, we can conclude that the sentence passed by the judge should have been a hospital and restriction order under s.37/s.41 or whether the indeterminate sentence of imprisonment passed was correct.  Our task therefore is to apply the principles set out in s.23 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 to the circumstances of these particular sentences. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The six cases were listed together for us to consider how courts should approach such cases.  Although, in the light of the abolition of the sentence of IPP, it will be the case that many fewer indeterminate sentences will be passed, the problems that have arisen in these cases will arise where a judge has to consider passing a life sentence and there is a psychiatric issue such as to give rise to the consideration of treatment in hospital.  As a consequence of these appeals, it seems to us that it would be helpful to give sentencing judges further guidance which, although primarily directed to indeterminate sentences, is also in large part applicable to all determinate sentences.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is plainly highly unsatisfactory for a court to be revisiting many years after sentence the issue as to whether a judge should, instead of passing an indeterminate sentence, have made a hospital and restriction order under s.37/s.41 in circumstances where the sole objective relates to the regime to determine release and conditions thereafter.  We were able to examine whether there was an alternative in the light of the further material and submissions made in the civil appeal.</p>

In contrast, the number of hospital and restriction orders under s.37/41 was 331, 334, 291 and 294 respectively and the number of transfers under s.47 was 450, 441, 458 and 455 respectively.

As some of the medical witnesses told us in the course of these appeals, it was often difficult to make an assessment in the conditions pertaining during the short period in which a psychiatrist interviewed the prisoner in prison.  A judge may therefore consider that making such an order may in some cases be the best way of proceeding.  However, for the reasons we give at paragraphs ii) and 56, judges should pause and think long and hard before making such an order.</p>

Furthermore the present system was discriminatory contrary to the provisions of Article 14.  An offender transferred under s.47/49 of the MHA was discriminated against, as consideration of release had to be by two separate judicial bodies.  The position had to be contrasted as an offender subject to an order under s.37/41 of the MHA would only have to satisfy a FTT and an offender sentenced to an indeterminate sentence would only have to satisfy the Parole Board.  There was no justification for having to satisfy two different judicial bodies before a prisoner transferred under s.47 of the MHA could be released.</p>

In such cases courts have imposed sentences of indeterminate or long sentences of imprisonment and the Secretary of State has often exercised the power under s.47 of the MHA.  Moreover where in view of the future risk an indeterminate or long determinate sentence is one of the options a court must consider for an offender with a mental disorder, it is often the better course for reasons we have given to impose such a sentence with the court making a hospital and limitation direction under s.45A for the treatment of the disorder or leaving it to the Secretary of State to make a transfer direction under s.47.</p>

Although there is almost invariably an interrelationship between the risks arising out of the mental disorder and the risks otherwise arising, the risks are different.  For example, a court may sentence an offender with a mental disorder to an indeterminate sentence because the court has taken the view that even if the mental disorder is effectively treated, the risk of the offender committing serious harm will remain.  If that offender is transferred under s.47 of the MHA to a hospital for treatment, the FTT may determine that he no longer needs to be detained in hospital as the treatment has been successful, but the Parole Board still has its function of determining whether it is still necessary for him to be detained for the protection of the risks that otherwise arise. </p>

On the evidence we have heard the interrelationship between the mental disorder and the other factors affecting risk to the public will need to be considered in determining both whether the mental disorder has been sufficiently treated to require detention under the MHA and whether the offender can be released under the test set out in the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997.  A clear illustration is the decision of the Parole Board made on 21 March 2013 in the case of Vowles which we set out at paragraph 75 below; the principal reason why the release of Vowles was refused was because the risks linked to her mental disorder had not sufficiently reduced. </p>

We do not agree.  As we have observed there is a close link between the two bases of detention of an offender with a mental disorder who is sentenced to an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment.  Although, for the reasons we have given, it is permissible to determine the issues separately, viewed both from the perspective of the protection of the public and the interests of the offender, the overriding common issue is whether continued detention is lawfully justified; that single issue is the issue which requires speedy determination.  Thus when those responsible for the material part of the process where it is said delay occurred are before the court – the Secretary of State and the Parole Board -, as they should always be, a court must look at the overall process (cf:<span style="font-style:italic"> In re D </span>[2008] 1 WLR 1499 at paragraphs 32 and 39) and decide whether there has been a speedy determination.</p>

This is a clear recognition of the need to act within a timescale that is applicable overall to the determination of the issues relevant to the lawfulness of the detention undertaken by both judicial bodies – the Parole Board and the FTT, as this time table has halved the timetable for determination where only the Parole Board is involved.  That period of 13 weeks, commencing immediately after the decision of a FTT (provided it has acted with proper despatch), seems to us to be what is required as an energetic and rapid approach (as described in and required by the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Rayner) v Home Secretary </span>[2009] 1WLR 310 at paragraph 21). </p>

It is self-evident that the obligation to make a speedy determination under Article 5(4) cannot be realised without active case management by the Parole Board.  The Parole Board has therefore adopted a process called “intensive case management”.  However the procedure so adopted, on the evidence before us, does not comply with its obligations, as active case management does not begin at the point of time at which the case is referred to the Parole Board, but only when the dossier of evidence is provided to the Parole Board by NOMS.  In cases such as the present where there has been a determination by the FTT, the obligation of the Parole Board is to undertake active case management from the moment of referral, in the same way as it is the duty of a court actively to manage its cases from the time cases are commenced before a court.  That is a duty that rests on the Parole Board; it is not dependent on an offender making the running on case management.</p>

It is difficult to see how it can properly and actively manage cases without such a power.  A party can of course apply for a witness summons to the High Court or County Court under CivPR 34.4, but that is of very limited relevance in enforcing compliance with directions, such as the service of reports.  It is plainly essential that the Parole Board be given such a power.  In the interim, as a significant number of the directions of the Board require action by the MoJ or NOMS, there is no reason, pending the introduction of such a power, why the MoJ and its agency NOMS cannot give an undertaking to the Parole Board to comply with its directions and appropriate administrative or disciplinary action taken by the MoJ and NOMS against employees who do not comply with the directions of the Parole Board.</p>

The conditions in (b) were not an important consideration.  For example, in <span style="font-style:italic">Howell</span> the defendant who had raped twice and was described as extremely dangerous, was suffering from schizophrenia and a serious personality disorder; he had been sentenced by the trial judge to life imprisonment.  The court observed that the trial judge had imposed that sentence to try and ensure that, if the defendant were ever to be released from treatment, he would return to prison and so be subject to the Home Office scrutiny before final release.

Under both regimes discharge on release is discretionary and in the hands of the Secretary of State, that is to say the Ministry of Justice.  In both cases regard is had in making the discretionary decision whether or not to release to danger.  In neither case is there any absolute right to release.  Secondly, release under both regimes is conditional and the defendant is subject to recall.  That said, there is an absolutely crucial difference between the two forms of regime.  Under an order for detention for public protection release is dependent upon the responsible authority being satisfied that the defendant is no longer a danger to the public for any reason and principally not at risk of relapsing into dangerous crime.  Under the hospital order regime release is dependent upon the responsible authority being satisfied that the defendant no longer presents any danger which arises from his medical condition.  Similarly, and critically, release under the detention for public protection regime is on licence and the licence can be revoked if the defendant shows that he remains a danger to the public from crime.  It is possible and indeed inevitable that the licence conditions will be designed, among other things, to prevent association with dangerous criminals.  Under the hospital order regime, recall is available but only if the defendant’s medical condition relapses.  Simple crime does not trigger a recall under the hospital order regime.</p>

The most important is the amendment to s.45A.  As we have noted in paragraph 20 above, the fact is that few hospital directions under s.45A have been made since the section was amended to take into account the criticisms made of it.  It is striking, as is apparent from the commentaries of the late Dr David A Thomas on the cases decided prior to the amendment (to which we have referred at paragraph 17), how it was anticipated that the section would, after amendment, address the issue so evident in many of the decisions of this court as to the appropriate balance between ensuring treatment in a hospital and protecting the public; see also his commentary on <span style="font-style:italic">Welsh</span> at<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>[2011] Crim LR 421.  That anticipation should have been realised, but, as the numbers make clear, it has not been.  The availability of such a direction is therefore a further factor which necessitates care when considering the observations in cases prior to 2008.  However, as the sentencing in each of the appeals before us took place before s.45A came into force, it is unfortunate that we have not been able to consider its application in any of the appeals.</p>

That is because it is more likely that such an illness may have a direct bearing on the offender’s culpability and because the illness is likely to be more responsive to treatment in a hospital.  In contradistinction it is more difficult to attribute a reduction in culpability to a personality disorder and at present individuals with severe personality disorders are less likely to benefit from hospitalisation.</p>

There are two major considerations.  First if an order is made under s.37/41 of the MHA, then if the disorder is in the result untreatable, there is a risk that the offender will remain in hospital for an indefinite period, as the FTT cannot release him if the risk to the public continues.  Psychiatrists are therefore concerned to ensure that they are not “stuck” with such an offender.  This is a serious risk which psychiatrists are anxious to avoid.  Second a range of treatment of those with personality disorders is available in a range of specialist prisons. </p>

In considering that wider question the matters to which a judge will invariably have to have regard to include (1) the extent to which the offender needs treatment for the mental disorder from which the offender suffers, (2) the extent to which the offending is attributable to the mental disorder, (3) the extent to which punishment is required and (4) the protection of the public including the regime for deciding release and the regime after release.

In the light of the amendments to s.45A, the observations of Hughes LJ which we have referred at paragraph ii) and the general evidence before us, we consider that a judge when sentencing must now pay very careful  attention to the different effect in each case of the conditions applicable to and after release.

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">If such a direction is not appropriate the court must then consider, before going further, whether, if the medical evidence satisfies the condition in s.37(2)(a) (that the mental disorder is such that it would be appropriate for the offender to be detained in a hospital and treatment is available), the conditions set out in s.37(2)(b) would make that the most suitable method of disposal.  It is essential that a judge gives detailed consideration to all the factors encompassed within s.37(2)(b).  For example, in a case where the court is considering a life sentence under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 as amended in 2012 (following the guidance given in in <span style="font-style:italic">Attorney General's Reference (No.27 of 2013), R v Burinskas </span>[2014] 1 WLR 4209), if (1) the mental disorder is treatable, (2) once treated there is no evidence he would be in any way dangerous, and (3) the offending is entirely due to that mental disorder, a hospital order under s.37/41 is likely to be the correct disposal.</p>

Although, as was the evidence before us, there are now a number of private providers to the NHS who have facilities at which offenders who are the subject of interim orders can now be held, the making of such an order has the consequence that as regards the victim of the crime there is no closure until the final order is made, there are significant costs to the general administration of justice in bringing a case back to court and there is acute pressure on the availability of secure beds.</p>

On 30 January 2012, they wrote a letter before action to the MoJ alleging a lack of expedition.  On 21 March 2012, these solicitors were granted legal aid funding and commenced on 26 March 2012 judicial review proceedings on the basis that the delay in listing the Parole Board hearing amounted to a breach of Article 5(4).  An urgent hearing was sought.  Leave was refused by Lang J on 27 March 2012.  However Criminal Defence MK Solicitors continued to act for Vowles in the proceedings before the Parole Board.</p>

However, as a result of what was described in the Parole Board evidence as an “administrative oversight”, the directions were not sent to the parties until 23 April 2012.  Criminal Defence MK Solicitors (who continued to deal with the hearing before the Parole Board) requested an extension of time to file representations; this was granted and the representations filed on 10 May 2012.</p>

The Tribunal expressed the view that all the evidence that they had heard reinforced their surprise that when sentenced she received a sentence of IPP rather than a hospital order under s.37/41.  Recall to prison would be completely inappropriate; it would be likely to undermine all the therapeutic work that had brought about the improvement in her health.</p>

The hearing of the judicial review took place before Irwin J on 18 and 19 March 2014.  He concluded that criticisms could be made of what had been done by NOMS and the Parole Board; a timetable should have been set in accordance with the revised policy for April 2012.  However, a faster timetable and the elimination of delays would have made no difference as it was essential to have proper evidence of Vowles’ progress after transfer to a low secure unit.  Nothing would have been gained by a hearing in April 2012, as Vowles would not have been at Plas Coch by then.  Once she was placed there in July 2012, it was apparent that time would be needed to assess her progress.  It was reasonable to have ordered a report from the responsible clinician in August 2012 and the responsible clinician, Dr Gupta, had asked for a further 3-4 months in November 2012 and the hearing had then been fixed for March 2013 – within that period.

She had also suffered a traumatic brain injury.  It was his view that the personality disorder met the criteria for a psychopathic disorder under s.37 (2) (a) (i) of the MHA as it then stood in 2008 as set out at paragraph 13 above but a hospital order could not have been made unless it was treatable.  Although Dr Heads had not actually said Vowles’ condition was not treatable, this could be implied from her report; that was an understandable conclusion given Vowles’ history.  Many psychiatrists would prefer to have such a person transferred under a s.47 order as there was a clear pathway to discharge that person from hospital by a return to prison after treatment.  In his view, Dr Heads had not given sufficient weight to the brain injury; the appropriate course would have been to make an interim order under s.38 with the likelihood that an order under s.37 would have followed, as it would have become apparent that that would have been the appropriate order. </p>

He did not consider that Dr Heads had carried out a full and thorough analysis of Vowles’ treatment needs, especially of symptoms related to Ms Vowles’ acquired brain injury.  He considered that if Ms Vowles had been detained under s.38, it would, as shown by what actually happened, have become apparent to her treating clinicians, after a period of assessment in hospital, that a s.37 Order would have been the correct disposal in 2008.</p>

The pre-sentence report made clear that Barnes admitted that he carried out the index offence because “he was desperate to ‘get money’ to fund his heroin use”.  His risk of reoffending and causing serious harm was high.  There were no constraints that operated to control his behaviour and he was unable himself to take control of it; he lacked “internal controls”.  Dr Ahmed in his psychiatric report recorded that Barnes had told him that on the day of the offence he “consumed 4-5 bags of heroin and described himself to be ‘sky high’ on drugs”.  Dr Ahmed concluded that Barnes “suffers from a mild depressive illness which…is not of a nature or a degree that warrants detention in hospital to receive medical treatment for his mental condition”.  In an addendum report dated 8 February 2007, Dr Ahmed considered that Barnes would benefit from psychological interventions to address his substance misuse, enhance his stress coping skills, to offer opportunities for employment or education and to treat any mental disorder.  All of this could be done within the prison and probation system.</p>

Professor Grubin told us that Dr Ahmed had not recommended a hospital order under s.37/41, as he had failed to explore fully Mr Barnes’ learning disability.  Dr Ahmed had not commented on the presence of either the personality disorder or learning disability.  Instead, he had focused on the question of whether or not Mr Barnes suffered from a mental illness which required treatment in hospital, concluding that while there was evidence of mild depression this was not of a nature to warrant a hospital order.  His narrow focus, however, meant that the possibility of exploring whether a hospital order should have been made was overlooked.  In his view a more thorough assessment should have been made under an interim order prior to sentence; if that had happened, it was possible that his response to medication and treatment might have been positive and justified the making of an Order under s.37/41 of the MHA; an interim order was the first step, as no doctor would have been prepared to suggest a hospital order unless he had been treatable. </p>

It is evident that Barnes had a serious criminal record; he was a heroin addict and this played a significant part in his offending.  It would not have been possible to  consider anything other than an interim hospital order and, on the evidence, it is uncertain what his response might have been.  Taking into account the fact that it cannot be said that the personality disorder and his learning disability as distinct from his drug addiction were the driving factors at the time, we are not persuaded that on the evidence before us a court could properly have made a hospital order.  </p>

His status within the gang was maintained by his willingness to engage in violent acts.  He showed no signs of guilt, remorse or empathy.  Reluctant to diagnose a personality disorder in one so young she nevertheless concluded that there were “worrying signs of psychopathic personality disorder”.  In her view Odiowei was “a dangerous young man who has many personality difficulties but is at present not ready to address his difficulties.  Consequently she recommended that if the court were to “impose a lengthy custodial sentence his mental state, including his personality, could be assessed again in a few years time but at present I feel this would be a fruitless exercise.”</p>

This, she thought was a marked feature, only capable of explanation by Odiowei when he had been sufficiently and consistently administered high doses of antipsychotic medication, in terms that he had held a paranoid belief that if he looked at the person interviewing him he would have to assault them.  The same prolonged period of assessment enabled her to conclude that many of the features suggestive of a personality disorder disappeared after medication and he, once a “hard man” in the hospital setting, had become vulnerable to bullying by others.  If there had been a personality disorder element in his presentation this had been relatively small in comparison to the psychosis.  In her opinion he would need long term management in the community once released, best afforded by the conditions that would attach following discharge from a s.41 restriction order.</p>

She was certain that “the years that [Odiowei] has subsequently spent at Ashworth have served to categorically confirm the presence of paranoid schizophrenia which was present from at least …teenage years” and that “it is very clear that he does not suffer from a psychopathic personality disorder.” She considered that “(f)rom the body of evidence that has been collected at Ashworth, it is clear that [Odiowei], as is common with many patients , was not forthcoming with regards to his symptoms and it is not unexpected that at a single interview Dr McInerney was not able to elicit the depth and range of psychotic symptoms..” and that [Odiowei’s] presentation which led Dr McInerney to suggest he had a personality disorder are equally valuable evidence that at the time of this interview he was indeed suffering from mental illness symptoms and had been at the time of his index offence.” She noted a significant number of patients motivated to conceal their paranoid delusional beliefs, whether through fear of psychiatric units, ridicule, and administration of medication or else the auditory hallucinations themselves warning against disclosure.  Odiowei was “floridly psychotic on admission” but subsequently controlled by medication, which had been managed to achieve maximum result and regularly administered alongside psychological therapies which has led to a “considerable improvement in [his] mental state.

Dr Higgins, too, was a distinctly impressive witness – analytical, objective and thoughtful.  She considered that life-long treatment would be necessary.  A s.41 order would best manage the risks presented by paranoid schizophrenia.  A named clinician in the community and adherence with medication would be priorities.

Over the course of two consecutive nights, 31 August 1996 and 1 September 1996, Irving set fire to six cars parked in private residential driveways.  In addition, in the early hours of the second day he threw a brick through the window of an occupied dwelling and subsequently phoned the occupants on several occasions making threats to the residents that he would “burn them alive” if they did not meet his demands.  It was subsequently noticed that a pair of curtains had suffered fire damage.  He was arrested during the course of that day.  He smelt of petrol, was carrying a can of lighter fuel and was found to have photographs of fire damaged property at his home address.  He denied the offences in interview, blaming another who had threatened him with being “burnt alive” if he identified him.  He had previous convictions for dishonesty and also for making nuisance telephone calls and “giving false alarm of fire”. </p>

Dr Joanne Holloway, a consultant forensic psychiatrist at the Prestwich Hospital, considered he had learning disabilities in the borderline range and that his state of arrested or incomplete development of mind included significant impairment of intelligence and social functioning associated with abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct.  Dr R P Ayra, a consultant psychiatrist in learning disabilities, considered him to be educationally subnormal with a mild degree of learning disability, problems with social functioning and a pathological maladaptive way of dealing with his problems.  Dr A C Wilson, a consultant forensic psychiatrist at the Prestwich Hospital, thought his range of intellectual impairments and the level of his functioning seemed to border on the formal learning disability range and that he otherwise agreed with Dr Holloway.  Dr O’Malley, a consultant psychiatrist at the Trafford General Hospital who saw Irving after conviction, rejected his self reported auditory hallucinations as genuine, found he had several features of an anti-social personality disorder and that whilst he “may have mild learning disabilities” he had been living independently and able to read to a limited degree so as to suggest that they were as a result of “social deprivation and poor education”.  Dr C Mulligan, a senior registrar in forensic psychiatry, relied on Dr Ayra’s opinion as to learning disability and reached the same conclusion as to the presence of a mental impairment as the other psychiatrists.  All psychiatrists interviewing Irving for the purpose of pre-sentence reports found him to be an unreliable historian given to fantasy, as had a community consultant psychiatrist in 1995 – who was also sceptical as to his self reported symptomology.  The two psychiatrists who interviewed him post conviction were each requested by Irving to “section him for two years”.  All five reporting experts concluded that he satisfied the criteria of mental impairment as defined by the MHA but that it was not of a nature or degree that required or would respond to inpatient psychiatric treatment.</p>

A “mild” mental retardation is used in comparison to moderate, severe and profound retardation and is a significant disability.

He concluded that Irving had a mild learning disability which was a lifelong condition, “fairly static”.  “The degree of [Irving’s condition] although less relevant than nature, has ameliorated with time/maturation and treatment ...” He considered that “with the benefit of hindsight” Dr Arya may have over-estimated Irving’s intellectual abilities and therefore considered him more in need of social support than specialist intervention.  Dr Obinwa noted the treatment received to have been “fairly comprehensive” and overall that Irving “has received great benefits from treatment”.  He concluded that the authors of the pre-sentence reports should have considered an assessment in hospital to investigate whether Irving was likely to respond to treatment.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In a supplemental report dated September 2003, Dr Halstead noted “the disagreement within the clinical team” as to whether the mental disorder is of a nature or degree which makes it appropriate for hospital detention or is “treatable”.  He expressed his opinion to be that the disorder was of necessary nature but not degree, suggesting that the hospital was preventing deterioration if not some degree of alleviation.  He did not consider it to be in the public or Irving’s interest for Irving to be returned to prison.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Dr Halstead prepared a supplemental report in May 2009.  He indicated his intent to “focus on the medical information, and defects therein, available to the Court at the time of sentence.”  In doing so apparently he considered it necessary to transcribe at some length his interview with Irving.  We have not found this long section of his report informative in any degree.  We note that whilst his criticism of  Dr Arya’s testing of Irving’s IQ or the results may have some substance,  he misquotes Dr Arya’s in ascribing to him the opinion that Irving was not mentally disordered.  In fact, Dr Arya found no evidence of “any active treatable mental <span style="text-decoration:underline">illness”</span>.  Further, Dr Halstead wrongly states that Drs Holloway and Mulligan “excluded [Irving] from classification within the meaning of s.1 of the MHA as it was at the time” – they did not.  Drs Holloway and Mulligan were concerned with nature, degree and treatability of the mental disorder.  This report is unhelpful and misinformed.He prepared a further report in June 2010.</p>

No thought appeared to have been given to the necessity of this court to be satisfied of the requirements of ss.37 (4) and 41(2) of the MHA in relation to the making of a hospital and detention order, if we were able to be persuaded to substitute the same in place of the sentence of life imprisonment.  The fact that Dr Halstead ‘agreed’ with the subsequent diagnoses of Drs Chowdhury and Obinwa lacked forensic worth.  He was not in any position of authority in relation to present day treatment, prognosis or management of Irving.  We regarded his suggestion that he would be able to speak on behalf of the hospital managers or present day responsible clinician on the basis of a telephone conversation to be totally unacceptable.  Consequently we adjourned the hearing. </p>

We have no doubt that the sentencing judge cannot be categorised as wrong in principle in imposing a life sentence on the basis of the facts of the case and the contents of the psychiatric reports then before him.  The Court of Appeal so decided in December 1997.  We are however mindful that the views of the reporting consultant psychiatrists were dependent upon what is now adjudged to be a faulty assessment of the degree of Irving’s learning disability.  On the basis of the evidence before us we are satisfied that his learning disability was underestimated.  Nevertheless we are conscious that a range of opinions has been expressed in the interim period as to the dubious necessity of in-patient treatment in the knowledge of updated IQ tests and the resultant identification of mild retardation rather than borderline learning disability.  That said, we note that  the majority of the latest expert opinions come down firmly in support of the view that the first instructed psychiatrists made a mistaken assessment of “treatability” at least in terms of preventing Irving’s further deterioration and should have recommended hospital and detention orders.  </p>

Dr Turner did not consider McDougall posed a significant risk to the general public but there was an ongoing risk to his mother.  He suggested that McDougall required pharmacotherapeutic treatment and psychological interventions that would most appropriately be delivered following transfer from prison after sentence under s.47 of the MHA.  He recommended a referral after sentence to the Oswin Unit at the Bamburgh Clinic, St. Nicholas Hospital in Newcastle, which is a specialist medium secure unit for treating patients with personality disorders.

However, following an exploration of his history, which included obtaining corroborative information from his mother, the diagnosis was revised; the current view being that he has suffered from schizophrenia or a schizoaffective disorder.  The records further confirm that his illness has responded well to treatment with antidepressant and antipsychotic medication with McDougall being fully co-operative with the treatment plan which has included supervised access in the community for a range of occupational, social and leisure activities, ongoing psychological treatment and support and medication.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Dr Barlow’s conclusion is that McDougall has suffered a major psychotic illness that appears to have developed gradually during his late teens and early twenties, against a background of genuine problems with delayed pubertal development, culminating in a florid psychotic episode in the months leading up to the offence.  There is strong evidence that McDougall was suffering from an acute schizophrenic episode at the time of the offence and, notwithstanding a long history of aggressive and threatening behaviour to his mother, this would have been a significant causal factor in the offence.  He has responded well to treatment.  Dr Barlow is of the opinion that, if there had been an assessment prior to sentence, as recommended by Dr Green and Mr Stuart, McDougall would have been classified as suffering from a mental illness that was significantly causative of the offence and which was susceptible to treatment and the most appropriate disposal would have been a disposal under ss.37 and 41 of the MHA.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Dr Stoddart’s conclusion is that, at the time of sentence, although the precise diagnosis was uncertain, both Dr Green and Dr Turner acknowledged that McDougall had a mental disorder within the meaning of the MHA that either definitely or most probably needed treating in hospital.  Dr Green, as supported by Mr Stuart, suggested further assessment before sentence.  Dr Turner did not explain why the use of the MHA after sentence was appropriate.  The clarification of McDougall’s diagnosis following his transfer to the Oswin Unit soon after sentence establishes that he had had psychotic symptoms for some time before the offence that were substantially linked to the events of that day.  He either had a depressive illness with psychotic features or a schizoaffective disorder, which is a disorder that shares equal features of schizophrenia and an affective mood disorder, which in McDougall’s case was depression.  Although there is also evidence of a personality disorder that is being treated within the Unit, the extremely significant cause and strong mitigating factor of the offending was the depressive illness with psychotic features or the schizoaffective disorder.  It is a chronic condition.  It is treatable.  It is being treated with antipsychotic medication that has been prescribed more or less continually since the date of the offence.  McDougall is co-operative and has responded well to treatment.  Under treatment, the risk to the public and particularly his mother is controlled.  Dr Stoddart’s conclusion, therefore, is that, at the time of the offence, McDougall did have a mental disorder within the meaning of the MHA that required treatment in hospital and that it would have been appropriate for orders under s.37 and 41 of the MHA to have been made.  Such orders remain available now.</p>

If that had been done, the judge would have been assisted by a clearer diagnosis and would have had a better understanding of the significant causal connection between McDougall’s mental condition and the offence.
