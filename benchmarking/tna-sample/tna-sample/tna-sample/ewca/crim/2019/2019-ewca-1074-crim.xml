The SFO has complained of inconsistency between the Judge’s approach to those applications and his decision in the Ruling.  In our judgment, nothing turns on that complaint.

Leave to appeal under section 67 of the 2003 Act will not be given by this court unless it is seriously arguable, not that the discretionary jurisdiction might have been exercised differently, but that it was unreasonable for it to have been exercised in the way that it was. No trial judge should exercise his discretion in a way which he personally believes may be unreasonable. That is not to say that he will necessarily find every such decision easy. But the mere fact that the judge could reasonably have reached the opposite conclusion to the one he reached, and that he acknowledges that there were valid arguments which might have caused him to do so, does not begin to provide a basis for a successful appeal, whether, as in the circumstances here, by the Prosecution or, when it arises, by the defendant."  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">With respect, we should not be taken as agreeing with this observation.  Like any “heavy” case, the burden on the Judge in summing-up would be considerable but we do not see this case as in any way exceptional.  Equally, we see no reason why this case should be at the “very outer limit of the capacity of any jury”.   Complex it may be but there is no good reason why it should be unduly complex. Its essence is relatively straightforward.  In any event, it is the task of the prosecution (primarily) to ensure that a case is presented in a clear and manageable form – the very helpful Bundle of “Graphics” made available to the jury (and to us) provides a very good example of how this can be done - and it is incumbent on the Judge to case manage it accordingly. So too, as a matter of professional good practice and their duty to the Court, such case management efforts are not to be frustrated by the Defence.  It is of the first importance that the prosecution of high-end cases of (alleged) fraud should not be deterred by undue complexity or cost; a failure to prosecute such cases, where it would otherwise be appropriate to do so, threatens the integrity of markets and is socially corrosive.  Under our system such prosecutions entail trial by jury and we see nothing in this case raising any doubts as to the suitability of this method of trial.  </p>

There was also before the Court an application by the solicitors, Quinn Emanuel, on behalf of a client involved in civil proceedings, for copies of the Ruling and, in addition, the parties’ submissions on the issue of no case to answer before Jay J.   In the event, both applications failed, save in respect of the BBC’s application for hard (but not electronic) copies of the documents it had sought. The Court’s ruling on this point is set out in the relevant Transcript (at pp. 14 and following) and does not require elaboration here.  Suffice to say that the Court was acutely conscious of the long-established principles of open justice (see, <span style="font-style:italic">Archbold, </span>2019, at paras. 4-3a and following) and will only depart from them when it is necessary to do so in the interests of the administration of justice.

The stated sum to be paid (of £42 million) for services to be provided is written in manuscript. That sum was to be paid in four instalments. The agreement does not specify the services to be provided in return for the £42 million; it states that Qatar Holding has agreed to provide ‘various services, as an intermediary, in connection with the development of our business in the Middle East’; and that the ‘type and scale of the services …will need to be refined by mutual agreement as our relationship develops further’.  ASA2 is hardly less short. The fee is stated at £280 million. It refers to the ‘great success of the agreement to date’. It then lists, in very broad language under six heads, the nature of some of the services stated to be provided: with again a statement that ‘these will need to be refined by mutual agreement’ during the period of the agreement. The sums payable by Barclays under ASA1 thus were £42 million. The sums payable under ASA2 were £280 million. It is one feature of ASA2 that its contractual period overlaps, for all but four months with the same contractual period stated in ASA1, albeit ASA2 was to last for an additional 28 months after ASA1 terminated. It is another feature of ASA1 that the four instalments payable under it were to be paid by 1 April 2009: that is, before the end of the contractual period; and all such instalments in fact were invoiced by the Qatari entities on 13 August 2008.

That <span style="font-style:italic">scienter</span> was clearly fixed “…from the moment you find a representation concerning their own acts which is incorrect, and which they must be taken to have known to be incorrect, and to have knowingly stated, and thereby to have misled the party complaining of the misrepresentation”.

We accept this SFO submission as to the analogous FSMA regime and, for this reason too, would not be at all attracted to ruling out the direct route in the circumstances of this appeal unless driven to do so – which we are not at all persuaded we are. For completeness, in this context, the SFO drew our attention to a number of FSMA sentencing authorities where no question had been raised as to the appropriateness of convictions of officers of companies for false or misleading statements published by the companies in question. It is unnecessary to refer to those authorities, given the absence of discussion as to the convictions but, if to a distinctly limited extent, they are supportive of the SFO’s submission.    </p>

In determining whether the signature of the SAs was capable of amounting to a false representation within s.2 of the Fraud Act, the factual nexus between the director signatory and the SAs would be relevant.   If, for example, the SAs were signed for and on behalf of Barclays by an individual director who knew that the warranties were false or misleading, having been involved in a conspiracy beforehand to make false representations, then the question of the applicability of Lord Hoffmann’s observations in <span style="font-style:italic">Standard Chartered </span>would call for careful consideration.

This is not so much procedural as substantive. The SFO’s reliance on the representations in the MCN and RCI Prospectuses creates no difficulty on the facts, and also recognises that it is the co-existence of the £280M with the statements made in them that engenders the falsity. The argument becomes strained and artificial in relation to statements made in the Warrants Prospectus because these were true even if the £280M is taken into account. The SFO relies on recondite statements in unaudited financial information referred to in the Warrants Prospectus which were introduced very late in the day.  This was not new information. There is really no evidence that JV and CL applied their minds to this, either generally or in the context of the DRLs signed on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November. Although I have no difficulty with the submission that for the purposes of s.5 of the Fraud Act 2006 specific intent can be proved by demonstrating that the directors must have appreciated that the extra £280M would falsify the MCN and RCI Prospectuses, I accept the defence submission that this becomes entirely artificial, indeed untenable, in relation to the Warrants Prospectus. This is a synthetic argument which aspires to transcend a legal difficulty.  My January 2019 ruling was correct, although not given for all the right reasons, and I will not reverse it.” </p>

To repeat, point 1 was that only Barclays could make the representations.  Point 2 went to the construction of s.2(2) of the Fraud Act. If wrong on both those points, Mr Purnell expressly disclaimed any “point 3”.  While he submits that it was “impossible to conceive” of the Board of Barclays “with its governance processes and….collective decision-making” being the agent through which individuals could make the indicted representations, that was a component of points 1 and 2, not a separate point 3.  It follows that matters relating to the factual context and the panoply of Barclays corporate governance such as those alluded to in the Davis LJ judgment (at [46] and, especially, [126]) are for any trial in this matter and (other than as part of points 1 and 2) do not comprise an objection at this stage to the applicability of innocent agency.  We understand the realism of Mr Purnell’s stance, especially having regard to the unavoidable factual content of any point 3 (along the lines we have outlined) – very much including the likely debate as to the improbability of Barclays being an innocent agent not exercising independent judgment (<span style="font-style:italic">cf.

Butt was charged under the <span style="font-style:italic">Falsification of Accounts Act 1875, </span>with making or concurring in the making of a false entry. Butt collected a sum of money from Sheppard for his employer; he did not, however, account for the full sum but only for a lesser amount. The entry of the lesser amount in his employer’s cash book was made by a clerk, Elford, who was an innocent agent in the matter.   Butt’s conviction was upheld, Lord Coleridge CJ saying this (at p.567): </p>

There is high authority that, where a man who knew of the falsity of the representation he was making made such representation by means of an agent who was ignorant of its falsity, there is no fraud…but that was in a civil action, and is, I believe a decision not universally approved of.  This is clearly a false entry as far as Sheppard is concerned.  It purports to represent receipts from the persons who have been entered as making payment of such receipts, and it seems to me clear that the prisoner either made it with the innocent hands of Elford, or concurred in the innocent hands of Elford making it. I am of opinion that this conviction was perfectly right, and must be upheld.” </p>

That scheme is emphasised by the fact that the new law, unlike the old, is <span style="font-style:italic">conduct</span> rather than <span style="font-style:italic">results</span> based.  Under s.2, there is no need to prove a result of any kind.  The principal aim is “to make the offence easier to prove…”: <span style="font-style:italic">Smith, Hogan and Ormerod</span>, at p.937.  Moreover, a further and likewise curious consequence of the Judge’s construction of s.2(2) is that while innocent agency would be excluded in respect of s.2(2), it would plainly remain available under s.2(5) where a representation is inputted to a system or device by way of “human intervention”. </p>

The <span style="font-style:italic">mens rea</span>, or mental element is made up of the requisite knowledge, dishonesty and intention.

Such a construction occasions no difficulty when no question of agency is involved and permits the legislation to give effect to Parliament’s intention of simplifying and widening the scope of the law in this area. It remains a strict construction and does no violence to the language of s.2, provided only that the language of the section is read in context and the section is construed as a whole. To reiterate, the contrary construction, by necessarily precluding the doctrine of innocent agency, narrows the ambit of the criminal law when contrasted with its scope prior to the passing of the Fraud Act. For that, there is simply no warrant. </p>

At this stage, the sole focus is on the strength of the prosecution case not the evidence, including good character, which may be adduced by the defendant. On any view, the credibility aspect of good character is irrelevant at the half time stage of a trial. The propensity aspect of good character is, perhaps, less straightforward.  Over and above the consideration that good character evidence forms part of the defence and not the prosecution case, caution should be exercised in placing reliance on the propensity aspect of good character, given that the direction ultimately given may have to be tailored in the light of all the trial evidence.  We would not, however, accept that it is impermissible in all cases to have regard to propensity when considering the inherent probability of the prosecution case.  Indeed, Mr Brown QC for the SFO accepted that it was arguably relevant in that context, and that was the context in which the Judge was referring to good character (see, for example, the reference to good character at [284] in a section headed “Inherent Probability”).    </p>

That evidence was to the effect that Mr Agius apparently had no recollection of the relevant Board meetings and had seemingly forgotten that advisory services for a fee of £115m had been raised at the 26 October 2008 meeting. Viewed in that light, we are unable to treat the Judge’s comment, essentially confined to Mr Agius’ <span style="font-style:italic">moral outrage</span>, as making good this SFO criticism.  We deal separately (below) with the inferences to be drawn from JV’s silence with regard to the £280M. </p>

Having regard to the individual perspective of JV, if ASA2 was not a sham on 26 October, when the Board was apprised of a payment in the region of £115M or £125M, how, it might be said, did it become a sham when a payment of £280M was agreed on 31 October?  <span style="font-style:italic">That</span>, in reality and as it seems to us, was the timing question with regard to JV which the Judge was addressing (and to which we return below).  </p>

These give us pause for concern; the failure to mention the significantly increased figure to Mr Agius (with whom, as already underlined, JV was in close contact) was striking; so too was the failure to ensure that the £280M was mentioned to the Board and, indeed, recorded in the Minutes, as soon as possible after the 31 October agreement.    Our concern is heightened by the Judge’s mistaken interpretation (at [582]) of the Board Minutes of 27 October; it seems clear that the fees in question were not the ASA2 fees but related instead to the placees.  Still further, we have not, in all this, overlooked JV’s lack of attention to the detail of the services to be provided by the Qatari entities or to the basis for the £280M fee.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the upshot, we find Issue IV finely balanced.  That, of itself, is a matter of no little significance, having regard to the relevant test under s.67(c). In the event, we are not persuaded that (the error at [582] apart), the Judge failed to have regard to any significant evidence or had regard to evidence which he should not have done.  Ultimately and whatever our reservations, the Judge was in a far better position to reach an overall conclusion as to whether that evidence provided a sufficient case to be left to the jury than this Court.  It is possible that another judge might have reached a different conclusion, but that is not the test.  The SFO has to show that the conclusion to which the Judge came was not within the range of reasonable conclusions open to him.  Having carefully considered the parties’ extensive written and oral submissions, and the limited evidence which we have been shown, we do not consider that the SFO can overcome this “high hurdle”. </p>

However, a trial can proceed against RJ, TK and RB on Count 1 and RJ on Count 2. In all the circumstances, that trial should proceed before a different High Court Judge, to be designated by the President of the Queen’s Bench Division. </p>
