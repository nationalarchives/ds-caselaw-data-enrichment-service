The indictment had been severed for three (Khatib, Nabeel Hussain and Uddin); their trial is described at paragraph 24 below.  The Crown’s primary case as opened in relation to count 1 was that all had been engaged in a conspiracy to murder by detonating IEDs on transatlantic airliners.  The alleged roles were as follows: Ali was the leader of the conspiracy, Tanvir Hussain was his right hand man and Sarwar was the expert at making the IEDs;  Islam, Savant, Zaman and Arafat Khan were to carry the devices aboard and die with the passengers; they had made so called “martyrdom” videos.  It is not necessary to identify the case against Gulzar as he was acquitted.  Count 2 was intended to reflect an alternative case, namely a conspiracy to place bombs that might damage aircraft. </p>

However in the course of the submissions of no case made on behalf of Islam and Zaman, she raised the question of whether the jury should be entitled to make a finding which indicated whether, in respect of each defendant, the jury accepted the Crown’s case of murder through the detonation of IEDs on aircraft or a conspiracy to murder in general (such as murdering a small number in a café).  As she developed her submissions, she contended that justice required a distinction be made.  Calvert-Smith J indicated that if the counts went before the jury in their current form, the defence might seek to ask him to ask the jury for a special verdict or the basis of any verdict of guilty – conspiracy to murder by detonating IEDs on aeroplanes or murder in general.  His view was that this would be an issue that had to be resolved in the light of all the evidence. </p>

This was an argument that was only barely mentioned before Henriques J in the hearing which led to his ruling of 7 November 2008.  As it is a pure point of law and, if correct, would make the verdict in the second trial one that was not open, it was an argument that we consider these appellants were entitled to advance.  In contradistinction to the next issue, stay for abuse of process, the court has no discretion; the application of the principle is mandatory; for example in <span style="font-style:italic">R v G</span> [2001] 2 Cr App R 615 the fact that counsel had agreed in terms not to raise <span style="font-style:italic">autrefois acquit</span> was irrelevant. </p>

The speeches in the House trace the history of the plea and discuss its relationship to abuse of process.  It was made clear that its precise ambit and limited scope had been developed in the cases and should not be reformulated in more general terms, as the citation from the speech of Lord Devlin (set out below) makes clear.

The word offence embraces both the facts which constitute the crime and the legal characteristics which make it an offence.  For the doctrine to apply it must be the same offence both in fact and in law …  I would add one further comment.  My noble and learned friend [a reference to Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest] in his statement of the law, accepting what is suggested in some dicta in the authorities, extends the doctrine to cover offences which are in effect the same or substantially the same.  I entirely agree with my noble and learned friend that these dicta refer to the legal characteristics of an offence and not to the facts on which it is based see <span style="font-style:italic">Rex v. Kendrick and Smith</span>.  I have no difficulty about the idea that one set of facts may be substantially but not exactly the same as another.  I have more difficulty with the idea that an offence may be substantially the same as another in its legal characteristics; legal characteristics are precise things and are either the same or not.  If I had felt that the doctrine of <span style="font-style:italic">autrefois</span> was the only form of relief available to an accused who has been prosecuted on substantially the same facts, I should be tempted to stretch the doctrine as far as it would go.  But, as that is not my view, I am inclined to favour keeping it within limits that are precise.”</p>

For example, in relation to assaults, there can be a common assault, an assault occasioning actual bodily harm, an assault on a police officer in the execution of his duty, racially aggravated assault, a malicious wounding or a wounding with intent.  These offences carry different penalties and, where there is a dispute as to the level of conduct or the intent, the Crown can, by charging different offences, enable the jury to determine, as triers of fact, the essential basis of fact upon which the judge will sentence.  It is of course for the Crown, subject to the view of the court, to consider the offences with which it is appropriate to charge a person, as an indictment with many alternative counts seldom makes the trial one that is easy to conduct or in the interests of justice.  </p>

He was tried and convicted on an indictment containing a single count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.  At trial he had given evidence that he did not know the victim was a police officer; he had reacted in self defence when someone had put his arm over him.  The case had been left to the jury on the basis that they could convict him if they were sure that his actions in striking out were unlawful because he knew the victim was a police officer or, if he did not know that, he had over-reacted.  The defendant contended he should have been sentenced on the basis that he did not know the victim was a police officer.  In this court Tasker Watkins LJ made clear that the court wanted to do nothing to encourage judges to depart from usual and proper practice (followed in that case) of refraining from inviting juries to explain their verdicts.

He was convicted on the first count of stealing from the handbag.

The jury were directed that they could convict on the count that was in the indictment as long as they were sure and satisfied as to any wilful neglect at any time within the period specified.  She was convicted.  The judge took the view that it was for him to make a ruling as to the appropriate factual basis for sentencing, relying upon the evidence that he had heard.  This court observed, not having heard argument from the Crown, that, “An amendment to the indictment could easily have been made so as to secure a finding of the jury on the point”.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">The judge’s function in resolving the factual issues is plainly evident after verdicts in trials of conspiracies.  The general practice of the Crown is to formulate a conspiracy in broad terms; a jury is simply concerned to decide whether the person was a party to a conspiracy formulated in broad terms.  It is for the judge, who hears the trial, to determine when he comes to sentence what role each played in furthering it.  To take the common example of a conspiracy to import drugs into the United Kingdom; the Crown would ordinarily charge those indicted as parties to a conspiracy to import drugs; those indicted might include a courier who has participated in one journey, more senior persons within the hierarchy and the one or two persons who were at its centre.  It is sufficient for the Crown to obtain a conviction to prove each was a party to the conspiracy to import; it is for the judge, at the end of the trial, to determine whether a particular defendant is a courier or at the apex of the conspiracy and therefore whether he may receive a sentence of five years or one of 25 years.  This practice was approved at least as long ago as 1973 when this court made clear in <span style="font-style:italic">Greenfield </span>(to which we refer in more detail at paragraphs 43 and 47) that the judge had to assess for the purpose of sentence what part each had played and the importance of that part. </p>

However, in the light of the issue raised at the end of the prosecution case, as we have explained at paragraphs 10 and following, it also put forward what it contended before us was a different conspiracy with an agreement on a more general course of conduct to meet the possibility that the jury might not find the specific agreement proved.  </p>

It seems to us therefore that if there is a different, but less serious conspiracy, an acquittal on the count charging the more serious does not prevent a conviction on the count charging the less serious or vice versa.

The jury rejected that plea.  He was tried and found guilty.  The overt acts proved by the prosecution at the trial in Manchester were explosions in Manchester and no other part of the United Kingdom.  The overt acts to be proved in the trial in Birmingham were explosions in Birmingham and its environs and not in Manchester or any other part of the United Kingdom.  Before the jury and on appeal it was Coughlan’s case that the prosecution were alleging on each occasion the same conspiracy, namely to cause explosions in the United Kingdom, including Manchester and Birmingham and that he had already been convicted of this conspiracy in his trial at Manchester.  The answer of the Crown was that although the indictment in each case alleged a conspiracy to cause explosions in the United Kingdom, in deciding whether there was one conspiracy or two it was permissible to have regard to the nature of the overt acts relied upon by the Crown.  The trial judge directed the jury that the conspiracy to plant bombs in Manchester and the conspiracy to plant bombs in Birmingham were two distinct conspiracies.  This court considered that this was too robust a direction, as it was for the jury to decide whether there was one conspiracy or two.  However the jury could have come to no other conclusion.

The prosecution was alleging that these appellants and the other accused had had a common purpose to cause explosions.  All the accused in their different ways challenged this basic allegation of a common purpose; and they did so by submitting that the evidence revealed the possibility that those charged may have had in relation to some of the incidents purposes which were not common at all.  What they were doing was challenging the existence of the conspiracy as charged, which is but a way of saying that they were denying that the prosecution had proved their case.  A charge which is not bad for duplicity when the trial starts does not become bad in law because evidence is led which is consistent with one or more of the accused being a member of a conspiracy other than the one charged.  Such evidence may make it impossible for the prosecution to establish the existence of the conspiracy charged.  <span style="font-style:italic">Griffiths</span> was such a case.  At the end of the prosecution’s case the evidence may be as consistent with the accused, or some of them, having been members of a conspiracy which was not the one charged as with the one charged.

But if at the end of the prosecution’s case there is evidence on which, if uncontradicted, a reasonably minded jury could convict the accused, or two or more of them, of the conspiracy charged despite evidence of the existence of another conspiracy, then the trial judge should let the case go to the jury. ” </p>

Count 1A charges an agreement to commit murder.  On the basis of that count, the original count in the indictment, all it would have been necessary for the Crown to prove was an agreement to pursue a course of conduct which would necessarily have involved the commission of murder.  It mattered not for the purpose of that count how the murder was committed.  Count 1, on the contrary, charged an agreement to commit murder by the detonation of IEDs on board transatlantic passenger aircraft.  It seems clear to us that on a simple reading of the indictment, these were different agreements.  There was a conspiracy to murder and a distinct conspiracy to murder in a particular way.  As was apparent from the way in which some of the appellants had argued their submission of no case to answer before Calvert-Smith J, they may have been parties to an agreement to cause an explosion but they were not parties to an agreement to detonate IEDs on board transatlantic passenger aircraft.  There is in our view a distinct difference between the two agreements; although each may have involved the commission of the offence of murder, they were distinctly different agreements as to the method and scale of the murder to be carried out.  They were therefore different in fact and in law for the purpose of <span style="font-style:italic">autrefois convict.  </span>We therefore consider, applying <span style="font-style:italic">Greenfield,</span> that that should be sufficient to decide the question.  However, we have gone on to consider what happened at the trials particularly in the light of the submission made by the appellants that we should focus on the way the case was advanced and put before the jury.</p>

There is a feature of our trial system which is sometimes overlooked or taken for granted. The collective experience of this constitution as well as the previous constitution of the court, both when we were in practice at the Bar and judicially, has demonstrated to us time and time again, that juries up and down the country have a passionate and profound belief in, and a commitment to, the right of a defendant to be given a fair trial. They know that it is integral to their responsibility. It is, when all is said and done, their birthright; it is shared by each one of them with the defendant. They guard it faithfully. The integrity of the jury is an essential feature of our trial process. Juries follow the directions which the judge will give them to focus exclusively on the evidence and to ignore anything they may have heard or read out of court. No doubt in this case Butterfield J will give appropriate directions, tailor-made to the individual facts in the light of any trial post the sentencing hearing, after hearing submissions from counsel for the defendants. We cannot too strongly emphasise that the jury will follow them, not only because they will loyally abide by the directions of law which they will be given by the judge, but also because the directions themselves will appeal directly to their own instinctive and fundamental belief in the need for the trial process to be fair.” </p>

Not every public comment about a particular case, however outspoken, will seriously interfere with the rights of the accused.  That may be so for example, where there is likely to be a long gap between the publication and any future trial, that it is unlikely to weigh heavily in the minds of the jury when they come to hear the case (“the fade factor”).

However, as we have set out at paragraph 9 above, the nature of the defences advanced by the defendants was not clear as none had served a meaningful defence statement.  As we have explained, it certainly was the position that, by the end of the Crown’s case, the Crown, by seeking the amendment to the indictment, had accepted the possibility that there could be a conviction on the basis that some of the defendants had engaged in a conspiracy to murder and not in a conspiracy to murder through the detonation of IEDs on transatlantic aircraft.  From that time on the position of the Crown was clear.  We reject the submission that the Crown was being opportunistic.

On his conviction for manslaughter this court held that the conviction should be set aside because her evidence was irrelevant to the Crown’s case save to the extent that she saw the appellant at the scene of the attack.  The evidence was extremely prejudicial and no direction by the judge, however strongly worded, could have undone the effect of that evidence.

The appellants had been acquitted of conspiracy to murder on the basis that they had agreed to murder by detonating IEDs on transatlantic aircraft.  It was inevitable that much of the evidence would have been the same, but the effect of the acquittal was that the Crown could not allege and could not call evidence to show that these appellants had been party to an agreement to detonate IEDs on transatlantic aircraft.  Provided that that was done, and it is not suggested it was not done, then there was no reason why it was not possible to call the evidence relevant to the conspiracy charged in count 1A and give the jury a direction as to how to treat the acquittal on count 1. </p>

We accept that it may have been better if the judge had not used the technical phrase in respect of the effect of the acquittal “they are not guilty in law of it”, but as in <span style="font-style:italic">Byrne</span> had simply said they were innocent of that charge.  However that can make no difference; it was technically correct.  What matters is whether the jury understood the effect of the acquittal.  In our judgement that was made very clear – they had not participated in the plan to detonate IEDs on transatlantic aircraft.  Their acquittal on count 1 was explained on the basis that they did not share the specific <span style="font-weight:bold">intention</span> to carry out the agreement to murder in the specific way of detonating IEDs on aircraft.  In our judgement, although for the reasons we have given we do not consider that analysis correct, nonetheless the jury were told of the essential distinction.  Their non participation in the plan to detonate IEDs on transatlantic aircraft was put as a matter of intention rather than agreement, but we cannot think that that distinction, important though it is in law, can have made any material difference to the factual issue before the jury and the way in which they were to treat the acquittal on count 1.  The jury had to determine whether the appellants were party to a conspiracy to murder; in making that determination, the jury were told that by reason of the acquittal, they were not guilty of seeking to do so by detonating IEDs on aircraft.  As long as those two matters were clear, and we believe they were, we do not consider that the way in which Holroyde J said he would direct the jury or directed the jury in any way affected the question of whether it was in the interests of justice to hold a second retrial or the fairness of that trial. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">In our view, Holroyde J exercised the discretion in relation to whether there could be a fair trial in accordance with the correct principles.  He carefully weighed up the considerations and came to a view that was plainly open to him.  We have had the advantage not open to the trial judge of standing back and looking at the arguments and the considerations together as opposed to having to consider the arguments as they were developed and ruled on at different occasions.  We are satisfied that the judge not only reached a decision that was open to him, but one that was plainly correct.  It is, in our view, also relevant to the interests of justice that it was at the instigation of the appellants in this case, particularly Zaman and Arafat Khan (as we have set out at paragraph 11) that the jury were asked to decide whether the appellants had agreed to being involved in detonating IEDs on transatlantic aircraft.  Weighing up all the factors, despite the long period of time that the two previous trials had taken and the harsh conditions of pre-trial detention and the publicity surrounding the two verdicts, we have concluded that the interests of justice required a second re-trial.  </p>

Before reaching their decision, they will have reflected on the arguments they have heard advanced by both, and in a multi-handed case by all the parties at trial, and then, in the privacy of their retiring room, the opinions and views expressed by each member of the jury.  This is, as counsel for the Crown, Mr Brooke, put it in his written submission, a "dynamic" process.  Of course the jurors who have been discharged cannot be, and are not responsible for the eventual verdict.  But until their discharge they are entitled to express their views, favourable or adverse to the prosecution or to some parts of the prosecution case, or favourable or adverse to the defendant or some part of the defence case.  As the discussions proceed, the views expressed at an earlier stage may well develop and change.  It is a continuing process.  But while jurors are properly empanelled, the views of each and every one of them are entitled to the same careful analysis and respect as those expressed by any juror, including jurors who are later discharged.  On discharge they cease to have any responsibility for the verdict, but there is no reason to imagine that the views expressed at a time when they believed that they would be responsible for the verdict were expressed any less conscientiously and responsibly than those of any other juror.  Those views become part of the fabric of opinions under consideration, impossible to isolate and compartmentalise.  It would therefore be wholly unrealistic for a direction to be given to the remaining members of the jury to ignore the views expressed on any subject by the departed jurors.  What matters is that the discussion between the remaining jurors will continue to ebb and flow and, on refection, the views expressed by the departing juror (or jurors) would have been examined and either accepted wholly or in part, or rejected wholly or in part, or treated as irrelevant by the remaining jurors in the course of reaching the decisions to which their conscience impels them.  The eventual verdict, however, is no more than that of the jurors who have been party to it as a result of the process of discussion in the privacy of the jury room.  The views expressed by the departed jurors will only be relevant to the extent that the remaining jurors will have adopted or assimilated those views as their own.” </p>

Barot was a terrorist who had pleaded guilty on a written basis of plea to the preparation of proposals for the purpose of being submitted to Al Qaeda for mass murder in both the United States and the United Kingdom.  The most detailed proposal was for what was known as the “gas limos project” - a proposal for packing limousines with gas cylinders and explosives and detonating them in an underground car park.  Although the plan, if executed, would have resulted in a very large number of deaths, the plan was a long way from being put into effect at the time Barot was arrested.  Before this court there was evidence that the “gas limos project” was amateurish and would never have given rise to a mass cumulative explosion.  It would therefore not have had the consequence which Barot had hoped for.  The court in the light of that and after a review of the principles reduced the sentence to a minimum term of 30 years. </p>

In contrast, Khatib had spent 5 months with Ali in Pakistan in 2005; the only reason the judge could deduce for that was for him to become, as he did, Ali’s lieutenant.  On his return, he had set up e-mail accounts, did research into detonators and bombs for the purpose of embarking with Ali on the making of bombs; because of his arrest for a driving offence and for possession of cannabis, he was considered too much of a risk to participate actively between May and July 2006.  He was then involved actively from July when he visited 386A Forest Road in Walthamstow and helped Ali and Tanvir Hussain.  The judge concluded that all the mitigating and aggravating factors of his participation compared with that of Islam cancelled each other out, save for Khatib’s youth; Khatib had only been 19 when he became involved whereas Islam had been 28. </p>

He was 25 years old at the time and when he purchased the equipment to which we have referred at paragraph 143; the judge was satisfied he must have known it was intended for use for the purposes of the conspiracy; he had gone on to make two visits to the flat at 386A Forest Road, Walthamstow. </p>
