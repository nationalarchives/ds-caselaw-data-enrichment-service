The complaint alleged that Colonel KL was responsible for torturing the complainant at the Gorusinghe Army Barracks during the civil war which took place in Nepal from 1996 until 2006 and which involved an armed conflict between government forces and Maoist fighters. In his complaint Janak Raut stated that a patrol of armed security forces arrested him at his farm and took him to the Bindhyabasini Battalion headquarters, Chandruta. He was kept in a room, blindfolded, beaten by three or four soldiers for about four hours and electrocuted on his ear. During this time he lapsed in and out of consciousness. He was repeatedly told that he was about to be executed and he was deprived of food and water. He was forced to sign various documents which he was not allowed to read. He complained that this pattern of behaviour continued, periodically, over the next 17 days.  </p>

He was also required to sign a document waiving any right to make a complaint and he was told that he would be killed if he made any complaint regarding the torture inflicted upon him.

Article 14(4) of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal has made a mandatory constitutional provision that no torture must be inflicted on a person detained in the course of investigation or trial and that any torture must be compensated if such torture is inflicted. Similarly, Article 7 of the ICCPR, 1996 and Article 1 of UNCAT, 1984 has prohibited torture by defining it as a criminal offence. Nepal has already ratified these conventions and they apply equivalent to Nepalese law according to the provision contained in section 9 of Treaty Act, 2047. Similarly, section 3(1) of the Act makes a clear provision that a person detained in the course of an investigation or inquiry or in any other manner must not be tortured. Nevertheless, severe torture and inhuman and degrading treatment was inflicted on me by the Respondents while I was in their custody. Consequently, I have suffered irreparable loss due to the problems I am having these days – I have pain my knee, back pain, problems with sleeping and sitting, loss of memory and anxiety attacks when I see army and police personnel.  </p>

The torture has left a severe impact on my mental, physical as well as intellectual state. Due to the Respondent’s acts of inflicting severe physical and mental torture, contrary to the constitution as well as existing national and international legal provisions, I have suffered irreparable physical and mental loss. Thus, I make this complaint seeking order for compensation amounting Rs 100,000.00 pursuant to section 6(1) of Torture Compensation Act and the maximum compensation by assessing reasonably the physical and mental loss I have suffered now and am likely to suffer in the future; and for an order for necessary departmental action to the Defendant pursuant to section 7 of the Act.  </p>

In his judgment he recited the basic facts as set out above. He recorded that the evidence given by Colonel KL was to the effect that the complainant was involved in terrorist and destructive activities and that he was taken for interrogation by Joint Security Forces and was afterwards released. Colonel KL denied that the complainant had been subjected to any physical or mental torture. A witness for the complainant, however, gave evidence corroborating his version of events. He explained that when he went to the barracks to make enquiries in relation to the complainant he was told that Janak Bahadur Raut “might have died”. Shortly thereafter the complainant was released.  </p>

They were taken to a special task force base camp. On the same day a protest was staged outside the base camp in support of Mr Hussein and the other men arrested. In consequence, all of the men were transferred to the Gorusinghe Barracks on the afternoon of 14 April. They remained blindfolded and handcuffed. On arrival at the barracks Mr Hussein heard instructions being given by a person he presumed was in charge of the barracks to take statements from the detainees. If they did not co-operate they were to be killed. Mr Hussein, still blindfolded, was made to walk to a wooded area and to lie upon the ground. He was then asked questions about the Maoists and was beaten severely including upon the soles of his feet with either iron bars or wooden sticks. In consequence his ankle was broken. When the beating ceased he was unable to stand and he was dragged back to the holding area. The next day he was visited by an Army Doctor who examined him and gave him medication to relieve the pain. However he was questioned again about the Maoists a few days later and was beaten, once again, upon the soles of his feet, kicked and had cigarettes extinguished on his hands.  </p>

He stated that he was taken to see Colonel KL who interrogated him. During these bouts of questions he was not hit but Colonel KL would instruct his soldiers to take Mr Hussein away and beat him to encourage him to speak. After approximately six months Mr Hussein was transferred to the district prison at Taulihawa and subsequently to Kathmandu Central Prison. Whilst he was in the district prison at Taulihawa Mr Hussein asked his brother to file a case at the Appeal Court at Butwal in connection with his unlawful kidnapping and detention. The court ordered the district court at Taulihawa to release him. He was released but was rearrested immediately upon departing from the court and taken back to district police headquarters and returned to prison. Mr Hussein estimates that he was detained for a total of 14 months. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.26in;margin-right:1.00in">“Finally, and to my mind decisively, if the implementation of a torture regime is a public function giving rise to immunity ratione materiae, this produces bizarre results. Immunity ratione materiae applies not only to ex-heads of state and ex-ambassadors but to all state officials who have been involved in carrying out the functions of the state. Such immunity is necessary in order to prevent state immunity being circumvented by prosecuting or suing the official who, for example, actually carried out the torture when a claim against the head of state would be precluded by the doctrine of immunity. If that applied to the present case, and if the implementation of the torture regime is to be treated as official business sufficient to found an immunity for the former head of state, it must also be official business sufficient to justify immunity for his inferiors who actually did the torturing. Under the Convention the international crime of torture can only be committed by an official or someone in an official capacity. They would all be entitled to immunity. It would follow that there can be no case outside Chile in which a successful prosecution for torture can be brought unless the State of Chile is prepared to waive its right to its officials immunity. Therefore the whole elaborate structure of universal jurisdiction over torture committed by officials is rendered abortive and one of the main objectives of the Torture Convention - to provide a system under which there is no safe haven for torturers - will have been frustrated. In my judgment all these factors together demonstrate that the notion of continued immunity for ex-heads of state is inconsistent with the provisions of the Torture Convention.  </p>

The official or governmental nature of the act, which forms the basis of the immunity, is an essential ingredient of the offence. No rational system of criminal justice can allow an immunity which is coextensive with the offence.” (p. 277D-E) “My Lords, the Republic of Chile was a party to the Torture Convention, and must be taken to have assented to the imposition of an obligation on foreign national courts to take and exercise criminal jurisdiction in respect of the official use of torture. I do not regard it as having thereby waived its immunity. In my opinion there was no immunity to be waived. The offence is one which could only be committed in circumstances which would normally give rise to the immunity. The international community had created an offence for which immunity ratione materiae could not possibly be available. International law cannot be supposed to have established a crime having the character of a jus cogens and at the same time to have provided an immunity which is coextensive with the obligation it seeks to impose.” (p. 278A-B) </p>

Nor would I accept that it was an implied term of the Torture Convention that former heads of state were to be deprived of their immunity ratione materiae with respect to all acts of official torture as defined in Article 1. It is just that the obligations which were recognised by customary international law in the case of such serious international crimes by the date when Chile ratified the Convention are so strong as to override any objection by it on the ground of immunity ratione materiae to the exercise of the jurisdiction over crimes committed after that date which the United Kingdom had made available.” (p. 248B-D) </p>

Lord Hutton, who based his speech on the view that the commission of an act of torture is not a function of a head of state (p. 263E-F) expressly rejected the view that torture becomes an international crime only when it is committed or instigated on a large scale (at p. 264B). Lord Millett, in considering the issue of jurisdiction, drew a distinction between isolated offences of torture and those which constituted an attack on the international legal order, similar to the distinction drawn by Lord Hope. </p>

I consider that it had done so by 1973. For my own part, therefore, I would hold that the courts of this country already possessed extraterritorial jurisdiction in respect of torture and conspiracy to torture on the scale of the charges in the present case and did not require the authority of statute to exercise it. I understand, however, that your Lordships take a different view, and consider that statutory authority is required before our courts can exercise extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction even in respect of crimes of universal jurisdiction.” (at p. 276 E-F) </p>

Mr. Lewis draws attention to the complaint made by the Prime Minister of Nepal in his letter of 17 January 2013 which expressly alleges a breach of the obligation under Article 6(3) (an allegation which is no longer pursued on behalf of the Appellant) and which states that the United Kingdom had not at that date reported, in accordance with Article 6(4), the findings of the preliminary inquiry to the Government of Nepal or indicated whether it intended to exercise jurisdiction. Mr. Lewis submits that a dispute has emerged on the international level between Nepal and the United Kingdom as a result of the breach by the United Kingdom of its obligations under the Convention against Torture and that that dispute on the international plane is not justiciable before the courts of this jurisdiction. Moreover, he points to the fact that, whereas section 134 of the CJA 1988 does implement the Convention against Torture in part by creating in municipal law an offence of universal jurisdiction, Article 6 of the Convention against Torture has not been implemented into municipal law within the United Kingdom. He submits that the judge erred in failing to conclude that the question whether the United Kingdom has complied with its obligations under the Convention against Torture is a non-justiciable question. </p>

It does not follow, however, that a court must never look at or construe a non-implemented treaty. There are many examples of English courts examining and construing unincorporated treaty provisions in order to determine issues which arise incidentally. (See, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">Zoernsch v. Waldock</span> [1964] 1 WLR 675; <span style="font-style:italic">Nissan v. Attorney-General</span> [1970] AC 179, per Lord Reid at pp.206, 211, per Lord Morris at pp. 215-7, per Lord Pearce at pp. 225, 226; <span style="font-style:italic">Dallal v. Bank Mellat</span> [1986] QB 441 per Hobhouse J.) In recent years English courts have shown a much greater willingness to examine and interpret treaties which have not been implemented into municipal law, in particular in the area of human rights. (See, for example, A. <span style="font-style:italic">(FC) v.

In doing so they have applied the principles of interpretation of treaties developed in public international law and now formulated in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and  have examined travaux préparatoires in order to ascertain the meaning. (Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Articles 31-33; <span style="font-style:italic">R. (European Roma Rights Centre) v.

None of the issues which arise for consideration in the present case is within “the judicial no-man's land” where limitations inherent in the judicial function make those issues non-justiciable. Nor, in our view, does an examination of the text of Article 6 of the Convention against Torture involve any infringement of a principle of the non-justiciability of nonimplemented treaties. <span style="font-style:italic">Pinochet (No. 3)</span> itself provides an example of a municipal court examining in detail the provisions of the Convention against Torture in order to determine, inter alia, whether the parties to that Convention had agreed that immunity ratione materiae should no longer be available between contracting States in respect of acts of torture committed in an official capacity. In doing so, the House of Lords went far beyond what would have been necessary simply to interpret the provision implemented into municipal law by section 134 of the CJA 1988. Furthermore, it did so notwithstanding the fact that the whole issue of immunity was at the heart of international disputes between Chile and the United Kingdom and between Chile and Spain. This is apparent from the opening submission of Mr. Lawrence Collins QC, as he then was, on behalf of the Government of Chile, that Chile was intervening “to defend its national sovereignty, to assert its interest in having the matters dealt with in Chile, to maintain the rule of law in Chile and to protect the national jurisdiction from outside interference contrary to international law, but not to defend the applicant’s </p>

However, he complains that the United Kingdom failed to comply with Article 6(4) in that it failed immediately to notify the State referred to in Article 5(1), i.e. Nepal, of the fact that he was in custody and of the circumstances which warranted his detention. Furthermore, it is said that the United Kingdom failed, contrary to Article 6(4) promptly to report to Nepal the findings in its preliminary inquiry and to indicate whether it intended to exercise jurisdiction. He says that this step should have been taken before the Appellant was charged. In this regard Mr. Lewis criticises the judge’s finding that, given that the Nepalese embassy was notified of the Appellant’s arrest, that representatives of the embassy attended at the police station while the Appellant was there, that at all times Nepal was funding the defence, that a substantial case summary was supplied to the defence on 24 January 2013 and that letters were sent to Nepal on 20 March 2013 and 1 May 2013, it was clear that there had been compliance with Article 6(4).

It may be assumed therefore that the purpose of this obligation is to keep those States informed as to how the investigation is proceeding. It may well enable the Article 5(1) States to decide whether or not to request the extradition of the suspect. In addition, the Convention against Torture includes a more general provision in relation to cooperation in Article 9(1) which provides that States Parties shall afford one another the greatest measure of assistance in connection with criminal proceedings brought in respect of offences of torture. </p>

In support of this submission he points to section 88 of the Extradition Act 2003 which provides that where a person has been charged with an offence in the United Kingdom any extradition proceedings against him must be adjourned until the charge is disposed of or withdrawn or the proceedings are discontinued. Mr. Lewis submits that, once the Appellant was charged on 4 January, Nepal would be precluded from seeking the extradition of the Appellant and that accordingly any purported compliance with the duty to report on the preliminary investigation after charge would be ineffective because it would not enable Nepal to seek the Appellant’s extradition.  </p>

Thirdly, there is, in any event, more than a touch of unreality about the submission. Nepal has not sought the extradition of the Appellant.

Indeed, in Questions relating to the Obligation to Prosecute or Extradite, the ICJ expressed the matter as follows: “However, if the State in whose territory the suspect is present has received a request for extradition in any of the cases envisaged in the provision of the Convention, it can relieve itself of its obligation to prosecute by acceding to that request. It follows that the choice between extradition or submission for prosecution, pursuant to the Convention, does not mean that the two alternatives are to be given the same weight. Extradition is an option offered to the State by the Convention, whereas prosecution is an international obligation under the Convention, the violation of which is a wrongful act engaging his responsibility of the State.” (at para. 95). </p>

	    <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:0.00in">One of the purposes of the obligation to report under Article 6(4) is, no doubt, to enable other Contracting States to decide whether or not they wish to request extradition. However, there is no obligation under the Convention scheme to extradite a suspect to another Contracting State if the Contracting State where he is present decides to exercise jurisdiction itself. Furthermore, the exercise of jurisdiction under Article 5(2) is not dependent on the State assuming jurisdiction having refused extradition to an Article 5(1) State. In addition, there is no obligation to await a request for extradition to another Contracting State before exercising jurisdiction. The Contracting State in which a suspect is present has an unfettered choice as to whether to extradite or to submit the case to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution.

Given that Nepal does not seek to put the Appellant on trial for these charges, the United Kingdom is under a duty under the Convention to bring proceedings in this jurisdiction. </p>

Mr. Lewis suggests that because of the procedural failures of the United Kingdom, Nepal cannot be taken to have waived the immunity of its official on this occasion. However, it does not appear to us that the removal of immunity ratione materiae from cases falling within the Convention against Torture operates at the level of an individual waiver in respect of each individual case. Rather, participation by a State in the Convention against Torture system, by ratifying or acceding to the Convention, constitutes an acceptance that officials shall not be immune in respect of their official activities which fall within the scope of the Convention. Moreover, there is nothing in the scheme of the Convention to suggest that its operation (and in particular its rule of non-immunity) is in any way conditional on compliance with procedural obligations under the Convention. </p>

There are two major obstacles in the path of this argument. First, it is difficult to see that the alleged breach on the part of the United Kingdom would fall within Article 60(3). There has been no repudiation of the Convention against Torture by the United Kingdom. Moreover, having regard to the considerations set out above, we are unable to see that there has been a violation of a provision essential to the accomplishment of the object or purpose of the treaty. Secondly, there is no evidence before us to demonstrate that Nepal has taken the step of suspending the operation of the Convention against Torture between it and the United Kingdom. Certainly, neither of the letters from the Nepalese Government which we have been shown (dated 17 January 2013 and 25 March 2014 respectively) refers to any such suspension.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0.00in">The judge rejected that submission. First, he considered it clear from the correspondence set out above that the Under Secretary-General was well aware that the Appellant had been arrested on 3 January 2013, questioned charged and remanded in custody on 5 January 2013. In these circumstances, he considered that the explicit waiver of the immunity “from personal arrest and detention enjoyed by Colonel KL” was retrospective. Moreover, in the circumstances of this case he could see nothing wrong in law in that course. Secondly, and in any event, the judge considered that this was self-evidently a case in which, had it been drawn to his attention prior to the Appellant’s arrest, the Secretary-General would have waived immunity then. Accordingly, even if he was wrong on the retrospective effect of the waiver and assuming in the Appellant’s favour significant and substantial breaches of PACE and the Codes of Practice, he did not consider that the admission of the interviews would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that justice required them to be excluded. The Appellant now appeals against that ruling. </p>

The Court considered the applicability of Article VI, Section 22 to this activity. It considered that Section 22, in its reference to experts performing missions for the United Nations, uses the word “mission” in a general sense and that while some experts have necessarily to travel in order to perform their tasks, others can perform them without having to travel. Accordingly, Section 22 is applicable to every expert on mission, whether or not he travels. It concluded that experts on missions can invoke these privileges and immunities against the States of which they are nationals or where they reside, in the absence of a reservation by the State concerned. The privileges and immunities of Articles V and VI are conferred with a view to ensuring the independence of international officials and expert in the interests of the United Nations and this independence must be respected by all States including the State of nationality and the State of residence.

Similarly, it is difficult to see that at that time he was on a journey “in connection with service on such missions”. Moreover, the analogy with a diplomatic agent drawn by Article 17(b) is unhelpful to the Appellant here. Article 40 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations makes express provision for the case of a diplomatic agent who passes through or is in the territory of a third State “while proceeding to take up or to return to his post” or “when returning to his own country”. In these circumstances the third State is required to accord him inviolability and such other immunities as may be required to ensure his transit or return.

On the contrary, we can see no reason in principle why waiver of immunity with retroactive effect should not be permitted. It seems to us that it must be open to States and to international organisations to waive their immunity with retroactive effect as they see fit. The question then becomes whether there was such an intention in a given case and, if so, whether any formalities have been satisfied. </p>

The wording of the Under Secretary-General’s letter, read in the light of what she had been told by Sir Mark Lyall Grant about the history of the matter, makes that intention clear. As the judge pointed out, the Under Secretary-General was fully aware that the Appellant had been arrested on 3 January 2013 and questioned, charged and remanded in custody on 5 January 2013. Moreover, while the Under Secretary-General’s letter proceeds on the basis that the Appellant was arrested at a time when he was entitled to immunity, it makes no complaint about what in fact occurred. If it had been the intention to waive immunity only with prospective effect, she could be expected to have something to say about the violation. Furthermore, in the circumstances of this case it is difficult to see what legitimate purpose of the UN could be served by waiving immunity only with prospective effect. It seems clear that immunity was waived so as not to impede these proceedings. That is consistent with the duty of the Secretary-General.  </p>

Here he draws attention, once again, to the analogy drawn in Article 17(b) with the position of a diplomatic agent. He points to Article 32(2) of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations which provides that the waiver of immunity from jurisdiction of diplomatic agents must always be express. However, while Article 17(b) assimilates the immunity of an expert to that of a diplomatic agent, it does so simply to describe the immunity to be accorded; it is to be the like immunity from personal arrest or detention which is accorded to a diplomatic agent. We do not understand this provision to import the requirements of the Vienna Convention in respect of the formalities for waiver. Indeed, as the amicus curiae points out, the contrary intention is apparent in the scheme of the General Convention which the Order in Council implements. Article II of the General Convention, which deals with the immunity of the property and assets of the United Nations, states in Section 2 that a waiver must be express. There is no corresponding provision in Article VI which makes provision for the immunity of experts on missions for the United Nations. We consider that, had it been intended that any waiver of the immunity of an expert must also be express, there would have been an express provision to that effect in Article VI. </p>

Madan</span> [1961] 2 QB 1. There, a clerk at the Indian High Commission who was entitled to diplomatic immunity under section 1, Diplomatic Immunities (Commonwealth Countries and Republic of Ireland) Act 1952 was charged with obtaining property by false pretences. At the committal proceedings he purported to waive his immunity. His diplomatic status became apparent before the court of trial, only after his conviction. Three months later the Indian High Commissioner waived the immunity. An appeal against conviction was allowed. The Appellant’s purported waiver had been ineffective. Furthermore, as the waiver made by the High Commissioner did not purport to be retrospective, the Appellant had been subjected to proceedings without jurisdiction. Mr. Lewis draws attention, in particular, to the conclusion that “proceedings brought against somebody, certainly civil proceedings brought against somebody entitled to diplomatic immunity are, in fact,  proceedings without jurisdiction and null and void, unless and until there is a valid waiver which, as it were, would bring the proceedings to life and give jurisdiction to the court.” (at p. 7) However, the decision casts little light on the issue in the present case because it turns on the court’s view that on its face the High Commissioner’s letter did not purport to operate retrospectively. </p>

The precise scope of that judgement, including whether it is correct to view it (as most commentators do) as the leading authority, has been the subject of recent analysis by the Court of Appeal: <span style="font-style:italic">R v JFJ</span> [2013] EWCA Crim 569. </p>

Either plea will only succeed where the later proceedings are for an offence which is the same as an earlier offence both in fact and law.

However, on the facts here, Mr Lewis attempted to persuade us there should be no legal burden upon the Appellant, merely an evidential burden. It is said to be unfair on an accused to place upon him the burden of proving he has already been prosecuted and punished in a foreign jurisdiction. The prosecuting state is far better placed to investigate and secure cooperation than an individual. Miss Cheema retorted that this particular accused has been put to no disadvantage whatsoever. On the contrary, he has had the considerable assistance and support of the government of Nepal. She was prepared to concede that, in the interests of fairness, there may be circumstances where the court would bear very much in mind any difficulties faced by an accused in discharging the burden but this, she argued, is not such a case. </p>

Nepal has not yet enacted a specific law making torture a punishable offence, but there are provisions of the Country Code which could be invoked to bring criminal charges against alleged torturers. They have not been invoked in this case and no charge has been brought under the Country Code by either the state or the complainant. Any prosecution would now be time barred.

Sections 8 and 9 provide for the determination of the amount of compensation and the execution of the decision. Section 10 authorises government lawyers to defend the government official alleged to have been involved in torture (as happened here). Section 12 states that the fact that a claim for compensation has been made under the Act does not prevent proceedings in a separate action. According to Professor Subedi, this means there is nothing to prevent a subsequent prosecution on the same facts.  </p>

Section 7 “speaks of prosecution/punishment of the person” responsible for inflicting the torture, leaving the way open for prosecution of the person involved and a possible prison sentence. Further, under Nepalese law the victim of torture has a number of options; making a claim for compensation is but one of them. Pursuant to Section </p>

The Appellant was represented by the local public prosecutor (which may seem a little strange to British eyes if these were thought to be both civil and criminal proceedings). Mr Raut sought compensation of Rs 100,000 (pursuant to section 6 (1) of the Act) to be payable by the Government and the “necessary” departmental action (pursuant to section 7).  The three issues for the court were: was the claim made in time, did the act of inflicting torture constitute an “offence” and was the complainant entitled to compensation. The judge records his finding that the complainant was tortured and orders compensation to be paid by the state. He makes no mention of punishment for the Appellant for his involvement in a serious criminal offence. The Appellant is simply referred to his senior officers for departmental action, as dictated by section 7 of the Torture Compensation Act.  </p>

He accepts that criminal proceedings were not brought under the Country Code, as they could have been, and that the District Court proceedings began as a civil claim against three defendants.

However, on his interpretation of the Act and the proceedings, section 12 has abolished the principle for offences of torture. The result, according to Professor Subedi, is that, despite a conviction for torture in the District Court, the Appellant remained liable to conviction of a criminal offence based on the same facts, under the Country Code and in a Court Martial.

Torture of a detainee is unlawful and “in any case under the Torture Compensation Act mere denial of torture is not sufficient.” The proper procedures had not been followed during the complainant’s detention.

The only reference to prosecution or possible punishment comes in section 7 which, as already indicated, provides for an official found responsible on a complaint of torture to be referred by the court to his home department for action by that department. It would be a curious criminal offence which gave the District Court power to convict of a serious offence but not the power to punish, forcing it to remit the case for punishment by a Government department. </p>
