The four cases, not otherwise linked, involve the smuggling of tobacco into this country for resale and have been listed together because they raise similar issues.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">38. What remains to be said about the meaning of the word "obtain" in s.71(4) [of the Criminal Justice Act 1988]? Clearly it does not mean "retain" or "keep". But no less clearly, in my judgment, it contemplates that the defendant in question should have been instrumental in getting the property out of the crime. His acts must have been a cause of that being done. Not necessarily the only cause: there may, plainly, be other actors playing their parts. All that is required is that the defendant's acts should have contributed, to a non-trivial (that is, not <span style="font-style:italic">de minimis</span>) extent, to the getting of the property.

It is, however, relevant to remember that the object of the legislation is to deprive the defendant of the product of his crime or its equivalent, not to operate by way of fine. The rationale of the confiscation regime is that the defendant is deprived of what he has gained or its equivalent. He cannot, and should not, be deprived of what he has never obtained or its equivalent, because that is a fine. This must ordinarily mean that he has obtained property so as to own it, whether alone or jointly, which will ordinarily connote a power of disposition or control, as where a person directs a payment or conveyance of property to someone else.</p>

In written submissions prepared for today, Mr Cammerman submitted that although the circumstances under which liability to duty may arise under the Tobacco Product Regulations 2001 are narrower than under the preceding relevant Regulations, they still cover the position of the appellant.  This would depend on whether liability arose under paragraph 13(3)(e) of the Regulations, which would impose liability on him if he was a person who "caused the tobacco products to reach an excise duty point."  In his oral submissions Mr Cammerman invited the court to adjourn the hearing of the appeal in order that fuller submissions could be made by both parties on that issue.</p>

We have no idea, and it would be wrong to speculate, whether if the case below had been presented on the basis that the prosecution asserted that this appellant had caused the tobacco to reach an excise duty point, the appellant would have chosen to give evidence.  It would be wrong for this court, which is primarily a court of review, to make a finding of fact of that kind in these circumstances.

Given that one of the aims of the Directive is the collection of excise duty, it is unlikely that it was envisaged that a Member State, in the words of the appellant, “must ... make a determination that a particular person is liable in the circumstances of the case”, even though, for example, the excise duty could not in fact be collected from him and even though another person or other persons would be liable.

Moreover, the fact that Directive 2008/118/EC, which repeals and replaces Directive 92/12/EC with effect from 15 January 2009, adopts additional rules as regards the persons liable for duty does not detract from this proposition of earlier harmonisation, but rather reinforces it.</p>

The reason why this is a closed category of liable persons is that, unlike the initial release of the excise goods for consumption in a Member State, there is now a cross-border or internal market consideration to be taken into account.  If Member States could impose a duty on any person as they saw fit in respect of goods on which duty had already been paid in another Member State, there would be a grave danger of double taxation, which would be contrary to the principle of the internal market.</p>

Mitchell pleaded guilty to being knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of duty payable on the importation of tobacco contrary to section 170(2) of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979.  The offence came to light when a lorry was stopped by customs officers at Dover on 17th September 2004.  The lorry had come from Belgium and was pulling a refrigerated trailer, containing what were supposed to be frozen chips but in fact consisted mainly of Golden Virginia Tobacco.  There were a large number of boxes weighing a total of over 2,000 kilograms.  The driver was arrested.  </p>

It is important to keep separate in one's mind the distinction between civil liability under the regulations and criminal liability under section 170 of the 1979 Act, which may trigger confiscation proceedings under POCA. A person who dishonestly evades the civil liability will commit an offence and be liable to a confiscation order but it is wrong to approach the construction of the civil liability imposed by Regulation 13 on the footing that this regulation is aimed at crooks; it is aimed at importations in general, which will include some dishonest importations but of which the vast majority will be lawful.  </p>

The Court put various examples to him in the course of argument, such as the innocent student abroad who, for a small reward, helped to load cigarettes into the boot of a person's car with knowledge that he was returning to the United Kingdom but no knowledge that the goods were intended to be smuggled.  Mr Mitchell, consistently with his broad approach to the wording of the regulation submitted that, yes, he would be someone who had caused the tobacco products to reach an excise duty point.  So, if we understood him correctly, would the railway porter at a French station who loaded goods into a car or onto a lorry, knowing that the driver was on his way to the United Kingdom.  So too would be the individual driver on any leg of the journey and not merely the company which employed him.  </p>

Mr Mitchell submitted that this was not so but we do not see as a matter of construction why it would not be so.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">31. It seems to us clear that Regulation 13 must have been intended to give effect to those provisions of the Council Directive.  One can see a broad comparison between those identified in Article 7(3) and those identified in Regulation 13.  As we see it, Article 7(3) is directed in effect at the consignor or consignee or, where one and the same person is the holder of the goods both before and after importation, at that person.  That is also a rational way to interpret Regulation 13.  Regulation 13(1) would cover a recipient who holds the goods from the moment of the importation and also a person who is carrying through the goods which are that person's before and after the importation.  Paragraph 13(3)(e) would cover a consignor.  Now, there is a difference in language between Article 7(3) of the Directive, "the person making the delivery" and Regulation 13(3)(e), "any person who caused the tobacco products to reach an excise duty point".  It may be that the reason for the choice of language in 13(3) is to make clear that attention is being directed to the person who may not be physically making the delivery but is the person who is truly responsible for it being made.  In the case of a company, to take an example considered in argument, J Snoops might be the driver and could be said to be the person physically making the delivery, but it would be his employer who, in reality, caused the products to reach the excise duty point.</p>

We are conscious, as already indicated, that we have not heard as full argument on this subject as we might, but we are satisfied that the civil liability created by the Regulations is not intended to have the wide sweep contended for by the prosecution.  It would be undesirable for us to seek to put a precise definition on the phrase "any person who caused the tobacco products to reach an excise duty point", least of all without fuller argument than we have heard in this case, <span style="text-decoration:underline">but it appears to us that it is directed at that person or body who had real and immediate responsibility for causing the product to reach that point,</span> which will typically and ordinarily be the consignor.

I have no doubt that they ‘obtained’ the tobacco itself (in the sense that the keys found in the car gave them access to it and sufficient control over it) but that is not the point. That they had not yet touched the tobacco is also not in point: the offence which they admitted was becoming concerned in dealing with the goods in one or more of the ways prohibited by s.170(1)(b) with the necessary intent.

The Crown Court held that Dennard had “obtained” the tobacco itself (para [33]) and there was evidence (see para [22]) that the purchase price of it was £24,000.  The evidence of Dennard’s travel to Belgium the previous day and his possession of the £9,000 onwards sale proceeds of part would support the proposition that he had “obtained” the tobacco for himself  (with or without others) and had the power to dispose of it.  Thus the tobacco could properly be considered to be his “benefit” as “property obtained” by him in connection with his offence.</p>

Normal LYNX procedure is for goods to be delivered by LYNX themselves to the addresses on the consignment. All consignments for delivery by LYNX are sorted at a central sorting point and then distributed to local delivery branches for onward delivery to the consignment addresses. The local delivery branch for the Essex area is at Chelmsford. The majority of occasions Howard would contact me with the details of delivery, but sometimes I called Howard to let him know that the consignments had arrived, on these occasions I called him on the mobile telephone number he gave me.</p>

This is (a) because of the danger that the citation of the Regulations may have provided additional support (for different reasons) for the Court’s stated conclusions, (b) because the failure to cite the 2001 Regulations deprived the Court from having a contrary argument to consider, and (c) because upon analysis of the law as it now stands the judgment cannot now be supported on the facts.</p>

He had pleaded guilty to one count and one charge, each of which alleged that he had been respectively keeping and carrying goods with intent to defraud Her Majesty of the duty.  Secondly, in civil law terms, the duty on the cigarettes had already been evaded (by others), prior to Mr Rowbotham receiving them.  He was not the importer, manufacturer, or diverter from bond.  While his acts and his guilty pleas could correctly be said to have involved an intention to defraud the Crown from that continuing liability to pay, the liability itself was the liability of others (as determined by the 2001 Regulations) and not of Mr Rowbotham, and had been evaded by others.</p>
