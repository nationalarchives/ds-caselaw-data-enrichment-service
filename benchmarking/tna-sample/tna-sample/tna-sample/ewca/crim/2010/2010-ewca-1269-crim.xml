It is of note that when the Attorney General undertook a review of 297 cases over a ten year period following the case of <span style="font-style:italic">R v Cannings</span> [2004] 2 Cr App R 63, 97 were cases of what is known as “shaken baby syndrome”.  The controversy to which such cases gives rise should come as no surprise.  A young baby dies whilst under the sole care of a parent or childminder.  That child can give no clue to clinicians as to what has happened.  Experts, prosecuting authorities and juries must reconstruct as best they can what has happened.  There remains a temptation to believe that it is always possible to identify the cause of injury to a child.  Where the prosecution is able, by advancing an array of experts, to identify a non-accidental injury and the defence can identify no alternative cause, it is tempting to conclude that the prosecution has proved its case.  Such a temptation must be resisted.  In this, as in so many fields of medicine, the evidence may be insufficient to exclude, beyond reasonable doubt, an unknown cause.  As <span style="font-style:italic">Cannings</span> [177] teaches, even where on examination of all the evidence, every possible known cause has been excluded, the cause may still remain unknown.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This court has heard, over a period of three weeks, three appeals concerning three babies, two of whom died, whilst in the care of a single adult.  During the course of the trials a large number of medical experts were called.  In two of the appeals what was asserted to be ‘fresh’ medical expert evidence was called.  These three cases highlight a particular feature of cases where it is alleged a baby has been shaken in the care of a single adult.  The evidence to prove guilt may consist only of expert evidence.  It must never be forgotten that that expert evidence is relied upon to prove that the individual defendant is lying in the account he gives, either at the time or at trial.  The correct management of such evidence is, therefore, of crucial importance in cases such as these.  The correct approach to such evidence must be identified.  If a conviction is to be based merely on the evidence of experts then that conviction can only be regarded as safe if the case proceeds on a logically justifiable basis.  That entails a logically justifiable basis for accepting or rejecting the expert evidence (see <span style="font-style:italic">R v Kai-Whitewind</span> [2005] 2 Cr App R 31 [90]).  Hearing these three appeals in succession affords an opportunity to make observations on the correct approach and the management of such expert evidence.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We should draw attention to the principles we have applied in relation to the admission of fresh evidence pursuant to s.23 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.  In all three appeals the appellants sought to adduce fresh expert medical witnesses, although it was not necessary to hear the expert evidence in Butler.  As is apparent in a trilogy of cases (<span style="font-style:italic">R v Stephen Jones</span> [1997] 1 Cr App R 86, <span style="font-style:italic">R v Meechan</span> [2009] EWCA Crim 1701 and <span style="font-style:italic">Kai-Whitewind</span>) it is difficult to apply the provisions of that section to expert evidence.  Where medical evidence is adduced before the Court of Appeal by an appellant from witnesses who were not called at trial and that evidence appears cogent and relevant, it is difficult for this court to exclude it on the basis that that evidence should have been called at trial.  There is a danger, therefore, of overlooking the importance of the principle identified by Lord Bingham CJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Stephen Jones</span> and repeated by Sir Anthony May P in <span style="font-style:italic">Meechan</span> that it would subvert the trial process if a defendant were to be generally free to mount on appeal an expert case which, if sound, could and should have been advanced before the jury (<span style="font-style:italic">Stephen Jones </span>at [93], <span style="font-style:italic">Meechan </span>at [1] and [23]).  In <span style="font-style:italic">Kai-Whitewind </span>Judge LJ observed that the court would only in the rarest of circumstances permit repetition or near-repetition of “evidence of the same effect by some other expert”.  Trials should not be a “dry run” for experts.  Hearings of appeals should not present an opportunity to call new experts in the hope that they might do better than those whose evidence had previously been rejected [97].  We have sought to apply those principles, particularly in the light of the fact that expert reports were obtained for the trial by the defence in Henderson and the defence chose not to call those experts because, in part, they assisted the prosecution.  In such a case, an appellant should not be in any better position than an appellant who had called evidence at trial.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Since the appeal depends upon an assessment of the expert evidence, just as at trial, the preparation and marshalling of that expert evidence is of the utmost importance in achieving just resolution.  The appeal requires presentation by counsel experienced and expert in the field of what is contended to be the unexplained death of or injury to a child.  Such counsel need to be able to identify focussed issues upon which this court can concentrate and to identify the evidence, whether it be evidence at trial or which it is sought to call, on which resolution of those issues will depend.  All counsel we heard in these cases were able to assist due to their experience in cases such as these and to the skill with which they deployed that experience.  It is no criticism of other counsel if we highlight the manner in which counsel for the prosecution, Joanna Glynn QC and Sarah Campbell, and for the defence, Mr Topolski QC and Andrew Scott, in Henderson, prepared their appeal.  The skeleton arguments were focussed upon the particular medical evidence.  Different features of that evidence were clearly identified and when any medical proposition was advanced, it was explained and its source clearly identified.  A number of different disciplines were involved, all of which were clearly distinguished by separate files, separately coloured and with the underlying evidence and literature upon which that evidence was based, identified and collated.  A core literature file, prepared by Mr Topolski, enabled the court to find and weigh the underlying literature upon which controversial evidence was based.  The Vice-President conducted a detailed case management hearing providing timetables and giving directions as to how the evidence was to be prepared.  Importantly, meetings were held between the experts so as to identify clearly those issues upon which agreement had been reached and those issues which remained a matter of debate.  Without such preparation and obedience to the directions given by the Vice-President it would have been difficult properly to resolve the appeal.  The example of the preparation in that case should, we suggest, be followed in future appeals.  We shall return to the theme of management and preparation in relation to the conduct of trials when we have considered the individual appeals before this court.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is a further problem to which we should draw attention.  Cases such as <span style="font-style:italic">R v Harris and Others</span> [2006] 1 Cr App R 5 contain detailed analysis of medical evidence and the conclusions of this court on that evidence.  In particular, in that case, the court commented upon the cogency of the “triad”: widespread bilateral retinal haemorrhages, thin film subdural haemorrhage and encephalopathy [63] and [69].  The court rejected the unified hypothesis that the same triad of injuries could be caused by lack of oxygen in the tissues leading to brain swelling, a hypothesis which Dr Geddes herself accepted could no longer credibly be put forward [66-68].  These conclusions have inevitably informed the basis of the approach taken by the police and prosecution and have been relied on in argument either at trial or before this court.  But it is trite to observe that the conclusion of any court as to the medical evidence, whether at first instance or on appeal, is dependent upon the evidence before that court.  No appellate jurisprudence could provide authority for a medical proposition.  The strength of a proposition in medicine depends upon the strength of the medical evidence on which it is based.  The quality and extent of the evidence will inevitably vary from case to case.  Whilst it is now commonly accepted that the triad is strong prima facie evidence of shaking, that depends upon the common acceptance of experts in the field and not upon the conclusion of courts which are only able to weigh the evidence presented before them.  Previous legal authority cannot determine whether the conclusion of a medical report should be accepted or rejected.  The most legal authority can do is present an accurate record of what was or was not accepted or propounded.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We stress this problem because we feared that the medical profession may have looked to the courts to resolve medical controversy.  But the difficulty the courts face, in an area of medical controversy, was demonstrated by the course of these appeals.  It had been hoped to hear the appeals of Henderson and Butler before the end of 2009.  However, renewed controversy in relation to post-mortem findings in cases of traumatic head injury in children led to a meeting at the Royal College of Pathologists on 10 December 2009.  The controversy was a matter of concern to the courts as the President, Professor Furness, recognised.  At the meeting a number of those recognised to have expertise in the field, who advanced opposing opinions, attended.  Certain areas of agreement and disagreement were recorded.  But they give rise to two difficulties.  Those areas of agreement and disagreement should inform future opinions.  It is difficult to see how any expert could advance an opinion to which those conclusions were relevant without at least reference to them.  But the record of those areas of agreement and disagreement is not itself evidence.  Further, whilst the report had been circulated for amendment, positive confirmation of its content was not received by the President from all the participants.  We have not been able to deploy that report save insofar as it was adopted in evidence before us.  We should say, however, that, in the evidence before us in these appeals, no expert sought to undermine the proposition that the triad was, as described in <span style="font-style:italic">Harris</span>, “a strong pointer to non-accidental head injury”.  But we should emphasise that none of these three cases is concerned solely with the triad: in Henderson the issue was whether there was evidence of injury independent of and additional to the triad, in Butler one of the issues was whether the unusual fact of the baby’s recovery after the discovery of retinal haemorrhage indicated a cause other than shaking, and in Oyediran the prosecution alleged a distinct and separate injury, namely, fracture of the baby’s arm.  For those reasons, we must emphasise that this judgment constitutes legal, not medical, authority and neither adds to nor subtracts from the strength of the evidence afforded by the triad.  </p>

But in the third appeal, Hedley J was replaced by Sharp J.  Counsel in all appeals had the opportunity to study a careful and comprehensive note, for which we are most grateful, made by counsel Gwawr Thomas.  All judges have made substantial contribution to the individual appeals but, of course, neither Hedley J nor Sharp J has commented upon the appeal which they did not hear.  The appeals were heard in succession, with a week between the second and third, because it was thought that it would be unfortunate if different constitutions wrote different judgments on different occasions when the appeals were heard so closely together.  We turn, then, to those individual appeals.  </p>

The appellant was charged with manslaughter.  After a six week trial at which the prosecution called eleven expert medical witnesses and the defence one, a jury at Reading Crown Court, on 13 November, 2007, convicted the appellant of manslaughter by a majority of ten to two.

We emphasise that we are dealing with natural causes of death within the purview of up-to-date medical knowledge because in this appeal we were properly reminded that at no stage can knowledge in a field such as this be regarded as complete and comprehensive.  There are limits to the extent of knowledge and no conclusion should be reached without acknowledging the possibility of an unknown cause emerging into the light of medical perception and that the mere exclusion of every possible known cause does not prove the deliberate infliction of violence (see <span style="font-style:italic">Canning passim</span> and<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>[177]).</p>

Mr Peter Richards, a Consultant Paediatric Neurosurgeon, gave evidence as to the thorough nature of Dr Pike’s investigation as to natural disease.  All natural diseases that could cause subdural haemorrhages were excluded.  At the trial the appellant relied upon Dr Anslow, a Consultant Paediatric Neuroradiologist.  It was his evidence that Maeve might have suffered a seizure brought about spontaneously which resulted in hypoxic-ischaemic brain damage leading to swelling of the brain and raised intra-cranial pressure.  As the defence now stress, the evidence of the triad and the retinal folds and axonal damage (the triad with those two additional features) was never challenged, nor was the proposition that they demonstrated violent trauma.  The issues of retinal folds and axonal damage were topics outwith the expertise of Dr Anslow.  The appellant was unable to explain the two critical features additional to the triad which formed the basis of the prosecution case against her.  This appeal is concerned with her attempts to do so now.  </p>

The three features of the triad, present in this case, were encephalopathy, specifically hypoxic-ischaemic brain damage, second, retinal haemorrhages and third, subdural haemorrhages.  Whilst he accepted that any of those three individual components could be found in cases other than inflicted injury, it was very unusual to find them together, save in cases of inflicted head injury.  He emphasised the importance of the characteristics of each of those components and the importance of considering them as a whole.  He acknowledged that there were other individuals who took a contrary view but suggested that they tended to be experts not involved in the day-to-day care and management of abused children.</p>

His particular clinical paediatric experience is concerned with examining children’s eyes in a clinical setting.  Whilst Maeve was alive, he found retinal haemorrhages in all the different layers of the retina extending throughout the whole of the retina.  Second, he found that both eyes had a 360º fold, with an optic nerve sheath haemorrhage in the right eye.

Raised intra-cranial pressure was eliminated for reasons which need not now detain us (the two possible causes, retinal haemorrhages secondary to persistently elevated intra-cranial pressure causing papilloedema and cases of Terson’s syndrome were excluded).  The time when these haemorrhages were first seen was particularly important in excluding non-traumatic raised intra-cranial pressure as a cause.  The next feature of the retinal haemorrhages which is of importance is their effect.  They would have rendered Maeve blind or almost blind as soon as they were sustained.  The eye injuries must, accordingly, have been sustained shortly before midday on 2 March 2005 since she was awake and happy, “whizzing around in her baby-walker” after about 11.10 a.m.  The other important feature was the discovery of retinal folds.  Mr Elston told the jury that he had only seen such perimacular retinal folds in cases of trauma.  That may include accidental trauma, accompanied by external signs of injury, but most commonly caused by shaking or a combination of shaking and impact.  Mr Elston told the jury that in 25 years of clinical paediatric ophthalmology he had only seen retinal folds cases of shaking or shaking and impact.</p>

That view was criticised by Dr Gardiner who suggested that the haemorrhage itself might raise the fold.

The paper demonstrated that perimacular folds could be caused other than by trauma although this was unknown both at the time of trial and at the time the reports were prepared for the purposes of this appeal.  It was not suggested that Maeve suffered from leukaemia.

Since it is not known how retinal folds are formed there is no sound evidential basis for saying that they occur merely as a result of a haemorrhage.  Mr Elston’s evidence, as a clinician, that in 25 years of paediatric ophthalmology he has only ever seen retinal folds in shaking or shaking and impact cases (his evidence at trial, repeated in his report dated 10 March 2009) persuades us that the folds are features pointing towards shaking or shaking with impact over and above the appearance of the haemorrhage.</p>

But he does not seek to dispute Mr Elston’s clinical experience and, indeed, he is in no position to do so since he is a pathologist and not a clinician.  Moreover, in his evidence he is unable to suggest any alternative reason for the retinal haemorrhages and in particular their appearance, extent and location.  Nor is he able to put forward any alternative cause for the folds, other than that they are to be regarded as attributable to the haemorrhages.  In particular, the evidence obtained from other paediatric clinicians since the trial excludes infection as a realistic cause of the retinal haemorrhages.  Professor Pollard, Professor of Paediatric Infection and Immunity at Oxford University, excludes systemic infection as a cause of the haemorrhages in the absence of any coagulation disturbance associated with shock.  Professor Klein, Professor of Infectious Diseases and Immunology at the Institute of Child Health and an Honorary Consultant in Great Ormond Street Hospital, gives, in his final report dated 11 November 2009, similar evidence.

Perhaps, on first reading, we failed to appreciate the emphasis upon “known” causes.  Essentially, Professor Luthert’s evidence amounted to no more than that the injuries were probably due to shaking or shaking with some impact but that he could not be certain.  That in our view is insufficient to undermine the safety of Mr Elston’s conclusion.</p>

The evidence of any expert in a particular field is inevitably limited to the field in which he professes expertise.  That, of course, is why no expert can be in the position of a jury or, for that matter, of this court, able to put particular evidence in the context of the totality.  Professor Luthert acknowledged this in referring to the evidence of traumatic injury to the nerve fibres (“traumatic axonal injury”).  He accepted that that would be additional evidence of trauma, outside his field of expertise, and would diminish the relevance of his discussion as to the interpretation of what he called “the triad alone” (see his note dated 5 October 2009).  It is, accordingly, necessary to turn to the evidence of the damage to the nerve fibres.</p>

Dr Al-Sarraj asserted that he could determine that the traumatic axonal injury was about two to three days old, consistent with Maeve sustaining that injury on 2 March 2005.  The defence challenged Dr Al-Sarraj’s ability to make the distinction.  But Dr Al-Sarraj relied in part on slides taken by Dr Geddes as part of her research in papers which have become known as Geddes I and II, and on Reichard “The Significance of Beta App Immunoreactivity in Forensic Practice”.  Dr Al-Sarraj also relied upon his own research, published literature and experience.  A critical feature for distinction was the location of the axonal damage in the cortico-spinal tracts and the appearance of the severed axons, the ends of which pick up the stain and show up as round globules rather than a diffuse cloud or “granular staining”, as Dr Al-Sarraj described it.  The distinction was important in demonstrating that the cause was not ischemia which will affect the whole area in which there is a lack of oxygen.  Traumatic injury will cut individual axons causing a leak of protein which will show on the beta app stain (this particular evidence became clear in response to a pointed jury question at the end of Dr Al-Sarraj’s cross-examination).</p>

But for the purposes of the neuropathology in the instant case what is important about both Dr Geddes’s papers is the reference to axonal damage at the cranio-cervical junction.  Dr Geddes sought       to distinguish between axonal damage caused by trauma and axonal damage secondary to hypoxia-ischaemia, raised intra-cranial pressure and/or brain shift (1297).  Localised axonal damage demonstrated in cortico-spinal tracts was regarded as significant.

The evidence of Dr Al-Sarraj and Dr Squier on this aspect, coupled with the literature on which it was based, was not met by any contrary evidence called on behalf of the defence.  The defence had instructed Dr Colin Smith, a highly experienced expert in “neuropathology and baby-shaking” who was a co-author of the Reichard paper to which we have already referred.

Dr Leestma is a neuropathologist from Chicago.  He was Professor of Pathology and Neurology at the University of Chicago between 1986 and 1987 and Neuropathologist and Associate Medical Director for the Chicago Institute of Neurosurgery and Neuro Research between 1987 and 2002 and a Neuropathology Consultant for the Children’s Memorial Hospital of North Western University Medical Centre Chicago between 2003 and 2005.  He has been consulted in matters of forensic neuropathology in private practice for the past thirty years.  He advanced a number of propositions in reports dated 10 July 2008, 2 February 2009 and 24 June 2009.  Not all of them survived by the time he gave oral evidence before us.  In particular, he had previously raised the possibility that the axonal pathology may have been due to artefacts produced by removal of the brain and cord post-mortem.  After discussion with Dr Al-Sarraj and after a meeting between the two doctors, he no longer pursued that possibility.  When he wrote his first report dated 10 July 2008 Dr Leestma suggested that whilst subdural haematomas in infancy are more likely to be due to physical forces, inflicted or accidental, “there are a host of natural disease states that can cause them”.  Now that the appellant has expressly abandoned infection as a cause of the constellation of symptoms from which Maeve suffered and that it is accepted that those symptoms are not attributable to any known infection, Dr Leestma’s proposition, that there are many rational explanations for Maeve’s symptoms other than abuse, was no longer relied upon.</p>

The undisputed evidence at trial was that any re-bleed would not have caused the catastrophic injury and death of Maeve.  Dr Al-Sarraj accepted that recent bleeding could be a re-bleed from an old haematoma but there was only a small amount of subdural haematoma found and that would not explain Maeve’s death.  The refutation of Dr Leestma’s written suggestion as to the cause of the subdural haemorrhage is summed up by the clinician Dr Peters.

Prior to his oral evidence before this court, however, there was a meeting at which, on examination of block 13, both experts agreed that deposits of beta app staining in the middle of the cortico-spinal tracts were of a different pattern from that which had been in other areas.  They were well-defined isolated globules without a granular background.  At that meeting Dr Leestma commented that Dr Al-Sarraj’s view of the significance of well-defined isolated globules “may well be right, I just don’t know”.  Dr Leestma did agree that removal of the tissue post-mortem was unlikely to be a reason for the signs observed in the spinal cord.

As he explained in his evidence, he had not understood the significance of the slides described as “block 13” which showed the different pattern of staining in the medulla and cortico-spinal tract.

His knowledge emerges from studies of the literature which excluded the important material contained in Geddes I and II and Reichard.  Until his meeting with Dr Al-Sarraj, he had never appreciated the significance of the signs of axonal damage in the cortico-spinal tract.  His lack of experience and his lack of appreciation of the importance of this point leads us to the conclusion that his evidence was fundamentally flawed.  His insistence on asserting that it was not possible to attribute significance to that axonal damage flies in the face of the references in both Geddes I, II and Reichard and the evidence which flows from Dr Al-Sarraj’s up-to-date experience.

This evidence, consistent with evidence given at trial and coupled with the effect of the eye injuries which would have almost blinded Maeve instantly, demonstrates that there is no basis for advancing the proposition that Maeve collapsed as a result of trauma on 15 February 2005 followed by a lucid interval until 2 March 2005.</p>

Indeed, the willingness of Dr Leestma to advance propositions which he subsequently had to withdraw in the light of his greater knowledge of this case, coupled with his lack of up-to-date experience, severely damaged and undermined the effect of his evidence.  We would have had considerable doubts as to whether he was properly qualified to give evidence designed to refute the evidence given by Dr Al-Sarraj or Dr Squier at trial.  We did not reach any concluded view as to that.

He accepted that he was not qualified to deal with the ophthalmological symptoms nor the question of axonal injury.  It appeared that Professor Morris was tending to revive the unified hypothesis in Geddes III which was rejected in <span style="font-style:italic"> R v Harris</span>.  Mr Topolski QC, rightly and with customary frankness, abandoned reliance upon Professor Morris and made it clear that he would not contend that infection was a cause of Maeve’s collapse and death.  But it is necessary, in the context of the other arguments which he maintained, to record some of the written evidence and oral evidence from, particularly, Dr Peters, which places the arguments on which the appellant did rely in the context of all the expert evidence which remained relevant in the appeal.</p>

But he would not accept that no causal link has ever been made between hypoxic-ischaemic injury and subdural haemorrhages or retinal haemorrhages.  We refer again to Dr Peters’ evidence of his clinical experience, recorded [53].  Moreover, there is ample literature to support his proposition that hypoxia does not cause subdural bleeding in infants (<span style="font-style:italic">Byard </span>(2007) (<span style="font-style:italic">Paediatric and Development Pathology 10</span>).  The paper considered a series of eighty-two foetuses of infants and toddlers up to 3 years who died following hypoxic cardiac arrest in which no single macroscopic subdural haemorrhage was detected.  To similar effect was a study of critically ill children admitted to Great Ormond Street Hospital in <span style="font-style:italic">Jackman </span>(2007) and in a more recent paper, by <span style="font-style:italic">Matschke </span>in<span style="font-style:italic"> Paediatrics</span> (<span style="font-style:italic">the American Academy of Paediatrics December 2009</span>) in which, following 715 autopsies of infants who had died before the age of 1 year from one institution over a fifty year period, the data argued strongly against the unified hypothesis proffered in Geddes III and “strengthens the association between subdural bleeding and non-accidental head injury in infancy” (page 1).</p>

The timing in Maeve’s case excluded the possibility that the brain-swelling caused the haemorrhage since such haemorrhages were observable early after four hours whereas the swelling would peak at between twenty-four to forty-eight hours after the crisis.  The only time he had seen the pattern of events apparent in Maeve’s case was following trauma.  We refer to this evidence again because it seems to us to demonstrate the force of the triad in this case.  The appearance of the symptoms, particularly the haemorrhaging at every level in the retina, coupled with the non-space-occupying subdural haematoma and the encephalopathy showed that this was a case where the triad itself afforded a strong basis for the conclusion that shaking or shaking and impact was the cause of Maeve’s sudden collapse.  Neither infection nor reperfusion, on the undisputed evidence both at trial and before this court, explained the retinal haemorrhages and folds or the subdural haematoma.</p>

Indeed, had it stood alone, there is every reason to think that it may not have been the subject of criminal prosecution at all and would have been viewed as a piece of “new parent carelessness”.  It is true that the Judge gave a careful direction to treat them separately but the reality is that this incident provided the only concrete example of any misdoing by the appellant and in a case such as this, it was asking a great deal of the jury to ignore it when they were considering the head injury.

That view is essentially based on two assumptions: first that it cannot be much more than that as many shaking injuries do not involve other damage e.g. to the neck or spinal cord; second, that it cannot be much less than that or there would be far more of those injuries than in fact there are.  Dr Anslow, for the purposes of this case, did not dissent from that view but asserted than a re-bleed would require lesser force, though how much less was not known, and he was of the view that the mother’s explanation of the buggy ride might indeed account for what had happened.  Dr Stoodley accepted that lesser force might be required to trigger a re-bleed (though of course in his view there was no such thing in this case) but he regarded as deeply unlikely the explanation of the buggy ride.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The buggy ride also raises another discrete but important issue in the case, namely that of timing. The preponderance of view was that the precipitating event (whatever it was) came just before the child went floppy.  That, of course, is the only evidence that established that that event occurred whilst the child was in the care of her father. If that were not so, there was no case against him on the major count. Whilst Dr Jayamohan (a neurologist) thought that the event might have occurred before arrival at the father’s home, the preponderance of view is that the father’s account is consistent with the event which caused collapse happening just before the child went floppy.</p>

Recovery is unusual and casts doubt on the reliance which can be placed upon the “triad” at all.  Of course there are cases of non-accidental head injury where some or all of the components of the triad are absent.  But there must be a rational basis upon which the jury could conclude that collapse was not due to an unknown cause, and thus reach a conclusion which rejects the evidential weight to be placed on the unusual feature in this case, namely complete recovery.</p>

The trial took place between 22 January 2007 and 16 March 2007.  The appellant was tried on a two count indictment.  In addition to the murder count, he was charged with causing or allowing the death of a child contrary to section 5 of the Domestic Violence Crimes and Victims Act 2004.  His co-defendant on the section 5 charge was the baby’s mother, Sophia Rudder.  She had originally been charged with murder.  Because she suffered from multiple sclerosis, the Crown decided not to proceed against her on that charge.  She was acquitted by the jury of the section 5 charge, and has since died.

On 11 August 2007 Sophia Rudder was visited by Josie Slade, a community midwife, who was concerned about her ability to look after her son on her own, in particular about her lack of upper body strength and ability to hold him.  The midwife said Sophia Rudder struggled to hold her son while trying to breast feed and was unable to pick him up.  As a result of these concerns, Social Services arranged for the appellant to join Sophia Rudder in the temporary accommodation, to help care for his son.   There was evidence from the health visitors of the appellant’s good care of Femi and his pride in having a son.</p>

He appeared forceful, and his partner seemed simply to follow his advice.  He told Ms Maitre that people with neurological problems were better off with short hair and he had therefore shaved Sophia Rudder’s head.  At Ms Maitre’s instigation, solicitors Flack &amp; Co were instructed to act for Sophia Rudder.  Ms Maitre’s letter to them said the appellant had damaged relationships with all the agencies trying to help Sophia Rudder through his attitude and behaviour.

Professor Risdon found Femi to be a well-nourished infant with no visible external injuries.  He was not dehydrated.  The stomach contained a little mucus and milk curd, consistent with a milk feed a few hours before death.  He had a small bruise on the inner surface of the scalp over the right parietal region.  There was a degree of swelling to the brain.  There was a thin layer of fresh subdural haemorrhage mainly over the right side of the brain and fresh haemorrhage around both optic nerves.  In his opinion, Femi had suffered a head injury characterised by a subdural haemorrhage, brain swelling and haemorrhage around the optic nerves.     </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In Professor Risdon’s opinion, by far the most likely explanation was that the injuries were inflicted, not accidental, in the absence of any plausible clinical history to account for the injuries.  The combination of subdural haemorrhage and brain swelling indicated a rotational acceleration/deceleration mechanism for the head injury.  Such a movement would cause the delicate veins between the surface of the brain and the dura to stretch; and if the movement was violent enough, to break.  Rotational acceleration/deceleration was characterised by a subdural haemorrhage, brain swelling and retinal haemorrhage (the “triad of findings”).   Here there was no retinal haemorrhage.  He was not surprised to find fresh bleeding round the optic nerve because it was an extension of the subdural space.  The mechanism of death was aspiration of the stomach’s gastric content, caused by the brain damage which affected the nerves controlling the reflex gag action.  Death would have been fairly quick.   Femi was cold to the touch at the Surgery, and this was consistent with Femi having been dead for at least half an hour.  In his opinion, Femi had been dead for a little while, and had not died in the Surgery, though in cross-examination he said he could not exclude that possibility.  </p>

He said it was not impossible to produce a fatal fall from a short distance, but the characteristics of such an injury would be different from the ones he found.  The fracture of the humerus and the first head injury could have occurred at the same time but he rejected as “implausible” the suggestion that those injuries could have been caused by a child falling from a parent’s lap and being pulled backwards, even violently.  The head injury could not have been accidental; the fracture could have been accidental theoretically, but such fractures do not occur in the way suggested.  He said the older subdural haemorrhage was not the type he would associate with one caused at birth.  Professor Risdon rejected the suggestion that there had been a “re-bleed” or secondary bleeding into a pre-existing site of brain injury rather than a second brain injury.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In re-examination he said the subdural haemorrhage was an extremely thin layer: the possibility of re-bleeding into that was obviously small.  If there had been a re-bleed into a pre-existing injury he would have expected a volume of blood sufficient to change the clinical condition of the child, and there was no evidence of that.  As for short distance falls causing serious injury, they nearly always occurred in ambulant children, the children in a study by Plunkett were not individually studied, and there was no individual examination of the injuries caused.  He had experience of three fatalities from short distance falls: and each involved older children who suffered a large, extra-dural, space-occupying haemorrhage, a quite different lesion from the one here.  Short falls for young children were everyday events.  The vast majority produced no injury at all, and certainly not damage inside the skull.      </p>

He agreed the head injury was caused on two separate occasions and that the fracture had been caused two weeks prior to birth.  The head injury could have been caused at different times or the same time.  It was not possible in his opinion to say whether the fracture had been caused accidentally or non-accidentally.  As there was no retinal bleeding this tended to suggest the force used was less than that found in traditional “shaken baby” cases.  If a child fell and were grabbed suddenly, that sort of force might produce damage to the brain.  As the brain injury had not been instantly fatal and in the absence of retinal haemorrhage, the brain injury could have been caused by a short fall from shoulder height to the ground.  Where a child had a two-week old brain injury any additional impact to the head, for example, a short fall, could lead to an increased propensity to bleed.   </p>

There was damage to the hippocampus which was more difficult to date, but in his opinion was probably caused at the same time as the damage to the cerebral cortex, as the two areas are closely related.  There was damage to the thalamus which may have been secondary to the damage to the cerebral cortex.  In the dura he also found haemorrhage of two different ages: a recent subdural haemorrhage which had occurred two-three days before death; and close to it, an older haemorrhage which was at least two weeks old.   In his opinion, the haemorrhages would both have been caused by a torsional twisting injury that might damage the communicating veins.

He said a child with a brain injury of two weeks’ duration would have abnormal movement of limbs, their behaviour would be abnormal, they would usually have seizures, their cry would be high-pitched and their feeding would be very weak.  They would barely be able to suck.  It was inconceivable that Femi had taken a 9 ounce feed a few hours before death.  It was nonetheless possible for there to be milky fluid in the stomach, as the baby could still suck, but this would be very weak.  It was also inconceivable that a half-competent GP would not have recognised the symptoms when he saw the baby twelve days before its death.  He did not think, therefore, the baby could have been injured at that point.  A fresh haemorrhage two-three days before death would have caused crying because of the severe headache it would have caused, unless the baby was unconscious.  He expected the baby would have been unconscious at some point in the two-week period after it was injured.  Professor Risdon’s evidence in relation to the arm fracture accorded with the evidence of Professor Hall.

It was at least two weeks old, and not more than four weeks (probably nearer to four weeks).  It was an unusual and quite serious fracture in this age of baby.   Such a fracture can be caused by a direct blow on to the bent elbow (for example, if the baby is thrown on to the floor) or by a forceful extension of the elbow.  It was more common in older children as it was caused by high velocity impacts such as falling from skateboards.  It could not be caused by shaking.

The fracture would have been caused by excessive and unusual force: something more than heavy-handed or rough handling.  It could not have been caused by an over-extension of the arm while dressing.  If the signs of the fracture had disappeared when Femi was seen by the GP (on 6 October 2005) the fracture would have had to have occurred a week before the visit, but a GP might not pick up a small swelling on the arm.    </p>

First, it is contended that the judge wrongly admitted the evidence of Jane Foster as to her visit on 23 May 2005.  The evidence was admitted pursuant to s.101(1)(c) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 on the basis that it was important explanatory evidence as to the mental capacity of Sophia Rudder.

She described “an extremely unpleasant” incident after she had seen Sophia Rudder through the open bedroom door, and had spoken to her.  During the incident the appellant roughly handled his partner.  He also pushed Ms Foster, verbally abused her, threatened her with a walking stick, and prevented her from leaving the flat.  He eventually let her leave after Sophia Rudder told the appellant in a quiet voice to “Let her go.” After she left, Ms Foster immediately dialled 999 and reported the incident to the police.  At the time Ms Foster noted that “I fear that Ms Rudder and child are at risk and need Social Services assistance immediately.”</p>

We recall his behaviour in the surgery on 18 October 2005.  But it must have been obvious to the jury that the incident concerning Miss Foster did not demonstrate any violence or aggression on the part of the appellant against his own son.  The judge reminded the jury as to why it was admitted, namely, on the question as to whether the defendant Sophia Rudder was able to appreciate risk, and emphasised to the jury that the incident had no relevance at all as to whether or not the appellant had a propensity to be violent.  </p>

According to Escoffrey, the child was aged 3-4 years, whereas he was much younger.  The appellant had apparently spoken of a twisted bone to the police.  According to Escoffrey, the appellant had said that his daughter was bathing his son and that he had been out shopping.  He said that shaking had occurred after he returned from the shop.  None of this bears any relationship to what the appellant in fact said about the circumstances of his son’s collapse. </p>

He said that the appellant had confessed to taking the child by the legs, holding him upside down, and shaking him.  He had confessed to doing this “all the time”.

In his summing-up the judge reminded the jury of the discrepancies between what Escoffrey said and what the prosecution alleged the appellant did to his son.  He reminded the jury of the discrepancies as to the circumstances in which Escoffrey said the confession had been made to him.  But he did leave the matter to the jury in terms that if they were not sure that the confession was true, they should disregard it.  But if, conversely, they were sure it was true, then they could rely upon it.</p>

Dr Jones described the mechanism of a fall which might have caused significant head injury to Femi.  He accepted that there was little data relating to the distance an infant would have to fall to suffer injury to the head.  It would, as we would expect, depend in part upon the surface on which the baby fell.  Dr Jones said that there was general acceptance as to the minimum degree of force (50-60G) as to which Dr Jones was less persuaded and the maximum (100-150G) for fatal damage.  He concluded that there would be a risk of serious head injury should the baby have fallen from a height of 82 centimetres above ground.  That distance would correspond to the height of Sophia Rudder’s shoulder above ground.  In cross-examination Dr Jones accepted that it was difficult, although not impossible, for any biomechanical model to simulate the complex anatomy of an infant’s brain.  Dr Al-Sarraj, called in rebuttal by the Crown, emphasised the difficulty of applying biomechanics to humans.  He emphasised the complexity of the human brain and the difficulty of drawing conclusions from biomechanical experiments.  In any event, he rejected the view that a low-level fall could have caused the extent of the catastrophic injury some two weeks or more before the child’s death.</p>

Dr Jones accepted, both in his oral evidence and in his written report, that there was very little data to be derived from experiment, as we would expect.  He also accepted, both in his oral evidence and in his report, the difficulty of drawing conclusions because of the complexity of a baby’s brain.  This court, in the <span style="font-style:italic">Cherry</span> appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Harris &amp; Others</span> [2006] 1 Cr App R5 heard conflicting evidence from biomechanical engineers, both in relation to the injury to be expected from a fall and the extent to which injury could be caused by shaking (see [81-96]).

For that reason she suggested that the possibility of HIV encephalitis should be explored.  She described the family history as unusual, referring to the fact that the baby’s father came from Nigeria where there was a high incidence of HIV and asserting that the mother was young to have died from multiple sclerosis.  Accordingly, Dr Squier “wondered” whether she may have had HIV rather than MS.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We must emphasise, therefore, that there was no evidence whatever that the condition of Femi had anything to do with HIV.  There was no evidential basis for any such suggestion.  It is, therefore, a matter of regret and surprise that we must record that despite the absence of any evidence of HIV encephalitis and the positive evidence from Professor Bell, who had attracted the praise from Dr Squier which we have recorded, Dr Squier was not prepared, before us, to reject the possibility of HIV encephalitis.  She repeated that HIV had not been excluded and referred to the fact that Femi’s father came from a country where it was endemic.  Dr Squier should not have persisted in that suggestion.  She herself had recommended examination by Professor Bell.  When Professor Bell rejected the suggestion, Dr Squier did not accept that rejection.  Dr Squier’s stance, in oral evidence before us, casts significant doubt upon the reliability of the rest of her evidence and her approach to this case.  It demonstrates, to our satisfaction, that she was prepared to maintain an unsubstantiated and insupportable theory in an attempt to bolster this appeal.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The inadequacies of her evidence were compounded by her persistence in the suggestion that Sophia Rudder might have suffered from HIV and not from MS.  In fact Sophia Rudder had been treated by an eminent neurologist, Dr Foster.  It is not sensible to suggest that that doctor would have attributed Miss Rudder’s condition to MS when in fact she was suffering from HIV.  Dr Squier appeared unaware of Dr Foster’s reputation and saw fit to suggest HIV despite the reputation of Dr Foster and in apparent ignorance of the very fact that Sophia Rudder was being treated by her.  Dr Squier’s approach to that aspect of the evidence supports our views as to the unreliability of her evidence.  She should not have suggested that cause of Sophia Rudder’s condition and death without careful consideration of her treatment by Dr Foster and without informing herself of Dr Foster’s qualifications and reputation.  </p>

The prosecution case alleged two separate head injuries, the first between two to four weeks before the death and the second a head injury leading to the death.  Further, it was alleged that Femi’s left arm had been deliberately broken, either at the time the first head injury was caused or on another occasion.</p>

In particular, all the expert evidence showed that the head injury from which Femi suffered at least two weeks before his death was severe and would have had a catastrophic effect upon his condition.  Femi, as Dr Harding said in evidence, had suffered from significant destruction of the brain several weeks before death.  Thus by the time of either the second injury or the re-bleed he was already severely brain-damaged.  The symptoms would have been severe.  The child, according to Dr Richards, would have had abnormal movement of limbs, would probably suffer from seizures, his cry would have been high-pitched and feeding would be very weak.  He would barely be able to suck.</p>

If that had occurred, it makes the failure of this appellant to report the catastrophic effect on his son inexplicable.

But we reject the submission on behalf of the appellant that it matters.  Nor do we think of particular significance the issue whether the second brain injury was a result of a re-bleed or secondary bleeding into a pre-existing site of brain injury, or a second brain injury.  Of course, if the prosecution could establish three separate occasions of deliberate injury caused to the baby, that would be powerful evidence of murderous intent.  </p>

The combination of the severity of the injury to the brain and the fracture to the arm, even if they were caused on the same occasion, not only establishes that the perpetrator was not the disabled mother, but rather that it was this appellant.  The nature and severity of the injury, particularly to the left arm, is a sufficient basis to establish a murderous intent.  That evidence is further supported by the absence of any reaction, let alone any report, of the condition of his son by this appellant when faced with the cries of pain of his son and the apparent effect, which we have described, of the first injury to the baby’s head.</p>

In Henderson that process established, for the reasons we have given, the guilt of the appellant.  By contrast, in Butler there was no logically justifiable basis upon which a reasonable jury properly directed could conclude that the expert evidence adduced by the Crown established guilt.

He emphasised that it was for the jury to evaluate the expert evidence even where the experts disagree as to the existence of the symptoms upon which their opinions were based [88-89].  But how is a jury to approach conflicting expert evidence?  We suggest it can only do so if that evidence is properly marshalled and controlled before it is presented to the jury.  Unless the evidence is properly prepared before the jury is sworn it is unlikely that proper direction can be given as to how the jury should approach that evidence.  Thus the jury will be impeded in considering that evidence in a way which will enable them to reach a logically justifiable conclusion.</p>

First, we suggest that the judge who is to hear a particular case should deal with all pre-trial hearings, save for those in which no issue of substance is to be considered.  Second, it is desirable that any judge hearing cases such as these, which depend entirely on expert evidence, should have experience of the complex issues and understanding of the medical learning.

He should be in a position to identify whether the expert evidence which either side wishes to adduce is admissible.  This assessment is as difficult as it is important.  The test adopted by this court in <span style="font-style:italic">Harris </span>was described in the judgment of King CJ in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Bonython</span> [1984] 38 SASR 45: First, whether the subject matter of the opinion falls within the class of subjects upon which the expert testimony is permissible and second, whether the witnesses acquired by study or experience have sufficient knowledge of the subject to render their opinion of value in resolving the issues before the court.  <span style="font-style:italic">Bonython</span> was cited by this court in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Reid &amp; Ors</span> [2009] EWCA Crim 2698 [111(i)] with the qualification that it is important that the court acknowledges advances to be gained from new techniques and new advances in science.  <span style="font-style:italic">Reid</span> is concerned with DNA evidence but the observations of the court in relation to the admissibility of expert evidence apply with equal force to cases concerning baby shaking as it applied to the developing science of DNA.  We shall return to emphasise the importance of Part 33 of the Criminal Procedures Rules 2010 in the context of these cases.

The fact that an expert is in clinical practice at the time he makes his report is of significance.  Clinical practice affords experts the opportunity to maintain and develop their experience.  Such experts acquire experience which continues and develops.  Their continuing observation, their experience of both the foreseen and unforeseen, the recognised and unrecognised, form a powerful basis for their opinion.  Clinicians learn from each case in which they are engaged.  Each case makes them think and as their experience develops so does their understanding.  Continuing experience gives them the opportunity to adjust previously held opinions, to alter their views.  They are best placed to recognise that that which is unknown one day may be acknowledged the next.  Such clinical experience, demonstrated, for example, by Dr Peters in the case of Henderson, may provide a far more reliable source of evidence than that provided by those who have ceased to practise their expertise in a continuing clinical setting and have retired from such practice.  Such experts are, usually, engaged only in reviewing the opinions of others.  They have lost the opportunity, day by day, to learn and develop from continuing experience.</p>

Such a meeting will not achieve its purpose unless it takes place well in advance of the trial, is attended by all significant experts, including the defence experts, and a careful and detailed minute is prepared, signed by all participants.  Usually it will be preferable if others, particularly legal representatives, do not attend.  Absent a careful record of the true issues in the case, it is difficult to see how the trial can be properly conducted or the jury properly guided as to the rational route to a conclusion.  The court may be required to exercise its important power to exclude evidence from an expert who has not complied with a direction under [33.6(2), 33.6(4)].  The court should bear in mind the need to employ single joint experts where possible (33.7).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the context of Part 33 we should draw attention to the fact that defence experts are not obliged to reveal a previous report they have made in the case, still less to reveal adverse criticism made by judges in the past.  But a failure to do so will not avail the defence.  A judge may well be able to exercise his powers under the Criminal Procedure Rules to ensure that in advance of a trial a defence expert has made disclosure of any relevant previous reports and any adverse judicial criticism.  Failure to do so would be contrary to the overriding objective and will achieve no more than to expose the expert to cross-examination on those points at trial.  It is difficult to see how those acting on behalf of the defendant could permit an expert report to be advanced without satisfying themselves that previous reports have been disclosed and any adverse judicial criticism identified and disclosed.  Failure to do so by either side will only cast suspicion upon the cogency of the opinion.  A defence team which advances an expert without taking those precautions is likely to damage its client’s case.</p>

Thus the direction of evidence-in-chief, cross-examination and any submissions, either at the close of the prosecution case or in speeches to the jury, should be focussed.  Of course the evidence in such trials, as in any criminal trial, may take on a different colour as the case progresses.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">By the time the judge comes to sum up the case to the jury the issues and the evidence relevant to the issues should be understood by everyone, including the jury.  Whilst it is conventional to discuss the law with counsel, the judge should, generally, take the opportunity to discuss the issues of medical evidence before the time comes for counsel to address the jury.  The judge will thus be in a position carefully to structure his summing-up to those issues.  He will be able to identify which evidence goes to resolution of those issues.  He should generally sum the case up to the jury issue by issue, dealing with the opinions and any written sources for those opinions issue by issue, unless there is good reason not to do so.  Merely repeating the expert evidence in the order in which that evidence was given serves only to confuse.  It is pointless, literally.  It deflects the jury from their task.  It does not save them, as they must be saved, from avoidable details.  It blurs their focus on evidence going to the real issues.  The summing-up should enable anyone concerned with an adverse verdict to understand how it has been reached.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the Family Division judges will set out the features of the expert evidence on which a judgment is required and those factors which form the basis of the judgment they have reached.  So too a jury should be confronted with the issues it must decide and the factors they should consider as the basis for judgment, one way or the other.  Anyone reading a summing-up composed in that way should be able to understand the route followed by the jury in reaching its verdict. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There are two features of the content of a summing-up in cases such as these which, we suggest, are important.  First, a realistic possibility of an unknown cause must not be overlooked.  In cases where that possibility is realistic, the jury should be reminded of that possibility.  They should be instructed that unless the evidence leads them to exclude any realistic possibility of an unknown cause they cannot convict.  In cases where it is relevant to do so, they should be reminded that medical science develops and that which was previously thought unknown may subsequently be recognised and acknowledged.  As it was put by Toulson LJ, “today’s orthodoxy may become tomorrow’s outdated learning” (<span style="font-style:italic">R v Holdsworth</span> [2008] EWCA Crim 971 at [57]).  In cases where developing medical science is relevant, the jury should be reminded that special caution is needed where expert opinion evidence is fundamental to the prosecution [57].</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, the jury need directions as to how they should approach conflicting expert evidence.  <span style="font-style:italic">Kai-Whitewind </span>teaches that the mere fact that expert differs from expert is no ground for withdrawing the case from the jury.  But how is the jury to approach such a conflict?  To suggest, in cases where the expert evidence is fundamental to the case, that the jury should approach that expert opinion in the same way as they do in every other criminal case, is inadequate.  It is difficult enough for Family Division judges to express their reasons for accepting or rejecting conflicting expert evidence, despite their experience.  Juries, we suggest, should not be left in cases requiring a higher standard of proof to flounder in the formation of a general impression.  A conclusion cannot be left merely to impression.  In the appeal of Henderson, Dr Leestma gave, if we may say so, a most beguiling impression, courteous and understated as it was.  But there were, as we have concluded, sound reasons relating to his experience in comparison with Dr Al-Sarraj for rejecting what he told us.  Lacking the experience of Family Division judges, a jury needs to be directed as to the pointers to reliable evidence and the basis for distinguishing that which may be relied upon and that which should be rejected.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In <span style="font-style:italic">Harris</span> the court pointed out the assistance given by Cresswell J [271].  That guidance is of assistance not only to judges, practitioners and experts themselves, but also to a jury.   If the issue arises, a jury should be asked to judge whether the expert has, in the course of his evidence, assumed the role of an advocate, influenced by the side whose cause he seeks to advance.  If it arises, the jury should be asked to judge whether the witness has gone outside his area of expertise.  The jury should examine the basis of the opinion.  Can the witness point to a recognised, peer-reviewed, source for the opinion?  Is the clinical experience of the witness up-to-date and equal to the experience of others whose evidence he seeks to contradict?  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Of course, none of these features will determine the case.  Not all of these features are even relevant in every case.  But we seek to emphasise the importance of guiding the jury as to the proper approach to conflicting opinions.  An overall impression can never be the substitute for a rational process of analysis.  The jury are not required to produce reasons for their conclusion.  Nevertheless, the judge should guide them by identifying those reasons which would justify either accepting or rejecting any conflicting expert opinion on which either side relies.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We acknowledge the danger of being over-prescriptive in relation to directions to the jury.  But judges, we suggest, need to remember that their directions are part of the means by which they ensure that a case which depends on expert evidence proceeds to its conclusion on a logically justifiable basis.</p>
