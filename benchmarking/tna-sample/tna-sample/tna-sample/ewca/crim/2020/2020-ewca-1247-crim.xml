He was convicted of the offence on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2019 after a trial in the Crown Court at King’s Lynn. He was acquitted of a multiple incident count of rape against the same girl, alleging at least four further rapes (count 6). He was also acquitted of a single count of rape of another girl at the children’s home (count 4). The jury were unable to agree on verdicts in respect of other counts on the indictment alleging sexual assaults at the children’s home against three boys. There is to be a retrial on those counts. The appellant has not been sentenced, pending the outcome of the retrial.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.64in;margin-right:0.00in">The appellant is now 80 years of age. As is often the case with historic allegations of sexual abuse in residential establishments, one of the difficulties faced by the appellant and those representing him was the lack of contemporaneous documentation which might shed light on relevant issues. This appeal is principally concerned with the adequacy of the process of disclosure of unused material and the impact of that on the fairness of the trial and the safety of the conviction. It is part of the background to the case, as the jury heard in evidence, that the appellant had previously been convicted in 1995 of sexual offences against five other girls at the same children’s home in the period 1977 to 1981, in respect of which he still protests his innocence. The appellant had served a sentence of 14 years’ imprisonment for those offences. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.64in;margin-right:0.00in">Ms Tania Griffiths QC has represented the appellant throughout. She submitted to the trial judge, His Honour Judge Shaw, that a fair trial was not possible and would amount to an abuse of process. She applied for a stay of the indictment. Mr Edward Renvoize, who has appeared throughout for the Crown, opposed that application. The judge deferred his ruling until the close of the prosecution case. Following full legal argument he refused the stay and the trial proceeded. He was satisfied that any prejudice arising from the delay and from the consequent absence of potentially relevant documentation could be cured by the trial process, including his directions to the jury in the summing up. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.64in;margin-right:0.00in">The principal ground of appeal is that the judge was wrong not to stay the indictment for abuse of process; it is said that the appellant could not have a fair trial in view of the fundamentally flawed disclosure process and the nature and extent of the missing documentation caused by the long delay. A further new ground of appeal was argued, by leave and without objection from the Crown: that the judge’s directions to the jury in the summing up in relation to delay and missing documentation were inadequate, rendering the conviction unsafe.  </p>

Her recollection was that she went to Woodlands at the age of 14, but documentation which came to light during the trial established that in fact she went there in September 1982, when she was 15½ years old. The extent to which her stay at Woodlands overlapped with the appellant’s time there was an important issue for the jury in evaluating her allegations of rape, and this became the principal focus of the appeal. It was an agreed fact by the end of the trial that the appellant had started a new job elsewhere no later than 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> May 1983. It was also an agreed fact, based on documentation which came to light during the trial, that JE had left Woodlands by 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> August 1983. On the face of it, therefore, they overlapped at Woodlands for a maximum of some 7 months, from September 1982 to April 1983.  </p>

Everything was fine for a while, for a couple of months, “… I can’t be dead on this time, you know”. She remembered the first time really clearly, “… because everyone had gone home. I think it was an Easter weekend and nearly everyone had gone home for the holiday… there was only three of us left in the home.”  She said she thought the first incident was on Easter Sunday. The appellant only seemed to be on overnight duty on Saturdays and Sundays and was always on duty with a man called Jim, whose surname she could not recall, who was “really old school… quite old as well.” </p>

He came into her room and started rubbing himself. He shut the door. She was scared. Nothing else happened but he came back about an hour later and told her there was no point in saying anything: “You’re a glue sniffer. You’re all glue sniffers so no-one’s going to believe you.” She said she “would’ve been definitely 14” when this happened. She said this was Easter and she had gone into Woodlands either just before Christmas or just before her birthday (17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March). She enlarged on the detail of this first incident. When he followed her into her room he was “letching round my neck and then … he’s started rubbing his thing… and then he sort of went and touched my face… as if to get me to look into his eyes… and then he just got up and went.”  She said there was no lock on her door. There was never a female member of staff on duty at weekends; the appellant would be on overnight weekend duty every two or three weeks. </p>

She said that the appellant started coming into her room every three or four weeks when she was in bed. He would take his penis out and put his hand under the bed clothes, fondling her. He would put his face close to her, trying to kiss her. She would pretend to be asleep. He would say “I know you’re not asleep”. She described the first time he raped her.  She was lying in bed facing the wall pretending to be asleep. He turned her over. He entered her with his penis and ejaculated. She was a virgin. She remembered that he was wearing “cords” (corduroy trousers), she always remembered cords. He kept his trousers on and just pulled them down. JE said that the first couple of times he raped her in this way, the next morning (which would be Monday, and a school day) she would make an excuse to stay in bed, pretending to be ill. She was bleeding. She didn’t really have any good friends at the time. Later in the ABE interview when asked about his ejaculating on the first occasion she was raped, she said when she went to the toilet it “all come out” and although she wasn’t on a period “I was spotting as well.” She said the appellant was “quite heavy” and “got…quite…frantic as he was ejaculating.” </p>

When he sat on her bed and took out his penis he would rub it and “kind of admire it… like he was..., I don’t know, proud…”. He didn’t get her to do anything else to his penis. She was asked if the appellant did anything else to her. Other than raping her, she said he did not touch her anywhere else on her body, but he used to “force my legs open and… used to ejaculate over me as well sometimes”. He never entered her in any other part of her body, but sometimes he didn’t penetrate her properly and she didn’t know whether his penis had slipped but it “really hurt”. She didn’t even know about anal sex at the time.

She estimated that this would have been about 12 years earlier. Asked whether she had told anyone at Woodlands at the time it was happening, she said that  when she moved to College Road (the half-way house) she had told a girl called Lea (she thought her name was Lea Duval) who was older than her, who said she had gone through the same thing and been physically abused and raped by the appellant. JE said there had been one occasion when another member of staff, called Mike, had caught the appellant coming out of her bedroom, doing his belt up. There had been some sort of conversation between the two men. She thought Mike had asked the appellant whether she was all right, and the appellant had replied she was fine. At the end of the ABE interview JE said she felt bad “…because I kind of just… grew accustomed to it, that’s completely the wrong way, I just, I kind of just cut it off, like,… and I got chucked out of school and it all spiralled.” She said the appellant was “so big and overbearing… when you’re in that situation and you’re in care… the things he used to say that he could do, what he would do… I used to get written up for things that I didn’t do.”  </p>

She got dressed quickly, went to investigate and found the appellant in the girls’ living area. He said he had heard a noise. She found that explanation for his presence there strange and concerning. He was wearing a black tracksuit with a white stripe down the leg, and but for the white stripe she might not have seen him.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.60in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Of particular relevance, the material which had already been disclosed referred to an allegation by JE of sexual assault, noted by a psychiatrist (Dr Schneider) on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> December 2010, that she had been raped at the age of 15. The disclosure request schedule (items 64 and 67) asked for further details of this allegation. The prosecution’s reply was to the effect that this must be a reference to the allegation of rape by the appellant in 1982, when she would have been 15 and that she had not made any other complaint of rape to the police. This turned out to be an inaccurate assertion, because it later emerged that there had been another incident of sexual assault, other than at Woodlands, the circumstances of which JE described in her evidence at trial. </p>

The nub of the complaint, so far as JE’s allegations were concerned, was that there had been no disclosure of documentation relating to her time in care and no records such as staff rotas for Woodlands. It was impossible to say with confidence precisely when she had been at Woodlands. There had been inadequate disclosure in relation to her mental health issues, only partially remedied by the further disclosure in response to the Disclosure Request Schedule. There had been no disclosure of counselling records. More generally, all records relating to Woodlands had apparently been destroyed. The absence of such material was all the more prejudicial as the jury would hear about the appellant’s previous trial and conviction for similar offences and that would be the prism through which the jury would view the present case. </p>

Ms Griffiths suggested that JE had said this only in response to prompting by the interviewing officer. JE replied that it came out of the blue when the police came to see her; telling things in great detail to a police officer was difficult; even though she had not forgotten, there were going to be mistakes and she might have said things that weren’t right. She was reminded that she had said in the ABE interview that there were about 10 to 12 rapes in total. JE replied: “I didn’t say they were rapes every time.” The judge intervened to press JE for an answer to Ms Griffiths as to why she had not said at the outset of the ABE interview that the appellant had raped her all these times. She replied that the policeman had just turned up; she was unsure about the situation; it was difficult talking to a male police officer when she had “sort of put it away for so long, I’d never really told anyone.” Ms Griffiths pressed JE on the detail of the rapes. JE said she had never reported the bleeding to anybody, even though the other staff were nice and some were women, and she had her own key worker. JE said that the figure of 10 to 12 times “might be slightly over”. On reflection she thought the minimum was probably about 7 or 8 times adding, “you should just get the file when he was working, and then you’d know”. </p>

A few minutes later, however, after a break in which she presumably took further instructions, Ms Griffiths corrected her earlier suggestion  and  now accepted that the appellant did have some cords in similar colours to those JE had described, but he did not wear them ordinarily to work.

We have no transcript of what the judge said (he would doubtless have discussed the matter with counsel first) but the jury’s question indicates that the issue of dates was very much in the jury’s mind from this early stage. The position was eventually clarified, to an extent at least, in the agreed facts. It was agreed that the appellant took up his new post in Gloucestershire on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> May 1983. The issue which was never resolved on the evidence, because of an absence of documentation, was whether he continued to work at Woodlands in April (i.e. after Easter) in the weeks leading up to starting his new job, there being a possibility that he may have had accrued holiday entitlement which enabled him to finish work at Woodlands sooner.  </p>

Ms Griffiths submits that on these timings the appellant may have had a complete alibi in that he may no longer even have been working at Woodlands when JE says he first raped her. She also submits that in view of the acquittal on count 6,  the jury must have been satisfied that the later series of rapes she alleged cannot have taken place as she described, over a subsequent period of weeks or months, because the appellant had by then left Woodlands. </p>

Prosecuting counsel, Mr Renvoize and his junior, Ms Ascherson, took control of the disclosure exercise and undertook to review all the material themselves. This necessitated a further adjournment. Next morning, Friday 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May, the jury were sent away until Monday 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May.  </p>

Among the documents reviewed by counsel was JE’s application for criminal injuries compensation, dated 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2019. The existence of this document, and a very brief summary of its content, had been included in the MG6C schedule forwarded by the police on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2019: see item 64. The summary stated that in the application JE “… describes the sexual abuse suffered whilst at Woodlands between 1981 and 1983…”. What the summary failed to mention was that in the application JE described not only vaginal rape but also anal and oral rape. The final revised MG6C schedule included this detail, and prosecuting counsel ensured that Ms Griffiths had a full copy of the application. </p>

The involvement of the other two male complainants post-dated this advice, strengthening the inference of collusion. In relation to DL, it emerged that, contrary to his account that the appellant had broken his nose in the course of a violent sexual assault when he was aged 13, there was a medical record (not previously disclosed) of DL reporting a history of having first broken his nose aged 17. In relation to JM, it emerged that, contrary to his insistence in cross-examination that his complaint was not motivated by money, he had told others (recorded in documents not previously disclosed) that he was waiting for a “pay out” and was looking to purchase a plot of land with his anticipated award of  compensation.   </p>

There had been extensive searches on two occasions of 16 separate premises across the county. Some items had recently been found in unmarked cardboard boxes in the basement of County Hall. It was a real challenge to monitor and track old files. He knew there had been fires and floods at premises belonging to the County Council.

Ms Griffiths first asked her about the reference in a social work assessment to her being raped at the age of 15 when her abuser put £10 in her pocket, for which she had been blamed by her parents. This was one of the records in the new disclosure. JE agreed that this was a reference to sexual abuse by someone else, not the appellant. It was not the incident she had mentioned to JC. She denied that it was possible she was confusing this incident with what she said the appellant had done to her. She said that this incident was not in fact a full rape, but an indecent assault. One Christmas she and a school friend had gone to clean a man’s flat. He had indecently assaulted her (a vibrator was involved) and put £10 in her pocket for the cleaning. When her foster mother found the £10 in her pocket she got into trouble because it was thought she had stolen the money. JE went on to give more detail of the incident. </p>

This was based on the previously undisclosed material. JE agreed that she hated bank holidays and Christmas: “… they’re family days and it just takes me back… that was why…”. She said she had never been subjected to any kind of <span style="font-style:italic">sexual</span> abuse by her adoptive parents and had no idea where that came from. Ms Griffiths put it directly to JE that the reason she was saying that Easter 1983 was the time the appellant had abused her was because Easter was very difficult for her recalling abuse from her adoptive parents at that time.

The challenges to their evidence had been “both robust and thorough”. Ms Griffiths had “left no stone unturned”. The judge noted that until Tuesday 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May he had not been asked to rule on any defence application pursuant to s.8 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996, nor had there been any request for the issue of a witness summons against any third-party requiring the production of records in their possession. Ultimately, however, Mr Watson from Norfolk County Council had given evidence. Prosecuting counsel had undertaken a thorough review of disclosure. It would be open to Ms Griffiths to make “appropriate and measured submissions” to the jury concerning the failure by the police to obtain the more recent medical records sooner.

For example, there was no evidential foundation to enable him to conclude that any complainant had ever engaged in any meaningful counselling or therapy, let alone to conclude that there might somewhere be disclosable records that had not been found. The judge said that Ms Griffiths had been unable “to identify a single document that has actually been lost, a single missing witness who could have given material evidence, or a single document in the possession of the Crown that should been disclosed to her that has not been.” She had identified much that she might have liked to see, but those submissions were akin to “keys to the warehouse” submissions.

The judge said that, on the contrary, in his judgment he had been presiding over a trial that had been scrupulously fair to both sides. Ms Griffiths had been afforded considerable leeway in her cross-examination of the witnesses, and in other respects. No restrictions had been placed on her crossexamination when perhaps they might have been. The judge elaborated on these observations with examples. He recorded that Ms Griffiths had submitted to him that she had made the tactical decision not to cross-examine complainants about material that she would have asked about had it been available to her from the outset, for fear of incurring tacit rebuke from the jury. (We observe that, despite this indication, Ms Griffiths did in fact cross-examine JE the following day on the newly disclosed material, as already outlined). The judge said that he agreed with the Crown’s submission that the new material which had been disclosed could fairly be described as “more of the same”, and nothing that was disclosed late gave rise to any new cross-examination of any real substance. Again, we observe that the judge was giving this ruling before JE had been recalled, and in the expectation that she would not be recalled. The judge said that the matters he described were “…all examples of how our criminal trial process has yet again demonstrated itself capable of coping with non-recent allegations and adapting to ensure fairness to both sides, and I am satisfied so that I am sure that this trial has been fair to both sides.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.60in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The judge said that the allegations in the present case were typical of cases of this kind, where the alleged abuse was not witnessed by any third party. The judge said there was now ample evidence at least that the defendant had the opportunity to commit the offences: “…in truth, records from Woodlands are very unlikely to have assisted at all.” The judge described the “quest for forensic perfection” as admirable, but one rarely achieved. He was sure that a fair trial was possible and was well underway. It would be for the jury in due course to decide whether the prosecution had proved its case or not. In reaching those conclusions the jury would be able to take account of Ms Griffiths’ extensive cross-examination of the complainants and other witnesses, any defence evidence she called, and any submissions she made in her closing speech. It would be for the jury to assess what they made of her several complaints about the police investigation and the disclosure process and how, if at all, those complaints influenced their deliberations and conclusions about the case. We shall return to Ms Griffiths’ criticisms of the judge’s ruling. </p>

He denied all the allegations. He gave a detailed account of his background and work history. He explained that in 1983 his father-in-law became ill and he and his wife decided they should try to move closer to her parents in Somerset. He applied for a job in Gloucestershire. He produced for the jury a letter dated 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span>  March 1983 appointing him to the new role, to commence on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span>  May 1983. He said he would have been expected to give one month’s notice to Norfolk County Council but he did not recall if he worked out his notice as he could not remember whether he might have had holiday entitlement. It was quite likely he  had some days left to take and he would have used up any holiday allowance he had left. He therefore did not know the date of his last working day at Woodlands, but that information would have been available in the records held at the time. </p>

In relation to JE, the appellant said that he did not generally work on Saturday nights but mostly because there weren’t as many children. Surviving registers from 1980 and 1981 showed that on one Saturday in September 1980 there were 6 out of 15 children present at Woodlands; on a Saturday in October 1980, 8 out of 19 children were present. The appellant confirmed that the children who were able to go home to their parents at weekends did so. All this information was subsequently provided to the jury in the agreed facts.

In relation to JE, one of the matters put to the appellant was the similarity between JE’s evidence of threats he made to silence her and the evidence of one of the girls he had been convicted of sexually abusing in the previous trial, to the effect that  the appellant had threatened to send each girl somewhere and there was no point in complaining to anyone. The appellant agreed they must either have told the same lie or made the same mistake. He suggested that JE may have read in a newspaper what the other girl had said in the trial 20 years earlier. </p>

It is important to have in mind the wide variations in the evidence relied on in support of prosecutions: no two trials are the same, and the type, quantity and quality of the evidence differs greatly between cases… Some cases involve consideration of a vast amount of documentation or expert/forensic evidence whilst in others the jury is essentially asked to decide between oral testimony of two or more witnesses, often simply the complainant and the accused. Furthermore, there is no rule that if material has become unavailable, that of itself means the trial is unfair because, for instance, a relevant avenue of enquiry can no longer be explored with the benefit of the missing documents or records. It follows that there is no presumption that extraneous material must be available to enable the defendant to test the reliability of the oral testimony of one or more of the prosecution’s witnesses. In some instances, this opportunity exists; in others it does not. It is to be regretted if relevant records become unavailable, but when this happens the effect may be to put the defendant closer to the position of many accused whose trial turns on a decision by the jury as to whether they are sure of the oral evidence of the prosecution witness or witnesses, absent other substantive information by which their testimony can be tested.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.00in">Ms Griffiths drew our attention to a case which, she submitted, bore similarities to the present case, where this court held that the trial judge had been wrong to refuse a stay: <span style="font-style:italic">R v Burke</span> [2005] EWCA Crim 29. There the defendant was charged with historic sexual offences against several boys in a children’s home where he had worked, 30 years earlier. The trial judge’s refusal to stay the proceedings was upheld in relation to all but one of the complainants, KS. His allegation differed from those of the other complainants in that it related to one single occasion when, on night duty, the defendant was said to have assaulted KS sexually after he was returned to the home by the police at about midnight following an absconding. Available records confirmed that KS had absconded on more than one occasion during the relevant period. If the defendant was on night duty when KS was returned by the police on the occasion in question that would be powerful evidence in support of KS’s allegation. If, on the other hand, the defendant was not on duty that night, then sensibly no jury could properly convict. Absent contemporaneous records from the home or elsewhere, it was not possible to tie down the exact date of the absconding and return. The crucial documents which would have existed and would have shown whether the defendant was on duty (i.e. the duty rota and/or form which would have been signed by whoever was on duty to acknowledge receipt of the boy) were missing.  It was partly for this reason that this court concluded that the defendant had been prevented from having a fair trial, but there was another unconnected reason as well, arising from some fresh evidence which had come to light. Accordingly, the authority is of limited assistance and, in any event, is merely an example of a case which turned on its own facts. </p>

It was only by good fortune that the appellant had himself retained and was able to produce a document confirming the date of his change of employment. Had he not been able to do so, there would have been nothing to contradict JE’s evidence that the rapes continued for a period of many months after the initial incident at Easter 1983. Immediately prior to the retrial in November 2019 the appellant’s personnel file had belatedly come to light in circumstances never satisfactorily explained. The reference in one of the documents to “Term from 17/03/83”  raised the possibility that the appellant had left Woodlands even before Easter 1983.  </p>

These records would undoubtedly have contained information as to the date of JE’s residence at Woodlands, and her move on to her next placement. Such records may even have revealed that JE had left Woodlands soon after her 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday in March 1983 because the only surviving record referred to her moving to further accommodation “at the age of 16”, and there was another record indicating that by 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> August 1983 she was living elsewhere (as set out in the agreed facts).  Ms Griffiths questioned whether, even now, there had been sufficient enquiry to locate such records.

Ms Griffiths acknowledged that the guidance was directed principally at therapy undergone by witness when a trial is already imminent, but she points out that here there was a delay of nearly 5 years between JE’s ABE interview and the trial, during which time she may well have undergone relevant therapy to which the guideline applied. Ms Griffiths also submitted, rather more faintly, that if there had  been proper disclosure of JE’s extensive mental health issues and therapy well before the trial, the defence would have had to consider whether to instruct an appropriate expert (presumably a psychologist) to review the impact of all this. Finally on this topic, Ms Griffiths submitted in her skeleton argument that, had the defence been aware before trial of the full extent of these issues, consideration might have been given to an application to exclude JE’s evidence altogether under s.78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, particularly as there had been a breach by the police  of the relevant codes of practice in failing to make a proper record of the initial conversation between the officer who first saw JE (DC Peter Sayer) several weeks before her ABE interview.  </p>

This compounded the inevitable difficulties faced by the appellant and his legal team in challenging the evidence of the complainants and presenting his defence 36 years or more after the alleged offences. In order to justify the grant of a stay it was for the appellant to show on the balance of probabilities that, by reason of the prosecution’s disclosure failings, the absence of documentation and all the other circumstances resulting from the delay, he would suffer serious prejudice to the extent that a fair trial could not be held.

The possible timing and timeframe for the rapes JE alleged was certainly an issue in the case, but the timeframe was established by the undoubted fact that the appellant must have left Woodlands no later than 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 1983, and this was part of the agreed facts and supported by the letter the appellant himself produced in evidence, a copy of which was provided for the jury.  </p>

But JE made it clear in her ABE interview and in cross-examination that although she <span style="text-decoration:underline">thought</span> the initial incident (with the towel) happened over the Easter weekend, she was not tying herself to that as a date. Mr Renvoize made this same point clear to the jury in his closing speech, apparently without objection from Ms Griffiths.  We also accept that rotas or other contemporaneous documentation might have proved or disproved that the appellant was on overnight duty at weekends with “Jim”, and never with any female member of staff, or shown whether as few as three children  were ever in residence over any given weekend. But these were not, in our judgment, central issues in the context of JE’s allegations as a whole. There was no suggestion, for example, that “Jim” or anyone else, staff member or child, would have been aware of the abuse taking place in the privacy of JE’s single room. </p>

If Ms Griffiths did specifically identify such documents in her oral submissions, we find it strange that the judge should have made the observation in his ruling that Ms Griffiths “has not been able to identify a single document that has actually been lost…” that would have been material, adopting the prosecution’s submission. We appreciate that in her oral submissions Ms Griffiths would have been addressing the issue of serious prejudice in relation to all five complainants and not merely JE, but we remain puzzled that the judge should have made this observation if Ms Griffiths had put this point at the forefront of her submissions, as she does now. Indeed, the judge made the same observation in the summing up, without Ms Griffiths correcting him.  </p>

The jury had heard DS Logue cross-examined on the topic; she had said there was no evidence of any witness having had therapy of the kind mentioned in the joint CPS and Department of Health Guidance on the provision of therapy for vulnerable witnesses.  It is plain that the guidance is really concerned with therapy in the lead up to the trial once the complaint has been made, and the responsibilities of the police and CPS in relation to the complainant as a witness in such circumstances. That was not the situation here. It is true that the guidance identifies psychotherapy, for example, as something which might have a material impact on the evidence of a witness (see para. 4.2 of the guidance), and hypnotherapy (see para.10.3), but the jury were aware from JE’s own evidence that she had undergone such therapy, and Ms Griffiths was able to deal with that point in cross-examination of JE and of the police witnesses, and in her closing speech.  </p>

That said, we accept that Ms Griffiths and her solicitors had commendably gone to great lengths, in the spirit of co-operation required by the overriding objective in the Criminal Procedure Rules, to identify for the prosecution the material that should be obtained and disclosed.   </p>

However, in the end, for the reasons which follow, we are not persuaded that this omission or any other alleged inadequacy renders the summing up defective, or resulted in an unfair trial rendering the conviction on 5 unsafe. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.60in;margin-right:0.06in;text-indent:0.5in">It is particularly important to focus on the real issue for the jury on count 5. The issue was whether the jury could be sure that the appellant had raped JE <span style="font-style:italic">at all</span>, not whether he had raped her on a particular date or between particular dates. JE’s own timing of the first alleged rape as taking place 3 to 4 weeks after the initial towel incident over the Easter weekend (Easter Sunday being 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> April 1983) was in no way conclusive. The accuracy of JE’s timing of the alleged incidents was simply one feature, albeit potentially an important feature, of her general credibility and the truthfulness and accuracy of this allegation. JE made it clear that although she thought this was the correct timing, she was not certain of it. In reminding the jury of her evidence in this regard, the judge nevertheless told the jury (at page 70F) that “it may be important to note that JE is describing an Easter bank holiday weekend rather than just any old weekend…”. That comment favoured the defence rather than the prosecution. </p>

The date of the offence was not a material averment.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.60in;margin-right:0.06in;text-indent:0.5in">We have considered the significance of the acquittal on count 6 (the multiple incident count). Although Ms Griffiths suggests that the acquittal demonstrates that jury must have rejected JE’s evidence on the timing of these subsequent alleged rapes, we think there may well be other explanations. For example, as we have already observed, the route to verdict and the directions of law required the jury to acquit on count 6 even if they were sure there were <span style="font-style:italic">some</span> further rapes, unless they were sure there were <span style="font-style:italic">at least four</span> more. Furthermore, JE had been inconsistent in her evidence as to the number of further rapes: 10 to 12 according to her ABE interview; a minimum of  7 or 8 in her oral evidence. Perhaps most telling of all, in her first account to her former partner of rape at Woodlands by the appellant, she had said (or given him the impression) that she had been raped only on one single occasion. That may well be a complete explanation for the acquittal. But in the end all the acquittal demonstrates is that the jury were not sure that the appellant had raped JE on at least four more occasions. </p>

The jury were made fully aware of the records that were missing. We have already quoted (at [152] above) the passage from the summing up in which the jury were reminded of the appellant’s own evidence that he might well have taken outstanding accrued holiday leave and therefore did not know the date of his last working day at Woodlands which “would have been available in records held at the time”. The judge also reminded the jury of his evidence that: “Sadly there are no records to prove definitively when anyone was there.” Similarly, the jury were well aware of the absence of JE’s social services records; that was the purpose of the questions to Nicholas Loone, establishing that to lose such records was a serious matter, as they contained: “… everything that was important in a child’s life”.  </p>

Their question early on in the case  during JE’s cross-examination (see [53] above), asking for the date the appellant’s employment ended and when he actually left Woodlands,  showed that they were very much alive to the issue. The appellant and JE were, on any view, both at Woodlands together for a period of at least 6 months, from 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> September 1982 (when she arrived) to 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 1983 (her 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday). It was for the jury to decide whether the appellant raped JE at any time during that period (count 5) and, if so, whether they could be sure that he raped her at least 4 more times (count 6). It was not an alibi case. </p>

But there was no suggestion that “Jim”, or any other member of staff or child, had witnessed any inappropriate behaviour by the appellant. These were matters which went to JE’s accuracy and credibility, but no such records (if they had been available) could have proved definitively that JE was not raped by the appellant. The impact of the general prejudice caused by the absence of this material was sufficiently covered by the judge’s directions of law.  </p>

We are quite sure that Ms Griffiths did so. The issue for the jury on count 5 was clear and stark. Were they sure JE was telling the truth in saying the appellant had raped her? The inconsistencies in her evidence were fully explored. The jury nevertheless believed her and disbelieved the appellant. We suspect that her vivid and accurate description of the cord trousers the appellant wore, down to the detail of colours, will have weighed with the jury. It would be an unusual thing for her to remember unless it carried an unforgettable sinister association. The evidence of the complaint to her ex-partner many years ago negated recent fabrication. The incident recalled by Helen Hall supported the general evidence of opportunity, albeit prior to JE’s time at Woodlands. The previous similar offences of which the appellant had been convicted in 1995 provided evidence of propensity.  </p>

The judge observed that the jury had sent no fewer than 32 notes during the course of the trial. The mixed verdicts the jury returned in relation to JE and the other female complainant, and their inability to reach verdicts on the counts relating to the male complainants, all demonstrate the care with which they examined and analysed the evidence.
