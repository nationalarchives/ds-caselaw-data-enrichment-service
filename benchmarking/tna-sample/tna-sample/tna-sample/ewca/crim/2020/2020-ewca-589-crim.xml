CP was adopted by the Price family, and thus had an older brother, Ivor Price, and a younger sister, Christine Price. The appellant and CP first met as teenagers in 1962/3 and were married in August 1967. They had three children: Vanessa (born in March 1968), Jeremy (born in March 1970) and Rachael (born in May 1971) who were aged 8, 6 and 5 respectively at the time of their mother’s disappearance. The elder daughter, Vanessa, was adopted, being the daughter of CP’s sister Christine, who had been strangled to death in April 1969 by her boyfriend, John Rapson, who was sentenced to life imprisonment for her murder. </p>

During that period, she gave no indication that she was unhappy, was seeing anybody else or was intending to leave again. In 1976 both CP (by then aged 30) and the appellant (by then aged 32) were working as teachers. She spoke enthusiastically to work colleagues towards the end of the summer term (which ended on Friday 16 July 1976) about a planned family trip to Blackpool during the school holidays and her work as a teacher in the new term which was due to start in early September 1976. Various friends, neighbours and colleagues recalled the Park family talking about a planned trip to Blackpool on Saturday 17 July 1976. </p>

On what was possibly that Friday, CP visited her sister-in-law, Maureen Price, and her niece Kay Price, at their home in order to pay in some ‘Christmas Club’ money. During the visit, CP said that she would bring Kay a birthday card and a present on the Sunday.  </p>

It was not until Saturday 4 September 1976, that the appellant informed CP’s brother, Ivor Price, that he had not heard from her for six weeks. After that, the appellant had reported to the police that CP was missing – stating that there had been no sign of forced entry or struggle at ‘‘Bluestones’’ when he and the children had returned from Blackpool on Saturday 17 July 1976, and (albeit that he said that he was unsure) that she had not taken any money or clothes.  </p>

She was dressed in a short nightdress and was elaborately bound, using around 20 feet of rope and string, which was tied and bound to her right shoulder blade, wrapped around her body at least three times, and tied with various complicated knots, into a foetal position. The body was enclosed within several layers of different materials. First, a plastic bin liner over the bottom half, and another over the top half, then a green nylon rucksack with padded straps (Exhibit 29) over the bottom half - all of which had then been put into a man-made sack fashioned by sewing up a black pinafore dress (identical to one depicted in photographs of CP taken whilst she was alive). The package had been weighed down by a flattened piece of lead pipe (consistent with having originally been the pipe from a high cistern lavatory) which had been folded over several times to form a mass 12” in length and 6.4kg in weight, and was attached by rope to the middle of the body. </p>

The examinations revealed that the head and neck were skeletonised and that the bones had separated from the rest of the body.  The vertebrae from the neck, together with a large number of small bones from the hands, fragments of the upper jaw and 18 teeth were collected from the plastic bin liner which covered her top half, along with a piece of strapping and two pieces of elastic/plaster material – one of which transpired to be a medical dressing which had originally been put across CP’s eyes. Dr Tapp concluded that there had been several impacts (either kicks or blows from a heavy blunt object, such as an axe or chopper) to CP’s face – with, on reconstruction, the appearance of the teeth and left zygoma suggesting that the object had a sharp edge. The central part of CP’s face had been destroyed by at least two blows from the object in a downward direction. There were also possible defensive injuries to the small bones of CP’s left hand, near to her wrist.  With the exception of the head, neck, hands, and lower forearms the overall structure and integrity of the body had been retained due to the formation of adipocere in the soft tissues. </p>

Dr Tapp also opined that the position of the body, coupled with the process of adipocere formation in the soft tissues, indicated that the body must have been tied up within 2-4 hours of death, before rigor mortis and putrefaction had set in.  In contrast, Dr Lawlor opined that the cause of death was “<span style="font-style:italic">unascertained</span>” because the various post mortem changes precluded determination of the cause of death.  Equally, whilst Dr Lawlor agreed that only direct blunt force trauma could have caused the significant injuries to the lower maxilla, he concluded that there was “<span style="font-style:italic">absolutely no way</span>” to show that those injuries must have occurred before, as opposed to after, death and that consequently there was no way that it could be proved, in pathological terms, that those injuries “<span style="font-style:italic">must relate to the cause of death</span>”.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.30in;margin-right:0.00in">The defence case was that the appellant, who was a man of exemplary good character, had not murdered (or ever been violent towards) CP. On Saturday 17 July 1976 he and their three children had gone to Blackpool for the day. CP was due to accompany them but did not do so because she was unwell. When he had returned home, CP was not there. There was no sign of forced entry or disturbance but her wedding and engagement rings, which she always wore, were on the bedside table. He believed that she had left him again. He had never had any dealings with MW, who was lying. GB’s evidence was obviously untruthful and unreliable. The evidence overall asserted to be consistent with another, including possibly John Rapson (the murderer of CP’s sister), having killed CP, and did not prove that the appellant had killed her. The police were criticised for losing their file from the 1976 missing person investigation, including the appellant’s statement given at the time to DI Williams. </p>

Secondly, that John Rapson (the murderer of CP’s sister), who at that time was being allowed out from prison each weekend, might have gone to Leece to look for his daughter Vanessa, and might have come across and killed CP on the Saturday. </p>

MW made a witness statement that same day, in which he recounted he had been on “F” Wing, where GB had confided in him that the appellant had been talking about the murder in his sleep and was obviously very disturbed about it. After that he had encountered the appellant in the exercise yard, when he had heard the appellant mumbling “<span style="font-style:italic">she deserved it</span>”.  Subsequently, he said, the appellant had approached him in the exercise yard and had confided in him that he had killed his wife with an axe which had a black handle and a metal shaft with a pick on one side and an axe on the other – which he, MW, had recognised from the description as one used for rock climbing.  MW made a further statement on 16th July 2004 in which he said that he had remembered that the appellant had also said that he had buried the axe on the shore of Coniston Water between the boathouse and the water. In his  final statement on 30th November 2004 (made just before he gave his testimony at trial) he said that he had recently further remembered that the appellant had told him that he had come home unexpectedly and had found his wife in bed with another man, that he had tried to hit the man who had run off out of the house, that he had then gone back and hit his wife with an axe used for mountain climbing, and that at the time that he had attacked his wife he had gone up some stairs.

He said he had killed his wife “<span style="font-style:italic">because she should have been reliable to him and not to others</span>” and that she deserved it.  MW said that the appellant had told him that he had put his hands around her neck until she passed out and had then used a weapon (MW had understood him to refer to an ice axe with a black handle and a metal shaft) in order to start to dismember the body, but had stopped and had then wrapped her up. The appellant had said that he put her body in his car and had taken it to Lake Coniston where he had gone out on his boat.  He had later buried the ice axe.  MW added that the appellant had also said he had come home and found his wife in bed with another man who had run out of the house.

There were, however, some elements of MW’s evidence that were supported by common sense and the evidence – the fact that other inmates would have got at the appellant; the fact that the appellant was a primary school teacher; that it was not suggested that an ice-axe had been mentioned in the media or the television documentary.

Mr Webster conceded that much of what GB had said in evidence was unrealistic, that parts of his account were confused; and that some details were clearly wrong. However, Mr Webster submitted, GB had no motive to lie, was trying his best to tell the truth, aspects of what he had said did chime with the evidence, and that the issue had to be addressed as to where he had got those aspects from, if not the appellant. </p>

The judge continued that in GB’s case there were also areas in which his evidence obviously could not be true and which were obviously unsound – namely, his initial suggestion that he had shared a cell with the appellant for some months; his evidence that CP had fallen overboard from a boat; the alleged trip across the water to Blackpool; and the alleged wedding anniversary celebration. </p>

Both had examined the rock and compared it with sample rocks gathered from the nearby shores of Coniston Water and from a wall at ‘Bluestones’.  Dr. Pirrie concluded that the rock and four of the samples recovered from ‘Bluestones’ contained certain recognisable similar characteristics (a calcium bearing rare earth element mineral).  In contrast the samples recovered from the shores of Coniston were of a different composition. </p>

However, there was also, he opined, a high degree of similarity between the rock and three samples from the eastern shore of the lake. Both the rock and those from ‘Bluestones’ came from the same general source, namely the Windermere Supergroup.  He believed that not enough research had been done and that rocks with similar mineral constituents could be more common in the Coniston area. </p>

He posed the question whether Dr Pirrie’s lack of experience meant that his evidence was perhaps less cogent than that of Professor Pye.  It was, the judge explained, for the jury to assess how the expert geological evidence helped them to decide whether, as Mr Webster had put it in closing, it was a strange coincidence that rocks with a calcium bearing rare earth element were found at ‘Bluestones’, and apparently in the one recovered in the lake, but not in the Coniston samples. </p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">We have a number of reasons for arriving at this conclusion. First, the evidence at trial as to how this rock came to be found so as to link it to the body was far from clear.  No witness could say with any confidence how it came to be found. Secondly, the evidence of the experts at trial must have left doubts as to whether it could not have come from the Coniston area. Dr Pirrie, as we have said, accepted that no studies had been carried out of the incidence of the calcium rare earth element in the Lake District and he agreed that he could not exclude the possibility that “it does occur and may occur in rocks in the Coniston area” because detailed work had not been carried out.  Professor Pye’s evidence before the jury was that Dr Pirrie had not “demonstrated satisfactorily” that the same association did not occur in rocks around Coniston shore. So the position after those experts had given their evidence was a long way from being clear-cut and the jury may well have found it very difficult to decide what conclusions could be drawn from this geological evidence. </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">Thirdly, this evidence was only one element in a strong circumstantial case against the appellant.  We have referred to many of those features already. They include motive arising from the established evidence of past marital disharmony, the applicant’s knowledge of knots, his ability as a sailor, and access to a boat (very necessary given the location of the body some distance from the shore), his knowledge of Coniston Water including the part of it directly opposite where the body was found, his lies (some of which were not in dispute), the evidence of a man with some similarities to the applicant seen in a white boat (the same colour as his dingy) pushing a large bundle over the side of the boat in late July 1976 at the eastern side of Coniston, and of considerable significance the clothes found on the body plus the lack of disturbance at home.  An intruder was highly unlikely, given the fact that there was said by the applicant to be no blood at the house and no sign of forced entry; that she was wearing a nightie and that her murderer had had access to her pinafore dress that he used to wrap the body.  Since she was still in her nightie it was also very unlikely that she had gone off from the house voluntarily with someone, especially leaving behind her rings purse and handbag. </span>

MW’s claim that his memory had got worse since 1997 because he had stopped taking hard drugs was significant - as it was his explanation for the shifts in his accounts. Disclosure of the 2004 information would have enabled the appellant to demonstrate in crossexamination that that explanation was a lie on oath to the jury, which would have been a good point for the appellant. Likewise, given the prosecution’s knowledge of that information, MW should not have been re-examined (as he was) in a way that enabled him to say that he had stopped using hard drugs (in 1997) because he wanted to come off them. </p>

If it were the sharp end there would be sharp cuts and damage to the teeth and would be individual and not in groups as we have here.  If you look at the photographs from 20 yrs ago there were scrapes down 2 or 3 so something wider. The ice axe is fairly narrow.  I would like to have seen it again.

If, however, Dr Tapp’s description was accepted, then the narrow edge of the implement (if there was only one) was sharpened to some extent. He observed, nevertheless, that there was at least one relatively clear and crisp lower edge to the fracturing, suggesting an edged implement, and thus a conventional axe could easily have caused the facial injuries. Equally, he concluded, the ice-axe could not be excluded pathologically as the cause of the maxillary fractures - but nor was there any evidence that indicated that the ice-axe must have been the weapon used.  </p>

By the time the Court comes to decide whether the appeal should be allowed or dismissed, it will have heard the evidence, including cross-examination, and any submissions made on its effect. It may then conclude, without doubt, that the evidence cannot be accepted, or cannot afford a ground for allowing the appeal.  Such was the case, for example, in R v Jones (Steven) [1997] 1 Cr.App.R. 86, where the Court, having decided to receive and having heard opinion evidence from an expert, found conclusive objections to the acceptability of that opinion (see p.94).  The Court may, on the other hand, judge the fresh evidence to be clearly conclusive in favour of allowing the appeal. Such might be the case, for example, if a witness who could not be in any way impeached testified, on oath and after all appropriate warnings, that he alone had committed the crime for which the appellant had been convicted.

He also acknowledged that some aspects of MW’s evidence were inconsistent with other evidence, that there was no doubt that MW had some bizarre beliefs, and that he was a man with previous convictions – which were all powerful reasons to treat his evidence with real and extreme caution.  The only elements that Mr Webster was able to rely upon as possibly supporting MW were common sense in relation to other inmates getting at the appellant; the fact that the appellant was a primary school teacher; the fact that it was not suggested that an ice-axe had been mentioned in the media or in the television documentary; and that it was an extraordinary coincidence that it happened that the appellant was a climber and had an ice-axe.  We examine the last point in detail below in relation to Grounds 2 &amp; 3, but observe at this stage that the appellant had an answer to it at trial (see para 75 above) namely that, whilst in HMP Preston, he had spoken about being a climber.  </p>

However, it is clear that it has always been Dr Tapp’s view that the wooden ice-axe cannot be excluded as being the murder weapon, and he is supported in that view by the other three pathologists involved in the appeal. The assertion that the police must have understood that Dr Tapp had excluded an iceaxe is speculative. In any event, and as we have indicated above, it was never suggested by the prosecution that the wooden ice-axe was the murder weapon, and no such impression was ever given, or was ever likely to have been inferred.
