But it is no part of a fair trial that questions of guilt and innocence should be determined by procedural manoeuvres. On the contrary, fairness is best served when the issues between the parties are identified as early and as clearly as possible.  As Lord Justice Auld noted, a criminal trial is not a game under which a guilty defendant should be provided with a sporting chance. It is a search for truth in accordance with the twin principles that the prosecution must prove its case and that a defendant is not obliged to inculpate himself, the object being to convict the guilty and acquit the innocent. </p>

In relation to young and/or vulnerable people, this may mean departing radically from traditional cross-examination. The form and extent of appropriate cross-examination will vary from case to case. For adult non vulnerable witnesses an advocate will usually put his case so that the witness will have the opportunity of commenting upon it and/or answering it.  When the witness is young or otherwise vulnerable, the court may dispense with the normal practice and impose restrictions on the advocate ‘putting his case’ where there is a risk of a young or otherwise vulnerable witness failing to understand, becoming distressed or acquiescing to leading questions. Where limitations on questioning are necessary and appropriate, they must be clearly defined. The judge has a duty to ensure that they are complied with and should explain them to the jury and the reasons for them. If the advocate fails to comply with the limitations, the judge should give relevant directions to the jury when that occurs and prevent further questioning that does not comply with the ground rules settled upon in advance. Instead of commenting on inconsistencies during cross-examination, following discussion between the judge and the advocates, the advocate or judge may point out important inconsistencies after (instead of during) the witness’s evidence. The judge should also remind the jury of these during summing up. The judge should be alert to alleged inconsistencies that are not in fact inconsistent, or are trivial. </p>

This is consistent with CrimPR 3.9(3)(b) (see paragraph 3D.2 above); consistent with the observations in R v Cox (see paragraph 3D.4 above), R (OP) v Ministry of Justice [2014] EWHC 1944 (Admin) and R v Rashid [2017] EWCA Crim 2; and consistent with the arrangements contemplated at paragraph 3G.8 below. </p>

For example, a photograph may provide a helpful reminder to a witness whose court visit has taken place sometime earlier.

It applies to an application to authorise the carriage of firearms or tasers in court for security purposes. It does not apply to officers who are carrying CS spray or PAVA incapacitant spray, which is included in the standard equipment issued to officers in some forces and therefore no separate authorisation is required for its carriage in court. Likewise, no separate authorisation is required for officers carrying tasers as part of their operational equipment where they are attending court on routine court business or to give evidence.  If, however, the carrying of tasers is part of a tactical deployment for security purposes then an application must be made in accordance with the following provisions to ensure the court is aware of the arrangements sought. </p>

In deciding whether to require a defendant to attend a first hearing in a magistrates’ court by live link from a police station, the court should take into account any views expressed by the defendant, the terms of any mental health or other medical assessment of the defendant carried out at the police station, and all other relevant information and representations available. No single factor is determinative, but the court must keep in mind the terms of section 57C(6A) of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 (Use of live link at preliminary hearings where accused is at police station) which provides that ‘A live link direction under this section may not be given unless the court is satisfied that it is not contrary to the interests of justice to give the direction. </p>

Thus for the purposes of such a hearing there is no legal obstacle to the judge, magistrate or magistrates conducting it from elsewhere, with other participants assembled in a courtroom from which the member or members of the court are physically absent. In principle, nothing prohibits the conduct of a pre-trial hearing by live link or telephone with each participant, including the member or members of the court, in a different location (an arrangement sometimes described as a ‘virtual hearing’). This is dependent upon there being means by which that hearing can be witnessed by the public – for example, by public attendance at a courtroom or other venue from which the participants all can be seen and heard (if by live link), or heard (if by telephone).

Open justice is the principal means by which courts are kept under scrutiny by the public. It follows that where a participant attends a hearing in public by live link or telephone then that person’s participation must be, as nearly as may be, equally audible and, if applicable, equally visible to the public as it would be were he or she physically present. Where electronic means of communication are used to conduct a hearing, records of the event must be maintained in the usual way: CrimPR 5.4.

Those details will be made available locally to those who need them. Nor does this guidance contain detailed instructions about the individual responsibilities of court staff, police officers and prison staff because those are matters for court managers, Chief Constables and HM Prison Governors. </p>

In the case of a live link, attention will need to be given to lighting and to making sure that those attending by live link can see and hear clearly what takes place in the courtroom without being distracted by the movement of court staff, legal representatives or members of the public, or by noise inside the courtroom. The sensitivity and positioning of the courtroom microphones may mean that even the movement of papers, or the operation of keyboards, while barely audible inside the courtroom itself, is clearly audible and distracting to a witness or defendant attending by live link or telephone. </p>

It applies to a room within the court building, but separated from the courtroom itself, from which a witness can give evidence by live link; it applies to such a room at a police station or elsewhere which has been set aside for regular use for such a purpose; and it applies to a van or other vehicle which has been adapted for use as a mobile live link room. However, that paragraph does not apply to the courtroom itself; it does not apply to a place from which a witness gives evidence, or a participant takes part in the proceedings, by live link or telephone, if that place is not regularly used for such a purpose (but see paragraph 7 beneath); and it does not apply in a prison or other place of detention (as to which, see paragraph 12 beneath). The objective is to ensure that anyone who participates by live link or telephone is conscious of the gravity of the occasion and of the authority of the court, and realises that they are required to conduct themselves in the same respectful manner as if they were physically present in a courtroom. </p>

In any such case it is essential that the parties anticipate the arrangements and directions that may be required.

It is particularly important to make sure that documents and images which are to be displayed by electronic means in the courtroom will be accessible to the witness too.

Section 86A(3) of the Act makes it an offence for the defendant without reasonable excuse to fail to comply with such a requirement, whether by providing false or incomplete information or by providing no information.  A person guilty of such an offence is liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months, or to a fine, or both.  It follows that a prosecution for failure to comply with a section 86A requirement may be brought by any of the procedures for which CrimPR Part 7 provides (Starting a prosecution in a magistrates’ court) in the same way as any other allegation of a summary offence. </p>

Where the defendant’s conduct evinces guilt, especially if the defendant refuses altogether to give the information required, such conduct undermines the administration of justice and the authority of the court.  In principle, it should be dealt with at once.  Section 86A(6) of the Act provides that, ‘The criminal court before which a person is required to provide his or her name, date of birth and nationality may deal with any suspected offence under subsection (3) at the same time as dealing with the offence for which the person was already before the court’.  In such a case, therefore, a magistrates’ court may invite the prosecutor to institute proceedings orally, there and then, pursuant to section 1 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and CrimPR Part 7, and may there and then try the alleged offence in accordance with the rules in CrimPR Part 24 (Trial and sentence in a magistrates’ court).  A defendant should be allowed a reasonable opportunity to reflect and to take legal advice, from a duty solicitor if the defendant has no legal representative in the prosecution for the main offence.  After that, unless the defendant then pleads guilty the prosecutor must call such evidence as may be convenient and sufficient, in the prosecutor’s view, formally to prove the allegation; and the defendant may present evidence, for example of reasonable excuse, and may make representations in accordance with those rules. </p>

There are exceptions but these ‘have to be justified by some even more important principle.’  However, the practical application of that undisputed principle, and the proper balancing of conflicting rights and principles, call for careful judgments to be made.

If the only reason for delivering a decision in that way is to promote efficiency and expedition and if no other consideration arises then usually a copy of the decision should be provided in response to any request once the decision is final.  However, had the decision been announced in public then the criteria in CrimPR 5.8(4)(a) would have applied to the supply of information by the court officer; and ordinarily those same criteria should be applied by the court, therefore.  Moreover, where considerations other than efficiency and expedition have influenced the court’s decision to reach a determination without convening a hearing then those same considerations may be inimical to the supply of the written decision to any applicant other than a party.  Reporting restrictions may be relevant, for example; as may the considerations listed in paragraph 5B.9 above.  In such a case the court should consider supplying a redacted version of the decision in response to a request by anyone who is not a party; or it may be appropriate to give the decision in terms that can be supplied to the public, supplemented by additional reasons provided only to the parties. </p>

Statutory restrictions prohibit publication ‘to the public at large or any section of the public’, or some comparable formulation. They do not ordinarily prohibit a publication constituted only of the supply of transcript to an individual applicant.  However, any reporting restrictions will continue to apply to a recipient of transcript, and where they apply the recipient must be alerted to them by the endorsement on the transcript of a suitable warning notice, to this or the like effect: </p>

Circumstances giving rise to concern may include, for example, the occurrence of events causing staff reasonably to suspect that an applicant intends or is likely to disregard a reporting restriction that applies, despite the warning notice endorsed on the transcript, or reasonably to suspect that an applicant has malicious intentions towards another person.  Given that the proceedings will have taken place in public, despite any such suspicions cogent and compelling reasons will be required to deny a request for transcript of such proceedings and the onus rests always on the court to justify such a denial, not on the applicant to justify the request.  Even where there are reasons to suspect a criminal intent, the appropriate course may be to direct that the police be informed of those reasons rather than to direct that the transcript be withheld.  Nevertheless, it may be appropriate in such a case to direct that an application for the transcript should be made which complies with paragraph 5B.8 above (even though that paragraph does not apply); and then for the court to review that application with regard to </p>

If, for example, there is reason to believe that notes are being taken in order to influence the testimony of a witness who is due to give evidence, perhaps by briefing that witness on what another witness has said, then because such conduct is unlawful (it is likely to be in contempt of court, and it may constitute a perversion of the course of justice) it is within the court’s power to prohibit such note taking. If there is reason to believe that what purports to be taking notes with an electronic device is in fact the transmission of live text-based communications from court without the permission required by paragraph 6C.7 of these Practice Directions, or where permission to transmit such communications has been withdrawn under paragraph 6C.14, then that, too, would constitute grounds for prohibiting the taking of such notes. </p>

If no magistrates’ court is due to sit on the day on which the defendant is charged, or on the next day which is not a Sunday, Christmas Day or Good Friday, then the Act requires the police custody officer to inform the court’s designated officer of the defendant’s detention, and requires the designated officer to arrange for a magistrates’ court to sit.</p>

In practice, to allow sufficient time for consultation with a legal representative and for the subsequent hearing, the defendant must have been brought to the court building, or given access to a live link to the court, by no later than 3.30pm. To that end, Judicial Business Groups must ensure that effective practical arrangements have been made between police forces, HMCTS, the Crown Prosecution Service and prisoner escort contractors for the prompt transmission of information about defendants held for production before the court. </p>

For the same reason, CrimPR 3.22 requires only that any paper copy of an indictment which in fact has been made must be endorsed with a note of the order and of its date where the court makes an order for joint or separate trials affecting that indictment or makes an order for the amendment of that indictment in any respect. </p>

However, if an indictment charges more than one offence, and if at least one of those offences does not meet those criteria, then CrimPR 3.21(4) cites that circumstance as an example of one in which the court may decide to exercise its power to order separate trials under section 5(3) of the Indictments Act 1915. It is for the court to decide which allegations, against whom, should be tried at the same time, having regard to the prosecutor’s proposals, the parties’ representations, the court’s powers under the 1915 Act (see also CrimPR 3.21(4)) and the overriding objective. Where necessary the court should be invited to exercise those powers.  It is generally undesirable for a large number of counts to be tried at the same time and the prosecutor may be required to identify a selection of counts on which the trial should proceed, leaving a decision to be taken later whether to try any of the remainder. </p>

Using a ‘multiple incidents’ count may be an appropriate alternative to using ‘specimen’ counts in some cases where repeated sexual or physical abuse is alleged.

The certificate of full argument is produced by the magistrates’ court’s computer system, Libra, as part of the GENORD (General Form of Order).  Two hard copies are produced, one for the defence and one for the prosecution. (Some magistrates’ courts may also produce a manual certificate which will usually be available from the justices’ legal adviser at the conclusion of the hearing; the GENORD may not be produced until the following day.) Under CrimPR 14.4(4), the magistrates’ court officer will provide the defendant with a certificate that the court heard full argument.  However, it is the responsibility of the defence, as the applicant in the Crown Court, to ensure that a copy of the certificate of full argument is provided to the Crown Court as part of the application (CrimPR 14.8(3)(e)).  The applicant’s solicitors should attach a copy of the certificate to the bail application form.  If the certificate is not enclosed with the application form, it will be difficult to avoid some delay in listing. </p>

The resulting delays impact on victims, witnesses and other court users and also waste costs.  A defendant’s failure to surrender affects not only the case with which he or she is concerned, but also the court’s ability to administer justice more generally, by damaging the confidence of victims, witnesses and the public in the effectiveness of the court system and the judiciary.  It is, therefore, most important that defendants who are granted bail appreciate the significance of the obligation to surrender to custody in accordance with the terms of their bail and that courts take appropriate action, if they fail to do so. </p>

This should be obtained in advance of the hearing and conveyed to the court through the defendant’s legal representative.  In order to minimise the disruption to the court and to others, particularly witnesses if the case is listed for trial, the defendant should notify the court through his legal representative as soon as his inability to attend court becomes known. </p>

This is likely to be practicable in the magistrates' court where cases can easily be transferred from one magistrates' court to another.  Practice is likely to vary in the Crown Court.  If the defendant appears before a different court, for example because he is charged with offences committed in another area, and it is not practicable for all matters to be concluded by that court then the defendant may be remanded on bail or in custody, if appropriate, to appear before the first court for the outstanding offences to be dealt with.    </p>

Considerable care must be taken to explain that obligation and the consequences before a surety is taken. This system, in one form or another, has great antiquity. It is immensely valuable. A court concerned that a defendant will fail to surrender will not normally know that defendant personally, nor indeed much about him. When members of the community who do know the defendant say they trust him to surrender and are prepared to stake their own money on that trust, that can have a powerful influence on the decision of the court as to whether or not to grant bail. There are two important side-effects. The first is that the surety will keep an eye on the defendant, and report to the authorities if there is a concern that he will abscond. In those circumstances, the surety can withdraw. The second is that a defendant will be deterred from absconding by the knowledge that if he does so then his family or friends who provided the surety will lose their </p>

It is possible that any defendant who apparently absconds may have a defence of reasonable cause to the allegation of failure to surrender.  If that happens, then any surety or security estreated would be returned. The reason for proceeding is that the defendant may never surrender, or may not surrender for many years.  The court should still consider the sureties’ obligations if that happens. Moreover, the longer the matter is delayed the more probable it is that the personal circumstances of the sureties will change. </p>

This will occur either because a witness has made more than one statement whose contents should conveniently be reduced into a single, comprehensive statement, or where a statement contains inadmissible, prejudicial or irrelevant material.  Editing of statements must be done by a Crown Prosecutor (or by a legal representative, if any, of the prosecutor if the case is not being conducted by the Crown Prosecution Service) and not by a police officer. </p>

Under that Code, interviews must normally be contemporaneously recorded.  Under PACE Code E, interviews conducted at a police station concerning an indictable offence must normally be audio-recorded.  In practice, most interviews are audiorecorded under Code E, or video-recorded under Code F, and it is best practice to do so.  The questioning of terrorism suspects is governed separately by Code H.  The Codes are available electronically on the Home Office website. </p>

In the magistrates’ court, the Bench sometimes retire to read the interview themselves, and the document is treated as if it had been read aloud in court.

If not already done, a respondent defendant should serve a defence statement under section 5 or 6 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996, so that the court is fully informed of what is in issue.  When a defendant makes an application for a witness anonymity order the prosecutor should consider the continuing duty to disclose material under section 7A of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996; therefore a prosecutor’s response should include confirmation that that duty has been considered.  Great care should be taken to ensure that nothing disclosed contains anything that might reveal the witness’ identity.  A respondent prosecutor should provide the court with all available information relevant to the considerations to which the Act requires a court to have regard, whether or not that information falls to be disclosed under the 1996 Act. </p>

However, a hearing may not be needed if none is sought: CrimPR 18.18(1)(a).  Where, for example, the witness is an investigator who is recognisable by the defendant but known only by an assumed name, and there is no likelihood that the witness’ credibility will be in issue, then the court may indicate a provisional decision and invite representations within a defined period, usually 14 days, including representations about whether there should be a hearing. In such a case, where the parties do not object the court may make an order without a hearing.  Or where the court provisionally considers an application to be misconceived, an applicant may choose to withdraw it without requiring a hearing.  Where the court directs a hearing of the application then it should allow adequate time for service of the representations in response. </p>

In the Crown Court, a recording of the proceedings will be made, in accordance with CrimPR 5.5.  The Crown Court officer must treat such a recording in the same way as the recording of an application for a public interest ruling.

	    <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.05in;text-indent:0.00in">In a series of decisions the Court of Appeal has made it clear that there has to be a different and fresh approach to the cross-examination of, in particular, children of tender years, and witnesses who are vulnerable as a result of mental incapacity. The following propositions have support in decisions on appeal: (<span style="font-style:italic">R v B 2010 EWCA Crim 4; R v F 2013 EWCA Crim 424; Wills v R 2011 EWCA Crim 1938; R v Edwards 2011 EWCA Crim 3028; R v Watts 2010 EWCA Crim 1824; R v W and M 2010 EWCA Crim 1926) </span></p>

Such an approach risks confusion in the minds of the witness whose evidence was bound to take centre stage, and it is difficult to see how it can be helpful. We struggle to understand how the defendant's right to a fair trial was in any way compromised simply because Mr X was not allowed to ask the question ' Simon did not punch you in the way you suggest?”</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.05in">It is particularly important in the case of a child witness to keep a question short and simple, and even more important than it is with an adult witness to avoid questions which are rolled up and contain, inadvertently two or three questions at once. It is generally <span style="font-size:48pt;color:#928D60"> </span>recognised that, particularly with child witnesses, short and untagged questions are best at eliciting the evidence. By untagged we mean questions that do not contain a statement of the answer which is sought. That said, when it comes to directly contradicting a particular statement and inviting the witness to face a directly contradictory suggestion, it may often be difficult to examine otherwise. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.05in">No doubt if a way can be found of engaging the witness to tell the story, and the content then differs from what had been said before, that will be a yet better indication that the original account is wrong. But that is difficult to achieve and indeed may itself have the disadvantage of prolonging the child's time giving evidence. Even then there may be no guarantee as to which account is the more reliable. </p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.05in">Most of the questions which produced the answers which were chiefly relied upon, unlike many others, constituted the putting of direct suggestions with an indication of the answer ' this happened didn't it '? Or “this didn't happen, did it?” The consequence of that is that it can be very difficult to tell whether the child is truly changing her account or simply taking the line of least resistance. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.05in">At the same time the right of the defendant to a fair trial must be undiminished. When the issue is whether the child is lying or mistaken, when claiming that the defendant behaved indecently towards him or her, it should not be over problematic for the advocate to formulate short, simple questions, which put the essential elements of the defendant’s case to the witness, and fully ventilate before the jury the areas of evidence which bear on the child's credibility. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.05in">Aspects of evidence which undermine or are believed to undermine the child's credibility must, of course, be revealed to the jury. However it is not necessarily appropriate for them to form the subject matter of detailed cross-examination of the child, and the advocate may have to forego much of the kind of contemporary cross-examination which consists of no more than comment on matters which will be before the jury, in any event, from different sources. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.05in">Notwithstanding some of the difficulties; when all is said and done, the witness whose cross-examination is in contemplation is a child, sometimes very young, and it should not take very lengthy cross examination to demonstrate, when it is the case, that the child may indeed be fabricating, or fantasising, or imagining, or reciting a well-rehearsed untruthful script, learned by rote; or simply just suggestible, or contaminated by or in collusion with others to make false allegations, or making assertions in language which is beyond his or her level of comprehension; and are therefore likely to be derived from another source. Comment on the evidence, including comment on evidence which may bear adversely on the credibility of the child, should be addressed after the child has finished giving evidence. </p>

The common law, therefore, remains the source of the criteria by reference to which the court must assess the admissibility and weight of such evidence; and  CrimPR 19.4  lists those matters with which an expert’s report must deal, so that the court can conduct an adequate such assessment. </p>

If there is then the court leaves the opposing views to be tested before the jury.” Nothing at common law precludes assessment by the court of the reliability of an expert opinion by reference to substantially similar factors to those the Law Commission recommended as conditions of admissibility, and courts are encouraged actively to enquire into such factors. </p>

Sections 36 and 38 are all about protecting vulnerable witnesses from cross examination by the accused.  Therefore, it should not be thought that an advocate appointed under section 38 has a free ranging remit to conduct the trial on the accused's behalf. Their professional duty and their statutory duty would be to ensure that they are in a position properly to conduct the cross examination.  Their duties might include therefore applications to admit bad character of the witness and or applications for disclosure of material relevant to the cross examination. That is as far as one can go. All these matters must be entirely fact specific.  The important thing to note is that the section 38 advocate must ensure that s/he performs his/her duties in accordance with the words of the statute.   </p>

Technically the lawyer no longer has a role in the proceedings thereafter.  However, if the lawyer is prepared to stay and assist the defendant on a pro bono basis, I see nothing in the Act and no logical reason why the court should oblige them to leave.  The advocate may well prove beneficial to the efficient and fair resolution of the proceedings.   </p>

The court will expect communication between the parties and with the court regarding any issues which are likely to affect the effectiveness of any trial: CrimPR 3.2(2)(b)-(e). In particular, any revision of the information provided in the preparation for effective trial form must be reported to the court and each other party well in advance of the trial, not at trial or shortly before; and in considering any application to adjourn a trial the court will regard as especially significant any failure in this respect.  Any communication should clearly identify the issue and any direction sought and should require reference to a legal adviser or case progression officer.  The parties and other participants are entitled to expect the court and its staff to adhere to CrimPR 1.3 (The application by the court of the overriding objective) and to conduct its business accordingly. If relevant Criminal Procedure Rules, Criminal Practice Directions and judicial directions for trial preparation are followed, an effective trial on the date arranged will be the result. </span>

However, there will be occasions on which, on the day set for trial, the court is invited without prior warning to adjourn to another day in consequence of an event or events said to make it unjust to proceed as planned; and in some circumstances it may have been necessary to arrange to hear a contested application to adjourn a trial on the very date on which that trial is due to begin (though before making such arrangements the court should have kept in mind the need to make time available for other cases, too, where the time available for the trial will be abbreviated by the time required to hear the application to adjourn it). </span>

The court is not obliged to investigate if no reason is offered.  In assessing where the interests of justice lie the court will take into account all factors, including such reasons for absence as may be offered; the reliability of the information supplied in support of those reasons; the date on which the reasons for absence became known to the defendant; and what action the defendant thereafter took in response.

To that end, prosecution opening speeches are invaluable. They set out for the jury the principal issues in the trial, and the evidence which is to be introduced in support of the prosecution case. They should clarify, not obfuscate. The purpose of the prosecution opening is to help the jury understand what the case concerns, not necessarily to present a detailed account of all the prosecution evidence due to be introduced. </p>

Any such identification of issues at this stage is not to be treated as a substitute for or extension of the summary of the defence case which can be given later, under CrimPR 25.9(2)(g). Its purpose is to provide the jury with focus as to the issues that they are likely to be called upon to decide, so that jurors will be alert to those issues from the outset and can evaluate the prosecution evidence that they hear accordingly. For that purpose, the defendant is not confined to what is included in the defence statement (though any divergence from the defence statement will expose the defendant to adverse comment or inference), and for the defendant to take the opportunity at this stage to identify the issues may assist even if all he or she wishes to announce is that the prosecution is being put to proof. </p>

Giving such directions at the outset is another means by which the jury can be helped to focus on the significant features of the evidence, in the interests of a fair and effective trial. </p>

Given the advantages described above, usually the court should extend such an invitation but there may be circumstances in which, in the court’s judgment, it furthers the overriding objective not to do so. Potential reasons for denying the defendant the opportunity at this stage to address the jury about the issues include (i) that the case is such that the issues are apparent; (ii) that the prosecutor has given a fair, accurate and comprehensive account of the issues in opening, rendering repetition superfluous; and (iii) where the defendant is not represented, that there is a risk of the defendant, at this early stage, inflicting injustice on him or herself by making assertions to the jury to such an extent, or in such a manner, as is unfairly detrimental to his or her subsequent standing.  </p>

The power to do this is implicit in section 16(1) of the Juries Act 1974.  In unusual cases (such as an unexpected emergency arising overnight) a juror need not be discharged in open court.  The good administration of justice depends on the co-operation of jurors, who perform an essential public service.

Any discussion must, however, be between the judge and the advocates on both sides.  If an advocate is instructed by a solicitor who is in court, he or she, too, should be allowed to attend the discussion.  This freedom of access is important because there may be matters calling for communication or discussion of such a nature that the advocate cannot, in the client's interest, mention them in open court, e.g. the advocate, by way of mitigation, may wish to tell the judge that reliable medical evidence shows that the defendant is suffering from a terminal illness and may not have long to live.  It is imperative that, so far as possible, justice must be administered in open court.  Advocates should, therefore, only ask to see the judge when it is felt to be really necessary.  The judge must be careful only to treat such communications as private where, in the interests of justice, this is necessary.  Where any such discussion takes place it should be recorded, preferably by audio recording. </p>

So far as the summing-up is concerned, it is inadvisable for the judge, and indeed for advocates, to attempt an explanation of the section for fear that the jury will be confused.   </p>

The procedure will have to be repeated in respect of each count (or alternative verdict), the verdict being accepted in those cases where the jury are unanimous and the further direction being given in cases in which they are not unanimous. The judge may exercise discretion in deciding when to record the unanimous verdict; the circumstances of the case may dictate that it is more desirable to give the majority direction before the recording of any unanimous verdicts. If so, then instead of being asked about each count in turn, the jury should be asked “Have you reached verdicts upon which you are all agreed in respect of all defendants and/or all counts?”</p>

The statement gives victims a formal opportunity to say how a crime has affected them. It may help to identify whether they have a particular need for information, support and protection. The court will take the statement into account when determining sentence.  In some circumstances, it may be appropriate for relatives of a victim to make a VPS, for example where the victim has died as a result of the relevant criminal conduct.  The revised Code of Practice for Victims of Crime, published on 29 October 2013 gives further information about victims’ entitlements within the criminal justice system, and the duties placed on criminal justice agencies when dealing with victims of crime. </p>

The decision about whether or not to make a VPS is entirely a matter for the victim; no pressure should be brought to bear on their decision, and no conclusion should be drawn if they choose not to make such a statement.  A VPS or a further VPS may be made (in proper s.9 form, see below) at any time prior to the disposal of the case. It will not normally be appropriate for a VPS to be made after the disposal of the case; there may be rare occasions between sentence and appeal when a further VPS may be necessary, for example, when the victim was injured and the final prognosis was not available at the date of sentence.  However, VPS after disposal should be confined to presenting up to date factual material, such as medical information, and should be used sparingly. </p>

If a victim, or one of those others affected by a crime, is a business, enterprise or other body (including a charity or public body, for example a school or hospital), of any size, a nominated representative may make an Impact Statement for Business (‘ISB’). The ISB gives a formal opportunity for the court to be informed how a crime has affected a business or other body.  The court will take the statement into account when determining sentence.  This does not prevent individual employees from making a VPS about the impact of the same crime on them as individuals.  Indeed, the ISB should be about the impact on the business or other body exclusively, and the impact on any individual included within a VPS. </span>

The nominated representative must also be in a position to give admissible evidence about the impact of the crime on the business or body.  This will usually be through first hand personal knowledge, or using business documents (as defined in section 117 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003).

The direction applies to orders made under the court’s common law powers, under the Justices of the Peace Act 1361, under section 1(7) of the Justices of the Peace Act 1968 and under section 115 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980.  This direction also gives guidance concerning the court’s power to bind over parents or guardians under section 150 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 and the Crown Court’s power to bind over to come up for judgment.  The court’s power to impose a conditional discharge under section 12 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 is also covered by this direction. </p>

Although it is necessary to have regard to such guidance, it is always permissible not to apply the guidance if a judge considers there are reasons for not following it.  It is always necessary to have regard to the need to do justice in the particular case.  However, if a court departs from any of the starting points given in Schedule 21, the court is under a duty to state its reasons for doing so (section 270(2)(b) of the Act). </p>

The court should then take into account what credit the offender would have received for a remand in custody under section 240 or 240ZA of the Act and/or for a remand on bail subject to a qualifying curfew condition under section 240A, but for the fact that the mandatory sentence is one of life imprisonment. Where the offender has been thus remanded in connection with the offence or a related offence, the court should have in mind that no credit will otherwise be given for this time when the prisoner is considered for early release.  The appropriate time to take it into account is when setting the minimum term.  The court should make any appropriate subtraction from the punitive period it would otherwise impose, in order to reach the minimum term. </p>

The court must then explain that the minimum term is the minimum amount of time the prisoner will spend in prison, from the date of sentence, before the Parole Board can order early release.  If it remains necessary for the protection of the public, the prisoner will continue to be detained after that date.  The court should also state that where the prisoner has served the minimum term and the Parole Board has decided to direct release, the prisoner will remain on licence for the rest of his life and may be recalled to prison at any time. </p>

In fixing the amount of any fine the court must take into account, amongst other considerations, the financial circumstances of the offender (whether an individual or other person) as they are known or as they appear to be. Before fixing the amount of fine when the defendant is an individual, the court must inquire into his financial circumstances. Where the defendant is an individual the court may make a financial circumstances order in respect of him.  This means an order in which the court requires an individual to provide a statement as to his financial means, within a specified time. It is an offence, punishable with imprisonment, to fail to comply with such an order or for knowingly/recklessly furnishing a false statement or knowingly failing to disclose a material fact. The provisions of section 20A Criminal Justice Act 1991 apply to any person (thereby including a corporate organisation) and place the offender under a statutory duty to provide the court with a statement as to his financial means in response to an official request. There are offences for non-compliance, false statements or nondisclosure.  It is for the court to decide how much information is required, having regard to relevant sentencing guidelines or guideline cases. However, by reference to those same guidelines and cases the parties should anticipate what the court will require, and prepare accordingly. In complex cases, and in cases involving a corporate defendant, the information required will be more extensive than in others. In the case of a corporate defendant, that information usually will include details of the defendant’s corporate structure; annual profit and loss accounts, or extracts; annual balance sheets, or extracts; details of shareholders’ receipts; and details of the remuneration of directors or other officers. </p>

This will give the prosecution the opportunity to assist the court should the court wish it. Usually accounts need to be considered with some care to avoid reaching a superficial and perhaps erroneous conclusion. Where accounts or other financial information are deliberately not supplied the court will be entitled to conclude that the company is in a position to pay any financial penalty it is minded to impose. Where the relevant information is provided late it may be desirable for sentence to be adjourned, if necessary at the defendant's expense, so as to avoid the risk of the court taking what it is told at face value and imposing an inadequate penalty.”</p>

If necessary, the court may compel the disclosure of an individual defendant’s financial circumstances.

It is not a substitute for the prompt commissioning of a report or reports by a defendant or defendant’s representatives where expert medical opinion is material to the defence case. In particular, the defendant’s representatives may wish to obtain a medical report or reports wholly independently of the court. Nothing in these directions, therefore, should be read as discouraging the commissioning of a medical report before the case comes before the court, where such a report is expected to be material and where it is possible promptly to commission it. However, where such a report has been commissioned then if that report has not been received in time for sentencing and if the court agrees that it seems likely to be material, then the court should set a timetable for the reception of that report and should give directions for progress to be reviewed at intervals, adopting the timetable set out in these directions with such adaptations as are needed. </p>

However, the timetable ought not be a protracted one. It is essential to keep in mind the importance of maintaining progress: in recognition of the defendant’s rights and with respect for the interests of victims and witnesses, as required by CrimPR Part 1 (the overriding objective). In a magistrates’ court account must be taken, too, of section 11 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000, which limits the duration of each remand pending the preparation of a report to 3 weeks, where the defendant is to be in custody, and to 4 weeks if the defendant is to be on bail. </p>

Where a report is requested in a case involving manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility, the report writer should have regard to the Sentencing Council’s guideline on Manslaughter by reason of Diminished Responsibility.

Under section 155 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 the Crown court may vary or rescind a sentence or order which it has imposed or made, within a period of 56 days beginning with the date of that sentence or order, or beginning with the date of another defendant’s acquittal or sentencing in some circumstances (see CrimPR 28.4(1)(b)).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.05in;text-indent:-0.50in">S.2 CrimPR 28.4(2) allows the court to exercise those powers at a hearing, in public or in private, or without a hearing. However, rule 28.4(4) confines the court’s discretion to dispense with a hearing by requiring the defendant’s presence, necessarily at a hearing, unless the variation is one proposed by the defendant, or the effect of the variation is such that the defendant is no more severely dealt with under the sentence as varied than before; or, if neither of those conditions us satisfied, were a hearing has been convened at which the defendant has had an opportunity to make representations, whether or not he or she in fact attends. Moreover, rule 28.4 requires service on the other party of any application to vary a sentence or order, in response to which that other party may wish to make such representations as general principles of law require to be heard. It follows that the circumstances in which a variation of sentence properly may be made without a hearing, consistently with the rule, will be confined to cases in which neither party objects to what is proposed and in which the consequences for the defendant of the variation will be neutral or benign.  </p>

Even in such a case, however, the court retains a discretion to convene a hearing, in the exercise of which discretion due regard must be had to the overriding objective and to the importance of dealing with criminal cases in public, in accordance with the principle of open justice. The application of that latter principle was described in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Cox</span> [2019] EWCA Crim 71; [2019] 4 WLR 88 at paragraphs 18 – 19 in these terms:  </p>

In any criminal matter, if there is no form designed for the particular warrant or order sought, the forms should still be used, as far as is practicable, and adapted as necessary.  The applicant should pay particular attention to the specific legislative requirements for the granting of such an application to ensure that the court has all of the necessary information, and, if the court might be unfamiliar with the legislation, should provide a copy of the relevant provisions.  Applicants must comply with the duties of candour and truthfulness, and include in their application the declarations required by the Rules and must make disclosure of any unfavourable information to the court. </span>

In courts with more than one judge, the paragraph numbering continues sequentially through each judgment and does not start again at the beginning of each judgment.  Indented paragraphs are not numbered.  A unique reference number is given to each judgment.  For judgments of the Court of Appeal, this number is given by the official shorthand writers, Merrill Legal Solutions (Tel: 020 7421 4000 ext.4036).  For judgments of the High Court, it is provided by the Courts Recording and Transcription Unit at the Royal Courts of Justice.

If it is desired to cite more than one paragraph of a judgment, each numbered paragraph should be enclosed with a square bracket.  Thus paragraph 59 in Green v White [2002] EWHC 124 (QB) would be cited: ‘Green v White [2002] EWHC 124 at [59]’; paragraphs 30 – 35 in Smith v Jones would be ‘Smith v Jones [2001] EWCA Civ 10 at [30] – [35]’; similarly, where a number of paragraphs are cited: ‘Smith v Jones [2001] EWCA Civ 10 at [30], [35] and [40 – 43]’.</p>

It is the responsibility of the court to ensure that those powers are not abused.  To do so, the court must be presented with a properly completed application, on the appropriate form, which includes a summary of the investigation to provide the context for the order, a clear explanation of how the statutory requirements are fulfilled, and full and frank disclosure of anything that might undermine the basis for the application.  Further directions on the proper making and consideration of such applications will be provided by Practice Direction.  However, the complexity of the application must be taken into account in listing it such that the judge is afforded appropriate reading time and the hearing is given sufficient time for the issues to be considered thoroughly, and a short judgment given. </p>

This general rule applies irrespective of the location of the magistrates’ court at which the case first began, if that was not the court at which the defendant was convicted, or sentenced, or both, because the reasons that led to the case being dealt with at a different magistrates’ court may apply equally to the hearing of the appeal.</p>

First, if on an appeal against conviction witnesses are required to give evidence in person then the appeal should be heard at the Crown Court centre which is the most conveniently situated for the majority of those witnesses. This exception is likely to apply where the defendant’s conviction and sentence have been imposed at a magistrates’ court distant from the place at which the offence occurred, perhaps because the defendant had failed to attend a hearing at the court for that area and subsequently was arrested for breach of bail and convicted and sentenced at another court. The information required of the parties to the appeal by CrimPR 34.3 and by the associated appeal forms will be essential to determining the most appropriate venue for the appeal. Second, where the appeal is against sentence only, or if, exceptionally, on an appeal against conviction no witnesses are required to give evidence in person, then then the appeal should be heard at the Crown Court centre which is the closest to the defendant’s home. This exception is likely to apply where the defendant has been convicted and sentenced at a magistrates’ court for the area in which the offence occurred but at a distance from the defendant’s usual or present residence. This exception must not, however, be allowed to operate to the disadvantage of any victim of the offence who is expected to attend the sentencing in the Crown Court. </p>
