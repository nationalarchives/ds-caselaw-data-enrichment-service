The loan was repayable over 54 months at an annual interest rate of 7.9% so that the monthly instalments to pay both the interest and the principal were £372.18 and the total sum repaid was £20,097.

That sum was added to the loan and was also repayable at the same interest rate over 54 months, making the total payment for the insurance policy £4,545. What Mrs Potter was not told was that only a very small percentage, about 4.7%, of the payment protection premium lent, was the actual premium paid by her to AXA for the policy.  The premium for the insurance policy was only £182.50 so that over 95% of the £3,834 that she paid for the PPI policy, and hence a substantial proportion of the £711 interest she paid on the loan of that sum, was paid to Canada Square as its commission on the sale of the policy.   </p>

The Court held, on facts similar to those of Mrs Potter’s case, that the non-disclosure of a very high commission charged to a borrower made the relationship between the creditor and borrower ‘unfair’ within the meaning of section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (‘section 140A’).  Section 140A provides that the court may determine that the relationship between a creditor and a debtor arising out of a credit agreement is unfair to the debtor because of, amongst other things, anything done or not done by the creditor either before or after the making of the agreement. </p>

She received compensation amounting to some £3,160 but that did not cover all her loss.  In November 2018 Mrs Potter consulted solicitors and on 14 December 2018 she brought proceedings in the County Court to recover the balance of the premium she had paid together with interest, relying on section 140A.  She pleaded that had Canada Square told her about the commission, she would not have allowed the policy to be linked with the loan. She alleged that the relationship arising out of the loan was unfair because Canada Square had failed to disclose the commission and because the commission was excessive and/or extortionate.  In its Defence, Canada Square admitted that it had not disclosed the fact that it would receive commission in respect of the policy but averred that Mrs Potter’s claim was time barred under section 9(1) of the Limitation Act 1980 (‘the LA 1980’) because it had been brought more than six years after the relationship between the parties had ended.   </p>

Section 32 contains two routes by which Mrs Potter might be able to proceed with her claim.  Section 32(1)(b) provides that where any fact relevant to the claimant’s right of action has been deliberately concealed from her by the defendant, the period of limitation does not begin to run until the claimant has discovered the concealment or could with reasonable diligence have discovered it.

Mrs Potter made a witness statement for the hearing that was not challenged.  No evidence was offered by Canada Square. The Recorder accepted Mrs Potter’s evidence that Canada Square had never mentioned commission to her at the time the PPI policy was sold to her and that she did not become aware that they were likely to have received or retained commissions that were excessive until she received advice from her solicitors in November 2018.  He held, for reasons that I will describe further below, that Mrs Potter’s claim was not time barred and gave judgment for her. Canada Square appealed and the appeal was heard by Jay J.  He dismissed the appeal, following a judgment handed down on 20 March 2020: [2020] EWHC 672 (QB).  He held that Mrs Potter could not rely on section 32(1)(b) by itself but that she could rely on section 32(2) of the LA 1980.  </p>

This, the OFT said, “provides the courts with maximum flexibility in considering unfairness, and avoids unduly constraining them in individual cases” (para 3.12). The OFT referred to the regulatory framework governing some of the credit relationships covered by section 140A but emphasised at a number of points in the guidance that for the purposes of section 140A, it was immaterial whether the practice in question was itself a breach of the law or might be actionable as such.

The FSA was the competent authority designated by the United Kingdom for the purposes of registering and regulating insurance intermediaries pursuant to Directive 2002/92/EC on insurance mediation (2003 Official Journal L 9/3).   </p>

It deals with a wide range of insurance policies, not only PPI policies.  Most of the provisions deal with the harmonised registration requirements, but Chapter III provides for the information which must be provided by the insurance intermediary to the customer.  The Directive focuses on information aimed at ensuring that the customer understands whether the insurance intermediary is tied to selling the products of only one insurer or whether it is able to offer products from a </p>

Article 12.5 provides that Member States may maintain or adopt stricter provisions regarding the information requirements, provided that such provisions comply with EU law.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In December 2002, in anticipation of the transposition of the Directive, the FSA issued a document called <span style="font-style:italic">Insurance selling and administration: the FSA’s high level approach to regulation</span> (CP160). This was the first step to developing the rules by which the FSA would play its part in the implementation of the Directive.  In the Chapter called ‘Fair treatment’, the FSA set out its proposals for ensuring the fair treatment of customers when they are sold insurance contracts.  It recognised potential detriment for customers from poor value purchases arising from commission-driven sales and from expensive fees or charges.  The FSA therefore set out its thinking on various ways to minimise such detriments, including by requiring the disclosure of commission.  The FSA noted that if the insurance intermediary was the customer’s agent, then the customer could ask it, as a fiduciary, to disclose any commission received from the product provider.  At para. 11.6, the FSA said they had considered whether they should make a rule that commission should be disclosed even where the insurance intermediary was not the agent of the customer and the customer did not ask for it.  At para 11.7, the FSA set out two reasons why the FSA thought that such a rule was not necessary. The first was that the commission did not affect the level of cover provided and that was known upfront. The second was that proposed rules did require disclosure of the total cost of the insurance separate from the cost of the loan (so in Mrs Potter’s case the cost of £3,834 was shown separately from the cost of the credit on the loan). This, the FSA thought, made it easier for customers to compare policies and spot poor value products.  The FSA went on to describe the drawbacks and costs involved in requiring firms to disclose commissions to private customers.  It might confuse customers, making it more difficult for them to shop around and it might cause information overload.  The FSA invited consultees to comment on the proposal that they would not introduce rules on commission disclosure for transactions involving private customers.  They stated that they would keep this under review in the light of their supervision and monitoring work and might decide to consult on a rule requiring commission disclosure at a later date.  </p>

This set out the feedback it had received from CP160 and contained the draft rule book proposed to regulate insurance intermediaries. At Chapter 8 of CP187, the FSA recorded that nothing in the responses to CP160 had caused them to change their view that the rules should not require disclosure of commission because their other product disclosure requirements were likely to be sufficient to mitigate the risks to customers.  In particular, the rules would require the premium for insurance (which it was assumed would incorporate the commission) to be shown separately from the charges for other goods and services being sold at the same time.   </p>

Tomlinson LJ (with whom Lord Neuberger MR and Patten LJ agreed) referred to concern about the conduct of lenders selling PPI as having been rife for some years and to the changes in the landscape that had occurred as a result.  However, the court there was considering a loan and PPI policy sold in 2006.  He also emphasised that the ambit of the complaint in Mr and Mrs Harrison’s case was very narrow compared with the large number of common types of failings in PPI policy sales.

He noted that there was at the relevant time no regulatory guidance specific to selling PPI but the sale was subject to the ICOB Rules introduced in 2005.  He then set out the background to the ICOB Rules and the Directive.  He set out paragraphs 11.6 and 11.7 of the FSA’s document, CP160, explaining why they had decided not to require the disclosure of commission.  Much of the rest of his judgment was directed at considering whether or not there had been a breach of any ICOB Rules by Black Horse and concluding that there had not.  He then turned to consider whether the level of commission was so egregious that it gave rise to a conflict of interest which it was the lender’s duty to disclose.  He said:  </p>

In the absence of an explanation such as an element of cross-subsidy the commission here is on any view quite startling and there will be many who regard it as unacceptable conduct on the part of lending institutions to have profited in this way. I struggle however to spell out of the mere size of the undisclosed commission an unfairness in the relationship between lender and borrower.  Moreover the touchstone must in my view be the standard imposed by the regulatory authorities pursuant to their statutory duties, not resort to a visceral instinct that the relevant conduct is beyond the Pale. In that regard it is clear that the ICOB regime after due consultation and consideration does not require the disclosure of the receipt of commission. It would be an anomalous result if a lender was obliged to disclose receipt of a commission in order to escape a finding of unfairness under s.140A of the Act but yet not obliged to disclose it pursuant to the statutorily imposed regulatory framework under which it operates.” </p>

The Supreme Court held that this did make the relationship unfair within the meaning of section 140A.  Lord Sumption JSC gave the judgment with which the other four Justices agreed.  Having described the regulatory framework and the relevant ICOB Rules, Lord Sumption said that it was clear that the absence of a statutory obligation to disclose commissions to a non-commercial customer was the result of a considered policy of the FSA: [15].

The ICOB Rules are some evidence of what that standard is. But they cannot be determinative of the question posed by section 140A, because they are doing different things. The fundamental difference is that the ICOB Rules impose obligations on insurers and insurance intermediaries. Section 140A, by comparison, does not impose any obligation and is not concerned with the question whether the creditor or anyone else is in breach of a duty. It is concerned with the question whether the creditor’s relationship with the debtor was unfair. It may be unfair for a variety of reasons, which do not have to involve a breach of duty. There are other differences, which flow from this. The ICOB Rules impose a minimum standard of conduct applicable in a wide range of situations, enforceable by action and sounding in damages. Section 140A introduces a broader test of fairness applied to the particular debtor-creditor relationship, which may lead to the transaction being reopened as a matter of judicial discretion. The standard of conduct required of practitioners by the ICOB Rules is laid down in advance by the Financial Services Authority (now the Financial Conduct Authority), whereas the standard of fairness in a debtor-creditor relationship is a matter for the court, on which it must make its own assessment. Most of the ICOB Rules, including those relating to the disclosure of commission, impose hard-edged requirements, whereas the question of fairness involves a large element of forensic judgment. It follows that the question whether the debtor-creditor relationship is fair cannot be the same as the question whether the creditor has complied with the ICOB Rules, and the facts which may be relevant to answer it are manifestly different. An altogether wider range of considerations may be relevant to the fairness of the relationship, most of which would not be relevant to the application of the rules. …” </p>

The causes of action had arisen in 1982, but the claimants asserted that in 1984 the defendants had deliberately concealed the facts relevant to the cause of action so that time did not start to run until after the claimants discovered the concealment. The question at issue was whether they could rely on deliberate concealment which occurred after the accrual of the cause of action, and hence whether the effect of section 32 was to suspend the running of the limitation period between the date of the concealment and the date on which it could reasonably have been discovered, or rather to restart the running of the limitation period as from the latter date.

The claimant brought proceedings against his former solicitors for negligence in failing properly to draw up documents granting him mooring rights. The transaction was completed in March 1989.  In February 1994, within the limitation period, he was informed by the grantor of the rights that the rights were no longer exercisable.  The claimant wrote to the solicitors in November 1995 and thereafter but got no answer.  He launched proceedings in January 1998 relying on the defendants’ failure to answer his letters as constituting deliberate concealment.  He accepted that the negligent drafting of the agreement was not done in the knowledge that it was a breach of duty.  The issue before the House of Lords was whether the words ‘deliberate concealment of a breach of duty’ in section 32(2) merely required that the act or omission giving rise to the breach of duty had been deliberate or whether the fact that it amounted to a breach of duty had also to be deliberate.  The earlier case of <span style="font-style:italic">Brocklesby v Armitage &amp; Guest (Note) </span>[2002] 1 WLR 598 had held that ignorance of the law was no excuse and that, since in general a person is assumed to know the legal consequences of his actions, provided that the conduct was deliberate it was not necessary to establish that the defendant was aware that his conduct was a breach of duty.  The House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Cave </span>overruled that decision and held that it was not enough to establish that the solicitors had deliberately drafted the mooring grant documents, if they had not also done so with an awareness that they were thereby committing a breach of their duty to the claimant.  </p>

But such cases were limited in two respects: first, the defendant must have been guilty of a deliberate commission of a breach of duty; and secondly, the circumstances must make it unlikely that the breach of duty will be discovered for some time. </p>

He can do so if he can show that some fact relevant to his right of action has been concealed from him either by a positive act of concealment or by a withholding of relevant information, but, in either case, with the intention of concealing the fact or facts in question. In many cases the requisite proof of intention might be quite difficult to provide. The standard of proof would be the usual balance of probabilities standard and inferences could of course be drawn from suitable primary facts but, nonetheless, proof of intention, particularly where an omission rather than a positive act is relied on, is often very difficult. Subsection (2), however, provides an alternative route. The claimant need not concentrate on the allegedly concealed facts but can instead concentrate on the commission of the breach of duty. If the claimant can show that the defendant knew he was committing a breach of duty, or intended to commit the breach of duty - I can discern no difference between the two formulations; each would constitute, in my opinion, a deliberate commission of the breach - then, if the circumstances are such that the claimant is unlikely to discover for some time that the breach of duty has been committed, the facts involved in the breach are taken to have been deliberately concealed for subsection (1)(b) purposes. I do not agree with [counsel for the claimant] that the subsection, thus construed, adds nothing. It provides an alternative, and in some cases what may well be an easier, means of establishing the facts necessary to bring the case within section 32(1)(b).” </p>

The claimant instructed the defendant firm to act for her in a professional negligence claim against a doctor.  In August 1994, a trainee solicitor, Mr Brown, handling the case negligently agreed to a consent order dismissing the claim against the doctor.  An application made to the court in December 1994 to reinstate her claim was dismissed with a wasted costs order made against the solicitors.  Mr Brown did not tell Ms Williams about the consent order or about the dismissal of the application to re-join the doctor.  In November 1995, the firm issued a new claim against the doctor which was struck out in February 1996 as an abuse of process.  An appeal against that strike out was dismissed in May 1996.  The findings of facts by the court below as to when Mr Brown had first told Ms Williams about the problems with her claim were not entirely clear.  It appeared that Mr Brown had told her about the consent order in July 1995 but it was only in June 1996 that he advised Ms Williams to consult other solicitors. The claimant relied on section 32(1)(b), alleging that the solicitors had deliberately concealed facts relevant to her claim against them. The limitation issue was heard as a preliminary issue by Recorder Brunnen.  The Recorder held that Mr Brown had not deliberately concealed anything from the claimant because at the time of the consent order in August 1994, he had genuinely thought that the position could be retrieved and had only avoided mentioning it to her to avoid his own embarrassment.  He therefore held that the claim was statute-barred.   </p>

Secondly, section 32(1)(b) did not require the claimant to show that the defendant must have known that the fact was relevant to the cause of action.  All that is required is that the fact was known to the defendant and the fact must actually have been relevant, whether the defendant knew that or not. Thirdly, the concealment can be of any fact relevant to the cause of action, it does not have to be concealment of all the relevant facts, and fourthly, the concealment must have been deliberate.

He held that there was no doubt that the solicitor owed a duty to keep his client informed about the conduct of the case and about any error that might give the client cause for complaint: “A solicitor who intentionally withholds from his client a fact about which he knows he ought to inform him or her can readily be said to “conceal” it”.  He considered the situations in which something short of active concealment could amount to concealment for the purposes of section 32(1)(b).  Mere non-disclosure in the absence of a duty to speak may be deliberate but could not, he said, constitute ‘concealment’. He also considered whether the defendant had to know that the fact being concealed was relevant to the right of action, but did not have to decide that point since it was clear that Mr Brown had realised that the fact was so relevant.  At several points in that discussion about deliberateness, Mance LJ referred to the state of knowledge of wrongdoing required as including recklessness – I will need to return to that aspect of the judgment later.   </p>

They negligently tested it using the wrong test method and certified that the fuel met the specification.  AIC then sold the cargo on to a purchaser and warranted that the product met the specification.  On delivery of the oil in New York, the purchaser faxed AIC to say that the testing on discharge of the oil showed that it was offspecification. AIC contacted ITS and both parties then realised that the wrong method had been used.  ITS carried out the right tests, referred to in the judgments as ‘the Cooper retests’, which showed that the product was outside the specification.  There was a phone call between Mr Whitaker of AIC and Mr Lucas of ITS by which time both sides were aware that the wrong test method had been used but during which Mr Lucas did not mention the Cooper retests.

He held that ITS owed no such duty and so he would have held that the claim was time barred.  Buxton LJ and Sir Martin Nourse held that ITS had been under a sufficient duty to inform AIC about the Cooper retests for their failure to do so to amount to concealment for the purposes of section 32(1)(b).  I will return to this case to examine in more detail whether Buxton LJ’s decision was based on his finding that an independent contractual duty did exist or on his conclusion that no such duty was necessary, so long as there was a duty to disclose in what he called “the sense relevant to the Act”: [443].  </p>

As regards section 32(2), the judge held that the concepts of breach of duty in section 32(2) and the right of action in section 32(1)(b) “must be the two sides of the same coin: in Hohfeldian terms, ‘juridical correlates’”.  He then turned to the question of deliberateness, noting that the presence of the mental element could not have predated the coming into force of section 140A, whether generally in April 2007 or in respect of this agreement in April 2008, nor could it have outlived the end of the relationship in March 2010.

Grounds 2, 3 and 4 relate to the mental element and the judge’s decision, first, that recklessness was sufficient to make the breach of duty deliberate, and second, that recklessness was established on the facts.  Mrs Potter has served a Respondent’s notice arguing that Jay J was wrong to conclude that she could not rely on section 32(1)(b).  She contends that Canada Square’s statutory duty to disclose the commission in order to avoid unfairness, coupled with its deliberate decision not to disclose suffices to meet the requirement under section 32(1)(b) that the commission (being a fact relevant to her right of action) was ‘deliberately concealed’.  </p>

However, as I have already pointed out, the question which arises under section 140A(1)(c) is not whether there was a legal duty to disclose the commissions. It is whether the unfairness arising from their non-disclosure was due to something done or not done by Paragon. Where the creditor has done a positive act which makes the relationship unfair, this gives rise to no particular conceptual difficulty. But the concept of causing a relationship to be unfair by not doing something is more problematical. It necessarily implies that the Act treats the creditor as being responsible for the unfairness which results from his inaction, even if that responsibility falls short of a legal duty. What is it that engages that responsibility? Bearing in mind the breadth of section 140A and the incidence of the burden of proof according to section 140B(9), the creditor must normally be regarded as responsible for an omission making his relationship with the debtor unfair if he fails to take such steps as (i) it would be reasonable to expect the creditor or someone acting on his behalf to take in the interests of fairness, and (ii) would have removed the source of that unfairness or mitigated its consequences so that the relationship as a whole can no longer be regarded as unfair.” </p>

In that case, the claimant was a judgment creditor of the defendant in earlier proceedings and had obtained a charging order over the defendant’s interest in his matrimonial home. The claimant then applied to set aside a deed entered into several years earlier between the defendant and his wife by which 30% of his then half interest in the house was transferred to his wife for no consideration.  The claimant pleaded that the deed should be set aside pursuant to section 423 of the Insolvency Act 1986 as a transaction defrauding creditors.  The issue before the Court of Appeal was whether a claim under section 423 was properly described as a claim for a breach of duty for the purposes of section 32(2).  Arden LJ (with whose judgment Sedley and Buxton LJJ agreed) noted that section 423 was not drafted in terms that expressly imposed a duty on a creditor not to enter into particular transactions but rather empowered the court to set aside a transaction entered into at an undervalue.

Outside of section 423, a person who incurs credit or liabilities undoubtedly owes responsibilities to his present and future creditors. A person should not incur a debt unless he has reasonable or probable grounds for expecting to be able to pay it when it is due. It therefore follows that the person should not make a gift at a time when he has no reasonable or probable grounds for believing that (without the asset which he is proposing to give away) he will be able to pay his debts, present or future, as and when they fall due.” </p>

My reasons, which I amplify below, for holding that the expression “breach of duty” in section 32(2) includes a claim under section 423 of the 1986 Act may be summarised as follows. (a) The wider meaning is a legitimate meaning of breach of duty. (b) Section 32(2) was enacted pursuant to the recommendations of the Law Reform Committee’s report on limitation in 1977 and the court can look at that report to see the mischief to which section 32(2) was directed. That committee did not recommend that the new provision be limited to some causes of action only. (c) The general structure of the 1980 Act indicates that section 32(2) is consistent with the wider meaning. (d) The expression “breach of duty” is used in section 11 of the 1980 Act but in a different context and so does not necessarily restrict the meaning of “breach of duty” in section 32(2). (e) Section 32 does not require the phrase to be given the narrower meaning. (f) The narrower meaning does not promote any part of the statutory purpose of section 32.” </p>

The question was whether those results had, none the less, been concealed by ITS from AIC within the meaning of section 32(1)(b).  The trial judge, Cresswell J, had held that ITS’ contract with AIC included an implied term requiring ITS to inform AIC of the Cooper retests. Counsel for AIC on appeal accepted that any such implied term was “at the cutting edge of the law”: [52].  Rix LJ cited the passage in [14] of the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Williams </span>where Park J referred to the claimant needing to show that the fact which the defendant decided not to disclose was one which it was his duty to disclose, or that it must at least have been one which he would ordinarily have disclosed in the normal course of his relationship with the client.

Although that formulation had been suggested by Park J in <span style="font-style:italic">Williams</span>, it had not been adopted by Brooke and Mance LJJ in that case.  He therefore analysed at length whether there was a duty to disclose arising from the NAMAS guidelines governing the accreditation of laboratory facilities or from ITS’ internal guidelines: [330].  Applying the traditional test of business efficacy, Rix LJ held that there was no implied term in the contract which assisted AIC: [340].  He considered the possibility that a term could be implied from a combination of utility and morality, to the effect that once any issue about a certificate has been identified, the certifier owes a duty to investigate and report: [344].  Rix LJ thought that this might have supported the conclusion that the trial judge had come to and was, he thought, the analysis adopted by Buxton LJ.  Rix LJ’s concern was that such an obligation, if it existed, would in theory be applicable to every conceivable kind of contract.  He held that there was no separate, continuing duty to investigate and/or disclose: “There is no general principle that the wrongdoer comes under an additional obligation to disclose his wrongdoing”: [345].   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">What, then, did Buxton LJ decide?  Citing the speeches of Lord Millett and Lord Scott in <span style="font-style:italic">Cave</span> and Park J’s judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Williams</span>, Buxton LJ described the issues for the court as (i) whether ITS was under a duty to AIC to reveal the existence and content of the Cooper retests, (ii) whether ITS, knowing of that duty, decided not to reveal the existence and content of the Cooper retests, and (iii) whether the Cooper retests were relevant to any rights of action asserted by AIC that were otherwise statute barred: [427].  Buxton LJ described the first issue as having become bogged down in an examination of international standards and practices, ITS’ internal guidelines and how they applied to what ITS had done.  He dismissed the relevance of these because, as he put it, the question of whether, in terms of the LA 1980, ITS had a duty to reveal the Cooper retests was not necessarily determined by reference to ITS’ contractual duties: [430].  He analysed in detail the evidence given by Mr Lucas and other ITS executives at the trial. Mr Lucas had denied knowing about the Cooper retests when he had the key phone conversation with AIC. In an argumentative reply during his cross-examination about his knowledge of those tests, Mr Lucas said that his assertion that he did not know about the retests must be true because he did not disclose the results to AIC in that call.  He recognised by that answer that he had a duty to reveal the Cooper retests to AIC, so that if he had known of them, he would have performed his duty to reveal them. Buxton LJ concluded that although the ITS executives did not consider that those obligations stemmed from published guidelines and standards, they did regard themselves as being under a duty to disclose the Cooper retests; that was a considered assertion by senior and experienced men in the industry: [438].  Buxton LJ went on (in the paragraphs of his judgment expressly endorsed by Sir Martin):  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“439. Not only was a duty to disclose the Cooper retests acknowledged by ITS, but also the existence of such a duty is a matter of common sense.  We have seen the unchallenged evidence of AIC as to the importance to them of the accuracy of the statements of quality on the certificate … .  The judge also stressed, and no one has suggested that he was wrong, the importance of the accuracy of a certificate to buyers and subbuyers (at [183]). Not only as a matter of law, but also commercially, it really challenges reality to think that a certifier, armed with tests that suggested that the tests used to complete the certificate had or might have produced incorrect results, could nonetheless simply do nothing about it; and in particular could properly say nothing about those tests to those who had employed him to certify. </p>

That obligation, of not sitting on material of one’s own creation that is known to be inconsistent with the certificate, does not lead to the endless uncertainty that Rix LJ fears.  It is for the holder of the certificate to decide what he does with the information once he receives it.  What I cannot accept is that considerations of certainty empower the certifier to take that decision for the holder by withholding relevant information from him.  Nor does such a duty create a continuing duty of review and disclosure under every conceivable kind of contract (cf [351], above).  This is the specific case of a certificate, where the certifier was in possession of material of his own creation that cast doubt on the certificate that he had given.  To hold, as I would, that he was under a duty in Limitation Act terms to reveal that material does not open any floodgate in any other sort of relationship.” </p>

Or was he deciding that, regardless of the contractual position, there was enough of an obligation to disclose, as acknowledged by Mr Lucas, to mean that a failure to disclose amounted to a concealment for the purposes of section 32(1)(b)?

	    <p style="margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“a matter of common sense” or on the basis of the subjective views that one party’s executives say they held some time after the contract was concluded.  Secondly, Buxton LJ stated that the floodgates concerns expressed by Rix LJ as arising from a continuing contractual duty of review and disclosure did not arise, because he was deciding only that Mr Lucas had been “under a duty in Limitation Act terms to reveal the material”.  His decision did not mean that there was an implied obligation for any other purpose.  Thirdly, he said at [430] that he did not regard the question of whether ITS was “in terms of the Act” under a duty to disclose as a question necessarily determined by reference to ITS’s contractual duties. He thereby moved the discussion away from the question posed by the trial judge and by Rix LJ as to the proper scope of the contractual duties owed by ITS to AIC.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I respectfully also regard that as the better construction of the statutory provision.  Section 32(1)(b) does not refer to a duty to disclose, it refers only to concealment.  Inherent in the concept of ‘concealing’ something is the existence of some obligation to disclose it.  To construe section 32(1)(b) as being satisfied only if there is a preexisting legal duty to disclose seems to me to add an unwarranted and unhelpful gloss on the clear words of the statute.  For the purposes of the Act that obligation need only be one arising from a combination of utility and morality to adopt Rix LJ’s phrase. Buxton LJ was not, as Rix LJ suggested at [345], concluding on that basis that there was an implied term in the contract between ITS and AIC.  Rather, as Sir Martin Nourse said at [383], Buxton LJ was basing the existence of the duty on a simple, common sense notion that a certifier who acquired knowledge of a material inaccuracy in his certificate is obliged to disclose it, such that if he fails to do so he can properly be described as concealing that fact.   </p>

Rix LJ’s judgment shows the dangers of such an approach, getting bogged down in an analysis of international and internal guidelines and risking the undesirable wider repercussions that would arise from the finding of an implied contractual term or tortious duty of care.  Those questions might have no other relevance to the right of action which the claimant is seeking to bring.  In particular, since an implied term must be implied into the contract at the date on which the contract is formed, it may focus the attention of the court on a time before the concealment actually took place.  As appears from <span style="font-style:italic">Sheldon</span>, the concealment may occur several years after the contract was concluded or the duty of care arose.  The focus should instead be on the conduct which is alleged to amount to the concealment and on an analysis of whether the defendant was, at that point, under a sufficient obligation to disclose for the failure to disclose to amount to concealment as at that date.  </p>

Mr Kimmins argued that such an approach depends on ‘recycling’ Canada Square’s conduct so that it serves both as the foundation for the right of action on which Mrs Potter brings her claim and also as the concealment of a fact relevant to that claim.  That is impermissible, he argued, because the concealment of the fact has to be something other than, and subsequent to, the creation of the right of action itself.  If the concealment is part of the right of action, he argued, then that is covered only by section 32(2).

The trial judge had held that the original failure by the solicitors to inform the plaintiff in regard to the limitation of time for her claim was itself not merely an act of negligence but also constituted the concealment by fraud. Lord Evershed was unable to agree with that conclusion: (p 569). </p>

Section 32(2) was intended to extend the scope of section 32(1)(b) to provide an alternative and in some cases easier means of establishing the facts necessary to bring the case within section 32(1)(b): see per Lord Scott in <span style="font-style:italic">Cave</span> at [60].  The potential application of section 32(2) should not operate to close out the possibility of section 32(1)(b) applying if the claimant can otherwise bring himself within that latter provision.  Lord Evershed in <span style="font-style:italic">Kitchen </span>did not rule out that there may be circumstances where the wrongful acts may also constitute concealment by fraud and gave as an example where the wrongful acts are continuous. As to whether the non-disclosure was continuous here, Mr Kimmins points out that in <span style="font-style:italic">Plevin</span> Lord Sumption indicated at [18] that the significance of the lack of information about the commission was that Mrs Plevin was not able to shop around for better terms or to decide not to take a PPI policy at all if she concluded that it did not represent value for money.  The concealment, Mr Kimmins said, was therefore operative only at the point in 2006 when Mrs Potter was considering whether to accept what Canada Square offered her.  I do not accept that submission.  I do not read Lord Sumption’s judgment as suggesting that the only unfairness arising from the commission was the inability to decide based on proper information whether to take the policy at all.  The unfairness lies additionally in the fact that because the cost of taking out the insurance was increased from £182 to £3,834, Mrs Potter did not have the option of paying for the policy without adding the premium to the loan.  She was required to pay interest at 7.9% on the loan she took out to pay Canada Square’s commission and those payments of principal and interest lasted until the end of the credit relationship.  If at any point, at least after April 2008 when section 140A became enforceable as regards the agreement, Canada Square had disclosed to her the breakdown of the premium and commission within that payment of £3,834, she may well have been alerted to the unfairness which entitled her to challenge that continuing obligation to pay.   </p>

She must also show that the breach of duty was deliberate, in the sense that Canada Square had the necessary mental element in respect of the fact that their conduct gave rise to a breach of duty.  Similarly, so far as section 32(1)(b) is concerned, it is not enough that the failure by Canada Square to disclose the fact that was relevant to Mrs Potter’s right of action was a conscious choice by Canada Square rather than an inadvertent failure.

The trial judge had directed the jury that (i) recklessness would be established if it would have been obvious to a reasonable person watching the small fire set by the defendants that it might spread to destroy the premises that had in fact been destroyed; (ii) that they must leave out of account that what was obvious to the reasonable bystander might not have been obvious to the defendants who were aged 11 and 12; and (iii) as to the state of mind of the two boys, the jury must be satisfied either that they had given no thought to there being such a risk or that, having recognised that there was such a risk, they none the less went on and did the act.  Having reviewed the earlier case law, Lord Bingham (with whom the other members of the Judicial Committee agreed) held that the correct test was that a person acts recklessly with respect to a <span style="font-style:italic">circumstance</span> when he is aware of a risk that it exists or will exist and it is, in the circumstances known to him, unreasonable to take the risk.

For example, section 15 of the Theft Act 1968 provides that for the offence of obtaining property by deception, ‘deception’ means “any deception (whether deliberate or reckless) by words or conduct as to fact </p>

	    <p style="margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">or as to law”.  The Consumer Insurance (Disclosure and Representations) Act 2012 defines qualifying mis-representations in section 5 as being either “(a) deliberate or reckless or (b) careless”.  I do not find those examples of much assistance.  I can see that in a criminal provision such as the definition of obtaining property by deception, particularly where dishonesty is a necessary, separate element, the drafter would want to spell out how the element of deception is to be applied.  In the 2012 Act, the content of the mental element is specified in great detail. Section 5(2) provides that a qualifying misrepresentation is deliberate or reckless if the consumer knew that it was untrue or misleading or did not care whether or not it was untrue or misleading and knew that the matter to which the misrepresentation related was relevant to the insurer, or did not care whether or not it was relevant to the insurer.  Further, section 5(5) raises a rebuttable presumption that the consumer had the knowledge of a reasonable consumer and knew that a matter was relevant to the insurer if the insurer asked a clear and specific question about it.  Given that the section has a lot to say about what is and is not a misrepresentation, I cannot read too much into the fact that the drafter used the phrase ‘deliberate or reckless’.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Kimmins then cited other cases in which courts have addressed the question of whether a contractual term that uses the word ‘deliberate’ should be construed as including recklessness.  In <span style="font-style:italic">De Beers UK Ltd v Atos Origin IT Services UK Ltd </span>[2010] EWHC 3276 (TCC), Edwards-Stuart J was construing a clause in a contract which provided that nothing in the agreement excluded a person’s liability for fraudulent misrepresentation, wilful misconduct or deliberate default.  At [206], the judge said that ‘deliberate default’ there meant that the person committing the relevant act knew that it was a default and recklessness was not enough.  I do not consider that that helps the present inquiry, even if it were legitimate to rely on an authority dealing with the wording of a particular contract when considering the construction of a statutory provision.  It is clear that the judge’s interpretation was quite properly coloured by the wording of the clause as a whole and by his conclusion that recklessness was already covered by the concept of ‘wilful misconduct’.  Similarly, in <span style="font-style:italic">Mutual Energy Ltd v Starr Underwriting Agents Ltd and another </span>[2016] EWHC 590 (TCC), insurers sought to avoid a contract of insurance on the grounds that there had been deliberate non-disclosure by the insured.  The issue before the court was whether a reference in the policy to deliberate or fraudulent non-disclosure covered the circumstance where the insured honestly but mistakenly decided not to disclose a particular fact or whether it required that the insured took a decision not to disclose a fact which it knew was material.  Again, I do not find that case helpful since Coulson J approached the task applying the well-established trio of cases on the principles of construction of contracts, in particular ‘non-disclosure in breach of well-known and well-understood insurance obligations’: see [14] and [31]. The cases he referred to on the meaning of the word ‘deliberate’ were cases involving contractual terms and he expressly rejected reliance on <span style="font-style:italic">Williams </span>as having no direct relevance to the issue of construction he had to decide: [79].  </p>

As I have already explained, the executives accepted that they would have been under a duty to disclose the retests to AIC if they had so known and so thought: [448].  Buxton LJ concluded that the judge on that basis had been correct to hold that there had been deliberate concealment.  Sir Martin Nourse agreed, saying at [381] that in order to be deliberate, the concealment did not have to be dishonest.  Neither Buxton LJ nor Sir Martin referred to recklessness and they did not need to do so.  Rix LJ took a different view, holding that because all three judges agreed that the trial judge’s finding of deceit could not stand on the evidence before him, that fatally undermined the findings of deliberate concealment as well.  I see the point that if recklessness were an available alternative to actual knowledge, one might have expected Rix LJ to consider whether the facts would have supported a finding of recklessness, even if the judge’s finding of knowledge and dishonesty were not sustainable.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Weir relies heavily on the judgment of Mance LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Williams</span> as showing that recklessness is enough, although he accepts that the remarks are <span style="font-style:italic">obiter</span>.  They are, however, remarks that were made not accidentally but in the course of an exposition of the test to be applied and, since they are remarks of Mance LJ they are, of course, entitled to particular attention.  I have already outlined the facts in <span style="font-style:italic">Williams </span>where the trainee solicitor, Mr Brown, negligently agreed to an order dismissing the case against the putative defendant doctor and then failed to have the action against the doctor restored.  The case, like many of the cases in which the mental element required came to be considered, involved the appellate court grappling with findings of fact by the trial judge acquitting the protagonist of any intentional wrongdoing, findings that the appellate court regarded with considerable scepticism.  Thus in <span style="font-style:italic">Williams </span>the Recorder at first instance had found that even after the application to re-join the doctor to the proceedings had been dismissed with an order that the solicitors pay the doctor’s costs, the trainee solicitor had still not been aware that he had been negligent.  Park J noted that Mr Brown had given evidence and impressed the Recorder as a totally sincere and frank witness who was ashamed of the way that he had handled the claimant’s case: [13]. The Recorder also found that Mr Brown’s motive in not telling Ms Williams what was going on was that he was embarrassed for himself rather than wishing to protect the firm from a negligence action.  The Recorder had therefore found that, at all times until at least the striking out of the new claim against the doctor as an abuse of process or the dismissal of the appeal from that decision, “Mr Brown honestly and genuinely believed that the situation created by the consent order could be cured and that Ms Williams would still be able to bring her action against the doctor.”  Park J held that this was not sufficient to enable the solicitors to escape the application of section 32(1)(b).  Mr Brown had concealed the consent order from Ms Williams: </p>

It is true that a desire to conceal from Ms Williams the possibility that she might have a claim in negligence against [the firm] was not the reason why Mr Brown decided not to tell her what had happened: the reason was to avoid embarrassment.  But in my view that makes no difference, and the Recorder was in error if (as I believe) he thought that it did make a difference.  What is relevant to s.32(1)(b) is the fact of concealment, not the reason or motive for it.  …” </p>

That would prevent the limitation period being extended where the defendant did not realise that the fact suppressed had any relevance to the wrongdoing provided he was not reckless in failing to realise this.  The wider meaning would regard deliberate concealment as occurring even though the defendant did not realise that the fact concealed had any relevance to any wrongdoing.

Second, any requirement that a defendant must realise the relevance of the fact to the plaintiff’s right of action could not and should not be read narrowly.  The plaintiff could not have to show that the defendant knew that there was a right of action which would succeed.  The subsection refers to a fact “relevant” to the plaintiff’s cause of action. I consider that there could, even on the more limited reading, be “deliberate concealment” within the subsection in any case where the defendant deliberately concealed a fact realising that it was relevant (or reckless as to whether or not it was relevant) to an actual or a potential claim against him, even though he might himself believe that any claim would, if pursued, prove to be ill-founded.

It is true, as Mr Kimmins submitted, that the facts of <span style="font-style:italic">Williams </span>appear consistent with actual knowledge and that all three judges clearly thought the Recorder had been generous in his assessment of Mr Brown’s state of mind. But all three judges were also reluctant directly to overturn those findings of fact made after hearing evidence. They had to find another route to justify concluding that Mr Brown’s concealment had been deliberate.  Mance LJ was the only member of the court to hold expressly that recklessness was sufficient and that Mr Brown had at least been reckless as to the significance of the rejection of the application to restore the action against the doctor.  Brooke LJ and Park J reached the same conclusion in part by rejecting the judge’s reliance on Mr Brown’s motives or on his mistaken optimism that the position could be retrieved.  Mr Kimmins fairly points out that if they had been satisfied that recklessness was sufficient, it is surprising that they did not rely on that in the same way as Mance LJ.  He also queries the source of the ‘general principle’ to which Mance LJ referred at the end of [38] as including recklessness in deliberateness – Mance LJ did not identify this.  Mr Kimmins suggested that it might have been a reference to the principle in <span style="font-style:italic">Derry v Peek </span>(1889) LR 14 App Cas 337 that fraudulent misrepresentation includes the making of a false representation recklessly, without caring whether it be true or false. If Mance LJ did have <span style="font-style:italic">Derry v Peek </span>in mind, then Mr Kimmins argued that that principle makes sense applied to false statements because the maker of the statement represents that he believes it to be true.  There is no need, however, to extend that principle to the present context.

This was an action brought by Primeo, a Cayman Island hedge fund, which had placed assets for investment with Bernard Madoff. Primeo claimed damages of about US$2 billion against the Bank of Bernuda as its former custodian, asserting that the custodian was strictly liable for losses caused by the sub-custodian Mr Madoff’s wrongdoing.  The claims were dismissed by Justice Andrew Jackson QC.  Primeo’s appeal was heard by Sir Richard Field, Sir Michael Birt and Sir Jack Beatson.  One of the many issues considered was the application of section 37 of the Cayman limitation law which was in identical terms to section 32(1) and (2) of the LA 1980.  The claims raised directly whether a reckless breach of duty constituted deliberate commission of a breach of duty within the Cayman provision equivalent to section 32(2).  The trial judge had found that the defendant’s witness’ conduct did not amount to wilful default and that the relevant person was not conscious that what he did was a breach: [460].  He had also held that recklessness was not sufficient to establish a deliberate breach of duty. The Appeal Court held that the judge had not erred. It was difficult, they held, to construe the words ‘deliberate concealment of a breach of duty’ as including recklessness, particularly since the wording represented a move by the legislature away from the language of fraud into which recklessness has been held to fall.  They considered that <span style="font-style:italic">Cave</span> had decided that recklessness does not suffice for section 32(2).  They referred to paragraph 25 of Lord Millett’s speech and to paragraph 60 of Lord Scott (which I have set out at paras 65 and 39 above, respectively), concluding that it was difficult to understand them as including recklessness.  They also quoted one passage from the judgment of Mance LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Williams</span> where he said that section 32(2) required a defendant ‘to realise that the act involved a breach of duty’.  </p>

We are not engaged in trying to work out the mental element required for the doctrine of equitable fraud either in 1926 or now.  We are trying to ascertain the meaning of the word ‘deliberate’ and that does not depend on whether recklessness was in 1939, or has since become or has ceased to be sufficient to support a finding of fraud of any kind. The exercise we are undertaking is different; the new section 26 was certainly intended to decouple the mental element under the old section 26 from the unhelpful concept of equitable fraud. But it did not necessarily mean to change the content of the mental element as it had been interpreted by the courts.  There are many cases since <span style="font-style:italic">Sheldon </span>where courts at all levels have found it illuminating to look at the earlier case law and at the material explaining the reasons for the replacement of the concept of fraud in the old section 26 with the new section 26 (later section 32) and the concept of deliberate concealment.  For every passage in the case law warning us against looking back at the old law, Mr Weir was able to point to an instance where the courts have carefully considered not only the pre-1980 cases but also the Law Reform Committee’s report which formed the foundation of the Limitation Amendment Act 1980.  Arden LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Giles v Rhind</span> looked at that material to see the mischief to which section 32(2) was aimed: see [43] onwards.

The second question is then whether the evidence he relies on does show that Parliament intended to carry that forward into the new section 26.  </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Beaman </span>the claimant had deposited packages with the defendants for safekeeping whilst she went to Turkey, on the understanding that the packages would be sent on to her when she asked for them.  Following the outbreak of the Second World War, it became impossible for the packages to be sent.  The defendant company was owned by Italian nationals and their business in England was taken over by the custodian of enemy property.  The English staff therefore wished to wind up the business. The business manager, Mr Ingram, reported to the company secretary, Mr Sayer, that the packages were of no value and they were disposed of to a charity.  No steps were taken to ask for the claimant’s consent or to get in touch with her before the packages were given away.  The claimant brought a claim in conversion more than six years later, relying on the old section 26 and arguing that her right of action had been concealed by fraud.   </p>

He referred to Denning J’s conclusion that the defendants had acted honestly.  As a result, Somervell LJ said, the court had no direct evidence as to the reasons why the claimant’s goods were given away.  However, the only possible inference was that the defendants wanted to get rid of the goods for their own convenience and with complete disregard of the value which the claimant had shown she attached to her property.  He held that “any reasonable person directing himself to the facts as known would have realised that the defendants had no right to give away the plaintiff’s goods and that it was dishonest to do so.” Singleton LJ also noted that Denning J had held that Mr Ingram was an honest and reliable witness but said that that still left open the question as to the proper inference to be drawn from the concealment. He accepted that there needed to be ‘conscious wrongdoing’ but held that there was ample proof of that. There was wilful disposition of the property with knowledge that the packages were valued by the plaintiff. The disposition of the property was carried out furtively and the fact that this had been done was deliberately concealed from her.  The appeal was therefore allowed.</p>

That may be true, but they were faced with the fact that the trial judge had concluded that Mr Ingram was an honest witness and that neither he nor Mr Sayer had realised that it was wrong and dishonest to dispose of the packages.  Lord Greene recognised that he could not overturn that finding, however sceptical he was that it was justified.  I do not accept therefore Mr Kimmins’ submission that the decision of the Court of Appeal was based on holding that the defendants had <span style="font-style:italic">known</span> that they were acting in breach of their duty as bailees when they disposed of the goods. All the members of the court recognised that that conclusion was ruled out by the findings of fact made by the trial judge.  That, in my view, is why Lord Greene MR referred to their recklessness as a finding that was open him and why Somervell LJ held that even if Mr Sayer had been honest when directing Mr Ingram to dispose of the goods, “any reasonable person” would have realised that they had no right to do so.  In my judgment therefore, because the Court of Appeal could not go behind the findings made by the judge, the case is authority for the proposition that something less than actual knowledge was sufficient.  </p>

The plaintiff’s husband, a member of the Royal Air Force, had been electrocuted when switching on the electricity at their home. Mrs Kitchen consulted solicitors with a view to bringing an action against the electricity company. The solicitor, Mr Arditti, negligently allowed the limitation period to expire without starting proceedings on her behalf.  Some time later, the electricity company made an <span style="font-style:italic">ex gratia</span> payment to the Royal Air Force Association to be used for her benefit. The money was then given to her by the RAFA but, at Mr Arditti’s suggestion in a telephone conversation with the electricity company, she was not told that the money had come from the electricity company.  The trial judge had found as a fact that Mr Arditti had wanted to withhold the source of the money from Mrs Kitchen not in order to avoid criticism of his firm but because he thought it would prevent the relationship of solicitor and client from springing up between the firm and Mrs Kitchen.  Lord Evershed MR recorded at p 571 that that finding was “strongly challenged” by counsel for Mrs Kitchen but said that he was not prepared to go behind it.  He therefore accepted “the judge’s acquittal of deliberate motive on Mr Arditti’s part.”  Having determined that there had been concealment, Lord Evershed addressed the question of whether there was sufficient mental element: </p>

Estate developers contracted to sell a plot of land on which the foundations of a house had been laid.  The vendors of the land then built a house for the plaintiff on the site.  In fact the foundations had been built on an old rubbish tip so that, as Lord Denning put it, “it seemed firm on top, but was soft and slushy underneath”.  The house had to be demolished.  The evidence at trial was that the vendors had been advised by an architect that they needed to use reinforced foundations but they had not acted on that advice.  The trial judge held that the vendors could not rely on the limitation period bar because they ought to have known of the consequent risk of subsidence. As they had not told the plaintiff of the risk, there had been concealment of his right of action by fraud.

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“The word “fraud” here is not used in the common law sense. It is used in the equitable sense to denote conduct by the defendant or his agent such that it would be “against conscience” for him to avail himself of the lapse of time. The cases show that, if a man knowingly commits a wrong (such as digging underground another man's coal); or a breach of contract (such as putting in bad foundations to a house), in such circumstances that it is unlikely to be found out for many a long day, he cannot rely on the Statute of Limitations as a bar to the claim: see <span style="font-style:italic">Bulli Coal Mining Co. v. Osborne</span> [1899] A.C. 351 and <span style="font-style:italic">Applegate v. Moss</span> [1971] 1 Q.B. 406. In order to show that he “concealed” the right of action “by fraud”, it is not necessary to show that he took active steps to conceal his wrong-doing or breach of contract. It is sufficient that he knowingly committed it and did not tell the owner anything about it. He did the wrong or committed the breach secretly. By saying nothing he keeps it secret. He conceals the right of action. He conceals it by “fraud” as those words have been interpreted in the cases. To this word “knowingly” there must be added “recklessly”: see <span style="font-style:italic">Beaman v. A.R.T.S. Ltd.</span> [1949] 1 K.B. 550, 565-566. Like the man who turns a blind eye. He is aware that what he is doing may well be a wrong, or a breach of contract, but he takes the risk of it being so. He refrains from further inquiry lest it should prove to be correct: and says nothing about it. The court will not allow him to get away with conduct of that kind. It may be that he has no dishonest motive: but that does not matter. He has kept the plaintiff out of the knowledge of his right of action: and that is enough: see <span style="font-style:italic">Kitchen v. Royal Air Force Association</span> [1958] 1 W.L.R. 563. If the defendant was, however, quite unaware that he was committing a wrong or a breach of contract, it would be different. So if by an honest blunder he unwittingly commits a wrong (by digging another man's coal), or a breach of contract (by putting in an insufficient foundation) then he could avail himself of the Statute of Limitations.”  </p>

The claimant did not have to show that the defendant knew that the conduct he was concealing gave rise to a cause of action; it was enough that the concealment was unconscionable and it would be unconscionable if he concealed the fact, being reckless as to whether or not he had committed an actionable wrong.  It may be that the facts of the cases could equally have supported a finding of actual knowledge and that the appellate courts thought the trial judges had been rather indulgent in their factual findings.  But the appellate judges found that the test was satisfied largely without overturning those factual findings but by concluding that actual knowledge was not needed.

The decision to delete those words between the Committee’s wording and the clause included in the Limitation Amendment Bill, he said, sticks out like a sore thumb.  Both Mr Kimmins and Mr Weir speculated why Parliamentary Counsel had removed those words when drafting clause 7 of the Limitation Amendment Bill; was it because recklessness was not intended to be sufficient mental element as Mr Kimmins suggested or because the drafter believed that the word ‘deliberate’ included the concept of ‘recklessness’ anyway?  That does not seem to me to be the relevant point.  The point is rather that the Bill presented by the Lord Chancellor was said not to be in any way more restrictive than the previous law, in the course of a debate which was focused on the element of unconscionability of the defendant’s conduct.  </p>

In many situations, as here, the existence of a legal wrongdoing can only be absolutely known by the defendant once a court has determined that a wrong has been committed.  One must avoid a similar kind of ‘logical paradox’ that the Supreme Court described in <span style="font-style:italic">FII </span>at [173] onwards, namely that one can only determine whether the test for allowing the claim to go forward has been satisfiedm once the claim has gone forward and been determined in the claimant’s favour. This was the problem to which Mance LJ referred in <span style="font-style:italic">Williams </span>at [38] where he said that “the plaintiff could not have to show that the defendant knew that there was a right of action which would succeed”.  It should be sufficient that the defendant appreciates that there is a real risk that its conduct will amount to a legal wrong in circumstances where it is not reasonable for them to take that risk.  Of course, the recklessness test brings with it its own list of potential sub-issues – how serious does the risk have to be? how is the appreciation of risk to be proved?  Those issues may be difficult or straightforward to resolve, but the courts are familiar with making that kind of evaluative judgment on the facts of the particular case.   </p>

By Ground 3, Canada Square argue that if, contrary to their primary submission, recklessness is sufficient, then the test comprises two stages: first, a subjective stage that Canada Square appreciated that there was a risk, and secondly an objective stage that it was unreasonable for them to take that risk.  They contend that the finding of the judge at [67] that “Canada Square must be treated as apprehending that there was a risk that legal wrongdoing would be found by the court” showed that he had applied only the first, subjective limb of the recklessness test without going on to consider whether it was reasonable for them to take that risk.  That, they argue, was an error of law.  By Ground 4, Canada Square argue that even if Jay J was right that all that is needed is a subjective apprehension of risk, he was wrong to find that that test was satisfied on the facts of this case.  </p>

The <span style="font-style:italic">ICOB Review Interim Report: Consumer Experiences and Outcomes in General Insurance Markets </span>discussed PPI specifically at paras 5.8 onwards. It described the nature of the market and noted at para 5.8.5 that competition in the market was not passed down to consumers, with nearly all consumers purchasing the product from the provider of the credit.  The FSA referred to the widespread lack of engagement by customers with the terms of the product they were buying, leaving “considerable scope for the sale of unsuitable policies”: (para 5.8.9).  Policies could be unsuitable for a variety of reasons and lack of competition at the point of sale meant that customers may make expensive purchases.  The FSA referred to commission rates as leading to expensive purchases. The potential for cross-subsidy whereby the money made on PPI policies enabled a lower interest rate on the credit was regarded by the FSA as problematic. Consumers typically shopped around on loan interest rates but not on the combined loan and PPI cost: (para. 5.8.10).  </p>

There were particular risks of consumers purchasing products that they could not claim under or that were not good value. The FSA frankly acknowledged in this review that their current disclosure rules “do not achieve their intended outcome” and that the evidence “suggests the market for PPI generally appears to be failing to deliver against key intended consumer outcomes of ICOB” (para. 5.8.13).  Their work showed:  </p>

That guidance was published in May 2008 pursuant to the OFT’s obligation under the then section 140D to explain how it planned to use its enforcement powers under the Enterprise Act 2002 for the benefit of consumers.  That guidance cannot have given any comfort to Canada Square that it was safe from the application of section 140A because of the ICOB Rules.  The OFT said that the category of conduct in section 140A(1)(c) encompasses both acts and omissions such as where the lender has failed to take certain steps which in the interests of fairness he might reasonably be expected to have taken. Relevant omissions “might include failure to provide key information in a clear and timely manner (or at all), or to disclose material facts.”  The OFT also said that regulatory guidance on what is or is not acceptable business practice may be helpful in identifying unfair behaviour, referring to the criteria set out elsewhere in the CCA by which the OFT assesses fitness to hold a consumer credit licence.  The OFT would take into account whether there had been a breach of the FSA rules, for example in relation to PPI policy sales. The guidance considered potentially unfair business practices in more detail in section 4, stating at para. 4.27 that:  </p>

Mr Weir showed us the FSA’s written evidence to that Commission. Although the giving of this evidence post-dates the end of Mrs Potter’s credit relationship, it recorded the situation that existed during that relationship and, since Canada Square was an active participant in that market, it is reasonable to infer that it was aware of what was going on.

The FSA said that although they had been aware when they took on the regulation of general insurance that there were “potential issues with PPI”, they had believed that the ICOB Rules would address concerns about poor practices.

It is also significant in my view that the FSA told the Parliamentary Commission that their consideration whether to adopt a more robust approach to regulating PPI after November 2005 was influenced by the fact that the OFT was considering whether to make a market investigation reference to the CC – the FSA did not want to pre-empt the CC’s own conclusions and remedies. Finally, the FSA recorded that following the publication of the CC report in January 2009, they wrote a ‘Dear CEO’ letter to all firms still selling single premium PPI with unsecured personal loans asking them to stop selling by 29 May 2009.  Firms complied with this request.  </p>

I would accept that the non-disclosure of commission was not among the most serious of the unfair practices that comprised what became known as the ‘PPI mis-selling scandal’.  I also recognise, as Mr Kimmins urged upon us, that the only factor relied on by Mrs Potter as making her relationship with Canada Square unfair is the non-disclosure of commission.  She was not complaining about being required to pay a single upfront premium for several years of cover or suggesting that she had been required to take out a PPI policy as a condition of the loan.    </p>

For most of the currency of the relationship with Mrs Potter, the CC was investigating selling practices in the market in light of the OFT’s concerns about market failures leading to consumers making expensive purchases.  The reasons why the FSA did not act on its findings in the 2007 Review by toughening up the regulation of PPI was not because it was satisfied that everything was operating as it should.

There were plenty of warning signs that lead inevitably to the inference that Canada Square must have appreciated that if they decided not to tell Mrs Potter that the PPI policy for which they were charging her £3,834 was in fact valued by the insurer at £182.50, there was a risk at least after April 2008 that the credit relationship between them would be regarded as unfair.  Similarly, they must have realised that there was a risk that they ought to disclose the commission to her because to do otherwise would conceal from her a fact that was relevant to her right of action against them under section 140A. </p>

He did, however, seek to rely on an argument along the lines that since all the banks were doing it, it must have been reasonable for Canada Square to do it.  In my judgment, any comfort that Canada Square might have drawn from the fact that other creditors were doing the same must have been dispelled at the latest on the publication of the Competition Commission Report, even if not by the FSA 2007 Review and the reference by the OFT of the market to the CC for investigation.  It was precisely because the practices criticised were so ubiquitous that the CC found that there had been a serious market failure from the point of view of consumers.   </p>

Here there would have been no difficulty or expense incurred in disclosing to Mrs Potter that the insurance premium payable to AXA for the PPI policy was only £182.50 and that the rest of the cost was Canada Square’s commission.  There would have been no possible harm to Mrs Potter in showing her that split of the costs.  I can see no reason why a reasonable person, apprehending the risk that Canada Square must have apprehended, would have decided not to disclose the commission to Mrs Potter.   </p>

Section 32(2) is an additional provision, in effect extending the concept of deliberate concealment to a case where there has been a “deliberate commission of a breach of duty in circumstances in which it is unlikely to be discovered for some time”. Deliberate commission of a breach of duty in those circumstances is deemed to amount to “deliberate concealment of the facts involved in that breach of duty”, whether or not there was actually such deliberate concealment. </p>

In addressing that question it is relevant to bear in mind why the failure to disclose rendered the relationship unfair. <span style="font-style:italic">Plevin</span> holds that a relationship may be unfair even though there was no duty outside section 140A to disclose the commission and even though the section itself does not impose an obligation to disclose it. The unfairness arises because “the creditor must normally be regarded as responsible for an omission making his relationship with the debtor unfair if he fails to take such steps as (i) it would be reasonable to expect the creditor or someone acting on his behalf to take in the interests of fairness, and (ii) would have removed the source of that unfairness or mitigated its consequences so that the relationship as a whole can no longer be regarded as unfair” (see Lord Sumption at [19]). Accordingly the starting point for any consideration of deliberate concealment in this case is that it would have been reasonable to expect the bank to disclose the commission in the interests of fairness and that the bank acted unreasonably in not doing so.  </p>

The bank thought about disclosing but decided not to do so. It is obvious that a decision was made at a senior level within the bank that the extraordinary level of commission should not be disclosed to customers; that salesmen and account managers were instructed accordingly; that documentation was prepared in a way which ensured that there was no mention of commission, let alone its amount; that the bank knew that disclosure of the commission would cause enormous customer dissatisfaction (and, in the case of new business, would mean that the customer would be unlikely to proceed); and that the bank’s decision not to disclose was made in order to safeguard this very lucrative business.

If I consciously decide not to tell you something which I know that you would wish to know and will not like, and which it would be reasonable for me to tell you in order that the relationship between us should be fair, I am deliberately concealing it from you.

But I do not agree that that renders subsection (2) otiose. A claimant who proposes to invoke section 32(1)(b) in order to defeat a Limitation Act defence must prove the facts necessary to bring the case within the paragraph. He can do so if he can show that some fact relevant to his right of action has been concealed from him either by a positive act of concealment or by a withholding of relevant information, but, in either case, with the intention of concealing the fact or facts in question. In many cases the requisite proof of intention might be quite difficult to provide. The standard of proof would be the usual balance of probabilities standard and inferences could of course be drawn from suitable primary facts but, none the less, proof of intention, particularly where an omission rather than a positive act is relied on, is often very difficult. Subsection (2), however, provides an alternative route. … I do not agree with [counsel for the claimant] that the subsection, thus construed, adds nothing.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Although the first issue in these two formulations appears to be identical, Rix LJ’s question was concerned with whether there was a legal duty, while Buxton LJ (who must be regarded as in the majority in view of Sir Martin Nourse’s agreement) was concerned with a duty “in Limitation Act terms” (see [440]) or a duty “in the sense relevant to the Act” (see [443]). These are not the same. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">A duty “in Limitation Act terms” is a somewhat elusive concept. It appears that the existence of such a duty is not to be determined by reference to a defendant’s contractual duties (see [430]) and that its existence is, at least to some extent, “a matter of common sense” (see [439]), but that does not help much in determining when such a duty exists. It may be that the duty is nothing more than a duty not deliberately to conceal relevant facts but, if so, it appears to add nothing of substance to the wording of section 32(1)(b), apart from enabling the unnecessary requirement to find a breach of duty to be satisfied.  </p>

In most cases where section 32(1)(b) applies the defendant probably will have known that the fact or facts which he concealed were relevant, but that is not essential. All that is essential is that the fact must actually have been relevant, whether the defendant knew that or not. The paragraph does of course require that the fact was one which the defendant knew, because otherwise he could not have concealed it. But it is not necessary in addition that the defendant knew that the fact was relevant to the claimant’s right of action.” </p>

Deliberate commission of a breach of duty involves knowledge of wrongdoing. Where it is likely to be some time before the commission of a deliberate breach of duty is discovered, there is deemed to have been ‘deliberate concealment of the facts involved in the breach of duty’. These words in section 32(2) are a paraphrase referring to section 32(1)(b). Both under them and under the language of section 32(1)(b) itself, the legislature must have had in mind (at least as the typical concern) situations where a defendant deliberately concealed facts knowing that they were relevant to an actual or potential breach of duty. So read, section 32(1)(b) deals (at least typically) with deliberate concealment of facts known to be relevant to wrongdoing, while section 32(2) deals with deliberate wrongdoing, which is (in the specified circumstances) equated with deliberate concealment of wrongdoing. In each, the wrongdoing is the wrongdoing in respect of which the plaintiff is claiming. I leave for a moment the question whether this typical concern is the only concern of section 32(1)(b).” </p>

In both cases, however, it was at least implicit in Mance LJ’s formulation that, in a case of omission as distinct from active concealment, the defendant had to know that the failure to speak was a breach of duty. For example, he said at [36] that “The deliberateness derives from [the defendant’s] knowledge that he ought to disclose and his intentional disregard of his duty to do so” and he referred at [37] to deliberate concealment in these terms: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Following this lead, this court in <span style="font-style:italic">The Kriti Palm</span> viewed the defendant’s knowledge that his failure to disclose the fact in question was a breach of duty as an essential requirement of deliberate concealment under section 32(1)(b). That is apparent from (among other things) the formulation of the issues by both Rix LJ and Buxton LJ which I have set out above. As Rix LJ concluded that there was no (legal) duty, the question whether the defendant was aware of that duty or its breach could not arise, although Rix LJ nevertheless addressed it for the sake of completeness at [363] to [366]. For Buxton LJ the relevant duty was a duty “in Limitation Act terms” and he addressed the issue whether the defendant knowingly breached that duty at [447] to [450]. His conclusion that it did was based upon admissions by the defendant’s witnesses in cross examination that if they had known about the Cooper retests, they ought to have told the claimant about them. </p>

In my view, in posing these questions the cases have travelled a very long way from the statutory language, which does not refer to breach of duty at all in section 32(1)(b), let alone draw distinctions between different kinds of duty, and does not contain any requirement about the defendant’s knowledge of such a duty. Nevertheless we are bound by (at least) <span style="font-style:italic">The Kriti Palm</span> and must do the best we can with the subsection as it has been interpreted in the cases which are binding upon us. It is on that basis that I agree with the judgment of Rose LJ. </p>

That is so as a matter of the language and statutory purpose, even though the cases (with the exception of the Cayman Islands case of <span style="font-style:italic">Primeo Fund v Bank of Bermuda (Cayman) Limited</span> [2019] CICA JO613-1 where the reasoning is very brief) have not had to address this point. The facts of the present case demonstrate this: the bank did not actually <span style="font-style:italic">know</span> that it had a duty to Ms Potter, even “in Limitation Act terms”, or that she had a right of action against it, but undoubtedly it concealed the commission from her and did so deliberately. To hold that its conduct did not satisfy the requirements of section 32(1)(b) would defeat the purpose of the subsection. </p>
