Each mobile station generates for itself a random number and compares it with a value sent by the network. A “win” can be defined as generating a random number greater than or equal to the transmitted value. So, for example, the possible transmitted numbers could be 1 to 10, and the random numbers could be 1 to 9. If the base station transmits a 10, no mobile will get onto the channel, but if it transmits a lower number than 10 an increasing proportion of mobiles can get on. At busy times the access can be throttled back to prevent collision. At very low usage times the transmitted value could be 1, and all mobiles would get access. </p>

The first step was to check whether the access class was barred, as above. The second step was a servicebased persistence test. In particular, the network transmitted a 4-bit persistence value for each of four differently defined radio priorities. The mobile would then conduct a persistence test by drawing a random value between 0 and 15 and compare this with the relevant transmitted threshold value. If the threshold (i.e. transmitted) value was less than or equal to the (mobile-generated) random number, then the access attempt would be allowed. If not, the attempt failed and the mobile would have to try again after a random time. It was possible to ensure that all attempts were successful by setting the threshold value to 0, or conversely to ensure that all attempts failed by setting the 4-bit value to correspond to 16. </p>

The network transmits parameters relating to this persistence test which vary depending on the type of class involved. For instance, classes 0-9 are treated as a single group and share the same 6-bit value of PSIST. Conversely, each of the special classes 10-15 has an individual 3-bit PSIST value transmitted by the network. The mobile uses the transmitted value of PSIST for the class to which it belongs in order to derive a value, P, which is compared to a random number RP generated by the mobile in order to see whether access is permitted. If not, it waits a random period until it is permitted to make another access attempt, or until it has run out of attempts. </p>

This permits subscriber stations of a prescribed user class to be authorized to use the telecommunication even if the random distribution by means of access threshold value would not authorize them to access this telecommunications channel. Thus, by way of example, subscriber stations for emergency services, such as the police or the fire brigade, can be associated with such a prescribed user class and can then access the telecommunications channel with priority irrespective of the random distribution by corresponding access threshold value information. </p>

In this case, access to the RACH can be permitted, for example, only for particular user classes of mobile stations on a temporarily or permanently privileged basis. In line with the described exemplary embodiments in figure 1, a first user class 35 is provided which comprises the first mobile station 5 and the second mobile station 10. In addition, a second user class 40 is provided which comprises the third mobile station 15 and the fourth mobile station 20.

It could also be possible to provide user classes containing a different number of mobile stations. It is also possible to provide more than two mobile stations in one user class.

The proportion of privileged users that are granted bypass access can be changed dynamically by way of the access class information broadcast by the network, and the proportion of the remaining users who will successfully gain access using the threshold evaluation can be controlled by way of the access threshold value broadcast by the network. This system combines the flexibility of a threshold with a bypass mechanism so that high priority mobiles in privileged user classes can gain direct access to RACH and escape the constraint of the threshold, all with limited signalling overhead.” </p>

Counsel for IPCom disputed Vodafone’s contention for three reasons, which it is convenient to take in reverse order. First, Vodafone had pointed to no expert evidence (either written or oral) in support of their contention that this was the inventive concept of conditionally amended claim 1. Vodafone’s new inventive concept was never put to Dr Irvine and did not appear in the written evidence of Mr Bishop. On the contrary, Dr Irvine said in his third report that he considered the key inventive concept of conditionally amended claim 1 was the same as that of unconditionally amended claim 1 which the judge quoted.  </p>

The claim not only requires that “each access class bit represents one user class”, but also requires that “each of the user classes is assigned one access class bit”. This requires each and every user class to be assigned an access class bit, and it does not differentiate between the privileged and normally privileged user classes referred to later in the claim. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The technical argument is that, as noted above, if one wants to be able to convert any normally privileged user class into a privileged user class, then  each of the normally privileged user classes must have its own access class bit. Vodafone argue that [0020] of the specification (quoted in paragraph 26 above) refers to changing a normally privileged user class (e.g. everyone whose mobile phone number ends with 1) into a privileged user class which is able to bypass the lottery, thereby achieving dynamic control of access. In addition, Vodafone rely upon what is now claim 5 which is directed to this feature. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">IPCom’s response to the linguistic argument is that, in this integer of the claim, the term “user class” is being used as a generic term, and not as a collective term for both privileged and normally privileged user classes. In context, the user classes being referred to are the user classes that make use of an access class bit (i.e. the privileged user classes), not the user classes that do not (i.e. the normally privileged ones). It should be borne in mind that the claim allows for a plurality of user classes each of which is privileged (e.g. fire, police, ambulance).  </p>

Furthermore, I consider that IPCom is correct that the effect of Vodafone’s construction is to collapse the distinction in the claimed method between privileged and normally privileged users. Even if Vodafone is correct that the skilled reader would understand that it would be advantageous to be able dynamically to transform all normally privileged user classes into privileged user classes, it does not follow that the claim is so limited.   </p>

Although counsel for Vodafone relied on an analogy involving a human being being granted the right to access a physical space such as a lawn or a building, I do not find this persuasive because the claim is not talking about either human beings or physical spaces, but about a logic flow to determine utilisation of a resource (as depicted in the flowchart set out under paragraph 32 above).       </p>

As the skilled reader will appreciate, the result of the comparison in step (iii) is binary: the mobile either wins the lottery or it loses. The phrase “allocates an access right” must be understood in that context, and must refer to granting or refusing access to the RACH. Furthermore, as counsel for IPCom submitted, it is clear from Figure 4 and [0037]-[0038] that the method embraces both outcomes. This is highlighted by the statement in [0038] that the method permits the network operator to “permit or block access to the RACH” depending on the level of traffic. The effect of Vodafone’s construction is that the method is only performed when access is granted. I therefore conclude that the judge was correct on this issue.               </p>

By contrast, Vodafone argue, the method would fall within the conditionally amended claim because it only requires the lottery to be performed for certain categories of non-privileged user and not all classes. </p>

In my view this is not an answer to the judge’s objection, since it amounts to an assertion of a technical result without explaining how that technical result may feasibly be achieved. The claimed method is a complete method for controlling access to a specific telecommunications channel. According to that method (whether according to the granted or conditionally amended claim), there are only two types of non-privileged user: those that have an assigned user class that is normally privileged and those that have no assigned user class at all. Users who have a user class that is not privileged are normally privileged and must do the lottery. If one postulates, as Vodafone do, that there is some unspecified way of accessing the RACH without either doing the lottery or being permitted to bypass the lottery because the user is privileged, then that can only be because the entirety of the claimed method (or, to put it another way, the entirety of the logic flow set out in Figure 4) is being circumvented. Even if this is feasible, it will not infringe either the granted claim or the conditionally amended claim.           </p>

More specifically, the judge held at [108]-[110] that, whereas the application for the Patent as filed only disclosed two checks, unconditionally amended claim 1 not merely claimed, but positively disclosed, a single check. Thus it disclosed subject matter which was not disclosed in the application, and amounted to an impermissible intermediate generalisation. </p>

On that basis, the skilled reader would appreciate that the problem with the unconditionally amended claim was what it disclosed compared to the application, a problem that was cured by the conditionally amended claim. As Lord Neuberger explained in <span style="font-style:italic">Actavis</span> at [74], however, one should not confuse the <span style="font-style:italic">disclosure </span>of a patent with the <span style="font-style:italic">scope of protection</span> of the relevant claims. In my judgment the skilled reader would not conclude from the mere fact that the disclosure of the Patent had been pegged back to what was disclosed in the application that this limited the scope of protection of the conditionally amended claims to two checks. The argument advanced by counsel for Vodafone in this case is an argument of the same genus as, and a weaker one on the facts than, the one that he successfully overcame in the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Actavis</span>. </p>

Even so, I do not accept IPCom’s argument that “chang[ing] the settings” of the base stations is equivalent to the scenario considered by Birss J in <span style="font-style:italic">Philips v Nintendo</span>. In that case, all that had to be done was for the apparatus to be switched on, at which point the software would be loaded into memory and would start running, when it would satisfy the functional requirements of the claim. In the present case, the settings of the base stations had to be changed by the operator in order to make the base stations operate in a different way. This is true whether the settings were changed using LIMA, a different tool or manually. It is true that the base stations were capable of altering their mode of operation so as to send the relevant signals as soon as their settings were changed, but without that change the base stations could not operate in Annex C mode. I do not accept counsel for IPCom’s submission that this is analogous to a radio which has a switch to change from mono (non-infringing) to stereo (infringing), because in that scenario there would be infringing circuitry present at all times even if it was not in operation at any particular time. In my judgment the judge was therefore correct to conclude that in normal use the base stations were not appropriately programmed or adapted or configured to send the barring parameters.      </p>

First, counsel for IPCom submitted that the approach taken in <span style="font-style:italic">Philips v Nintendo</span> was consistent with the “kit of parts” doctrine discussed in <span style="font-style:italic">Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd v Delta Airways Inc</span> [2010] EWHC 3094 (Pat), [2011] RPC 8 (the point did not arise on the appeal in that case). I remain somewhat sceptical about the kit of parts doctrine for the reasons explained at [131] in <span style="font-style:italic">Virgin v Delta</span>, but it is not necessary or profitable to consider the doctrine further in the present case given that it is not about dealings in a kit of parts.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, counsel for IPCom suggested that problems of this kind might be better analysed in terms of the doctrine of equivalents than in the way in which they had been analysed in cases like <span style="font-style:italic">Philips v Nintendo</span>. Given that he did not suggest that IPCom could succeed by that route if it did not succeed on the arguments discussed above, however, it is not necessary to consider that interesting suggestion on this occasion.                </p>

The consequence is that compensation is payable by the relevant Government department rather than Vodafone. Both IPCom and SSD contend that the judge fell into error when construing section 55(1) of the  1977 Act. The issue is what is meant by “authorised in writing by a government department”, or more specifically what form of authorisation is required for this purpose. There is no challenge to the judge’s conclusion that Vodafone’s acts were “for the services of the Crown”. </p>

In short, MTPAS provides a mechanism for the government to privileged access to mobile phone networks to organisations involved in responding to an “emergency” as defined in the Civil Contingencies Act 1994. It is activated by way of a request sent to mobile phone networks by or on behalf of the senior police officer in charge of the emergency response (known as the Police Gold Commander). The format of this request is set out in a memo which was sent by the Cabinet Office to Chief Constables in March 2008: see Annex A thereof.

It is not necessary for present purposes to set these out. The leading authority under the 1949 Act was the decision of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Pfizer v Ministry of Health</span> [1965] AC 512. In that case Pfizer was the proprietor of a patent with product and process claims covering tetracycline, an antibiotic, and processes for making it. Until September 1961 supplies of tetracycline for use in NHS hospitals were obtained from Pfizer’s licensees. In May 1961 the Minister of Health announced that he had decided to use the powers conferred by section 46 of the 1949 Act to obtain certain patented drugs from sources other than the patentees or their licensees in order to save money. To this end the Ministry of Health invited tenders for the supply of tetracycline. The form of tender specified that the contract would be subject to a clause which provided that “Under the provisions of section 46 of the Patents Act, 1949 … the contractor is hereby authorised for the purpose of tending for or performing the contract … to make, use and exercise in accordance with the said provisions any invention …”. The defendant was successful in its tender and fulfilled the contract by importing tetracycline from Italy where there was no patent protection. The House of Lords held by a majority that the supply of the drug to NHS hospitals was a use “for the services of the Crown”, and hence within section 46. No point was taken about the form of the authorisation. </p>

I shall set out the provisions relevant to this appeal below, but at this stage two points may be noted. First, as will appear, section 55(6) expressly permits authorisation to be given retrospectively. In <span style="font-style:italic">Dory v Sheffield Health Authority</span> [1991] FSR 221 the plaintiff brought an action against two health authorities for infringing a patent relating to machines known as lithotriptors for treating kidney stones. After the action had been commenced, the Ministry of Defence issued an authorisation to the defendants’ supplier RW. This provided that “Under the provisions of sections 55-58 </p>

It went on to state that it applied retrospectively and to any claim in respect of the patent in suit. Falconer J held that the effect of the retrospective authorisation was to take away the plaintiff’s cause of action as at the date of the writ. No point was raised on the form of the authorisation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, although section 55(1) extends beyond agents of the Crown, the concept of authorisation is one which is familiar from the law of agency. In that context actual authority may be either express or implied. The usual basis for implication is necessity (as it is in the case of implied terms in contracts). It is difficult to see why section 55(1) should exclude an authorisation to do an act which necessarily infringes a patent. It is equally difficult to see why it should extend to an authorisation to do an act which does not necessarily infringe a patent. I will return to this point below. </p>

If, as SSD also contends, an authorisation to work any patent would suffice, it might be very difficult, if not impossible, for the relevant Government Department to comply with this obligation. The same is true if an authorisation to do any act would suffice. In my view section 55(7) suggests that the authorisation must either be an express authorisation to work a specific patent or an authorisation to do a particular act which necessarily involves working a specific patent.         </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Seventhly, I do not accept the submission of counsel for SSD that express authorisation is required for the Crown to make an informed decision. He postulated an example in which an invitation to tender is put out the performance of which requires the use of a patented invention. Contractor A, who is ignorant of the patent, bids without allowing for the cost of obtaining a licence. Contractor B, who knows of the patent, makes an allowance for the cost as a result of which his bid is higher and he loses the contract to Contractor A. Contractor A having won the contract is then threatened with infringement proceedings. If he were able to plead that he had an implied authorisation for Crown use, he would be able to offload the cost of compensating the patentee onto the Crown, negating his competitive advantage at the bidding stage and possibly even causing the Crown a loss. Counsel submitted that such an outcome cannot have been within the contemplation of the legislature and should accordingly be rejected. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I do not think that this example supports SSD’s interpretation. If performing the contract necessitates working the patented invention, on the second interpretation the authorisation will cover this. Then both A and B would have the benefit of a Crown use defence if they won the contract. Accordingly B would not need a licence from the patentee and would not have to allow for the cost of royalty payments to the patentee. It may be the case that the Crown ends up with higher costs (as a result of compensating the patentee) than it anticipated if it did not know about the patent; but the same would happen if an express authorisation was granted to work any invention and that turned out to cover a patent which the Crown did not know about. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On the other hand, a variant of this example does support SSD’s and IPCom’s case that the third interpretation cannot be correct. Suppose a contract is let which can be performed either by working the patent or by not working the patent. Contractor A chooses to work the patent, while Contractor B chooses not to. Both quote the same price, and the contract goes to A. On the third interpretation A has a Crown use defence, and the Crown is landed with the costs of compensating the patentee even though the Crown may not have known of the existence of the patent. By contrast, on the first or second interpretations, the Crown can, once it discovers the patent, make an informed decision as to whether or not to grant a retrospective authorisation to A.  </p>

It is true that the third interpretation avoids having to consider the question of necessity, but I do not agree that this means that section 55(1) is easier to operate. On the contrary, for the reasons given above, I consider that the third interpretation places a much greater burden on the Crown than the second. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Ninthly, the judge considered that the third interpretation was supported by an example postulated by Vodafone in which an act can only be done in one of two ways, each of which infringes a different patent. I agree that it follows from the first and second interpretations that, if the Crown merely authorises the act, then there is no defence of Crown use either way. I do not see, however, why this shows that the third interpretation is to be preferred. On the contrary, it would potentially expose the Crown to a greater liability if the contractor chose to work a patent which was subject to a higher royalty rate than the other. By contrast, the first and second interpretations would enable the Crown, if it chose, expressly to authorise the working of the lower cost patent. </p>

I disagree with this. In the normal commercial scenario where A buys goods from B, then in the absence of express contractual terms B impliedly warrants, as part of the warranty of quiet possession, that the goods do not infringe third party intellectual property rights: see <span style="font-style:italic">Microbeads AG v Vinhurst Road Markings Ltd</span> [1976] RPC 19. Thus the burden is on the supplier to ensure that the goods are non-infringing or licensed, not on the purchaser. This makes sense: the supplier is in a position to know what technology it is using, to conduct patent searches and take legal advice, to negotiate for a licence if required and to re-design if necessary. I do not see why the position should be different here if the Crown does not authorise use of the patent either expressly or by necessary implication. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Counsel for Vodafone emphasised the difficulty, particularly in the context of standardised telecommunications networks, of conducting freedom-to-operate analyses. Patents can be hard to find (although over-declaration of patents as being standard-essential is a much more common problem than under-declaration), and being confident as whether to a particular patent is essential to the operation of a particular standard can be even harder, particularly now that the United Kingdom has embraced infringement by equivalents.

The purpose of testing is to ensure that the product or method can be used if and when an emergency occurs. It is unsurprising in such circumstances that the duration of use for testing purposes is very short compared to the duration of normal use. Moreover, the fact that the method was not used in an actual emergency does not detract from the fact that it was available for use at all times during the relevant period.

His cross-examination required him to clear his mental decks of all such proposals and start with a system solely based on the lottery. He plainly thought this whole exercise unrealistic, as I believe it to have been.

The first step was to decide the “normal” meaning of the claim. At [53] Lord Neuberger (giving the unanimous judgment of the court) described the previous approach as one in which the courts had applied an “extended version of the ordinary concept of “construction” or “interpretation.” At [54] he proposed a modified way of approaching the scope of patent claims: </p>

Indeed, as Arnold LJ has pointed out at [99], in describing the role of equivalents, Lord Neuberger began by asking whether the alleged infringement fell within the “literal” meaning of the claim.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In this appeal IPCom advanced no case on equivalents in relation to the integer dealing with the phrase “access right”. So the scope of that expression depends entirely on step 1: the “normal” interpretation. As Arnold LJ has said at [67] the words “access right” are ordinary English words. So I begin by considering what, as ordinary English words, they would be understood to mean. Mr Nicholson QC submitted, and the judge accepted, that an “access right” could be either positive or negative. It is perfectly true, as Arnold LJ says at [69], that intellectual property rights are often characterised as negative rights. They are negative rights in the sense that they are rights to stop other people from doing things (working the invention, copying a literary work etc). But the question is not whether, in the abstract, a right can be positive or negative. It is whether there can be a negative access right. I regret that I simply do not understand the concept of a negative right <span style="font-style:italic">of access</span>. Patent claims have often been likened to boundary markers intended to show third parties “the exact boundary of the area within which they will be trespassers”: <span style="font-style:italic">Electric and Musical Industries Ltd v Lissen Ltd</span> (1938) 56 RPC 23, 39.

Some people have the cards, but others do not. The building owner decides who is entitled to a card and who is not. The building owner’s right could, I suppose, be described as a negative right in the sense that he can stop people from coming in without a card; and he can decide who gets a card and who does not. But it is a real right. It could also be described as a positive right, in the sense that the building owner can also decide (positively) who is allowed to cross the boundary without becoming a trespasser. A person who has a card can fairly be described as having an access right. But what I find impossible to accept is that a person who does not have a card has a negative access right. You might just as easily say that I have a negative right of access to 10 Downing Street; or to the MoD’s top secret laboratories at Porton Down. To have no right of access is not a right of any kind. To describe it as a “negative right” is, in my judgment, a meaningless oxymoron. So here: I fail to see how a person who has been denied access to the system because he is neither privileged nor has “won the lottery” can be said to have any access right at all as a matter of ordinary English. Even though the patent is dealing with a logic flow, I still find it difficult to see how a right of access can encompass no right of access at all as  a matter of ordinary English. </p>

At [68] Arnold LJ has cited a number of passages from the specification that bear on the question. Those passages do suggest that the method described in the specification both grants and blocks access. But does that lead to the conclusion that the claim means what Mr Nicholson says it means; or is it a pointer to possible success on an unpleaded and unargued case of equivalents? </p>
