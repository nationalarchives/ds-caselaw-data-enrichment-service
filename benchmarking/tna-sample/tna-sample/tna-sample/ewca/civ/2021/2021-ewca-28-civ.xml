	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">1.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>This appeal raises two questions about the application to a defamation claim of article 27 of the Lugano Convention (Convention on jurisdiction and recognition of judgments in civil and commercial matters 21.12.2007 (OJ 2007 L339 p1)).   The Judge applied article 27 to decline jurisdiction on the grounds that the cause of action in these proceedings was the same as that in proceedings brought in Norway for negative declaratory relief, of which the Norwegian Court was first seised.    The issues on this appeal are (1) whether article 27 applies to these defamation claims; and (2) if so, whether the causes of action in the two sets of proceedings are the same.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The claim arises in relation to a controversy as to who was the developer of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.  On 31 October 2008 an academic paper was published online under the name Satoshi Nakamoto describing the manner in which the electronic cash system operated.  Thereafter Satoshi Nakamoto came to be regarded as the pseudonym for the person or persons who developed Bitcoin.  The claimant, Dr Craig Wright, is a computer scientist with a particular interest in cryptocurrencies.  He has lived in England since December 2015.   His connections with England are more fully explored in the judgment of this Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Wright v Ver</span> [2020] EWCA Civ 672.   As recorded in paragraphs 23 and 27 of that judgment, he claims on his website to be the creator of Bitcoin under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, and claims to have been the author of the 2008 academic paper.    </p>

It set out the terms of nine tweets on that account posted between 13 and 18 March 2019, but made a complaint of libel only in relation to the one sent on 17 March quoted above.  It set out the defamatory meaning alleged, namely that “[Dr Wright] had fraudulently claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, that is to say the person or one of the people who developed Bitcoin.”  It went on to assert that the meaning was false in these terms: </p>

It threatened a claim for damages unless all these steps were taken.  It required a response by 5 April 2019, and stated that, in the absence of a satisfactory response, Dr Wright would locate the author and commence libel proceedings against him in this jurisdiction. </p>

Mr Granath filed an acknowledgment of service and issued a Part 11 application asking the court to decline jurisdiction pursuant to article 27 of the Lugano Convention on the grounds that the Oslo District Court was first seised and that the Norwegian Claim and English Claim involved the same cause of action.

Jurisdiction was accepted on the basis that the relief sought was “global” in the sense that it was not limited to any harm or loss suffered in Norway, and that article 5(3) of the Lugano Convention was applicable because the “harmful event” occurred in Norway, that being where Mr Granath lived and published the tweets.  Dr Wright’s appeal on this issue to the Borgarting Court of Appeal was dismissed, as was a subsequent appeal to the Norwegian Supreme Court.  Jurisdiction for the Norwegian Claim is therefore established, with the consequence that if the Judge was correct, article 27(2) requires jurisdiction to be declined in favour of the Oslo District Court and the English Claim to be dismissed. </p>

It identifies the three ingredients required under section 3-6a of the Damage Compensation Act (Damages Act) as being that the allegations (in the tweet) must be libellous, made negligently, and be unlawful.  What follows addresses each.  As to the first it states “Granath believes he can substantiate that Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto and that Granath’s allegations are therefore correct.  Therefore they are not libellous.”  As to the second it states “Neither has Granath acted negligently in relation to the statements.”  As to the third it states “In any case Granath had honourable reasons to put forward the allegations” and goes on to refer to the statements being within the wide framework of the protection of freedom of expression as a key human right under the Norwegian Constitution and under article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and so not unlawful.  It goes on to say, in the alternative, that even if the statements are libellous, Dr Wright has not suffered any loss because his reputation was damaged long before the tweets.  The section concludes: “Accordingly we ask the court to find in favour of Granath regarding the claims by Wright.  We will also ask for a declaratory judgement that Granath’s statements on Twitter about Wright are lawful.” </p>

The claimant, who was based in England at the time of suit, commenced an action for libel in England which by amendment was confined to the damage caused only by the publication and distribution in England.  There were rival submissions as to how to determine both limbs of the article 5(3) test, namely place of harmful event and place of direct damage.  These were resolved by the court holding that the place where the harmful event occurred was to be interpreted as the place where the publisher of the newspaper is established, since that is the place where the harmful event originates and from which the libel is initiated: paragraphs 24-25.

However it created a distinction in the type of claims brought in defamation proceedings.   The first two options provided a choice of forum in which to bring the whole of an entire claim (to use the language of paragraph 32), as is normally the position with the application of article 5(3) to other claims in tort or delict.  This has come to be known as a global claim.  The third option provides a choice to bring a series of claims in different jurisdictions at the same time with each confined to the damage suffered within each jurisdiction. These have come to be known as mosaic claims. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">There are two aspects of this decision worth emphasising.  First, the option to bring mosaic claims is of a different quality from the options of where to bring a global claim.  The forum chosen for a global claim will determine where the entire claim is to be determined: it is a single forum choice.  By contrast the mosaic claim option inherently permits multiple parallel proceedings in which the proceedings will be identical or similar (depending on the governing law applied under local rules of private international law) save for the local damage alleged.   It is a multi-forum choice which contemplates and permits the bringing of parallel proceedings.  The Court recognised that this carried with it all the disadvantages of parallel litigation, but said at paragraph 32:  “Although there are disadvantages to having different courts ruling on various aspects of the same dispute, the plaintiff always has the option of bringing his entire claim before the courts either of the defendant’s domicile or the place where the publisher of the publication is established.”  The disadvantages of parallel litigation may be very considerable: they involve the duplication of costs and court resources, and the risk of irreconcilable or inconsistent decisions, which it is the very purpose of the <span style="font-style:italic">lis pendens</span> regime to mitigate or avoid.  The Court was, however, less concerned about this effect of mosaic claims because the claimant had the option of bringing a global claim instead.  The Court said nothing expressly about the ability of a defendant to mitigate or avoid these disadvantages.  However, as I shall endeavour to show, he can mitigate or avoid them as a result of the choice conferred on him to have the claim determined as a global claim in a single jurisdiction by bringing a claim for negative declaratory relief. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, the case illustrates that an important consequence of the claimant having jurisdiction options is what might pejoratively, but wrongly, be called “forum shopping”.   In defamation cases the courts of different states will apply their own conflicts rule to determine applicable law: defamation is outside the harmonising scope of the Rome II Regulation (Regulation (EC) 864/2007 on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations).   Often this will result in application of the <span style="font-style:italic">lex fori</span> which may well differ from that which would be applied in a different available forum.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Shevill</span>, Advocate General Darmon stated that that there are striking differences between the national laws in contracting states in respect of defamation; </p>

He went on to point out that therefore choice of forum was “not a neutral matter” (paragraph 12), recognising that the choice of forum carried with it the potential for significant differences in the parties’ substantive rights, because available jurisdictions might apply their own differing national laws.   This is inherent in the scheme of the Convention and the options it confers, conferring on a claimant the ability to choose from amongst the available options the forum which will apply the system of law most favourable to him.   However, as I have observed, it would be wrong to treat this as forum shopping in a pejorative sense.

The particular problems thrown up by this different form of information medium led the court to fashion a further special rule for the application of article 5(3) in such cases: the claimant additionally should have the option of suing in the jurisdiction in which he has his centre of interests (paragraphs 48-50).  The Court made clear that this was for a global damages claim and was in addition to the other options conferred by article 5(3) (paragraphs 51-52).  </p>

That decision makes clear that they apply whether the claimant is a natural or legal person (paragraph 38), and apply when there is material damage as well as damage to reputation or feelings (paragraph 36).   It also establishes that where non-pecuniary relief of a kind which is single and indivisible is sought, in that case amendment of a website and removal of material from it, it may only be sought in one of the jurisdictions in which a global claim may be brought; it cannot be included in a mosaic claim: see paragraphs 45 to 49.  Mr Wolanski QC submitted that this would apply equally to a claim for an injunction restraining Mr Granath from repeating the libel, as it clearly would if the injunction were not confined to local repetition in England.  The significance of this aspect of the decision lies in the categorisation of the English Claim in this case.  Mr Wolanski submitted that it was a global claim, not a mosaic claim limited to damages suffered within this jurisdiction.  That followed both from the inclusion of a claim for an injunction, as well as the prayer for damages without limit.  Although paragraph 6 pleaded damage to Dr Wright’s reputation in this jurisdiction, that was to fulfil the requirements of s.1 of the Defamation Act 2013 to establish serious harm, and did not restrict the claim for damages to those suffered in this jurisdiction.  The English Claim is therefore a global claim, not a mosaic claim.  </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Owners of cargo lately laden on board the Ship TATRY v Owners of the Ship MACIEJ RATAJ</span> (Case C406/92) [1999] QB 515, the CJEU was concerned with claims arising out of the alleged contamination by diesel oil and other hydrocarbons of a bulk cargo of soya bean oil carried by the TATRY to Rotterdam and Hamburg.  The shipowners made a pre-emptive strike by commencing proceedings in the Rotterdam District Court against the cargo owners, including those due to take delivery in Hamburg, for a declaration of non-liability.  One of the questions in issue was whether that involved the same cause of action under article 21 of the Brussels Convention (materially identical to article 27 of the Lugano Convention) as a subsequent cargo claim brought by the Hamburg cargo interests for damages in England.  I shall return to the decision when considering article 27 below, but for present purposes it is relevant to note that the Court expressed no disapproval of this course. Moreover Advocate General Tesauro addressed and rejected an argument that NDR actions are “a cloak for forum shopping” (paragraphs 21-22) and went as far as to say that “the bringing of proceedings to obtain a negative finding is generally allowed under the various national procedural laws and is entirely legitimate in every respect.”   </p>

The “Italian Torpedo” was the name given to parties facing a strong claim who brought NDR actions in Italy for tactical advantage based on the lengthy delays which might occur there.  That is, in the words of AG Tesauro, entirely legitimate.  If it produces a result which some find unpalatable, that is not the result of the availability of NDR, or the propriety of invoking it as such, but of the simple “tie-break rule” (<span style="font-style:italic">Dresser UK Ltd v Falcongate Freight Management Ltd</span> [1992] QB 502, 514) of first seisin in article 27 which gives priority to the objective of certainty; and of the assumption which underlies the Convention that there is no distinction to be drawn in the quality of justice available in each member state notwithstanding differences in national courts, laws and procedures.     </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Folien Fischer AG v Ritrama SpA</span> (Case C-133/11) [2013] QB 523, the CJEU addressed the question whether article 5(3) applied to an NDR claim by Folien Fischer that its distribution policy, and refusal to grant patent licences, was not contrary to competition law, as Ritrama had alleged.  In concluding that article 5(3) applied, notwithstanding the differences in the form of the actions and the role of the parties, the Court said at paragraph 52 that provided the relevant elements of the liability in dispute fulfilled the article 5(3) test in either of its two meanings (i.e. place of harmful event or place of direct damage), each of those two states could assume jurisdiction for an NDR claim.  In other words, where article 5(3) confers a choice of options, it confers them on the defendant by way of a choice of fora in which to bring an NDR claim just as much as on a claimant.  A charge of “forum shopping” in the pejorative sense is just as misguided when applied to these choices which are made by someone facing a claim as it is when applied to the same choices available to the person advancing the claim. They are the choices which the Convention confers. </p>

In observing that the claimant always had the option to bring his entire claim before the courts of the defendant’s domicile or of the place where the publisher of the defamatory publication is established, the court is in my view to be treated as saying that the considerable disadvantages involved in parallel litigation can be avoided by the bringing of a global claim, which is something open to the claimant.  The same logic would permit a defendant to avoid these serious disadvantages by seeking to have the entire claim dealt with in a forum which had global jurisdiction by bringing a claim for NDR.  Indeed, whether or not that is inherent in the observation in that case, it is consistent with the main purposes of the <span style="font-style:italic">lis pendens</span> provisions in the Convention, which are to avoid parallel proceedings and avoid the risk of conflicting judgments.    </p>

After all, art 22 is available, with its more flexible discretionary power to stay, in the case of ‘related proceedings’ which need not involve the triple requirement of art 21. There is no need, therefore, as it seems to me, to strain to fit a case into art 21. The European Court, when speaking in <span style="font-style:italic">Gubisch</span> (at para 8) of the purpose, in the interests of the proper administration of justice within the European Community, of preventing parallel proceedings in different jurisdictions and of avoiding ‘in so far as it is possible and from the outset’ the possibility of irreconcilable decisions, was addressing arts 21 and 22 together, rather than art 21 by itself. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.01in;text-indent:0.00in">Thus a prime example of a case within art 21 is of course where party A brings the same claim against party B in two jurisdictions. Such a case raises no problem. More commonly, perhaps, the same dispute is raised in two jurisdictions when party A sues party B to assert liability in one jurisdiction, and party B sues party A in another jurisdiction to deny liability, or vice versa. In such situations, the respective claims of parties A and B naturally differ, but the issue between them is essentially the same. The two claims are essentially mirror images of one another. <span style="font-style:italic">Gubisch</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">The</span> [<span style="font-style:italic">Tatry</span>] are good examples of this occurrence. </p>

The authority of <span style="font-style:italic">The Happy Fellow</span> at first instance may be somewhat shaken by the reservations expressed by Lord Justice Saville on appeal, but it too may be said to illustrate the process of analysing the claims and issues in the respective proceedings to identify whether they are the same. Where, for instance, there is no dispute over a shipowner's right to limit should he be found liable (a separate question, which need not even be resolved at the time when a limitation action is commenced or a decree given), I do not for myself see why it should be held that the liability action and the limitation action involve the same cause of action for the purposes of art 21.”  </p>

The claim seeks to establish that the tweet is true.  I do not see how the Norwegian Court could consider or decide that question without answering the logically prior question of what it means. Mr Wolanski relied in the course of argument on the fact that the Norwegian Claim said nothing about whether meaning was in issue.  However care must be taken about the use of the word  “issue” which is prevalent in the jurisprudence in this area.  What matters is the element or elements of the claim, whether or not in dispute.  If the Norwegian court will have to determine meaning as an element of the claim, it is irrelevant whether there is any dispute about its meaning, and therefore an “issue” in that sense.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I am also unable to accept that the truth of the tweet cannot be treated as a question which arises in the English proceedings on the grounds that it will be for Mr Granath to raise it by way of defence.  This argument has a wholly artificial air; it is clear that the defence of truth will be advanced in the English Claim if it proceeds, because the truth of the tweet has been averred as the central element of the Norwegian Claim.  That does not fall foul of the rationale put forward in <span style="font-style:italic">Gantner</span> at paragraphs 27 to 31 for ignoring defences, which is that the identity question must be capable of being answered at the moment of seisin in the second set of proceedings.  I would accept Mr Tomlinson’s argument that if the first set of proceedings would amount in substance to a defence to the second set, that is sufficient to allow its defensive content to be taken into account in assessing the scope of the second seised proceedings for article 27 purposes.  Some support for this approach is to be found in <span style="font-style:italic">Gubisch</span>.  There the claim first brought was by the German seller of a machine tool who commenced suit in a German Landgericht (regional court).  It was an action for the price against the Italian buyer.  Subsequently the purchaser commenced proceedings in Italy for a declaration that the order he had placed was inoperative because he had revoked it; or alternatively for rescission of the contract on the grounds of lack of consent or discharge as a result of failure to comply with the mandatory time limit for delivery.    The CJEU held that the claims involved the same cause of action because the question whether the contract was binding lay at the heart of the two actions.  It went on at paragraph 16 to say: “If it is the action for rescission or discharge of the contract that is brought subsequently, it may even be regarded as simply a defence against the first action, brought in the form of independent proceedings before a court in another Contracting State.”  In other words, the Court was saying that if one action can be regarded as in substance a defence to the other, its defensive content helps determine whether the two claims involve the same cause of action.  So in the present case, the claim in Norway that the tweet was true would have been regarded as a defence to the English Claim and as such its defensive content falls to be considered in the English proceedings, which are second seised, when comparing the two to determine whether they involve the same cause of action.   </p>

Some national systems may require a claimant to plead a lack of truth as part of a claim while others leave it to be raised by way of defence.  Those are aspects of the national laws and procedures whose differences ought not to affect the autonomous application of article 27.  As my Lord, Singh LJ, put it in the course of argument, article 27 looks to an overall assessment of the position in substance, not to the niceties of different procedural requirements of national systems of law.   </p>

The terms of the Norwegian Claim make clear in a number of places that what is sought is a declaration of nonliability for the claims advanced by Dr Wright, and specifically the claim advanced in the letter before action of 29 March.  That letter confines the libel claim to the 17 March tweet.    </p>

The first is that the Norwegian Claim identifies negligence as a necessary ingredient of liability under Norwegian law, and asserts the absence of negligence on Mr Granath’s part.  This gives rise to the possibility that Mr Granath could succeed in Norway on a basis that would not be inconsistent with liability to Dr Wright in England under English law: if </p>

However the consequence of the Court now declining jurisdiction under article 27 would be to preclude him from pursuing that English law claim or obtaining the relief it would provide. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The second difference between the claims is that were Mr Granath to fail in full in Norway, the relief available there to Dr Wright by way of counterclaim would not be co-extensive with that available in a successful English law claim.  It would not include a s.12 statement; and it might not include an injunction.  I say “might not” because it was in dispute as to whether that was so.  Dr Wright sought to adduce expert evidence of Norwegian law before the Judge below, but permission was refused on the grounds that it came too late, with the result that there was no relevant evidence of Norwegian law or practice before the Court.  Mr Tomlinson asserted that an injunction must be available in Norway as an effective remedy guaranteed by the EU Charter, but later confirmed that Norway was not a signatory to the Charter and not bound by it.  He submitted in the alternative that such relief would be available as part of Dr Wright’s article 8 rights under the European Convention on Human Rights, but that is not self-evident to me and the point was not explored in argument.  I shall assume for the purposes of my analysis that an injunction is not available in Norway because for the reasons explained below I do not regard any such unavailability as precluding the application of article 27. </p>

The Italian first instance court rejected the argument that the cases involved the same cause of action within the meaning of article 21 of the Brussels Convention.  On appeal, the Court of Cassation referred the question to the CJEU.  The rival arguments were recorded in paragraph 2 of the Opinion of Advocate General Mancini.  That which prevailed in the Italian first instance court, and was supported by the Italian government, was that article 21 must be interpreted literally and the two causes of action were not the same; any risk of inconsistent judgments could be met by the application of the discretionary jurisdiction to stay under article 22.  The contrary argument, supported by the European Commission and other interveners, was that article 21 “operates not only in the case of proceedings involving exactly the same subject matter and cause of action but also in the case of actions which, whilst differing in scope, are based on the same legal circumstance.”  AG Mancini favoured the former argument, and opined at page 4 that the cases did not involve the same <span style="font-style:italic">cause</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">objet</span>: “Both cases are indeed concerned with the question whether a contract exists and whether it is operative.

The validity of the contract which was in issue in the Italian proceedings was a necessary, but not sufficient, basis for the claim in the German proceedings; the latter additionally raised the issue of what the seller was entitled to under the contract if valid and subsisting.  In that case the identity which was held to be sufficient was that in both sets of proceedings the cause of action “was based on the same contractual relationship”.

It is not clear from the report whether the buyer would have accepted a liability to pay the price if he failed in his allegations that the contract was inoperative, rescinded or discharged, but that is not relevant: as the authorities make clear (see e.g <span style="font-style:italic">Primacom</span> at paragraph 42 and the <span style="font-style:italic">Easygroup</span> case discussed below), what matters when determining whether there is identity of <span style="font-style:italic">cause</span> is whether there is sufficient identity of the issues which the claim raises, whether or not such issues are disputed by the defendant. </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Hoffmann v Krieg</span> (Case 145/86) [1988] ECR 648 the CJEU had established that in the context of the enforcement provisions (article 27(3) of the Convention), irreconcilable judgments were those where the decisions had mutually exclusive legal consequences. At paragraphs 49 to 57 of <span style="font-style:italic">The Tatry</span> the Court explained that the word irreconcilable in article 22 of the Brussels Convention had a different and broader meaning than it did when used in the enforcement provisions. It covered the risk of conflicting or contradictory decisions even if their legal consequences were not mutually exclusive and they could be separately enforced.  This was because the objective of article 22 was to improve coordination of judicial functions within the Community and avoid conflicting and contradictory decisions (paragraph 55).  Applying <span style="font-style:italic">The Tatry</span>, the House of Lords held in <span style="font-style:italic">Sarrio SA v Kuwait Investment Authority</span> [1991] 1 AC 32 that the concept of conflicting decisions was to be interpreted broadly, and could extend to conflict on issues which were not primary or even essential issues as individual ingredients of the cause of action.

It is true that articles 21 and 22 are also aimed at avoiding the possibility of judgments which would result in non-recognition, and are irreconcilable in that sense, but that is not their only objective, as is apparent from paragraph 8 of <span style="font-style:italic">Gubisch</span>, in which the CJEU identified the purposes of articles 21 and 22 of the Brussels Convention together as  “intended, in the interests of the proper administration of justice within the Community, <span style="font-style:italic">to prevent parallel proceedings before the Courts of different Contracting States </span>and<span style="font-style:italic"> to avoid conflicts between decisions which might result therefrom</span>.  Those rules are therefore designed to preclude, insofar as possible and from the outset, the possibility of a situation arising <span style="font-style:italic">such as</span> that referred to in Article 27(3), that is to say the non-recognition of a judgment on account of its irreconcilability with a judgment given in a dispute between the same parties in the State in which the recognition is sought” (my emphasis).  The same formulation is adopted in <span style="font-style:italic">Erich Gasser GmbH v MISAT Srl</span>  (Case C-116/02) [2005] QB 1, at paragraph 41.  I would therefore respectfully disagree with the suggestion in paragraph 129 of Lord Neuberger’s minority judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">The Alexandros T</span> that the fundamental purpose of Article 27 is to ensure enforceability of judgments if he thereby intended to convey that such is its sole or essential purpose.

However, a granular analysis would inevitably have identified differences in the legal ingredients of the causes of action in the two cases.  It is inconceivable that the legal ingredients of a code based tort of embezzlement under Greek law would coincide with the legal ingredients of the equity based proprietary claims advanced in the English proceedings.  One was a claim of a personal nature, the other proprietary.  This was expressly recognised in Lord Bingham’s conclusion that the plaintiffs were asserting in England that the underlying agreement “gave rise to <span style="font-style:italic">different legal consequences from which different legal obligations</span> and therefore different legal remedies flowed” (my emphasis).     </p>

Moylan LJ expresses disagreement that the remarks of Lord Bingham bear this interpretation; or if they do, that they bear the weight I seek to place on them.  He gives two reasons.  The first is that the judgment provides limited assistance by way of explanation as to why the cause was considered to be the same in both countries, and one explanation might be that the court was persuaded by the expert evidence that the tort claim and the restitution claim had the same legal basis, which was, in turn, the same legal basis as the proceedings in England.  This was not, however, the explanation given by Lord Bingham: the issue of identity under article 21 was not one to be determined by Greek law or any domestic law, but by the autonomous European law concept which he identified from paragraph 39 of <span style="font-style:italic">The Tatry</span>.  His conclusions explain that this was fulfilled by the identity of both claims <span style="font-style:italic">arising out of the same underlying agreement</span>, notwithstanding, as he expressly recognised, that the legal obligations which were relied on as flowing from that agreement were different in each of the two claims.   The unifying feature was said to be the underlying agreement notwithstanding the different legal obligations which formed the basis for the two claims.  Secondly, Moylan LJ suggests that the focus on the fact that the proceedings were based on the same underlying agreement resonates with the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Gubisch.</span>  I would respectfully agree, but this serves to emphasise that exact identity between the legal issues which arise domestically in the two sets of proceedings is not required, it being absent both in this case and in <span style="font-style:italic">Gubisch</span> for the reasons I have endeavoured to explain. </p>

In an action in Mainz, the borrowers sought a declaration that the lending banks were not entitled to interest under the facility, either at all, or alternatively in respect of a certain period of time, on the basis of a particular German statutory provision providing protection to those in financial crisis. In Frankfurt they sought declarations in relation to pledge agreements executed on the same date as the loan facility: they claimed there were no pledges constituted by those agreements, alternatively that they were not enforceable until the end of the loan agreement or the end of the borrowers’ financial crisis.  In England the lenders’ first action was for an injunction to prevent the borrowers selling an asset which by the terms of the loan facility could only be sold with the consent of the lenders.  The second action sought declarations as to the validity and enforceability of the clause in the loan agreement providing for payment of interest.  The third action sought disclosure of a report on the lenders’ financial position by PwC which another provision of the loan agreement required to be disclosed to the lenders. </p>

He recognised that the German courts would apply their own domestic law as a matter of its rules of private international law, and that the English court would conversely apply its own law as applicable under English conflicts rules.  There was therefore a clear disparity in legal issues: the Mainz court would apply the German public order statute which protects debtors in financial crisis, whereas the English court would not.

A decision in the English Court would not answer the question which the German Courts have to consider as a matter of public policy.

It is not clear to me that this concept formed an important part of the reasoning for either of the two bases for the decision.  Paragraph 40 would suggest that it may have done: there David Richards LJ identified the issue of consent as an essential element of both claims, and said that the <span style="font-style:italic">cause</span> was mirrored in the two sets of proceedings as regards the issue of consent notwithstanding that there was not complete overlap.  On the other hand, paragraphs 46 and 51 suggest that the legal issues in both claims were considered to be identical apart from the effect of the undertaking and indications given in the Cypriot proceedings which would narrow their scope to the issue of consent.  Each of the two grounds for the court’s decision comprised reasons why the undertaking and indications should be ignored for the purposes of comparing the <span style="font-style:italic">cause</span> in each action. </p>

Lord Clarke uses the language of “mirroring” in his judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">The Alexandros T</span>, but as is well known, metaphors are sometimes no substitute for further analysis.  It is, in my view, an apt and useful metaphor for the inverted reflection which captures the identity between a positive allegation and a negative allegation.  It cannot, however, be taken to mean that the two claims must be an exact reflection of each other in the sense that there is complete overlap of all legal issues.  That would be contrary to the decision of the CJEU in <span style="font-style:italic">Gubisch</span>, the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Haji-Ioannou</span> and contrary to the decision of Cooke J in <span style="font-style:italic">Primacom</span> which received the implicit approval of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">The Alexandros T</span>.

As Lord Clarke observed at paragraph 28(iv) in <span style="font-style:italic">The Alexandros T</span>, article 27 is not engaged merely by virtue of the fact that common issues will arise in both sets of proceedings.

This affords a clue to what level of divergence will or will not prevent the necessary identity of <span style="font-style:italic">cause</span>.  Where a divergent issue is not one of those issues which comprise the essential element of the claim, in the sense of being part of its essence or main focus, the fact that such issue arises in only one set of proceedings may not prevent the necessary identity of <span style="font-style:italic">cause </span>being established.   Conversely an issue which arises in only one of the sets of proceedings and which is one of the issues which goes to make up the essence of the claim in those proceedings is likely to prevent the necessary identity of <span style="font-style:italic">cause</span> being established.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Tomlinson’s submissions therefore appear to me flawed in a number of ways.  The very high level of abstraction at which he seeks to characterise the legal basis for the claims, i.e. liability for defamation, focusses solely on the end the actions have in view, i.e. the <span style="font-style:italic">objet</span>, leaving no scope for the additional requirement of identity of <span style="font-style:italic">cause</span>.  Moreover he misconstrues the references in <span style="font-style:italic">Easygroup</span> to an “essential” ingredient of the claim as meaning that overlap of a single issue is sufficient.  Further it does not follow that because the purpose of Article 27 is to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments, any circumstances which give rise to the risk engage it.  A similar fallacy in reasoning was exposed by Lord Hodge in <span style="font-style:italic">AMT Futures v Marzillier</span> at paragraph 29 when he said: “To invoke a special ground of jurisdiction a claimant must bring himself within that ground: <span style="font-style:italic">Folien Fischer AG v Ritrama SpA </span>(CaseC133/11) [2013] QB 523 paragraphs 39-40.  A claimant cannot establish jurisdiction under the Judgments Regulation by merely invoking the justification or rationale of the ground.”  Moreover, Article 28 caters for the situation where there is some overlap which is insufficient to meet the requirements of article 27. Article 27 is only intended to bite in relatively straightforward situations and there is no need to strain to fit a case within it (per Rix J in <span style="font-style:italic">Glencore</span>).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On the other hand Mr Wolanski’s submissions seek to restrict the scope of article 27 too narrowly.

To insist on identity between the necessary ingredients undermines the need to give article 27 an autonomous interpretation.  Similarly there need not be complete overlap in the forms of relief available or claimed.

Mr Wolanski relied on what was said by Dillon LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Berkeley Administration Inc v McClelland</span> [1995] I.L.Pr. 201 at paragraphs 26 to 28, but those passages do not support the proposition advanced.

They are claims to determine whether there is liability for publishing the tweet in question involving identical issues of meaning, truth and damage to reputation.  The additional ingredient of negligence in Norway, which does not exist in England, is no more than the difference between national classification of defamation rights for which due allowance must be made.

But that is not unfair and does not amount to forum shopping in the pejorative sense.  It is a “right” conferred on him by way of choice of jurisdiction under the Convention, as the Norwegian Courts in their jurisdictional judgments in this case have held, just as the Convention confers on Dr Wright a “right” to bring a global claim in England where the law is more advantageous to him and less favourable to Mr Granath.  Neither of these “rights” is absolute.

If an injunction is unavailable by way of counterclaim in Norway, such is the result of the differences in remedies under national laws which must be ignored.  Were it otherwise, article 27 would not prevent Dr Wright from bringing a global claim in both England and Norway.   In fact, in practical terms an injunction is likely to be available from the English Court should Dr Wright be successful in Norway and need one.  A subsequent request for confirmation that Mr Granath will not repeat the libel will be met either by such confirmation, in which case an injunction is unnecessary, or by a refusal, in which case a <span style="font-style:italic">quia timet</span> injunction would no doubt be available with the benefit of issue estoppels arising from the Norwegian Court findings.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Wolanski submitted that this case raises the issue which divided Bean and Baker LLJ on the one hand, and Lewison LJ on the other, in their obiter remarks in <span style="font-style:italic">EuroEco v SSSA</span> [2019] 4 WLR 156 as to whether article 27 could apply to preclude multiple mosaic claims brought simultaneously by a defamation claimant in different jurisdictions at the same time.  It is inherent in the very nature of the mosaic claim option which <span style="font-style:italic">Shevill</span> determined was available to defamation claimants under article 5(3) that the choice so conferred is a multiple forum choice.  That multiple forum choice therefore arguably involves a tension with articles 27 and 28 which restrict such choice.   However that is not an issue which arises in this case because both the English and Norwegian Claims are global claims. There is no such tension in relation to global claims.  Article 5(3) confers options for global claims in defamation which are single forum choices for the resolution of the entire dispute between the parties.  In that respect defamation claims are no different from any other claims in tort or delict for which article 5(3) provides a range of jurisdictional options (place of domicile; place where harmful event occurs; and place where damage is directly suffered).  There is no authority which suggests that article 27 is inapplicable to such claims, and no sound reason for restricting its applicability.  On the contrary, the avoidance of parallel proceedings and risk of irreconcilable judgments which article 27 is designed to avoid dictates that it should apply.  The logic of Mr Wolanski’s argument is that if the laws of Norway and England were the same, it would be open to Dr Wright to bring identical global claims against Mr Granath in both jurisdictions and have two bites of the cherry without being subject to the <span style="font-style:italic">lis pendens</span> restraints of articles 27 and 28.

There can be no doubt that a judgment given in a Contracting State requiring performance of the contract would not be recognised in the State in which recognition was sought if a court in that State had given a judgment rescinding or discharging the contract. Such a result, restricting the effects of each judgment to the territory of the State concerned, would run counter to the objectives of the Convention, which is intended to strengthen legal protection throughout the territory of the Community and to facilitate recognition in each Contracting State of judgments given in any other Contracting State.” </p>

The application of article 21 cannot be made conditional on the individual features of national procedural laws and differing forms of action: reference to the domestic laws of contracting states, when rendered necessary by the incompleteness of the rules contained in the Brussels Convention, must be conducive to the applicability of the provisions of the Convention and may not in any circumstances lead to results which conflict with its aims and rationale: see in that connection the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Gubisch Maschinenfabrik</span> [1987] E.C.R. 4861, 4873-4874, paras. 68, and the earlier judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Industrie Tessili Italiana Como v.

This was for the purposes of article 22(3) (article 28(3) in the Lugano Convention), namely for the purposes of deciding when actions would be “deemed to be related” and not for the purposes of article 21 (article 27).  In this context, the court explained, at [57], that the term “irreconcilable” as used in article 22(3) “has a different meaning from the same term used by article 27(3) of the Convention” (article 34(3) of the Lugano Convention; the non-recognition provision).  However, I depart from Popplewell LJ in that, I do not consider that what was said there provides any assistance on the question of when proceedings have the same cause of action.  The court was specifically addressing only article 22(3) and expressly said, at [50], that the question as to the scope of article 22(3) “arises only if the conditions for the application of article 21 of the Convention are not satisfied”.  The question of when proceedings have the same cause of action is a different question to that of whether actions are deemed to be related so as to bring them within article 22 (or article 28).  As a result, “irreconcilability in the wider sense”, to adopt Popplewell LJ’s expression from paragraph 90, as applied in <span style="font-style:italic">The Tatry</span> is relevant only to the scope of article 28 of the Lugano Convention (article 22 of the Brussels Convention) and not, respectively, article 27 (article 21). </p>

A number of remedies were available in respect of this claim including restitution.  The civil proceedings in Greece involved a claim by each of the plaintiffs for “moral damages” of Dr 15,000 (about £33) against Mr Frangos, a claim which was described in the judgment, at p.1091, as “a type of compensation under Greek law in relation to certain torts”.  In the proceedings in England the plaintiffs alleged that there was “an agreement or understanding” under which funds transferred to Mr Frangos would be held and managed on behalf of the plaintiffs, at p.1078, and claimed that they were entitled to trace the assets acquired with those funds. </p>

One possible explanation is that the court was persuaded by the expert evidence to the effect that the claim for restitution and the tort claim had the same legal basis which was, in turn, the same legal basis as the proceedings in England.  This was the argument advanced by the defendant, as referred to above, and would be supported by the simple statement that “the same facts and rule of law form the basis of each proceedings”.

The analysis simply involves a comparison between the claims in order to see whether they have the same cause and the same object. In so far as Andrew Smith J treated the question as a broader one in <span style="font-style:italic">Evialis SA v SIAT</span> [2003] 2 CLC 802 I respectfully disagree with him, although, as Beatson J observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Sinco</span> at para 50, <span style="font-style:italic">Evialis</span> was distinguishable on the facts because the insured had brought a substantive claim in the English proceedings in addition to their claim in the Italian proceedings, which rendered the former a mirror image of the latter.

The authorities make clear that it is the claims as formulated by the claimants in the two sets of proceedings that determine whether they have the same “cause” and “objet”. The defendants’ claim in the Cypriot proceedings, as set out in their writ, is drafted in very wide terms. It is not limited to the issue of consent but is wide enough to encompass a challenge to all or any of the facts and matters on which the claimant relies in the English proceedings. The apparent narrowing of the scope of the Cypriot proceedings results from an undertaking given to the English court not to challenge the validity of the claimant's trade marks and indications given by counsel that the only issue would be consent. </p>

In all other respects, the narrowing of the issues depends entirely on counsel's indications. It seems unlikely that those “indications” would have any binding force in Cyprus, and we certainly have no evidence that they would bind the defendants. Before the Cypriot proceedings were struck out, there had been no amendment to the writ nor had particulars of claim narrowing the case to the issue of consent been served. If we are to judge the “cause” by reference to the claim in the Cypriot proceedings, as we are required to do, that claim was and remained in a form that potentially put in issue all the elements of the claimant's claim in the English proceedings.” </p>

In other words, as I read the judgment, as he explained further, at [50]-[51], both sets of proceedings engaged the same legal rules.

It is also why, with all due respect, I disagree with Popplewell LJ’s analysis, at [84] that “the search is for the common issue or issues which capture the essential nature of the cause of action in the sense of its main or central focus” and, at [90(iv)], where he refers to the “issue or issues which make up the essential element of the claim”.  In my view, his proposed approach resonates with the approach set out in the passages I have just quoted, which address the question of whether the proceedings have the same object or subject matter and not that of whether they have the same cause, and would have the effect of removing any real substance from the specific requirement that the proceedings have the same cause as well as the same object.   </p>

The European Court of Justice held that art. 21 applied. The cause was the same because both proceedings involved ‘the same contractual relationship’ (para. 15); and the objet was the same because, although one action was aimed at giving effect to the contract and the other action at depriving it of any effect, nevertheless (para. 16): </p>

The first action was brought by the shipowners in Holland, naming all of the cargo owners except Phibro, and claiming a declaration of nonliability for the alleged contamination. The second and third actions were brought in England by Phibro and some but not all of the other cargo owners, against the shipowners, claiming in respect of damaged cargo. The fourth action was brought by the shipowners, again in Rotterdam, and again for a declaration of non-liability, but this time against Phibro. I have already mentioned that the European Court of Justice held that art. 21 operated to the extent that the same parties were involved, even if other parties were also involved. That was the ‘first question’. The ‘fifth question’ raised the issue whether the cause and objet were the same in the Dutch and the English proceedings. The European Court of Justice held that they were. The declaration for non-liability and the claim for damages in respect of the same cargo both involved the same cause.

That this might be the question “at the heart of the two actions”, to quote <span style="font-style:italic">Gubisch</span>, at [16], establishes, at most, that they have the same object, not that they have the same cause.  It also follows, that I do not accept Mr Tomlinson’s submission that proceedings have the same cause of action if they “raise a common “<span style="font-style:italic">question</span>” or “<span style="font-style:italic">element</span>” which is “<span style="font-style:italic">essential</span>” or which “<span style="font-style:italic">lies at the heart</span>” of both proceedings”.   As I have sought to demonstrate above, I do not consider that this approach is supported, as he submitted, by the “authorities from <span style="font-style:italic">Gubisch</span> through to <span style="font-style:italic">Easygroup</span>”.  In particular in my view, these submissions conflict with Lord Clarke’s observations in <span style="font-style:italic">The Alexandros T</span> including, at [28(vi)], that “article 27 is not engaged merely by virtue of the fact that common issues might arise in both sets of proceedings” and, at [30], that the “essential question is whether the claims in England and Greece are mirror images of one another, and thus legally irreconcilable”.  Simply stated, the claims in the present case are not “mirror images of one another, and <span style="font-style:italic">thus</span> legally irreconcilable” (my emphasis). </p>

Whilst this might be a policy consideration behind the formulation of articles 27 and 28, the potential for irreconcilable judgments does not answer the question of whether the proceedings involve the same cause of action.  Although I agree with Popplewell LJ when he says, at paragraph 81, that irreconcilability may be a helpful tool in evaluating whether the article 27 test is met, the <span style="font-style:italic">potential </span>for conflicting decisions will not determine whether the causes of action are the same. </p>

This part of his decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal and not further appealed to the House of Lords which dealt only with the question of whether the actions were related. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I also agree with Mr Wolanski’s submission that the judge was wrong when he decided, at [77]-[78], that the correct approach is to determine “whether there is a significant or substantial degree of commonality or overlap between the two sets of claims” and when he said that all “that is necessary … is that there is a substantial and important area of common dispute”.  The judge adopted this approach because, again, he considered that an “important relevant factor albeit not decisive is the clear potential for conflicting decisions”.  With respect to the judge it is the answer to the question of whether the causes of action are the same which will determine whether conflicting judgments will be irreconcilable.  Further, in my view as set out above, his approach is that applied to the question of whether the proceedings have the same object and not to whether they have the same cause. </p>

In my view, the answer is that they do not.  The Norwegian claim, based on the Damages Compensation Act 1969 section 3-6a, clearly includes one legal element which does not feature in the English proceedings, namely whether the allegations were or were not made negligently.  This does not form part of or feature in the English proceedings.  I also have a question as to the issue raised in the Norwegian proceedings of whether the allegations were “unlawful”.  It would seem to me arguable that this is also a distinguishing feature but, as this was not argued by Mr Wolanski, I do not deal with it further. </p>

For example, it is clear that a legal dispute arising from, say, one accident might give rise to two different causes of action in different states.  One cause of action might be based on strict liability and the other on negligence.  There is clearly a risk of differing judgments but the causes of action are not mirror images nor would they necessarily lead to irreconcilable judgments if, for example, negligence was not proved.  Accordingly, if the prospective defendant brought proceedings for a declaration that they were not liable because they were not negligent, this would be the mirror image of a claim based on negligence but not one based on strict liability.  Similarly, in the present case, the legal principles involved in the Norwegian proceedings do not mirror the legal principles involved in the English proceedings.  Put another way, the juridical basis of the proceedings is not the same. </p>
