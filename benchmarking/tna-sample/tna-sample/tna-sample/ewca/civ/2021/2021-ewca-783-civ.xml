This affected major airports and retailers who sold tax (or VAT) free items from airport lounges, and certain high street retailers who sold popular luxury branded items often to wealthy visitors from China, South East Asia and the Gulf. The decision was taken as part of a review of fiscal and customs arrangements affected by the expiry of the transitional period governing relations between the UK and EU following the exit of the UK from the EU which occurred at 11pm 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st </span>December 2020 (“<span style="font-style:italic">the Transitional Period</span>”).  The abolition took the form of the withdrawal of two schemes.  The first was the VAT RES and was statutory in form.  The second scheme was ESC 9.1 and was operated under an extra-statutory concession given by the Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Customs and Excise (“<span style="font-style:italic">the Commissioners</span>”). Details are set out below.  </p>

The principle of non-discrimination which is found in Article I:1 GATT was relied upon by the Government to curtail the options that it considered were open to it. The Claimants challenge its analysis of the GATT and argue that because of this error of law the Government artificially and wrongly constrained the paths open to it and ignored alternatives which were favourable, or at least less damaging, to the Claimants (Ground II).  </p>

It is said that at all times the Government should have factored into consideration the existence of such a free trade agreement and had it done so its analysis would have altered. When the TCA was in fact agreed this also amounted to a material change of circumstances.  Even if the Government were correct that prior to expiry of the Transitional Period it would be a breach of the GATT to retain the schemes following expiry of the Transitional Period, the effect of entering into the TCA was to reverse that analysis.  The existence of the TCA meant that it would no longer be unlawful to retain the schemes.  The omission of the Government to take this into account represented a serious failure to take account of a relevant consideration (Ground III). </p>

The Claimants challenge the approach taken by the Government to the collection and evaluation of evidence relating to the economic harm to business and the wider economy that it is said would arise from abolition.   It is argued that when the abolition decision was taken the Government had failed to collect the relevant evidence and had failed therefore to address relevant considerations (Ground IV).  </p>

Abolishing it brings the treatment of tourists from outside the EU into line with those from the EU from the end of the transition period (as opposed to extending the scheme to EU tourists). Alignment is a requirement of WTO rules. Most VAT RES beneficiaries do their shopping in luxury stores, particularly those in London and the South East, with 90 per cent of refunds from London and Oxford (Bicester Village). Ending the scheme results in a direct Exchequer saving – around £0.5 billion was refunded through the scheme in 2019 – but there will also be costs as the UK becomes less attractive for affected tourists relative to alternative EU destinations such as Paris or Milan. Estimates of the sensitivity of tourism to price changes generally refer to tourism in general rather than those focused on luxury shopping. The costing takes one UK-specific estimate relating to tourism in general and scales it up by 50 per cent (to an elasticity of 1.9) in recognition of the likely greater responsiveness of those affected by the measure. This reduces the yield slightly, but the estimate is highly uncertain. Several studies have considered the negative consequences of this measure for affected industries. Our forecasts consider such indirect effects at an aggregate level, looking at overall changes in tax and spending (worth tens of billions of pounds at this forecast) rather than measure-by-measure.  </p>

No customs duty, additional excise duty (providing the goods are for personal use and are transported by the individual) or additional VAT was due at their destination, VAT and excise duty having been paid in the EU country of purchase.

While the VAT RES adheres to international tax principles, it is unclear what the impact on the high street is (particularly outside of London and other tourist destinations), whether the scheme offers value for money for the Exchequer, and whether passengers are being treated fairly (for example, some customers only receive a small proportion of their VAT refund).”</p>

As the rules for airside tax-free shopping are set out in a concession the government is aware that these rules are applied inconsistently. For example, in 2015 media coverage alleged that in some cases the tax-free element was not being passed on to consumers. And in some cases the relief is applied to tax-free sales of goods that will very likely be consumed in the airport rather than being exported. This is not consistent with international tax norms (WTO rules and OECD Guidelines), in which VAT and excise on goods should be paid in the country of consumption. Extending airside tax-free shopping to EU bound passengers travelling by air, sea, and rail would require legislation to formalise the system, and further requirements setting out how tax-free shops should operate could be included in this legislation. Alternatively, the government could remove the airside extra statutory concession and use the VAT RES - if it decides to retain the scheme - to achieve tax-free sales for passengers.” </p>

In Heathrow’s case, this would mean that commercial income would significantly reduce and under CAA regulation Heathrow would not be able to support current passenger charges to airlines.  This could lead to an increase in air fares by the main airlines who operate from Heathrow and therefore impact on UK consumers negatively.  As mentioned above, airports and airlines are likely to experience a relatively slow recovery, and so non-aeronautical income will become even more important for UK aviation in the years ahead. </p>

Smaller airports were largely powerless to negotiate on aeronautical charges and were increasingly dependent upon retail revenues with duty and tax-free sales generating the “<span style="font-style:italic">biggest component</span>” of such revenues.

It was also a costly system to maintain with unclear economic benefits and was burdensome for exit points. The benefits of the scheme for the high-street ignored the fact that the scheme did not benefit the whole of GB equally, with purchases largely centred in London. </p>

Retailers would be able to continue to be able to offer VAT-free shopping, consistent with international principles of taxation, to non-EU visitors who purchased items in store but who then had them sent direct (by the supplier) to their overseas addresses. Following the end of the Transitional Period, this more limited facility would also be available to EU visitors.  </p>

Thirty-three respondents opposed abolition and supported extension, especially at a time when airside retailers were dealing with the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Currently, tax-free sales to passengers travelling to non-EU countries are permitted under an HMRC extra statutory concession (ESC). The legal scope for such an ESC is very limited and the ESC for tax-free sales, as it stands, could not apply after the end of the transition period, nor could it be amended. This was made clear in the consultation document. HMRC will therefore remove the ESC for tax-free sales across the UK with effect from 1 January 2021.  </p>

The rules also allow for tax-free sales to UK residents who can use the scheme for goods that will likely be brought back to the UK. For example, a UK-resident passenger could purchase a camera VAT-free on departure, and then bring the camera back into the country on return for long-term use, without tax having been accounted for. This is not consistent with international tax norms, in which VAT and excise on goods should be paid in the country of consumption.  </p>

The only behavioural factor taken into account in estimating the tax base was a possible reduction in spending from travellers from the rest of the world. As to this the Note stated: “<span style="font-style:italic">The tax base is uncertain.  There is also uncertainty around any behaviour responses once the policy is implemented, especially around how much shops will react and adjust prices and, consequently, how much travellers reduce spending</span>”.

Paragraphs [22] – [39] of the Note explained the difficulties inherent in seeking to model the estimated costings.

The only behavioural factor taken into account in estimating the tax base was the likely reduction in number of tourists lost to other destinations because they would be less incentivised to visit the UK.  In relation to the (reduced) numbers of visitors that would still visit the UK there would be a further reduction in spending as relevant (mainly luxury) goods became comparatively more expensive without the possibility of obtaining a refund; an increase in price implied a reduction in demand. Later (<span style="font-style:italic">ibid</span> paragraph [19]) the KAI unit recognised that the reduction in visitors might also be exacerbated by the fact that other EU states still offered VAT RES schemes to customers from the rest of the world.  In relation to incremental indirect effects the KAI unit stated: “<span style="font-style:italic">We have estimated a small impact on the APD forecast.

It set out the amount of tax that the Exchequer stood to gain by virtue of abolition.  In calculating this figure, it took account of the deterrent effect of a rise in tax free prices and the diversion of tourism from the UK to competing destinations such as Paris and Milan. To quantify this loss, it took a price elasticity figure of 1.28 which had been calculated as reflecting the typical rate of diversion in the tourism sector. It then added 50% in order to take account of an assumed higher price elasticity in relation to luxury goods. The effect of this would be to assume a higher than par diversion of tourists away from the UK as a result of a price increase in luxury goods. It therefore applied an increased price elasticity figure of 1.9. The OBR concluded that this would reduce tax yield.  But it also observed that the estimate was “<span style="font-style:italic">highly uncertain</span>”. </p>

They explained that OBR did consider the possibility that abolition would lead to trade being diverted from the UK.  The extent of any diversion would depend upon elasticity of demand. The OBR was uncertain about its conclusions (including net benefit or detriment to the Exchequer).  This was partly due to the Exchequer not having its own, internal, data on the costs of tax free shopping. The impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on trade flows was substantial and there were uncertainties surrounding this and the point at which trade would recover.  This lack of clarity was exacerbated by uncertainty relating to “<span style="font-style:italic">behavioural response[s]</span>” i.e. the way in which an increase in price would trigger a reduction in spending by consumers. The OBR had assumed quite a high elasticity response but acknowledged that it could not be confident in its analysis.

So in some ways we’ve linked this to the judgements we’ve made about how long it will take the air passenger duty forecast to recover. And that’s all before you get to the behavioural response. Now, the way we looked at this, there was rather more outside evidence brought to bear on this than many costings of similar size. We assumed a relatively high price elasticity response from those affected, but for the reasons you’ve set out, whether that’s going to be high enough or not is something that I don’t think we can be very confident in. I don’t think we’re going to be able to pick this apart with the benefit of hindsight either, because it’s being introduced mid-pandemic.  </p>

That number just looks at the degree to which shopping on the type of goods that are covered by the scheme at the moment will be affected. When we look at how the wider economy is affected by new policy measures, we do it in the round, with all the measures that are announced in a Budget or a Spending Review. So in this instance, with the best part of £100 billion being added to public spending, a £0.5 billion at most tax takeaway is kind of swamped by that. That’s not to say that these are not important - if you were looking at this on its own, if it was the only thing that happened in this Budget, then we would have been looking at that in a slightly different way. So, that’s not to say the analysis that people have done is not relevant, but it’s not factored into that specific line of numbers.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Claimants argue that the Government has misconstrued and misapplied <span style="font-style:italic">Wilkinson</span>.  ESC 9.1 does not, properly analysed, cover activity which should otherwise be subject to tax; it does not “<span style="font-style:italic">untax</span>” tax free sales and therefore the conclusion that following the Transitional Period ESC 9.1 could not be retained or amended was wrong. This is because airside tax free sales fell within the scope of the exemptions set out in Article 146 of the VAT Directive and in the measures of domestic law which implemented those exemptions.  In any event given the objective of Parliament as set out in the legislation, which was to set up a system the modalities of which would ensure “<span style="font-style:italic">removal</span>” of a product from the United Kingdom and thereby satisfy the destination principle, it was open to the Commissioners to use the C&amp;M powers to exclude airside sales from VAT.  This was especially so since removing ESC 9.1 was likely to lead to a net reduction in revenue to the Exchequer relative to retaining it and one consideration that was relevant to the exercise of the C&amp;M power was the need to maximise Exchequer receipts. Finally, even if ESC 9.1 fell outside of any permissible exemption the Government was <span style="font-style:italic">still</span> entitled to retain or extend the scheme <span style="font-style:italic">by legislation</span> and the Government therefore erred when it said in paragraph [3.25] CR that the inapplicability of C&amp;M powers meant that the schemes “<span style="font-style:italic">therefore</span>” had to be withdrawn.

It is not open to the Commissioners to depart from that legislative intent and by means of an ESC which forgives the obligation to pay. The citation from <span style="font-style:italic">Wilkinson</span> also explains that the power does not enable the Commissioners to grant an ESC because, for instance, they adopt a different view of <span style="font-style:italic">policy </span>to that of Parliament. This was at the heart of the issue in <span style="font-style:italic">Wilkinson </span>where it had been argued that the Commissioners should have used their C&amp;M powers to formulate a tax rule (in accordance with other binding legislative equality obligations) “<span style="font-style:italic">on grounds not of pragmatism in the collection of tax but of general equity between men and women</span>”.

Ms Emily Antcliffe, Director of Indirect Tax within HMRC, explained in her evidence the position taken by the Commissioners in relation to ESCs generally and ESC 9.1 in particular.  She has responsibility for VAT and environmental taxes. She explained that the present general powers of collection and management (“<span style="font-style:italic">C&amp;M</span>”) were set out in section 5 of the Commissioners for Revenue &amp; Customs Act 2005.  These powers provided the Commissioners “… <span style="font-style:italic">with a wide managerial discretion as to how they carry out their functions</span>…”.  She described an ESC as follows: </p>

As ESC is a published statement that HMRC will, in certain defined circumstances, depart from the strict position under statute and treat taxpayers as if they were entitled to some concession, such as a reduction in liability to the particular tax or duty.  ESCs must be justified as an exercise of the Commissioners’ managerial discretion.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">ESC 9.1 was not compliant with section 30 VATA or with the VAT Directive which guided its interpretation.  It applied regardless of whether the goods were actually exported or were consumed immediately or were taken out of the UK and then returned (e.g. in the case of sunglasses or a camera). There was no obligation on the supplier (the vendor) to perform the physical process of export or shipment or to employ an agent to perform these physical tasks or otherwise to “<span style="font-style:italic">ensure</span>” that the goods were exported.  ESC 9.1 was a mechanism which the Government considered encouraged misuse and, this being so, it ran counter to the objective behind Article 146 read in the light of Article 131 of the VAT Directive which is concerned to eliminate “<span style="font-style:italic">evasion, avoidance and abuse</span>”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">These arguments, which are designed to extend the provision, cannot be justified. Once the goods in issue have been sold to the customer, title in them has passed, and the act of export or shipment of those items from the territory by the customer is not as an agent for the supplier/vendor.  It is an act carried out by the customer on her/his own behalf.  That person is not legally, or in any other relevant way, comparable or equivalent to a supplier/vendor or a courier or shipper acting on behalf of the supplier/vendor.  As the Government pointed out if it were otherwise: “… <span style="font-style:italic">the ESC would not be needed at all and its abolition would be of no concern to the Claimants</span>.”  Moreover, the cursory checking of a boarding card at the point of sale does not in any way serve to “<span style="font-style:italic">ensure</span>” export for all of the factual reasons referred to in the CP and CR.  It does not, for instance, prevent the customer of perfume opening it immediately after purchase and applying it liberally there and then, and, after the holiday, bringing the residue back into the UK. In any event the expressions “<span style="font-style:italic">ensure</span>” and “<span style="font-style:italic">establishes</span>” used in the VAT Directive, and in the case law, must be understood in the context of Article 131 (see paragraph [74] above) which the CJEU has said is relevant to interpretation.  This strongly militates against a conclusion that the law extends to exempt a scheme which facilities “<span style="font-style:italic">abuse</span>”. </p>

The concept of strict interpretation of exemptions means only that an exemption should be limited to its proper purpose. But it also militates against any broad or expansive extension of the exemption, for instance to catch customers according to some principle of practical equivalence.  The purpose of the exemption is not to place customers in a position whereby they can decide whether or not to pay tax. </p>

With respect section 7 does not assist and it does not do away with the requirement in section 30(6) that exemption arises when it is the supplier who performs the export. It does not expand that to exempt the situation where the supplier sells to a customer who might (or might not) then remove the item from the UK and if it is removed later bring it back in and doing so on his or her own behalf and might or might not then pay tax. </p>

First, because the basic policy behind the legislation is the destination principle and ESC 9.1 achieves this by setting up a system governing the modalities of <span style="font-style:italic">removal</span> of the item in question from the UK to a place where tax is then payable and paid.   Secondly, and in any event, retention could give rise to a better net return for the Exchequer than abolition, and it is part of the Commissioners’ C&amp;M powers to take measures to achieve the highest net return.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">First, in this case since the analysis of the relevant statutory provisions is that ESC 9.1 does untax that which should be taxed there is no residual scope for the Commissioners to exercise their C&amp;M powers and “<span style="font-style:italic">untax</span>” the taxable by an ESC.  The House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Wilkinson</span> made clear that the Commissioners had a broad discretion as to the use of their powers of management but that this did not extend to untaxing the taxable by an ESC: see the citation at paragraph [67] above which sets this out as an outer limit of the exercise of the C&amp;M power.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, the Claimants’ argument about the modalities of removal is inconsistent with the statutory language which accords an exemption where agents of the actual supplier/vendor perform the export or shipment. It would be unacceptable to extend the “<span style="font-style:italic">modalities</span>” so as to treat as acceptable the acts of a customer who owns the goods and who is not acting as an agent for the supplier/vendor.

Even if the Commissioners were of the view that retaining or extending the concession would increase the net revenue to the Exchequer (which they were not), that would still not entitle them to adopt an ESC if it were contrary to the express will of Parliament.   Parliament has decided that the tax should be paid on all transactions and this conclusion cannot be gainsaid by a judgment of the Commissioners that Parliament got it wrong, and the exemption should be broadened.

Instead, in their very detailed written submissions, they argue that the Government misconstrued the GATT.  Properly applied it did not preclude retention of the VAT RES either permanently or during an extended period to allow for adjustment after the Transitional Period. Internal taxes, such as VAT, do not fall within Article I:1 and III:2 GATT and no other provisions would apply to prevent retention or even extension.  This is set out in case law under the GATT and in policy documents issued by the WTO.  In any event the schemes did not give rise to any discriminatory or differential benefit which was the vice which those articles were targeted at. Moreover, the fact that the Government retained the VAT RES for Northern Ireland showed that it did not consider that it was bound in law under the GATT to remove <span style="font-style:italic">all</span> discrimination. It follows that the Government misdirected itself as to the law and artificially limited the options open to it.  Had it applied the law correctly then it could well have adopted one of the solutions argued for by the Claimants.  This misdirection was highly material to the analysis of the Government; it served to set tight and restrictive tramlines for any decision that could be taken.

She argued, in summary, that insofar as the alleged error of law was said to arise from an unincorporated treaty (the GATT) the complaint was not one that the court could adjudicate upon because rights and obligations in unincorporated treaties were non-justiciable. But even if the court did have jurisdiction the principle of nondiscrimination in Articles I:1 and III:2 GATT applied to the VAT RES (and ESC 9.1) and required the discrimination to be removed upon expiry of the Transitional Period. The position in relation to Northern Ireland was irrelevant to the analysis. The test in law was only whether the Government’s position was “<span style="font-style:italic">tenable</span>”, which it plainly was, but even if the test was higher (i.e. the normal standard applied to issues of law) the Government’s analysis of the GATT was correct. It did not err.  The final point was a procedural one.  The Government objected to the reliance by the Claimants upon expert evidence (in the form of the report prepared by Mr Harbinson (see paragraph [100] above)) as to the scope and effect of the GATT, which it says is a matter for submissions of law to the court and not evidence. This was not an academic point, but rather one of principle as to the correct way in which parties and courts should approach questions of international law.  As a precaution the Government served a report of Mr Tereposky which addressed the analysis of Mr Harbinson. </p>

The concept of a “<span style="font-style:italic">like</span>” product includes identical products (e.g. perfume of the same brand) and products which compete (e.g. </p>

Though, in the case of a national measure or scheme which applies different rules to all types of product it is assumed that the products potentially subject to discrimination will be “<span style="font-style:italic">like</span>” relative to those which are benefited under the measure or scheme in dispute:  See e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">Colombia – Indicative Prices and Restrictions on Ports of Entry</span> Panel Report (WT/DS366/R, 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2009) at paragraphs [7.182ff] and cases cited thereat. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On one reading the duty in Article I:1, in the event of a breach, is to level up i.e. to grant to others the same advantage, privilege etc as the state has granted to the favoured or benefited products.  But, in logic, this cannot mean that once a state has conferred an advantage or benefit it must maintain that in force in perpetuity and be compelled to extend that benefit to all others regardless of the state’s internal policy. Since the essence of the rule is non-discrimination, it is open to the Government to remove the differential treatment by levelling down.   Article I:1 is not about the choices that states make in their fiscal policies, for instance whether to offer an exemption or not. It is about ensuring that whatever choice is made is <span style="font-style:italic">then</span> applied in a non-discriminatory fashion so far as international trade in goods is concerned. The Government argued, in my view correctly, that the WTO did not have any policy preferences that it encouraged its members to adopt in relation to rules of domestic taxation, including border tax adjustments.  Members were free to implement measures such as border tax adjustments in accordance with their national policies as they saw fit, provided that such measures were consistent with the rights and obligations set forth in the WTO Agreements.

In short there is no discernible reason of law or policy why Article I:1 should demand levelling up but preclude levelling down. What matters is the removal of the discrimination.  This conclusion is consistent with the way in which the Panel and Appellate Body have routinely described the prohibition in Article I:1 as a prohibition on discrimination and that the remedy is the removal of the discrimination. </p>

We read this to mean that the provisions of the GATT 1994 shall not make impossible the formation of a customs union. Thus, the chapeau makes it clear that Article XXIV may, under certain conditions, justify the adoption of a measure which is inconsistent with certain other GATT provisions, and may be invoked as a possible "defence" to a finding of inconsistency. </p>

It has accepted that the GATT binds the Government. The Government proceeded throughout upon the basis that it needed to take a decision as early as feasible to give affected businesses time to adapt, should that be necessary, before the expiry of the Transitional Period. At the time, the Government did not know whether there would be a future trade agreement with the EU.  It took the stance that it could not measure the legality of its <span style="font-style:italic">present</span> position under the GATT against the hypothetical possibility that some future trade agreement with the EU might, if concluded, arguably affect that analysis. It had to arrive at a decision which would be compliant with the GATT come what may; free trade agreement or not. The documents, including disclosed documents, are replete with confirmation of this.

It became insolvent owing monies to third parties, including the claimants. They sought to hold the member states liable upon the basis that, upon the true construction of the International Tin Agreement, the Council was acting as agent for its member states. The claim was rejected as nonjusticiable because it involved a claim based upon rights contained in an unincorporated or unimplemented treaty.

It is agreed between the parties that over the past century, and more, a variety of circumstances have been identified where the Courts will interpret and take account of international law which has neither been formally incorporated into domestic law (e.g. through legislation), or otherwise relied upon by decision makers to shape and influence domestic measures and acts. One of the most well established is in relation to customary principles of international law which can (by a form of indirect invocation) give rise to enforceable rights and obligations in the domestic courts.  They will do so: (i) only indirectly as a source of guidance for domestic common law; and (ii), only if not inconsistent with other principles of domestic law: <span style="font-style:italic">R (Solange and others v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs)</span> [2020] EWCA Civ 1010 at paragraphs [141ff] citing with approval Lord Mance in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Keyu) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs</span><a href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/69.html">

The House of Lords accepted that an international treaty could be used to guide the interpretation of a statutory provision such that where there were two possible interpretations of a measure the court would prefer that which avoids conflict between domestic legislation and the UKs international treaty obligations.  As Lord Goff observed: “… <span style="font-style:italic">that “involves no importation of international law into the domestic field</span>” (page [748C/D]); see also per Lord Ackner at page [760GH].

In 1997 officers of the anti-terrorist squad arrested Mr Kebeline, Mr Boukemiche and Mr Souidi.  All were Algerian nationals. They were charged with offences under section 16A of the <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/potpa1989562/">Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989.</a>  The issue, in a nutshell, was whether the decision of the DPP to give his consent for the prosecution involved an error of law, namely an erroneous conclusion that the prosecution was compatible with Article 6(2) ECHR. The issue arose during the interim period between the enactment of HRA 1998 and the bringing into force of its main provisions and concerned the role and jurisdiction of a court in reviewing that exercise of discretion. In coming to his decision on the matter the decision maker had sought advice as to what the position would be under the ECHR.  It was hence a factor that fed into the thinking leading to the final decision. As in <span style="font-style:italic">Launder</span> (<span style="font-style:italic">ibid</span>) it was a matter that the decision maker had taken into consideration.

They submitted that the effect of the judgment was to invite the DPP to disapply primary legislation. In my view this argument is mistaken and fails to do justice to the reasoning of the Divisional Court. The Lord Chief Justice pointed out that in the present case the Director wished to know where he stood on the issue of compatibility of the legislation. The DPP sought and relied on legal advice on that issue. The Lord Chief Justice said that if the advice was wrong, the DPP should have the opportunity to reconsider the confirmation of his advice on a sound legal basis.

Kuwait Airways sued Iraqi Airways for unlawfully exploiting for its purposes the Kuwait Airways air fleet. Saddam Hussein had by act of war removed the fleet to Iraq.  Under normal principles both Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi state enjoyed state immunity. However, Iraqi Airways, who had taken possession of the fleet, had no equivalent immunity.  Their defence was that Saddam Hussein had passed an Iraqi law giving them the fleet. The difficulty was that this law was in violation of Security Council resolutions under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter and generally contrary to international law. The House of Lords held the law could not be recognised as valid, and that Iraqi Airways was liable.  It applied the unincorporated treaty to defeat the defence.   An important feature of the case was the provisions of the United Nations Charter and Security Council Resolutions. Lord Steyn (at paragraph [114]) rejected as "<span style="font-style:italic">marching logic to its ultimate unreality</span>" the submission of Iraqi Airways that, because these were unincorporated, they must be disregarded.  This was not a case where, in the classic sense, it could be said that the UN resolution had been adopted into domestic law; but it was a case involving a matter of public policy to which the Government had publicly and strongly adhered as indicating its position: see generally the analysis and discussion at paragraph [114].  Moreover, it would place the UK in breach of its international obligations were the courts to adopt an approach contrary to the state’s obligations under the United Nations Charter and under the relevant Security Council Resolutions, and this was a relevant consideration for the court. </p>

Lord Justice Mance (ibid paragraph [28]) cited the five examples given by Lord Oliver in <span style="font-style:italic">Tin Council</span> (ibid pages [500D] – [501B]) where unincorporated treaties could be relevant.  These examples (which were not intended to be exhaustive) can be summarised as follows.  First, where a statute was enacted to give effect to the UK’s obligations under a treaty it could have to be considered and, if necessary, construed to resolve any ambiguity or obscurity as to the meaning or scope of the implementing statue. Secondly, where parties had entered a domestic contract in which they had chosen to incorporate the terms of an unincorporated treaty the court could interpret the treaty for the purposes of ascertaining the rights and obligations of the parties under the contract. Thirdly, where domestic legislation, although not incorporating the treaty, nevertheless required, either expressly or by necessary implication, resort to be had to its terms for the purpose of construing the legislation then the court could do so. Fourthly, where the exercise of the royal prerogative directly affected an extension or contraction of the jurisdiction without the constitutional need for internal legislation the court could have regard to the international law measure. Fifthly, since the conclusion of an international treaty and its terms were matters of fact the treaty could be referred to where necessary as part of the factual background against which a particular issue arose. </p>

This could be where the measure was vague and uncertain, where it was intended to be enforced only via informal international political consensus, and where there was no guidance as to how the measure should be construed or applied.   In this case the DPP claimed that his decision not to prosecute, which was the decision under challenge, was consistent with Article 5 of the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, an unincorporated treaty.  This does not lay down hard and fast rules but, as set out in its recitals, is concerned to achieve “<span style="font-style:italic">equivalence</span>” at the international level of approaches to investigation and prosecution.

Although, as I have acknowledged, there are occasions when the court will decide questions as to the state's obligations under unincorporated international law, this, for obvious reasons, is generally undesirable. Particularly this is so where, as here, the contracting parties to the Convention have chosen not to provide for the resolution of disputed questions of construction by an international court but rather (by article 12) to create a Working Group through whose continuing processes it is hoped a consensus view will emerge. Really this is no more than an echo of para 44 of Lord Bingham's opinion. For a national court itself to assume the role of determining such a question (with whatever damaging consequences that may have for the state in its own attempts to influence the emerging consensus) would be a remarkable thing, not to be countenanced save for compelling reasons. </p>

In the first place, as Lord Bingham points out at para 43, there is a marked distinction between seeking to apply established Convention jurisprudence to the particular case before the court (as there) and determining, in the absence of any jurisprudence whatever on the point, a deep and difficult question of construction of profound importance to the whole working of the Convention (as here). Secondly, it seems to me tolerably plain that the decisionmakers in both <span style="font-style:italic">Launder</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Kebilene</span>, deciding respectively on extradition and prosecution, would have taken different decisions had their understanding of the law been different.

Although both the Director (and the Attorney General) clearly believed—and may very well be right in believing—that the decision was consistent with article 5, it is surely plain that the primary intention behind the decision was to save this country from the dire threat to its national and international security and that the same decision would have been taken even had the Director had doubts about the true meaning of article 5 or even had he thought it bore the contrary meaning. All that he and the Attorney General were really saying was that they believed the decision to be consistent with article 5. This clearly they were entitled to say: it was true and at the very least obviously a reasonable and tenable belief. Both the Director’s and Attorney General’s understanding of article 5 was clearly apparent from their public statements: it was implicit in these that they understood article 5 not to preclude regard being had to fundamental considerations of national and international security merely because these would be imperilled by worsening relations with a foreign state.” </p>

The claimant challenged the decision of the Office of Communications ("<span style="font-style:italic">Ofcom</span>") to write to the International Telecommunications Union ("<span style="font-style:italic">the ITU</span>") requesting the cancellation of an assignment currently recorded in its Master International Frequency Register in respect of the Claimant's mobile satellite communications system.

It is responsible for the international arrangements for electronic communications systems, in particular the radio frequencies and orbits used by telecommunications satellites. The United Kingdom is one of nearly 200 member states.  That regime had not been implemented into domestic law.  A central argument in the case was that Ofcom had wrongly assumed that it was under a duty under the ITU regulatory regime to cancel the filing whereas it was common ground that there was no such duty under the ITU regime (ibid paragraph [48]).  In other words, Ofcom, when it took its decision, had made a serious error of law relating to the scope and effect of an international law regime. </p>

It will be apparent from the documents referred to above that widely different views are held as to the consequences which should follow under the ITU regime in circumstances where, as in the present case, a number of years after its registration, an assignment has not been brought into regular operation in accordance with its notified specification. That is a live dispute as to the rights and duties of the 191 national administrations which participate in the ITU regime. Moreover, there is provision within the ITU regime for dispute resolution, although the question whether that would be applicable in the circumstances of the present case is itself apparently in dispute. A further difficulty in the present case is that the statements emanating from various officers of the ITU referred to above would, given their quality and characteristics, hardly be an appropriate basis for the task of resolving the issue. However, that apart, it would not be appropriate for this court to embark on such an undertaking for the policy reasons given by Lord Bingham and Lord Brown in <span style="font-style:italic">Corner House</span>.

The UK was an early proponent of the use of MFN clauses in international trade treaties and, on occasion, these fell to the courts to construe. In <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial Japanese Government v P. &amp; O. Steam Navigation Company</span> [1895] A.C. 644 the issue concerned the applicability of an unincorporated treaty (the British–Japanese Treaty of Peace, Friendship, and Commerce). This conferred rights upon British subjects by virtue of an MFN. In 1892 a British merchant vessel collided with a Japanese imperial cruiser. The Japanese government commenced proceedings in the British consular court for damages.  The case proceeded to the Supreme Court for China and Japan at Shanghai, also a consular court. It was then appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. One issue was whether, under the unincorporated treaty, a British subject had the enforceable right to compel a Japanese claimant with a complaint to pursue that claim in courts set up by the British authorities under the treaty, or whether the Japanese litigant could invoke the Japanese courts. Under treaties concluded between Japan and the US and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Japan had accorded to citizens of those states rights, which included the right to be sued in their own courts, and not those of Japan. The Privy Council had to decide whether, by virtue of the MFN, the same rights were to be accorded to British citizens.  To answer this question the Privy Council applied the law of England including the common law, rules of equity, statute law and other law for the time being in force. The Privy Council held that under the MFN all the rights enjoyed by US American and Austro-Hungarian subjects were also enjoyed by British subjects.  It was:  </p>

The decided cases fully bear this out. Standing back two main themes emerge.  The first (and most important) focuses upon the nature of the linkage between the (formally unincorporated) measure of international law and domestic law.  Case law treats as a critical question whether the decision maker has taken the international law into account in its decision making. The second concerns the intrinsic justiciability of the measures in question i.e. whether it is the sort of measure that is capable of being adjudicated upon. This seems less critical to justiciability because it can be taken into account in applying the flexible tenability test which arises only in relation to a measure which <span style="text-decoration:underline">is</span> justiciable (see paragraphs [178] – [183] below) and which enables the court to adjust the test for reviewability accordingly. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Fifthly, in relation to intrinsic justiciability and where the GATT rules sit on the spectrum of soft to hard laws, it is far closer to the prescriptive, hard edged, end of the scale.  Those rules are intended to be legally certain and predictable and have binding effect in specific situations.  They are capable of being litigated and there is a copious body of guiding case law from the GATT Panels and from the Appellate Body which the parties have cited extensively from in this case. It is relevant that the EU was an early member of the GATT.  When the Treaty of Rome was agreed by the founding Member States, and signed in 1957, the free trade provisions therein (including those on customs duties, other non-tariff measures, quantitative restrictions and measures of equivalent effect, subsidies and discriminatory taxes) were modelled upon, and intended to be compliant with, the GATT 1947.  In the intervening period courts, including in the UK, have dealt with countless disputes about the scope and effect of these provisions. There are multiple textbooks and academic treaties providing detailed guidance. The courts have not experienced undue difficulty in resolving disputes founded upon those articles of the Treaty of Rome (and its successors) which were the counterparts to articles of the GATT.  Any suggestion that the GATT is by its nature not the stuff of litigation is disproven by decades of practical judicial experience. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Sixthly, the Government argued that the mere existence of a dispute resolution procedure at the international level was a reason for the courts to stand back.  Reliance was placed upon the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Corner House</span> (ibid) where Lord Brown suggested that the nature of the informal and political dispute resolution procedure at the international level was a reason for the court to refrain from intervention. I disagree.  The facts of that case were extreme and a long way from the position under the GATT.  There the conclusion that the international law was intrinsically non-justiciable was perfectly understandable both in terms of its nature and as to the political nature of the dispute resolution machinery set up to iron out differences between signatory states. The case sits in sharp contradistinction to the position under the GATT. In any event, proceedings at the domestic level serve a very different function to those at the international level, where the present claimants would have had no <span style="font-style:italic">locus</span>. This is a judicial review of a decision which directly affects the rights and obligations of individuals; it is not litigation which seeks to reconcile differences between states. As an aside it is hard to see how any proceedings at all could ever arise at the level of the GATT in relation to the facts of this case, given that it is common ground that the decision to align the EU with the rest of the world is lawful under the GATT. </p>

It is, however, relevant that the Government itself seeks to rely upon the GATT as a shield.  It argues that the court should rule upon the GATT under section 31(6) Supreme Court Act 1981, in the context of the principle of good administration.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">The case law of GATT Panels and the Appeal Board makes clear that the courts of a state form a constitutional part of that member state. The act of a court which is inconsistent with the GATT can place the state in violation of its international law duties.    The domestic courts have also made clear that it might be relevant in deciding whether to grant relief that a court order could place the UK in breach of international law obligations that the state has evinced an intention to adhere to: see paragraphs [126], [127] and [153] above.  In the light of this to adjudicate upon the Government’s argument the Court must rule upon the premise that an order compelling restoration of the tax exemptions <span style="font-style:italic">would</span> breach the GATT.  This means that the Court must rule upon the scope and effect of the GATT.  The Government position is therefore that the GATT is justiciable <span style="font-style:italic">if </span>it enables the Government to win; but not otherwise.   It seems to me that at the level of principle in a case such as this where the international law is thoroughly grounded into domestic law a court would at least have to pay some regard when fashioning relief to the international law obligations of the state; that is simply one facet or consequence of the measure now having become justiciable. The fact that the Government in this case seeks to invoke the GATT is an additional indication of its justiciability. </p>

Resort to a test of tenability is not however the universal approach of that Court which does in some cases treat other instruments of international law as more or less determinative. As in domestic law the approach of the Court is influenced by the nature of the international law in issue. An example is the judgment of the Grand Chamber of the Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Sindicatul “Pastorul Cel Bun” v Romania</span> Application No. 330/09 (“<span style="font-style:italic">the Good Shepherd case</span>”) where the Court had to decide whether a group of orthodox priests in Romania were workers in an employment relationship for the purpose of Article 11 ECHR.

These included the Convention of the International Labour Organisation on Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise.  This set out criteria to be applied when determining worker and employment status.  Applying those criteria to the facts the Court held (<span style="font-style:italic">ibid </span>paragraph [148]) that the priests fulfilled the characteristics of an employment relationship for the purpose of Article 11.

A court must take account of these differences and adjust its approach accordingly.  In the domestic cases where tenability has been in issue the international law rule or measure in dispute has been towards the softer end of the spectrum.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Corner House </span>the articles of the unincorporated treaty were vague and broad brush.  They were expressions of high principle not detailed rules. They had a distinctly political ring about them.  It is hard to see how any court asked to rule upon whether the decision maker had acted in compliance with such principles could have construed and applied them with save a broad reasonableness brush. The Court (Lloyd Jones J, as he then was) applied the tenability test in <span style="font-style:italic">ICO</span>: see paragraphs [160] – [161] above.  The Judge focused upon the measures in issue and because of their nature was unable to express a concluded view; he limited himself to applying a test of reasonable tenability.

Ms Patel supported her argument by saying that there was no case law exactly on point, this being a factor which was considered relevant in <span style="font-style:italic">Corner House </span>and which goes to the intrinsic ability of a court to adjudicate upon the rule or measure.  This is true only to the very limited extent that there is no directly comparable case on VAT exemption schemes.  But there is multiple case law on the application of the GATT to indirect taxation and on every argument that was raised before the court and the court bundles were awash with copies of authorities and literature on such issues, including: what is meant by a “<span style="font-style:italic">charge</span>” or “<span style="font-style:italic">rules</span>” in Article I:1; what is meant by “<span style="font-style:italic">matters</span>” in Article III:2 and whether it applies to internal taxes; what is meant by a “<span style="font-style:italic">like</span>” product; what is meant by “<span style="font-style:italic">discrimination” </span>or<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>“<span style="font-style:italic">advantage, favour, privilege or immunity</span>”, etc.  In truth this case turns upon the application of some fairly basic principles to essentially agreed facts.

The Panel notes the European Union's argument that Brazil fails to explain why a measure not falling under Article III would also escape the application of Article I. Despite Brazil's limited explanation of its argument, the Panel understands Brazil to be arguing that if a measure does not concern a "matter referred to in Article III:2 or III:4" then it is outside the scope of Article I:1. Such an understanding would accord with the plain text of Article I:1. The Panel therefore proceeds in its analysis by examining whether the tax reductions at issue under Article I:1 constitute "matters referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 of Article III". In other words, whether the measures at issue constitute either internal taxes or other internal charges of any kind applied directly or indirectly to products; or laws, regulations, or requirements affecting the internal sale, offering for sale, purchase, transportation, distribution or use of imported products.  </p>

For more than fifty years, the obligation to provide most-favoured-nation treatment in Article I of the GATT 1994 has been both central and essential to assuring the success of a global rules-based system for trade in goods. Unlike the national treatment principle, there is no provision in the Paris Convention (1967) that establishes a mostfavoured-nation obligation with respect to rights in trademarks or other industrial property. However, the framers of the TRIPS Agreement decided to extend the most favoured-nation obligation to the protection of intellectual property rights covered by that Agreement. As a cornerstone of the world trading system, the most-favoured-nation obligation must be accorded the same significance with respect to intellectual property rights under the TRIPS Agreement that it has long been accorded with respect to trade in goods under the GATT.

The European Communities argues, in particular, that the non discrimination obligations of Articles I:1, X:3(a) and XIII of the GATT 1994 and Article 1.3 of the Licensing Agreement, apply only within each of these separate regimes.

The essence of the non-discrimination obligations is that like products should be treated equally, irrespective of their origin. As no participant disputes that all bananas are like products, the non-discrimination provisions apply to all imports of bananas, irrespective of whether and how a Member categorizes or subdivides these imports for administrative or other reasons. If, by choosing a different legal basis for imposing import restrictions, or by applying different tariff rates, a Member could avoid the application of the nondiscrimination provisions to the imports of like products from different Members, the object and purpose of the nondiscrimination provisions would be defeated. It would be very easy for a Member to circumvent the non-discrimination provisions of the GATT 1994 and the other Annex 1A agreements, if these provisions apply only within regulatory regimes established by that Member.  </p>

The fact that most cases concern imports is not, moreover, surprising since a state seeking to adopt a protectionist stance invariably does this by targeting imports to protect internal production.  But from time to time states do introduce rules affecting exports and Article I:1 captures discrimination in such cases.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="18">
		<p class="footnotedescription"> The same could be said of the equivalent provisions under the relevant EU treaties. These prohibit restrictions on imports and exports.

The article is aimed primarily at the granting of subventions to exporters to boost their sales. It is capable of applying to differentiated tax rates as the Interpretative Ad Note makes clear (see paragraph [120] above). It might apply, for instance, where tax remitted exceeded the tax payable so that, in its net effect, the tax scheme served as a subvention.  It might have applied if under the VAT RES the tax refund was set at 105% of the VAT initially paid such that affected retailers received an export booster equivalent to 5% of the tax.   The relevant point however is that even if Article XIV is capable, in some circumstances, of applying to measures of taxation there is nothing indicating that it is the sole measure capable of addressing taxation.

The Claimants argue that no advantage, favour, privilege or immunity was conferred by the schemes so that maintaining them would not have engaged Article I:1.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The starting point is that both the VAT RES and ESC 9.1 differentiated in the tax treatment of <span style="text-decoration:underline">all</span> products dependent upon their destination.  The discrimination was <span style="font-style:italic">de jure</span>; it was baked into the schemes themselves. As such the schemes differentiated as between the same and competing products (i.e. “<span style="font-style:italic">like”</span> products) being exported.  That differentiation affected all those in the supply chain who sold these like products; it was institutionalised and systemic.  It is established law that in relation to schemes that apply to all types of products, when deciding whether there is discrimination the test is objective and determined by reference to the structure of the scheme in issue. Where like products are treated differently under the schemes then the discrimination is in effect deemed to exist; see paragraph [113] above, and also <span style="font-style:italic">Bananas</span> (ibid) at paragraph [190] (set out at paragraph [194] above) which reinforces this conclusion.  </p>

This difference in treatment would have been manifest under both schemes in (i) the rate of tax and (ii) the system applied.  As to the <span style="font-style:italic">rate</span> sales inside the schemes were zero rated whereas sales outside the schemes for like (identical or competing) products, were not.  As to the <span style="font-style:italic">system</span> there would have been two quite different systems whereby for one category (rest of world) if the customer produced requisite proof then tax was fully refunded or not charged whereas in relation to EU states the normal tax regime applied.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Although economic effect is not required, in this case those suppliers and retailers who benefited from the VAT RES and ESC 9.1 have argued strenuously that the concessions amounted to a substantial commercial advantage and that they would suffer mightily without them.  The Cebr Report of September 2020 (see paragraph [49] above) seeks to quantify the difference between operating under the VAT RES and operating under the normal tax regime. It therefore provides a telling indication of the effect of the “<span style="font-style:italic">advantage, favour, privilege or immunity</span>” which being inside the concessionary schemes conferred and, by parity of reasoning, the relative disadvantages of being an exporter outside the schemes. Moreover, in submissions made in response to the CP, when the provisional view of Government was that it might <span style="text-decoration:underline">extend</span> the schemes, stakeholders were largely enthusiastic because they considered that to do so would confer significant <span style="font-style:italic">additional</span> advantages.  This evidence also highlights that being in the schemes conferred a relative export advantage relative to those outside of the schemes. In this light, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that exports operating under the VAT RES and ESC 9.1 schemes received substantial benefits in respect of their export business. Upon the Claimants’ own case the immunity brought about by being in the schemes conferred material advantage, favour and privilege. </p>

As to this and setting to one side the other considerations referred to above, the underlying premise is not necessarily true because in practical terms the schemes facilitated tax abuse.

He argued that even accepting that the Government’s position was tenable (but not therefore necessarily correct), the analysis was still irrational since tenability did not oust rationality.  He pointed out: that the references to the GATT in the CP and CR were short and conclusionary; that there was no explanation as to why the Government considered that Article I:1 was engaged; that there was no reference to the possible applications of Articles XVI and XXIV GATT; and that there was no explanation as to why there was discrimination given that the VAT RES and ESC 9.1 both had as their object ensuring that tax was paid according to the destination principle which was an internationally accepted fiscal norm. </p>

It is for this reason that the Government meets the flexible tenability standard.  There is no daylight in this case between a finding of tenability and a finding of correctness.  As such I do not agree with Mr Beard’s arguments insofar as they concern issues of substance.  Insofar as the rationality challenge is as to the adequacy of the analysis and the reasoning in the CP and CR then it is true that the Government’s position under the GATT is set out in conclusionary terms.  However, that conclusion was consulted over and, so far as the Court is aware, was not challenged by consultees during the consultation process.  It was certainly not challenged by these Claimants.

Here the Government deliberately chose to adhere to international law and, that being so, it was lawful and proper for the Government to apply the law to the letter, realpolitik notwithstanding. Indeed, as the Government points out, Article XVI:4 GATT buttresses the duty of immediate rectification in Article I:1.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Government disagrees.  It says that the TCA and EU(FR)A 2020 have nothing to do with, and do not affect, tax rates. The decisions to abolish the tax concessions were taken before the TCA or EU(FR)A 2020 were in existence. It was clearly not irrational for the Government – when it abolished the schemes - not to consider the possible ramifications of an agreement that was in negotiation and might never come into being and which did not touch upon tax rates.  Moreover, it was clearly rational for Government to decline to <span style="font-style:italic">reconsider</span> retaining or reintroducing the VAT RES and ESC9.1 in the light of the TCA since it had always been the Government’s firm position that it wished, following EU exit, to retain discretion over tax rates. In any event the substantive analysis of the Claimants concerning the scope and effect of Article XXIV GATT is incorrect. Properly interpreted nothing in the TCA serves to exclude the GATT since the TCA had nothing to say about tax rates.  It follows that nothing in the GATT could prevent the formation of the TCA and, this being so, it is irrelevant for that reason as well. The Government argues that the Ground is not arguable and that permission to amend should be refused; but even if permission is granted judicial review should be refused. </p>

The Claimants say that the <span style="font-style:italic">possibility</span> of a free trade agreement should have been taken into account when these decisions were being taken. I disagree. Whatever might or might not have been the private views of the Government as to the likelihood of a free trade agreement being concluded the fact is that no such agreement had been entered into and the negotiations on important components of a final text were being discussed and negotiated up until the last moment.  There is hence a short answer to this which is that it simply cannot have been an error on the part of the Government to fail to have regard to measures which were in negotiation and might never come into force. The Government all along wanted a solution which was lawful under <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> permutation of outcome – deal or no deal.  It is in this respect common ground that at all material times, including after the coming into effect of the TCA, it was not unlawful under the GATT for the Government to have aligned the VAT positions as between the EU and the rest of the world. </p>

This was simply never on the cards given the Government’s earlier stance.  The Government wished, as part of its EU exit strategy, to retain control over rates of taxation. This was quintessentially a political decision sitting at the most extreme margins of anything that the courts would ever consider interfering with.

The position of the Government throughout has consistently been that, following expiry of the Transitional Period, decisions on tax rates would be a matter for the Executive and Parliament and not governed by any possible future trade agreement with the EU.  It follows that there is nothing in the TCA which the automatic read-across and modification mechanism in section 29 EU(FR)A 2020 could attach to which could have the effect of limiting the powers of the Government in relation to the VAT RES or ESC 9.1. </p>

The Claimants argue that because the TCA amounted to a free trade agreement, recognised by the parties as such under Article XXIV:5 GATT (set out at paragraph [122] above), it had the effect of creating a total derogation from the principle of nondiscrimination in Article I:1.  In other words the prohibition on retaining the concessionary schemes no longer applied <span style="font-style:italic">at all</span>.   If this argument were correct then the <span style="font-style:italic">mere fact</span> that a state concluded a free trade agreement or customs union, meeting the requirements of Article XXIV, would confer upon that state <span style="font-style:italic">carte blanche</span> to ignore the fundamental prohibition on discrimination in Article I:1 in its trade relations with the rest of the world.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.06in"><span style="font-style:italic">Agreement</span>”, and concerned exclusively cheese, then, on the Claimants’ argument, the UK would be entitled to discriminate against other products being imports or exports from or to third countries howsoever unrelated they were to the subject matter of the Article XXIV compliant trade or customs agreement.  An agreement on cheese with the EU would enable the UK, under GATT, to discriminate in relation to perfume, watches or cameras traded as between the UK and third counties.  Article XXIV:5 is not however drafted in terms which support such a construction.  It provides that “… <span style="font-style:italic">the provisions of this Agreement shall not prevent, as between the territories of contracting parties, the formation of a customs union or of a free-trade area</span> …”.  I have set out my conclusion on the implications of the phrase “<span style="font-style:italic">shall not prevent</span>” at paragraph [123] above. It does not disapply, wholesale, GATT provisions such as Article I:1; it is concerned <span style="font-style:italic">only</span> to ensure that those provisions do not prevent an Article XXIV compliant agreement or customs union coming into being.  The most obvious example is rates of customs duty.  If state A enters into a free trade agreement with state B under Article XXIV and grants B preferential tariffs on (say) certain agricultural produce then it would not thereafter be bound under Article I:1 GATT to offer those same, low, <span style="text-decoration:underline">agricultural</span>, tariffs to all other states on those same products. Article XXIV does not however go further than this. If it were otherwise the concurrent application of Article I:1 might deter the coming into force of the free trade agreement at all.  </p>

This specifically permits derogation from the non-discrimination principle in relation to charging of preferential tariffs to developing countries but makes clear that this cannot serve to justify <span style="font-style:italic">other</span> restrictions or distortions of trade.

If the Court (sitting as the Court of Appeal) grants permission, then we (this time as the Divisional Court) proceed to determine the claim for judicial review. Because of this the Government has given full disclosure and the Claimants have had sight of the underlying evolution of relevant policy. That disclosure was supplemented by detailed witness statement evidence from senior officials from within HMT and HMRC, including from the economic and statistics arms of HMRC (the KAI unit see paragraph [21] above).

In later written and in oral submissions Mr Beard QC clarified that there was no one quantitative model that had to be performed.  The decision maker had a choice as to methodology to use.  Secondly, it is also accepted that it is not possible to arrive at a precise quantification of Wider Economic Impact.  It is acknowledged that this would be to demand an unattainable degree of accuracy.  Thirdly, it is accepted on the facts of the case that within HMT and HMRC, and in evidence fed into the OBR analysis by the specialist KAI unit from within HMRC, and also in submissions and advices provided to Ministers, there <span style="font-style:italic">was</span> at least a recognition of the industry case that abolition would cause wider harm to their sector, and to the wider economy.

The limited analysis that was performed stopped well short of that needed to be carried out if a fair assessment of impact was to be had.

I understand from my teams’ conversation with KAI that a significant difficulty was that any precise empirical estimates that are broader than the Fiscal Cost, including the effect on the high street, of the VAT RES or tax-free airside sales would be heavily dependent on key behavioural assumptions which were uncertain (e.g. on how it would affect purchasing decision and someone’s decision to visit the UK in the first place).  Making these precise behavioural judgments, alongside the difficulty in obtaining, for example, granular sales date from retailer, was a key issue with conducting this kind of ‘precise’ estimate.” </p>

Whilst there might be a debate about the extent of the impact it could not be in dispute that there would be <span style="font-style:italic">some</span> significant adverse effects.  Disclosed documents show that the Government accepted that some of the main conclusions in that report were indeed correct.  Yet the Government persisted in its failure to perform any proper analysis of the wider ripple effects of abolition, which included likely negative effects on overall tax receipts. The Government took into account the OBR Forecast but this failed to consider Wider Economic Impact. The net effect was that the evidence base upon which the Chancellor then decided to lay the SI before Parliament was flawed.  It exaggerated Fiscal Cost and Exchequer Impact and underplayed Wider Economic Impact. </p>

Without quantifying Wider Economic Impact, even within margins of error or ranges, it was not possible for the Government to take a rational or fair decision about the relative pros and cons of abolition.

In relation to identification of relevant evidence of the reasons she argued that whilst the CR did set out a Decision to abolish certain tax free sales, the reality was that this was only ever a decision subject to implementation.  It could not exert any independent legal effect.  Subsequently, and in response to strong representations made by stakeholders which included submission of the Cebr Report of September 2020, a review did occur of the evidence.  The Cebr Report was put before the Chancellor.  The OBR engaged with KAI who provided detailed Costings Explanatory Notes.  OBR published its Forecast on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2020 and updated advices were put to the Chancellor which included a narrative summary of stakeholder concerns.  The evidence leading up to the exercise of the statutory power to lay the SI and the formal withdrawal of ESC 9.1 on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> December 2020 had therefore to be taken into account in determining whether the decisions of the Government complained of were consistent with ordinary public law principles. </p>

This was the consistent view of HMRC, HMT, KAI, OBR and, ultimately, the Chancellor.  Any attempt to go beyond estimating Fiscal Cost and Exchequer Impact (themselves exercises of considerable uncertainty) was an exercise chasing unattainable accuracy and the generation of any figures through such an exercise would have been meaningless. </p>

All decisions sit on a spectrum which, at one extreme, concern the position of individuals and define with specificity their rights, benefits and obligations.  Frequently, the decision is the outcome of a largely non-discretionary process, such as a calculation to determine a benefit payment or the amount subject to tax.  At the other end of the spectrum there are decisions based upon intrinsically political, scientific or social considerations of a broad and often uncertain nature.  The present decision, albeit that it affects the financial position of individuals and companies, is towards this latter (broad) end of that spectrum.  It involves the balancing and reconciling of a variety of potentially conflicting and incongruent objectives of a broad organisational, fiscal and commercial nature.  These competing considerations are not readily amenable to easy or accurate quantification and compel the making of judgment calls about their nature and extent in order to balance one against the other. Such a balancing exercise, as was recognised internally, may lead to winners and losers. In my judgment the decisions which are in dispute are ones which attract a relatively broad margin of judgment or discretion for the decision-maker.  None of this means that the exercise of discretion or judgment is beyond review, but it does mean that in determining what is reasonable and rational the Courts will pay close regard to the views of the many officials who agreed as to the nature and limits of the exercise to be performed and whose views the Chancellor evidently accepted. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">First, the Decision (in the CR) could not, by itself, alter the law and could only, legally, ever stand as a statement of intent. Between the date of the CR and the later exercise of the statutory power, the chronology shows that the Chancellor sought new evidence and analysis on a variety of matters and that new evidence was indeed submitted. The advices put to Ministers contemplated the taking of a future exercise of the statutory power (to lay the SI pursuant to the power under section 51(1)(a) and (c) of the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018)  and a formal act of withdrawal of ESC 9.1 and were provided in the light of the most up to date evidence.  They were not advanced upon the basis, for instance, that the power to take both actions had already been exercised or that the Minister’s discretion was otherwise fettered by the Decision set out in the CR.  The Government, in written submissions, accepts that the decisions taken on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> December 2020 were separate decisions. It refers to: “…<span style="font-style:italic">the subsequent decision to implement withdrawal of the schemes was taken following and informed by the OBR analysis</span>.”  Moreover, constitutionally, the decision to abolish the VAT RES was that of Parliament which could in theory (under the negative resolution procedure) have opposed and rejected the SI. Under the negative resolution procedure which governed the coming into effect of the SI, it became effective as of the date of laying i.e. 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> December 2020. It could therefore be said that, on one view, the operative decision for the VAT RES was that of Parliament and the reasons for this would at least include those expressed in documents which immediately preceded the laying of the SI. In these circumstances it is wrong to focus exclusively upon the reasoning in the CR because that simply does not reflect reality. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">Secondly, whilst in some respects the reasoning in paragraphs [3.25] – [3.27] of the CR is conclusionary and not always consistent, it is wrong to treat these three paragraphs as continuing the full reasoning of the Government in relation to the ESC. For this it is necessary to look at the CR more broadly and as a whole in order to identity the full suite of reasons. For illustration, the Government’s conclusions on its duties under the GATT are not referred to in paragraphs [3.25] – [3.27] but elsewhere, for instance in paragraph [3.19]. It is also relevant that the CR is a brief document addressed to the world at large summarising, in often sweeping and high-level terms, the Government’s conclusions.  A court will adopt a more holistic approach to such a document than in relation to other decisions of a more personalised nature, such as those addressed to named natural or legal persons setting out the conclusion of a regulatory enforcement procedure and imposing a sanction, or granting or denying a social benefit, or denying housing, or refusing admission to a school, or refusing planning permission to a homeowner to extend a dwelling, etc. </p>

On the facts of the case the Government took that new evidence (such as the Cebr Report of September 2020) into account and it was factored into fresh advice given to Ministers leading to a fresh decision.  It played a material part in the on-going process leading to the decisions taken on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> December 2020.

I disagree.  The OBR evidence was given in the light of the publication of its Forecast on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2020 (see paragraphs [56] – [61] above).  In that public document OBR acknowledged that because of the imponderables involved its estimates might not be accurate. The evidence now relied upon by the Claimants concerned that report and therefore focused upon actions taken or not taken by OBR <span style="font-style:italic">outside</span> of Parliament.  Moreover, the evidence relating to those non-Parliamentary actions was given in public session.  It was relayed live on Parliament TV. A video recording of the evidence is available on the Parliament website which stands as a public record of the evidence.  As at the date of this Judgement it can still be viewed. There is no disagreement as to this evidence.  The Claimants do not rely upon that evidence to call it into question, or as a challenge to the proceedings of the Select Committee.  If the OBR had been asked in a separate letter to confirm the evidence, perhaps under a FOIA request, I have no doubt that it would have done so. No authority was cited to support reliance upon Parliamentary Privilege as an exclusionary device which stretched to this extreme.  Indeed case law indicates that no privilege applies:  See e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">Justice for Health Limited v Secretary of State for Health et ors </span>[2016] EWHC 2338 at paragraphs [157][165]; and <span style="font-style:italic">Stagecoach Midland Trust Ltd v Secretary of State for Transport</span> [2020] EWHC 1568 (TCC) per Stuart Smith J (and he then was) at paragraph [79].

During that work various economic reports prepared by relevant commercial stakeholders, extolling the benefits of the tax-free schemes, were considered.  These included a Cebr Report from 2017 and a report from York Aviation dated March 2020.  These were based upon data preceding the commencement of the Covid-19 Pandemic. They did not analyse the effects of abolition since, at that stage, this was not in contemplation.  Nonetheless, the reports provided evidence of the benefits of tax (or VAT) free including of its extension following expiry of the Transitional Period, and it can be properly inferred from this material that abolition would, in the view of business, lead to significant adverse economic effects. Mr Michael Cunningham, Deputy Director at HMT, in his witness evidence to the Court, explained that HMT and HMRC were aware of and took these reports into consideration in the decision to launch a consultation. They contributed to the provisional view that the schemes might be extended. Their reliability was however questioned: </p>

While stakeholders might refer to these reports as evidence of the benefits of extending the scheme, they are very clearly estimates and predictions and open to challenge. These reports also contained little discussion about the uncertainties in predicting behaviour or the impact of passenger/visitor numbers, as KAI’s initial analysis of the Fiscal Cost had done. My team also had conversations with KAI about the general findings in these reports, with the view taken that these types of analysis were significantly uncertain and the claimed outcomes very difficult to predict. …  [M]y team and KAI also held a meeting with the authors of the March 2020 York Aviation report to understand better the data used in their analysis of the Exchequer Impact of extending tax- and duty-free sales which formed part of their assessment of Wider Economic Impact.

I understand from my team’s conversations with KAI that a significant difficulty was that any precise empirical estimates that are broader than the Fiscal Cost, including the effect on the high street, of the VAT RES or tax-free airside sales would be heavily dependent on key behavioural assumptions which were uncertain (e.g. on how it would affect purchasing decisions and someone’s decision to visit the UK in the first place). Making these precise behavioural judgements, alongside the difficulty in obtaining, for example, granular sales data from retailers, was a key issue with conducting this kind of ‘precise’ estimate.

The Forecast did not proceed to measure Wider Economic Impact but did make some assumptions about the possible impact upon Exchequer Impact.  These took account of a reduction in tourism attributable to the deterrent effect of a price increase in the sorts of luxury goods which were sold under the scheme.  The base for the calculation was an industry wide price elasticity figure of 1.28, derived from a PWC Final Report - “<span style="font-style:italic">The Impact of Taxes on the Competitiveness of European Tourism</span>” (October 2017).  The OBR then scaled the figure upwards by 50% to reflect an assumption that the elasticity of demands for luxury goods was materially higher than for tourism generally.  This led to a figure of 1.9%.  When this was applied it led to a reduction in the tax yield from abolition (Exchequer Impact).

Having described the evidence that was considered a central point is the margin of appreciation that must be applied to the decision-making process. As already set out this is relatively broad. In this connection it is relevant to consider the nature of the evidence needed to estimate the wider impact of abolition. Ms Mitrophanous QC argued, based upon the OBR analysis, that it reflected the view of an expert body that even a first level assessment of effects (to arrive at Exchequer Impact) was highly uncertain. It necessarily followed that the sort of secondary and tertiary indirect effects the Claimants contended should have been modelled were simply not worth performing because of the uncertainty and unreliability of the assumptions that would have been required to be made.  The Court should attribute real weight to the independently formed judgment of the OBR as to the limits of any exercise in counterfactual forecasting. This was the essence of its professional stock in trade.  I agree that weight should be attributed to their evaluation for the reasons given.  Their assessment is not beyond judicial scrutiny, but it is entitled to considerable respect.  In this case the view of OBR was that the first level estimation of Exchequer Impact was at the margin of (and possibly even beyond) that which was feasible.  It followed that it was reasonable for OBR to conclude that to go further would render any resultant figure unreliable. </p>

These are the immediate fiscal effects of a policy change, ignoring any impact on the behaviour of those affected by the change or any knock-on effects to the wider economy. In the beer duty example, that would mean applying the new beer duty rate to the baseline forecast of the quantity of beer clearances and calculating the difference in beer duty raised on the new and old basis. This calculation would be relatively simple, but the behavioural and wider effects ignored could be material.

In the beer duty example, the reduction in beer duty leads to lower beer prices, which, given the price elasticity of beer consumption, would increase beer clearances relative to the baseline.

Changes to the forecast size or composition of the economy would have second round of effects on the public finances – for example, temporarily lower inflation would affect the amount of interest paid on index-linked gilts and could affect the uprating of tax and benefit thresholds; changes in household consumption could affect VAT receipts; and so on.  </p>

It was argued that the new regime would exert damaging consequences for consumers and would encourage the development of an unregulated market by incentivising operators to offer gambling services into the UK without a licence and/or in breach of the regulatory controls and will thus harm the consumer. The burden imposed by the new regime on reputable operators would provide a competitive advantage to competing but unscrupulous overseas operators. It was said that "<span style="font-style:italic">inevitably</span>" an element of the cost burden of the new regime would be passed on to UK consumers by licensed overseas operators. Further, the costs of the burden of the new regime would reduce the marketing spend of compliant operators decreasing the resources that could be applied to attracting and retaining UK customers. It was then said that this would attract unscrupulous operators to the market who, not having these costs, would be able to undercut, or enjoy greater profitability than, licensed overseas operators.  The Court did not accept that this calamitous chain of events would occur.  The argument was premised upon a series of assumptions that were far from self-evident and, indeed, seemed economically counterintuitive.

The inquiry will also normally assess the "statistical significance" of the estimated relationships i.e. the degree of confidence that the true relationship is close to the estimated relationship. In the present case the counterfactual being assessed is the use and prevalence of tobacco in a market where standardised packaging as mandated by the Regulations is operative.

Examples of such uncertainties include the extent to which Covid-19 has decreased demand for travel and for tax free shopping and the extent to which in the future demand will recover and at what rate and when, if ever, it will return to pre-Covid-19 pandemic rates?  Answers to these questions in turn depend upon variables beyond the control of retailers and will be affected by the adoption, and success (or failure), of palliative Governmental health measures in the UK but also elsewhere in the world where travellers go to and come from; and yet further upon the extent to which the experience of shoppers during lock-down, acquiring goods on-line, causes a permanent switch in shopping habits which, in turn, also supresses longer term demand for tax free shopping? </p>

She said that it was impossible, in such circumstances, for a court to conclude that the approach adopted by KAI was irrational even if it was the case that there was some merit in the alternative approach adopted by the Claimants’ expert.  She pointed out that the OBR had, in the performance of its statutory duties, certified the approach adopted by KAI as reasonable.  She also pointed out by reference to the expert report adduced on behalf of the Claimants that there was acceptance by the expert there that the approach adopted by KAI was (at least) not improper.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">Thirdly, she pointed out that even when the figures were adjusted, in context, they made only a marginal difference to the overall conclusions about the extent of Exchequer Impact.   The Note was submitted to OBR for it to consider in its preparation of the OBR Forecast.  It was clear from the Forecast as published, and as submitted to the Chancellor, that OBR treated all estimates of even Exchequer Impact as “<span style="font-style:italic">highly uncertain</span>”.  It did not treat as reliable its <span style="font-style:italic">own</span> conclusions about Exchequer Impact, which was the point the OBR in fact made to the House of Commons Select Committee (see paragraph [61]).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">Fourthly, Ms Mitrophanous QC described the Chancellor’s decision as multifactorial.  The OBR Forecast, with its attendant uncertainty, was itself but one of a number of pieces of evidence and analysis which went into the mix of factors that the Chancellor took into account.  There was nothing in the evidence which indicated that had the adjusted figures been factored into the OBR Forecast and laid before the Chancellor they would have made any difference to that decision. It followed, she argued, in effect as a matter of causation, that this dispute about computation played only a trivial role, if it played any role at all, in the final decision. </p>

But even if, to test the argument, I was to conclude that the absence of consistency was irrational that is by no means the end of the story.

It took the reduction in their spending set out in Tables 8 and 9 and then applied these to the average return or refund values on the VAT RES forms. The calculation incorporated an 80% adjustment to account for the 20% “<span style="font-style:italic">carve out</span>” for the impact of administrative fees. Ms Peters, in her witness statement, “<span style="font-style:italic">on reflection</span>” accepted that Exchequer Impact would be more accurately estimated if the carve out had been excluded.

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">The final matter to be determined is Ground V. As to this the Government argues that the Claimants are guilty of undue delay under section 31(6) Supreme Court Act 1981 which is a reason to refuse permission on the appeal or relief in the substantive judicial review. The grant of relief is likely to cause substantial hardship and/or substantially prejudice the rights of third persons and/or is detrimental to good administration. Accordingly, permission to seek judicial review should be refused or if granted relief should be refused in any event.   The main points advanced are as follows.  First, on the facts the Claimants became aware of the Decision on publication of the CR on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September and this included that the Decision would be implemented as from 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January 2021, yet they still took nearly two months before issuing the claim.  Secondly, the failure was compounded by the decision of the Claimants to refuse the invitation made by the Court to hold an expedited hearing to commence on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December with a judgment to be handed down before the end of the year, with the consequence that the hearing had to occur after implementation.  Thirdly, if the Government had to unravel the scheme now, following implementation, it would cause huge inconvenience and prejudice to many third parties.  Finally, reversing the legislation now would be unlawful under the GATT and therefore contrary to the principle of good administration: <span style="font-style:italic">“Reversion to the status quo ante would also place the United Kingdom in breach of its WTO obligations following expiry of the transition period</span>”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">I address this briefly.  It is necessary to separate out arguments about undue delay from those relating to relief. In relation to relief it was agreed that this would need to be addressed fully only if the Court were minded to find in favour of the Claimants.  Argument on relief would therefore await the judgment of the Court. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">First, the claim was served within the requisite limitation period. This is a case of real complexity, as the arguments and analysis set out in this judgment demonstrate. The case as served was immensely detailed and contained a great deal of factual and other evidence from a multiplicity of sources and parties.  This was never a case that could have been compiled with great haste, as some can. Perhaps (it is impossible to say) it could have been prepared a few days or a week or so earlier but even if that were true there is no “<span style="font-style:italic">undue</span>” delay.  As explained in the main body of this judgment whilst the Decision in the CR was published on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2020 in actual fact the decisionmaking process continued, and the Claimants were integral to it.  On one perfectly feasible view the real decisions were those of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> December 2020 to lay the SI before Parliament, and withdraw ESC 9.1, and on another view the real decision in relation the VAT RES was that taken by Parliament to adopt the SI, also on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> December 2020. All of these events were <span style="font-style:italic">after</span> the Claimants had issued proceedings. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">Second, there has in the end been no prejudice to the Government by this course of action.  By order dated 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2020, Fraser J directed a hearing of the claim on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2021, granting permission on Grounds 1 (<span style="font-style:italic">Wilkinson</span>) and II (GATT) only. This was upheld by Swift J. In this way, the Court acceded to the Claimants’ request for expedition and directed a tight timetable for responsive submissions and evidence by the Government.  The Claimants then sought permission to appeal the refusal to grant permission to pursue the other grounds of challenge.  If the substantive hearing on all extant matters had gone ahead on 10th December 2020, the Government might have had cause to complain that it had been prejudiced by the late commencement of proceedings.  However, in the event, the substantive hearing was adjourned by order of the Court from 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2020, to 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> and 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> February 2021.  One important reason for granting this adjournment was to enable the Government to have sufficient time to marshal its case on all the matters now to be determined, acknowledging that this was a significant case for all parties and that the issues were complex.   Thus, the argument on prejudice caused by any alleged delay fell away. </p>
