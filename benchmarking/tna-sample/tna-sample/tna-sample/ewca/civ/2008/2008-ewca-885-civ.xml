Their outcome is likely to be affected by the rulings on these appeals. However, the effect of the rulings extends beyond public sector employment and is likely to affect the way in which employers, employees and trade unions approach equal pay in general and, in particular, job evaluation exercises and consequential changes to pay and grading structures.      </p>

They were known, in the case of manual workers, as “the White Book”; in the case of administrative, professional, technical and clerical workers (APT &amp; C or white collar employees) as “the Purple Book”; and in the case of skilled craft workers as “the Red Book.” Of the three schemes, only the White Book was based on a job evaluation scheme (JES). The work of any White Book employee was rated as equivalent (RAE) to any other White Book employee on the same grade. It was intended and anticipated that the JES underlying the White Book scales would eliminate any possibility of sex discrimination in respect of pay.   </p>

Thus, any Purple Book employee of Redcar who wished, in an equal pay claim, to compare herself with a White Book or Red Book employee would have to show that her work was work of equal value.

It provided for all manual and APT &amp; C jobs to be graded on the same scales. New job evaluation studies were to be conducted locally under procedures involving panels of employer and employee representatives and using specified factor guidance.  Once the JESs were completed and the Green Book implemented, the work of any employee on a particular scale would be RAE to any other employee on that scale, regardless of the nature of their work. </p>

It appears to be common ground that one of the fundamental purposes of the Single Status agreement was to remove the inequalities of pay which had crept into local government employment.  Certainly, the working group identified within the existing arrangements some problems arising from the operation of equal pay law.  For the future, under the Green Book, there was to be equality of pay for men and women doing equally rated work.   </p>

All were in Manual Grade 2 (MG2).  They sought to compare themselves with male gardeners and refuse collectors (MG2) and male street cleaners (who were in the lower grade of MG1).  All these men were earning more than the MG2 women. In broad outline, the factual position was that, although the MG2 women’s basic pay was the same as the men on MG2 (and higher than the men on MG1), the men were receiving either a bonus or an allowance which took their pay above that of the women who received no such bonuses or allowances. The differential was substantial: for example, the gardeners’ bonus scheme resulted in a pay uplift of 40%. </p>

However, in respect of claims received after 27 January 2004, it made no more concessions, but relied on the defence under section 1(3) of the 1970 Act.  Its argument was to be that the White Book permitted different groups of workers to negotiate bonuses and allowances provided that these were genuinely based on a justifying factor, such as productivity or working conditions. The bonuses which gave rise to the pay differential between the MG2 men and women were said to be genuinely and justifiably based on a productivity scheme and the allowances were justified by economic or working conditions. The claimants’ position was to be that the bonuses and allowances, which the male comparators were receiving, were not justified. They were just pay supplements to which the men were automatically entitled; in effect, the men were on a higher rate of basic pay than the women.   </p>

The ET held that the bonuses and allowances payable to gardeners and street sweepers, which had been genuine and justifiable when first introduced had, by 2000, become automatic pay uplifts for the men.

We will explain the pay protection scheme and the nature of the women’s claims in greater detail later in this judgment.

In a claim brought under section 1(2)(b) of the SDA 1975, the claimant usually has to produce statistical evidence of the disparate adverse effect of the practice upon women. If that is shown, there will be unlawful indirect discrimination, unless the employer can justify it by complying with (iii).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Because Article 141 covers any pay discrimination on the ground of sex both direct and indirect, the 1970 Act must be construed as covering direct and indirect discrimination.  This was not clear in 1970; the separate concepts of direct and indirect sex discrimination had not then been recognised. In any event, the body of the 1970 Act does not speak of ‘discrimination’; its method is to impose a requirement of equal treatment for men and women in the same employment in order to prevent discrimination as regards terms and conditions of employment between men and women.  It may be - it is not clear - that, when passing the 1970 Act, Parliament had in mind only direct sex discrimination in the field of pay.  Certainly, when the 1970 Act was brought into force by the SDA 1975, which introduced the concept of indirect discrimination, the provisions of the 1970 Act were not amended or clarified to take account of the possibility that a differential in pay might arise as the result of indirect, as well as direct, sex discrimination. However, it is now clear that the 1970 Act must be read so as to forbid both direct and indirect sex discrimination in the field of pay.  It follows that, for the section 1(3) defence in the 1970 Act to succeed, the pay differential (which the claimant has demonstrated) must be due to a genuine material factor which is not ‘the difference of sex’ either directly or indirectly.    </p>

In that case, a female speech therapist brought proceedings against her employer and the Secretary of State for Health claiming equality of pay with two male comparators (a clinical psychologist and a pharmacist),  who were paid more than her for doing work of equal value. The employer relied on the GMF defence in section 1(3) of the 1970 Act.  At first instance, the tribunal dismissed her claim holding that the difference in pay had resulted from the operation of the different collective bargaining agreements governing the pay of the different professional groups. These agreements were not in any way tainted with sex discrimination. The section 1(3) defence succeeded.  </p>

If there was no barrier or requirement, there was no indirect discrimination. The claimant’s submission was that there was no need to identify a barrier or requirement which prevented her from joining the advantaged group and receiving the higher rate of pay. On the facts of the case there <span style="font-style:italic">was </span>a differential. The facts were that practically all the speech therapists were women and, at the relevant senior level, practically all the clinical psychologists and pharmacists were men.

The employer’s appeal to the Court of Session succeeded on the ground that the section 1(3) defence was made out because the pay differential was not related in any way to sex. The reason for it was the employer’s system of promotion coupled with financial constraints. The House of Lords dismissed the appeal.

The variation between her contract and the man’s contract is presumed to be due to the difference of sex. The burden passes to the employer to show that the explanation for the variation is not tainted with sex. In order to discharge this burden, the employer must satisfy the tribunal on several matters. First, that the proffered explanation, or reason, is genuine and not a sham or pretence. Second, that the less favourable treatment is due to this reason.  The factor relied on must be the cause of the disparity. In this regard, and in this sense, the factor must be a “material” factor, that is a significant and relevant factor. Third, that the reason is not “the difference of sex”. This phrase is apt to embrace any form of sex discrimination, whether direct or indirect. Fourth, that the factor relied upon is or, in a case within section 1(2)(c) may be a “material” difference, that is, a significant and relevant difference between the woman’s case and the man’s case. </span>

The first of these cases was <span style="font-style:italic">Nelson v Carillion Services Ltd </span>[2003] ICR 1256. Redcar relies on that case as authority for the proposition that, where the issue of indirect discrimination arises in an equal pay case, the burden of proving that the employer’s pay arrangements were indirectly discriminatory lies on the applicant. This results in the burden of proof switching back and forth.  The argument goes as follows: the claimant shows that she is receiving less pay than a man for equal work; the employer raises the section 1(3) defence and the burden of proof passes to him; if he can show that the pay disparity was not directly discriminatory, the burden passes back to the claimant who must prove, if she can, that the pay disparity was indirectly discriminatory. This will usually be done by demonstrating disparate adverse impact or an <span style="font-style:italic">Enderby-</span>type group differential. If she fails in that, the section 1(3) defence succeeds and the claim fails. If the claimant succeeds in showing indirect discrimination, the burden switches back to the employer to show, if he can, that the discriminatory pay differential is objectively justified.</p>

However, this court is bound by it, unless the circumstances fall within one of the limited exceptions to the usual rule of precedent identified in <span style="font-style:italic">Young v Bristol Aeroplane Co Ltd </span>[1944] I KB 718 at pages 725-6.  None of these applies.  No real argument was raised that <span style="font-style:italic">Nelson</span> was decided <span style="font-style:italic">per incuriam</span>; nor could it be as both <span style="font-style:italic">Marshall</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Enderby</span> were discussed at some length.  Whatever we think about <span style="font-style:italic">Nelson, </span>it is binding on us.   However, we do not think that the case is of importance in the determination of these appeals. Nothing in these appeals turns on where the burden lies of demonstrating that the pay arrangements were indirectly discriminatory.  Where the burden of proof lies can be of great importance in the process of decision making.  That is no doubt why, in <span style="font-style:italic">Marshall</span>, Lord Nicholls went to such pains to set out his view of the position, even though the incidence of the burden of proof was not part of the ratio of his decision.  However, the incidence of the burden of proof is not important in any case where the evidence (from whatever source) enables the tribunal to be (properly) satisfied that the pay differential was or was not caused by indirect sex discrimination.  Burden of proof is only important where the evidence (from whatever source) fails to satisfy the tribunal. Then the result is determined against the party which bore the burden of proof on that issue.  In the present appeals, as we will demonstrate in due course, the ET was satisfied that the pay differentials were indirectly discriminatory. Redcar and Middlesbrough do not contend that there was insufficient evidence to support those decisions; they contend that the ET’s reasoning was wrong.   Thus, we are satisfied that these appeals are not affected by the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Nelson </span>(supra).  </p>

In particular, in an <span style="font-style:italic">Enderby-</span>type case, where the disadvantaged group comprised all or almost all women and the advantaged group were all or almost all men, it would be impossible in practical terms for the employer to show that the pay differential was not related to the difference of sex.  Thus, although, in theory, it was right to say that an employer could still show that the pay differential was not due to the difference of sex, even in the face of evidence of disparate adverse impact, it would only be possible in a case where the statistical evidence was not very strong or convincing.  </p>

Thus all employees assessed to be on the same scale were to be entitled to same rate of pay.  The result of the JESs was that some employees of each authority received an increase in pay and some a decrease. It was clear that the employers could not impose a reduction in pay on any employee without his or her consent. Consent was to be obtained by collective bargaining.  There is in each employee’s contract of employment a term which binds him or her to accept the result of collective bargaining by the appropriate trade unions.  Before the Green Book schemes were implemented, each authority and the relevant unions had negotiated a deal whereby those employees who were to suffer a pay cut under the new evaluation and scales were to be given ‘pay protection’.

It had had to introduce pay protection in order to secure the agreement of the unions to the pay reduction of some employees. The unions would not otherwise have agreed to the pay reductions. Without that agreement, the whole Green Book scheme (which was designed to eradicate pay discrimination for the future) would have foundered.

Their complaint was not about the existence of the pay protection scheme; rather it was about their exclusion from it. As explained above, their complaint was that, but for Redcar’s breach of their right to equal pay before changeover, they would have been on the same (higher) rate as the men, would have suffered a pay drop on 1 April 2004 and would have been included in the pay protection scheme.  The women’s case was that their exclusion from pay protection resulted directly from Redcar’s pre-changeover (proven or conceded or alleged) unlawful sex discrimination. </p>

It pointed out that many of the employees who were within the pay protection scheme were women; in fact, more women than men were within it.   Redcar also contended that, even if it had a disparate adverse impact on women employees, the pay protection scheme, as operated, could be objectively justified as necessary and proportionate on grounds unrelated to the difference of sex.  The inclusion of the women who were already known to have been entitled to enhanced pay (the First Multiples) and anyone who might later be proved to have been so entitled would have made the scheme too expensive. Redcar would not have been able to afford the scheme on the terms agreed, but would have had to offer a less generous scheme which the unions would not have accepted.</p>

Hargrove, upheld the women’s claim for equal pay for the period after 1 April 2004. Its reasoning was, first, to rule (in favour of Redcar) that examination of the limited available statistics relating to entitlement to pay protection did not demonstrate that there had been any indirect discrimination against women. Most of the employees receiving pay protection were women. However, it held (in favour of the claimants) that, when the position was examined more closely, it could be seen that that there were two reasons why employees could be granted pay protection.  They could be included in the scheme because their basic pay had been reduced. Those employees were either all or mainly women.  The other reason for inclusion was that the employee had lost a bonus or allowance. They were all men. They were the comparators doing work equally rated with the women claimants’ work.  The comparators were a male group receiving pay protection which was protecting their old bonuses.  The claimants were a female group doing equally rated work, but not receiving pay protection because they had not previously been receiving the higher rate of pay which they had been entitled to receive.

During the hearing of this appeal, we used the latter report.  The facts in <span style="font-style:italic">Snoxell</span> were that, before 1970, the employers had graded men and women on separate grades, simply on the ground of sex.  Miss Snoxell and Mrs Davies were female machine part inspectors. They were paid less than male machine part inspectors doing the same work. In 1970, the employer reorganised the pay structure. For the future, male and female inspectors were to be paid at the same rate for which a new grade (H2) was created. The existing female inspectors went into that grade as did all newly appointed inspectors, whether male or female. The pay in grade H2 was lower than that at which the existing male inspectors were being paid. They were put into a special grade, X2, where they continued to receive the higher rate to which they had previously been entitled.  It was said that they were ‘red-circled’.  In today’s language, they were granted pay protection.  It was intended that this pay differential should continue while those men remained employed. The pay differential was still effective in 1975 when the 1970 Act came into force.  The two women claimed equal pay. The employer claimed reliance on the section 1(3) defence.  The industrial tribunal upheld the employer’s defence, holding that the variation in pay between the men and women was genuinely due to a material difference other than sex.  </p>

Suppose the case of a single employee approaching retirement in a few months’ time, whose job has ceased to exist and who is temporarily transferred at his old wages to a lesser  paid job.

	      <span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:12pt">side by side, it can be seen that the solution depends upon whether, in analysing the history of the difference in treatment of Miss Snoxell and Mrs Davies on the one hand and the red-circled male inspectors on other, one stops at the moment of the formation of the circle or looks further back to see why Miss Snoxell and Mrs Davies were not within it. The arguments presented to us have, not surprisingly, considered questions of causation, and it has been said that the inability of Miss Snoxell and Mrs Davies to join the red circle was, or was not, the effective cause of the current variation in the terms of their contract of employment. It seems to us that this earlier discrimination can be said to be an effective cause of the current variation. But we would put the matter more broadly.  The onus of proof under section 1(3) is on the employer and it is a heavy one.  Intention and motive are irrelevant; and we would say that an employer can never establish in the terms of section 1(3) that the variation between the woman’s contract and the man’s contract is genuinely due to a material difference (other than the difference of sex) when it can be seen that past discrimination has contributed to the variation.  To allow such an answer would, we think, be contrary to the spirit and intent of the Equal Pay Act 1970, construed and interpreted in the manner we have already explained.

First, when it was established that there was a group which was disadvantaged as the result of sex discrimination, the only immediate way to deal with that was to bring the disadvantaged group up to the level of the advantaged group.  Second, when steps were taken to achieve a long term solution to discrimination (which might well entail a reduction in the benefit of the advantaged class), achievement of equality could not be made progressive if to do so had the effect of maintaining discrimination, even if only temporarily. </p>

As to Mr Allen’s submission on <span style="font-style:italic">Smith v Avdel, </span>the EAT held that the principles there stated were not of general application; they applied only to pensions cases.

It is clear that the lay members, in particular, were anxious about the difficulty that local authorities faced when trying to ‘manage’ their way out of historic discrimination.  However, the EAT said that it had to determine the legal rights of these particular claimants and could not interpret the law as its members might wish it to be.  Then, at paragraph 163, it added a rider to its conclusion, to the effect that, just because it had rejected the section 1(3) defence in this case, it did not follow that pay protection could never be relied on in connection with historic discrimination.  It postulated that the result might be different where the circumstances were different, as, for example, where the pay protection scheme had been brought in before any claims for historic discrimination were received.  It expressed the view that: </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The first main question for the ET was whether the reason for the pay differential was or was not ‘the difference of sex’. The ET considered whether the operation of the pay protection scheme had a disparate impact on female employees. The statistics showed that, in a predominantly female workforce, in January 2006, 1 in 2.5 of the male workforce was receiving protected pay compared with 1 in 4 of the women.  By October 2006, 1 in 4 of the male workforce was on protected pay compared with 1 in 14 of the women. The ET observed that these figures showed that a smaller proportion of women than men received protected pay in January 2006 and a much smaller proportion in October 2006.  However, the ET decided to disregard the October figures because it was not satisfied that the reasons for the changes between January and October had been properly explained. It concluded that the figures did not demonstrate that there was any ‘real evidence of disparate impact’ in the operation of the pay protection scheme.  We note in passing that it appears that the ET placed the burden of proving this issue on the claimants, thereby giving rise to a potential argument as to the correctness of <span style="font-style:italic">Nelson.</span>  However, in view of its next finding, this does not matter. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Next, the ET noted that those in receipt of pay protection fell into two groups.  One group were women whose pay had fallen because their jobs had been re-evaluated to a grade carrying lower pay.  The other group comprised men who had lost their bonuses and allowances.  The group of female claimants did not receive pay protection; their pay had not fallen because they had not been properly paid before changeover. The position was the same as had pertained in the Redcar case. The ET decided that it must adopt the same reasoning, which had been upheld by the EAT. It cited the passage from the Redcar EAT’s judgment dealing the effect of historic discrimination, and concluded that the post-April 2005 pay differential was tainted by sex. It was therefore necessary for Middlesbrough to show objective justification.  S<span style="font-style:italic">mith v Avdel</span> was not specifically cited to the ET, presumably because the EAT in Redcar had said that its application was confined to pensions cases. Apart from that, the ET adopted a similar approach to that of the Redcar ET and held that Middlesbrough had failed to show justification.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Cavanagh’s first submission in the Redcar appeal was that the ET had wrongly held that the employer’s reason for excluding the women from pay protection was directly discriminatory and that no question of justification therefore arose.  We must say immediately that that submission is unsustainable.  From the passages of the decision which we quoted above at paragraphs 72, 77 and 78, it is clear that the ET did not hold that the exclusion of the claimants was <span style="font-style:italic">directly</span> discriminatory.  It held that their exclusion was tainted by sex.  That was because the pay protection arrangement continued the historic unlawful sex discrimination based upon the men’s unjustifiable bonuses and allowances.  There was no suggestion that that historic discrimination had been <span style="font-style:italic">directly</span> discriminatory. It had plainly been indirect and had been unlawful because the employer had failed to justify it.  If the pre-April 2004 discrimination was not direct, it is hard to see how the post-April 2004 discrimination could be. Although the ET did not say in terms that, post-April 2004, it was talking about indirect discrimination, it did not need to: the point was so obvious.  Moreover, the ET went on to consider factors relevant to the issue of justification by the employer of the discrimination which it had found.  At paragraph 26 of its decision, it held that the employer could not justify the differential in pay. We have quoted the relevant passage at paragraph 79 above.  The ET would not have needed to consider justification at all if it had just held that the pay protection scheme was directly discriminatory.  Mr Cavanagh’s first submission must fail.  </p>

He submitted that the factual and legal position after April 2004 was completely different from the factual and legal position which had pertained before April 2004. In respect of the pre-April 2004 (White Book) situation, Redcar now accepted that it had unlawfully discriminated against the claimants in respect of their pay. But after the changeover date, everything was different. There was a new pay scheme, the Green Book, which was underpinned by a new JES.  The women were comparing themselves with different comparators.  The new reason for the new pay differential advanced by Redcar (namely a need to cushion the effect of a pay reduction) was a completely different reason from the old reason for the old differential. The ET should have focussed on the new circumstances and the new condition which was required for entitlement to pay protection. That was simply the suffering of a pay reduction on changeover day. The past and the so-called causal connection between the historic discrimination and the post-changeover situation were irrelevant.       </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In <span style="font-style:italic">Snoxell</span>, the EAT looked behind the immediate and overt reason for the current pay disparity and took account of the underlying reasons why it had arisen.  The immediate reason for the current pay disparity was that the applicants were in grade H2 and the comparators were in grade X2, which carried a higher rate.  There were a lot of male inspectors in grade H2 along with the women, so paying the women the H2 rate was not on the face of it discriminatory.  However, if one then asked why there were two grades for employees doing the same job, the answer was that it was because X2 had been created to preserve the men’s discriminatory historic pay differential. The EAT looked behind the immediate reason for the differential (the women are in a different grade) and asked why they were in a different grade. Then it could be seen that the reason for the pay differential was tainted by sex; it was based on historic discrimination.  We consider that the EAT’s approach in that case was correct.  A tribunal has to find what the reason was for the pay differential and, if necessary, should look at the underlying reason and not merely the immediate reason or criterion for inclusion/exclusion.  We think it is right to examine the underlying or historical position where that will throw light on the reason why one person is receiving an advantage and another is excluded from it. Indeed to exclude the history, in a case where it is relevant, would be artificial. </p>

However, we do not think that the ET failed to focus on the new pay differential.  The ET was concerned with why (post-changeover) the women were receiving less pay for work equally rated under the Green Book. The answer was because they were not included in the pay protection scheme and the male comparators were.

That was not, on the face of it, anything to do with sex.  But, if one then looks at the underlying reasons why the men suffered a wage drop on changeover and the women did not, the questions and answers go as follows:  Why did the men suffer a drop in pay? Because they lost their old bonuses. Why did the women not suffer a drop in pay on that day? Because they had been underpaid in the period preceding changeover. Why had they been underpaid in the preceding period? Because they were being unlawfully discriminated against in that period. They too had been entitled to the same pay as the men who had been on bonuses.  Thus the reason for the new pay differential was causally related to the historic unlawful sex discrimination. </p>

The same reasoning as was set out in the passage we cited from the judgment of Phillips J (see paragraphs 74 and 75 above) applies to the present circumstances.  The EAT in <span style="font-style:italic">Redcar v Bainbridge</span> endorsed it (see paragraph 83 above).  We think they were right to do so.

However, we must first mention the EAT’s handling of this issue, which is slightly puzzling.  At one stage, in paragraph 131, the EAT seemed to say that it did not matter in the context of this case whether the discrimination in question was direct or indirect because, if the arrangements were tainted by sex, the section 1(3) defence would be bound to fail.  If that is what the EAT thought, it would be wrong in our view. It is always important to distinguish between direct and indirect discrimination because direct discrimination can never be justified and indirect discrimination can be justified. Whether it is justified depends on the circumstances.  </p>

It may be said that the same is not true of those who had not by then made any claims at all, but again there must have been a realistic appreciation that further claims of that nature would be forthcoming. Furthermore, as we have said, no argument was addressed to the employment tribunal by either party that that was in principle a proper approach and the issue was only very briefly touched upon before us in oral argument by Mr Cavanagh. In the circumstances we think there is no basis in this case for distinguishing between the different categories of women.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It appears to us that the EAT’s reasoning, which is not as clearly set out as it might have been, was as follows.  The ET had been entitled to hold that the exclusion of the women claimants from pay protection was discriminatory by analogy with <span style="font-style:italic">Snoxell</span>. The women’s exclusion was either indirectly discriminatory and required justification or the arrangements were such that the section 1(3) defence failed and no justification was required. We think that the latter alternative would have been wrong. Justification was, at least in theory, possible and had to be considered.  It looks to us as though the EAT must have thought that the ET had misdirected itself because it had relied, in an unexplained way, on <span style="font-style:italic">Smith v Avdel. </span>The EAT had earlier said that that case was not relevant and its effect was confined only to pensions cases. If the ET had misdirected itself, the EAT was entitled to consider justification for itself and we think it did so at paragraphs 160 and 161 cited above.  We are fortified in that view by the fact that, having reached its conclusion that the claims succeeded, it expressed concern at the result and observed that there might well be circumstances in which the exclusion of a group of women from a pay protection scheme <span style="font-style:italic">would be justified</span>.  This was where the employer could show ‘a carefully crafted and costed scheme negotiated for the purpose of cushioning the effects of a drop in pay and without any reason to suppose when it is implemented that this would have discriminatory effects’. However, the EAT added, <span style="font-style:italic">that was not this case</span>. It is clear to us that the EAT had itself found that Redcar’s arrangements, which excluded the successful claimants from pay protection, could not be justified.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the Middlesbrough decision, at paragraphs 97 and 98, the EAT returned to the question of justification in the Redcar case. It said that the question of justification had not arisen in the Redcar case because the employers knew when they implemented the pay protection scheme that they had not been paying at least some of the women the pay due to them in breach of equal pay law. They knew that, had they corrected the women’s pay as soon as they accepted they had been acting unlawfully, the women would have had the benefit of pay protection.  For that reason, sex was “a direct and significant cause of the difference in treatment” (paragraph 159 of the ET decision). The EAT thought that in those circumstances the issue of justification did not arise. If it had, it was bound to fail because the employer was relying on its own failure to correct an inequality, which it knew existed, as justification for defeating the claim.  </p>

Elias J will have written both judgments and must be taken to have known what the EAT in Redcar had thought. As we have said, we think the first of these two analyses was wrong and that justification was required.

The ET’s conclusion was that the need to phase out discrimination (which was the legitimate objective) did not justify the continuation of any form of enhanced payment to the men without also enhancing equivalently the pay of the women’s groups.

Mr Cavanagh submitted that the ET’s conclusion had been wrong and that there plainly was objective justification for Redcar’s arrangements. It was wrong to criticise Redcar for failing to raise the women’s wages as soon as it had conceded the First Multiple claimants’ claims or at any rate before changeover day. It had not been possible to do so as there was a dispute as to quantum and a dispute about the wet weather allowance in the refuse workers pay.  So it was not possible for Redcar to adjust the claimants’ pay in time.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We do not accept these criticisms of the ET.  We consider that its reasoning was without fault. We will trace it through. At paragraph 25.5, the ET accepted Redcar’s contention that the male comparators had a contractual right to their enhanced pay (bonuses etc) and realistically, their contracts could only be varied by agreement. The only way agreement could be reached was by offering the men pay protection.  If the employer had tried to reduce their pay peremptorily, there would have been industrial unrest and hardship to the men. Thus the ET accepted that the employer’s reasons for introducing the pay protection scheme amounted to a legitimate objective.  So, the ET had taken into account the ‘soft landing’ reason for the pay protection scheme.  Moreover, the ET held that the reasons were not, in themselves, tainted by sex. However, excluding the women from the scheme, when they too should have been in receipt of the same enhanced pay as the men was discriminatory.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The ET’s task was then to consider whether the means Redcar had adopted of achieving its legitimate objective (which means had entailed excluding the women) were appropriate and necessary to achieve that objective.  Or, in the language of Lord Nicholls in <span style="font-style:italic">Barry</span>, whether the ground relied on for justification (the legitimate objective) was sufficiently important for the court to regard it as overriding the effect of the discriminatory treatment of the women.  The ET considered various factors. It mentioned that in <span style="font-style:italic">Snoxell</span> the red-circling had been permanent but here the pay protection advantage was only temporary. That was a point in favour of the employer; the discrimination would only last for three years and was reducing.  It observed that the class of those receiving pay protection was closed; no one was to be admitted after 1 April 2004. That was also a point in favour of the employer; the advantaged group was limited to existing employees.  On the other hand, it noted that the pay protection scheme had been the subject of negotiation with the representatives of the comparators but there was no evidence that the views of the women had been taken into account.  The ET was of the view that Redcar has simply not applied its mind to the discriminatory effect of the exclusion of the women claimants from pay protection. Even after the event, no evidence had been given as to why the women could not have been included in the scheme.  No evidence had been given as to the likely cost of including the women claimants.  The ET considered that the circumstances were not at all like those in <span style="font-style:italic">Cross v British Airways</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">plc</span> [2005] IRLR 726 CA where cogent reasons, including economic costings, had been provided. The ET would have been willing to take the cost of including the women into account as relevant but they had been given no evidence.  It should be noted that the ET did not specifically mention that the employer was aware at the time when it implemented the pay protection scheme that a number of claimants were alleging that they were entitled to the same pay as the men who were going to receive pay protection and that, in respect of at least some of those women, the employer had no defence to the claims.   However, the ET was clearly aware of that factor and must be taken to have had it in mind when it commented, adversely, that the employer had not applied its mind to the discriminatory effect of excluding the women from the scheme.  </p>

The ECJ decided, exceptionally, that pension providers were to be given a specific period in which to alter their rules so as to be compliant with article 119.  That exceptional course was taken because of the particular difficulties which would be caused to the pensions industry if the usual rule applied, namely that the decision of the court was declaratory of what the law had been since the relevant provision had come into force.

That was because <span style="font-style:italic">Smith v Avdel</span> was concerned with direct discrimination which had been recognised and was being corrected.  Once direct discrimination had been recognised, it had to be corrected immediately (or in a pensions case by 17 May 1990) and completely.  Any continuation of direct discrimination could not be possibly be justified. However, Lord Lester submitted that the position was different where the discrimination in question was indirect. Indirect discrimination can sometimes be justified. Therefore there was no absolute bar to transitional arrangements in cases of indirect discrimination.  </p>

We accept that <span style="font-style:italic">Smith v Avdel</span> was a case of direct discrimination and that the present case is not; therefore the two are not on all fours.  We accept that the hard and fast rule which the ECJ laid down for the correction of recognised direct discrimination (it must be full and immediate) does not apply to a case of indirect discrimination. That is because there is always a possibility that indirect discrimination can be objectively justified. So the strict rule as set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Smith v Avdel, </span>that all transitional arrangements in a move to eliminate discrimination are unlawful, does not apply in cases of indirect discrimination. </p>

That is because he must do his best to comply with the fundamental principle of equal pay, which applies to the eradication of indirect as well as direct discrimination.  Where an employer is reorganising his pay structures and there is no reason to think that the old arrangements were directly or indirectly discriminatory, he will be entitled to bring in the new arrangements by transitional provisions.  And, if it should later transpire that the old arrangements had been indirectly discriminatory and that the new arrangements are tainted by that historic discrimination, it will be easier for him to justify that discrimination by reference to his other reasons for wanting to reorganise the structures.  There will, of course, be many gradations of knowledge between, on the one hand, knowing that the old arrangements were and the new ones will still be discriminatory and, on the other hand, having no reason to think that they might have been.  In such intermediate positions, the employer’s knowledge of the circumstances will be relevant to the issue of justification.</p>

As we have said, the ET did not explain how it applied <span style="font-style:italic">Smith v Avdel </span>and to that extent its decision is open to criticism.  However, the facts of the Redcar case show that the employer knew that one of the important purposes of the Green Book scheme was the elimination of past discriminatory pay practices.  It knew that it had been discriminating against at least some of the White Book women claimants. It knew that, under the new arrangements, the bonuses and allowances which had given rise to the past discrimination were being abolished and that that was why the men who had been receiving them were being given pay protection. The employer must or should have realised that the women, who had been discriminated against in the past, were going to be discriminated against under the new scheme by being excluded from pay protection. Yet, as the ET found, there was no evidence that they had applied their minds to this problem or had made any attempt to avoid or even reduce the discrimination.  They had not even attempted to cost the inclusion of the women.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We can deal with that submission quite shortly in view of what we have already said in respect of the Redcar case. The only difference between the facts of the Redcar and Middlesbrough cases was that Middlesbrough had not conceded any equal pay claims before its changeover day as Redcar had; many claims had been brought before changeover but all had been fought and the tribunal’s decision was awaited.  Redcar knew for certain that it had been discriminating in the past and Middlesbrough did not.  However, that difference, which related to a question of knowledge, was irrelevant to the issue of whether the pay differential was tainted by sex.  The test for that is entirely objective.  Thus, the fact that Middlesbrough might have honestly believed that it had a complete defence to all the White Book claims makes no difference to the question of whether the post-changeover pay differential (exclusion from pay protection) was <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> discriminatory. It seems to us that it clearly was for exactly the same reasons as applied in the Redcar case. The immediate reason for the differential was that the male comparators were receiving pay protection and the women claimants were not.  The men were receiving it because they suffered a drop in pay on changeover day and the women did not.  The underlying reason why the women did not suffer a drop in pay was because they had not previously been paid the wages they were entitled to; they had been discriminated against. If they had been paid their wage entitlement, they too would have suffered a drop in pay and would have been entitled to pay protection.  Thus the current pay differential was rooted in past sex discrimination.  For that reason, the contention in the respondent’s notice must fail. Middlesbrough has to justify its arrangements; accordingly there is no need for us to decide Mr Allen’s contention on whether the statistics demonstrated disparate adverse impact.</p>

In that case, the MOD sought to eradicate sex discrimination in pay before the 1970 Act came into force in 1975. Women drivers, who had previously been in pay band 6, (and were therefore advantaged) were put into band 4 with all male drivers.  They objected and, by a negotiated agreement in 1977 (in which it was restated that the correct band for all drivers was band 4), the women who had been employed at changeover, were allowed to receive band 6 pay for as long as their employment continued. In effect, their old advantaged pay was protected.  A group of men complained to an industrial tribunal that they were receiving less than these women for like work and, before the tribunal, the employer’s section 1(3) defence failed.  The tribunal held that the reason for the difference was the difference of sex.  The EAT upheld that decision and the MOD appealed.  The Court of Appeal (Lord Denning MR, Waller and Dunn LJJ) allowed the appeal, holding that the employers had shown that the difference in pay was genuinely due to a material difference, other than the difference of sex. The Court said that the reason for the pay differential was not the difference of sex, but was because the employer had given the women a personal advantage as part of its attempt to eliminate the earlier sex discrimination. </p>

The ET rejected his submission. In particular, the ET held that it made no real difference that Redcar had conceded liability in some cases before Green Book implementation whereas Middlesbrough had fought them all.  The ET observed that Middlesbrough had received a lot of pre-changeover claims and must have known that there would be more.  At the time of bringing the pay protection scheme into operation, the hearing of the White Book claimants had taken place and Middlesbrough must have known that, even though it had defended the claims, there was a real risk that some of the women were going to succeed.  It knew what had happened in the Redcar White book claims.  The ET also noted that, as with the Redcar case, there was ‘little if any’ evidence that Middlesbrough had ever calculated the cost of providing protected pay for the known claimants who might win. The ET thought that it would not have been difficult to do so by identifying the possible claimant groups. But that had not been done at the time; moreover, Mr Jeans had not told the ET whether any such costing had been carried out subsequently. </p>

Although it accepted that a period of protection of previously discriminatory pay, limited in time in order to phase it out, would be a legitimate aim, it had not been shown that this scheme was an appropriate and proportionate means of achieving that objective, when the size of the disadvantaged group and the cost of including or excluding that group had not been calculated.

First, he submitted that the EAT had not been entitled to interfere with the ET’s conclusion. The ET had directed itself properly and was entitled to form the view it had on the basis of the evidence before it.

In so far as that passage suggests that an employer’s knowledge that he is discriminating is relevant to the question of whether he <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> discriminating, we think the EAT was wrong.  Whether an employer’s arrangements discriminate against women either directly or indirectly is a question of fact and it is to be determined objectively. Whether or not the employer knew or realised that he was discriminating is irrelevant, as is the question of whether he intended to discriminate.

Although we accept that the distinction is not without significance, we do not think too much should turn on such a distinction. As we said earlier, there will be gradations of knowledge ranging from actual knowledge at one end of the scale to complete and genuine ignorance at the other. However, we think it would be most unattractive if an employer who turned a blind eye to the potential discriminatory effect of his arrangements were to be in a better position on justification than one who investigated the position thoroughly and realised that the arrangements were indeed discriminatory.  Such a distinction would put a premium on a failure to monitor pay arrangements and properly to investigate an allegation of pay discrimination when first made.    </p>

We have in mind the passage at paragraph 163 of the EAT’s decision where it said that justification might be possible if the employer showed a ‘carefully crafted and costed scheme negotiated …. without any reason to suppose that, when implemented, it would have  discriminatory effects.” However, instead of referring back in that way, the EAT gave an affirmative answer to its general question apparently based upon the facts of this particular case, as the EAT saw them.

She is being denied a payment which was contingent on the employee receiving the higher pay at the material time, which she was not doing. ….  That adversely impacted on these women but we see no reason in principle why such adverse impact should not be capable in an appropriate case of constituting a justification for the difference in treatment.

The first four sentences of that passage comprise a summary of the way in which the EAT saw the facts of this case.  But it could not follow ‘accordingly’ that the withholding of protected pay does not inevitably involve a failure to give effect to Article 141.  The two are unrelated.  We have no difficulty with the proposition that there may be circumstances in which an employer could justify denying a woman a benefit (pay protection) that she would have had if he had paid her equal pay when he ought to have done.  We think the way the EAT in Redcar described the kind of circumstances in which justification could be made out was probably as good a way as any of putting it.  We also note in passing that the EAT’s description of the facts as it saw them went beyond and was not wholly consistent with the ET’s findings of fact.  The ET had not made any finding of fact as to whether the employer was knowingly or deliberately dragging its heels in failing to implement pay rises which it knew were due to the women.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At paragraph 104, the EAT said that it found the arguments on justification very finely balanced.  It had to consider whether the employers’ reasons for excluding the women from pay protection were a proportionate means of attaining a legitimate objective (the <span style="font-style:italic">Barry/Cadman</span> test).   First, it considered whether the difference in treatment constituted the pursuit of a legitimate aim.  The EAT observed that it was ‘a legitimate objective to protect the salary stream and to distinguish between two employees on that basis’.   The ET had thought the same. The EAT also considered that it was legitimate to have as an objective the introduction of a job evaluation scheme which would eliminate discriminatory pay for the future. If the scheme would be undermined by extending it to these women, that was a highly relevant consideration, potentially constituting justification.  As we understand it, Mr Allen does not quarrel with that and, in any event, we think the EAT was right on that point.           </p>

Here it differed in its view from that of the ET.  It accepted Middlesbrough’s submission that it was impossible to know precisely what the discriminatory effect would be of not including these female employees in the pay protection scheme. It was, said the EAT, impossible and would usually be impossible to predict in advance the potential liability in equal pay claims. The employer would not know how many claims there would be; nor would he be able to predict the prospects of success. So, assessment of the likely discriminatory effect of a decision to exclude the successful ones from pay protection would be speculative. The EAT accepted Middlesbrough’s submission that, if the Council had attempted to estimate the cost of including the women who could be expected to establish their claims, it would have been likely to make a conservative estimate and might well therefore have offered too little to the staff who were known to be about to suffer a pay drop. The effect might have been that the offer would not have been sufficiently attractive to secure agreement and the scheme might have failed completely. </p>

Unless the pay was actually being received, there was nothing to protect. We think that is itself sufficient justification, but it is reinforced by the fact that the need to reach a protected pay arrangement, with the agreement of the unions was crucial to the making of the job evaluation scheme.

We do not think it can be right to take that essential evaluation away from tribunals.  Moreover, we cannot accept that the answer will always be as the EAT thinks. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is apparent that the EAT in the Middlesbrough case was sympathetic to the position of an employer who, on finding that he has been or might have been discriminating against women seeks to reorganise his pay structure so as to avoid discrimination in the future.  The EAT recognises that employers (or at least public employers such as these local authorities) will have a limited budget and many calls upon their resources.  The argument accepted by the EAT in the Middlesbrough case is that in such circumstances, the employer will always be entitled to say that it must continue to discriminate against the women for another three or four years (albeit to a reducing extent) because it cannot afford to bring them into line with the men at the time of reorganisation. We find that a very surprising and undesirable general conclusion.  We accept that a large public employer might be able to demonstrate that the constraints on its finances were so pressing that it could not do other than it did and that it was justified in putting the need to cushion the men’s pay reduction ahead of the need to bring the women up to parity with the men. But we do not accept that that result should be a foregone conclusion.  The employer must be put to proof that what he had done was objectively justified in the individual case.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A significant part of Mr Jeans’ submission to this Court was concerned with the difficulties faced by local authorities with large workforces.  His submissions began from the premise that the authorities were not in any way to blame where the pay of women employees had fallen behind the men’s in a discriminatory way.  It was unrealistic to expect the authorities to be able to prevent such inequalities arising.  So, in cases of this kind, he submitted, that was where they were starting from.  “We are where we are”.  Authorities such as Middlesbrough were having a very difficult time because large numbers of equal pay claims were cascading down upon them.  At times, in the submissions of both Mr Cavanagh and Mr Jeans, it appeared that the authorities’ stance was that they were under a duty to get rid of sex discrimination in pay only when claims were made and the inequality of pay had been demonstrated to them.  In short, they only had to ensure equal pay in response to a successful claim. The EAT appears to have been sympathetic to those submissions.  But, as Mr Allen pointed out, equal pay legislation came into force in 1975 and, at that time, employers had been given 5 years in which to reorganise their pay structures so as to get rid of sex discrimination in pay.  Mr Allen submitted, and we accept, that an employer’s duty since then has been to ensure that there was no sliding back into discrimination. Employers have been and are under a continuing duty to avoid sex discrimination in pay, regardless of whether their female employees seek to assert their rights by litigation.</p>

We do not think that such a situation is consistent with the provisions of the 1970 Act which have now been in force for over 30 years.  We consider that it will be possible for an employer to justify the continuance of indirect sex discrimination through the discriminatory application of a pay protection scheme but not as a matter of course and only where the employer satisfies the test of justification as set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Barry/Cadman.</span></p>

There might be found in it a non-discriminatory explanation for the difference between, for example, the pay of clerical workers and of manual workers and the presence or absence of bonus arrangements.

The EAT had wrongly held that the fact that certain White Book workers had succeeded in equal pay claims, using White Book colleagues as comparators, precluded Middlesbrough’s reliance, in claims made by Purple Book workers using White Book workers as comparators, on the fact that Purple Book terms are separately negotiated. He stressed that the situations of the White Book and Purple Book workers are different. Bonuses were not in contemplation in clerical jobs, whereas the White Book contains an exhortation to consider such schemes, which broadly reflect the differences between the nature of manual and clerical jobs.

We do, however, agree with Mr Allen that, although Middlesbrough’s submissions do not group its numerous criticisms of the ET decision under the head of perversity, the essential question on this appeal is whether the ET arrived at a perverse and inadequately reasoned conclusion in making an inference that the separate collective bargaining was tainted by sex and therefore not available as a material justifying factor under section 1(3). </p>

In our judgment, the critical facts are that (a) predominantly male work groups had been paid bonuses; (b) predominantly female work groups had not been paid bonuses; and (c) there had been an earlier finding as between White Book female claimants and White Book male claimants that the men’s bonus arrangements were not explained or justified by productivity considerations. Whilst we do not agree with Mr Allen that the gender disparity between the claimants work groups and the comparators work groups <span style="font-style:italic">inevitably</span> leads to an inference of sex taint, any more than does the earlier finding in relation to bonus payments, those factors were material available to the ET, from which it was entitled to infer that there was a sex-taint in the separate collective bargaining history as between the groups and therefore in the difference in pay.     </p>

The point was first pleaded in an amended generic notice of appearance, dated 15 June 2005, where it was said first, that the First Multiple claimants, who had already succeeded in their claims based on work RAE with White Book men and had received back pay and interest as ordered by the ET for those claims, were barred from pursuing an equal value claim in respect of the same (pre-April 2004) period. Redcar would argue that <span style="font-style:italic">res judicata</span> and election would prevent them seeking to recover greater sums by means of an equal value claim.  The second point pleaded related to former Purple Book claimants who had failed to establish a claim to equal pay for the pre-changeover period relying on their new grading under the Green Book JES.  (This was the backdating or retroactive effect point.)  Redcar pleaded that, having failed in that first claim, they could not pursue a second claim based on equal value in respect of that period.

The amount of the underpayment was the difference between (a) the amount already paid by Redcar for the relevant period and (b) the amount that ought to have been paid under the pay term, treated as modified or included by the equality clause and calculated by reference to the pay of the comparator. The First Multiple claimants have been paid that amount in satisfaction of the ET’s judgment. Having obtained an order from the ET to that effect, those claimants were not entitled to go back to the ET and ask for more pay for the same period. In other words, the operation of the equality clause upon the express contractual term for pay can lead to only one outcome.

Properly analysed there is only one relevant promise in the pay term included in the employment contract, as modified by the inserted equality clause. That is the promise to pay. Redcar is alleged to have broken it in the period up to 1 April 2004. The claimants’ equal value claims, which they now wish to pursue, rely on the same breach of that single promise to pay as was relied on by them in their RAE claims for that period. The fact that claims for which judgment was obtained were based on RAE, whereas the claims which they wish to pursue for a second judgment are based on equal value does not alter the position. The equal value claims and the RAE claims are only different ways of putting the same cause of action for equal pay based on breach of the modified contractual term relating to pay.                     </p>

The claimants’ application included both RAE claims and equal value claims. The application identified a number of male comparators. Apart from the many White Book claimants who were seeking to establish RAE claims on comparison with White Book comparators, some former Purple Book claimants were seeking to establish retrospective RAE claims on comparison with Green Book male comparators and equal value claims on comparisons with those Red Book male comparators.

They relied on particular male comparators in relation to their pay prior to 1 April 2004.

It is not, in our judgment, a situation where the same breach of contract is pleaded in each case. The principle of res judicata is a procedural one; it is really a rule of evidence as the quote from the speech of Lord Guest shows. It is also rooted in public policy and in particular that it would be oppressive to allow the further action to be taken. If one looks at the case from that broad standpoint, it would in our view be unjust to impose what would effectively be a lottery on claimants, forcing them to take a chance on which case to advance. Do they choose the most favourable potential claim even if there is the greatest risk of losing, or the least favourable because perhaps it has the greatest chance of winning? We do not think that the purpose of the doctrine is to place claimants in such an invidious position.</p>

It is a breach of the same term but committed in different ways. <span style="font-weight:bold">Conquer v Boot </span>shows that you cannot seek to dissect what is in substance a single promise into a series of separate obligations and treat them all distinctly. The analysis in fact is closely linked with the principle in <span style="font-weight:bold">Henderson v Henderson. </span>All aspects of the single promise must be considered together. It would be an abuse to run the litigation in any other way. But the promise to pay the same as man A is not the same as the promise to pay the same as man B.

There is no room for further modifications for the same period of time. There may be different breaches of the obligation, but they were all breaches of the same contractual term.

As Lord Nicholls explained in <span style="font-style:italic">Capacious Investments </span>at 521B-C, the principle governs election between remedies. It applies where more than one remedy is available for the same wrong and where they are alternative and inconsistent rather than cumulative. One remedy may be based on the loss suffered by the victim. Another remedy may be based on the gain made by the wrongdoer. In such a case the claimant must make a choice between them because the two remedies are inconsistent with one another. The choice normally has to be made when judgment is given holding that liability has been established for infringement of a right or for breach of a duty and the question of remedies arises. For example, a claimant in a case for infringement of a property right or for breach of a fiduciary duty is put to his election between the remedy of damages for the loss suffered or of an account of the profits made by the wrongdoer from the infringement of the right or for breach of the duty. </p>

It is itself a substantive right for the infringement of which remedies are available in the form of awards of arrears of pay and declaratory relief by the ET in those cases in which contravention of the right has been established in one or more of the ways allowed by the 1970 Act. We do not accept Mr Cavanagh’s analysis that this is in essence a matter of obtaining remedies, involving a choice in relation to a particular level of pay and then making a claim to a further remedy for a different level of pay, which should be precluded by an irrevocable election between inconsistent remedies or outcomes relating to the same employment and the same period.</p>

The amount of the arrears of pay recovered as a result of successfully putting the equal pay claim in one way will reduce the amount recoverable as a result of successfully putting the claim in a different way.  The sum recovered by a claimant at the successful conclusion of the hearing of the first part of her claim (in this case the RAE claim) is properly to be regarded, not as satisfaction of the judgment on the claim as a whole but simply as payment for <span style="font-style:italic">that</span> part of the claim.  The second (or even third) parts of the claim remain to be tried and, if the claimant is successful in one or both, may be entitled to a ‘top up’ payment for the excess she recovers under the second or third part of her claim.  Whatever the outcome of the later parts of her claim, she cannot be deprived of what she has recovered under the first part, the RAE claim.        </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First, the claimants’ right to equal pay is the creation of statute. No cause of action would exist but for the intervention of statute. It is true that the 1970 Act uses the technique of deemed statutory modification of a contractual term or of deemed inclusion of a term in the contract of employment.  A claim for equal pay is not, however, a claim for breach of the equality clause deemed to be included in the contract. Nor is the claimants’ cause of action for breach of contract <span style="font-style:italic">simpliciter.</span> It is for “contravention of the term of the contract” which is treated as having been modified or included pursuant to the 1970 Act. The cause of action is thus governed by the provisions of the 1970 Act which impact on the contract. It does not derive from the terms of the contract itself, as agreed upon by the parties. The contract agreed upon by the parties contains a promise to pay. The parties did not agree upon a promise for equal pay. The source of the equal pay obligation is statutory. It is not what the parties themselves have agreed. Thus, contrary to Redcar’s submission, the contractual entitlement of the claimants in respect of a particular period is to pay, not to equal pay.  Without the statutory provisions there would be no right to equal pay and therefore no claim for arrears of pay accruing as the result of underpayment calculated by reference to the comparison required by the 1970 Act. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In our judgment, these equal pay claims are not like the case of a claim for breach of a single contractual promise as in <span style="font-style:italic">Conquer v Boot </span>[1928] 2 KB 336 cited by Mr Cavanagh. Although the equal pay claim is for contravention of the term of the contract, the content of the term is determined by the terms of the statute and not by agreement of the parties. The cause of action is asserted pursuant to statute. Within and by virtue of the statute there is more than one cause of action. There are three different legal bases for an equal pay claim.      </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, there is nothing mutually inconsistent in the nature of the three different legal bases for the claim for equal pay; nor is there anything in the substantive statutory provisions in the 1970 Act explicitly or implicitly confining a claimant to only one way of putting her claim. It follows that the claimants are entitled to put forward all their equal pay claims cumulatively. The different heads of claim may have different outcomes as a result of different ingredients leading to the selection of different comparators and to different evidence being adduced.</p>

The situation that has arisen in this case, and will arise in most equal pay cases, presents ETs with the need to make case management decisions rather than with an occasion for parties to invoke common law doctrines as complete answers to an equal pay claim. The ETs have the widest possible case management powers for dealing with a case justly, in ways which are proportionate to the complexity and importance of the issues and for ensuring that the case is dealt with expeditiously and fairly and so as to save expense. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Equal pay cases are amongst the most challenging to come before employment tribunals. Mr Cavanagh raised the spectre of the claimants’ ability to bring claim after claim without end, if (a) the law was that each time a different set of facts was alleged there was a different cause of action and (b) there was nothing to prevent that from happening by application of the principles of <span style="font-style:italic">res judicata</span> and election. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There are two answers to that. The first is that, in our judgment, it is not permissible to allege a new cause of action in respect of a particular pay period in another action under the same head for the same pay period simply by selecting a different comparator. For a new cause of action for the same period it would be necessary to bring the equal pay claim under a different head, which would normally involve different comparators as well. Even if that were not the case, there is the second answer which lies in firm and fair management of equal pay cases from an early stage. We appreciate that, like most advice from on high, this is easier said than done, especially at a time when the limited resources of the ETs are stretched to breaking point by the avalanche of equal pay cases against public authorities.</p>

In deciding what directions to give, ETs should bear in mind the need to avoid duplication of evidence and legal argument, and to cut down the number and length of the hearings in a way that will not unfairly prejudice the rights and interests of the parties. </p>

In order to prevent or limit successive sets of proceedings, the claimants ought to be required to bring forward the entirety of their equal pay claims for a particular period in the same set of proceedings. It is within the case management powers of the ET to require claimants to identify in their proceedings all the different ways in which they intend to put their case and the issues that arise on the claims, explaining to them that, if they have decided in one set of proceedings not to advance their claim in a particular way in respect of the relevant period, they will not normally be entitled do so later in a new set of proceedings. </p>

The EAT upheld that decision.  The claimants, who wish to claim in respect of periods going back six years from the implementation of the 2004 JES (despite it being accepted by them that the JES had not existed before 1 April 2004) appeal.

A JES falling within section 1(2)(b) of the 1970 Act is but one way in which the legislature has chosen to give force to the Article; there can be proof of “like work with a man” under section 1(2)(a), “work of equal value” as found under section 1(2)(c) (added by amendment) or “work rated as equivalent” under an appropriate JES under section 1(2)(b).  The RAE option is commonly described as “employer-led” and so it is, but so to describe the option overlooks the fact that any JES is likely, certainly in relation to a large public authority, to have involved, as it did in the Redcar case, more than one union and extensive and detailed negotiations over months, if not years.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The three separate options, as Mr Allen rightly emphasises, are not expressed as mutually exclusive in section 1(2) of the 1970 Act; in any one equal pay claim a claimant may advance any one or more of the forms of claim.  If, says Mr Allen, a claimant who succeeds in her application under a like work or equal value claim can recover, as it is accepted that she can, for up to six years prior to the date of her instituting a successful claim – section 2(5) and 2ZB – then there is no logic in a successful RAE claim being denied corresponding retroactive effect and being treated as the “odd one out” amongst the three forms of claim.  To construe the Act otherwise, say the claimants, is to deny women the very equality which Article 141 obliges Member States to confer as a fundamental right.  To confer so important a right in such a way that, in a JES case, it can only be remedied <span style="font-style:italic">prospectively</span> from the date of the equality of rating within the scheme taking effect is to fail, say the claimants, to respect the great force of the Article.  Further, say the claimants, by giving retroactive relief to RAE claims, one gives relief that would otherwise be likely to be available to claimants only by way of the expensive and time-consuming processes needed for a successful claim under the “equal value” route.  One would thus speed up and make less expensive those processes, remove them from the tribunals and put them instead into the more suitable JES domain of unions’ and employers’ negotiations.  To confer retroactive effect, would reduce numerous separate equal value or like work claims by separate employees, as they could instead be joined together under RAE claims which can conveniently embrace many claimants by way of multiple claims.  Surely, say the claimants, that is an end which the legislature is likely to have wished to achieve.  Moreover, when a claimant and his or her comparator are RAE, then it has to be taken, say the claimants, that the jobs have been of equal value as, they say, section 1(2)(b) and section 1(5) were plainly intended as a means of securing compliance with Article 141 (and its predecessor).  </p>

Section 1(2)(b) spoke of when the woman “is” employed on work rated as equivalent; section 1(2)(b)(i) spoke of the case where a term of the woman’s contract determined by the rating “is or becomes” less favourable to the woman.  Nowhere is there an alternative such as “or has been”.  The tribunal noted also that the claimants concerned were not left without a remedy in respect of periods before 1 April 2004 if they truly had an RAE case with respect to such earlier period; if, having been themselves within the earlier White Book, they could find, with respect to a period before 1 April 2004, some male comparator rated as equal with them under the White Book but who had been receiving better pay or more favourable terms, then they would, of course, be able to raise RAE claims with respect to that earlier period.  Equally, if they could not find any such comparator by relying upon equal rating, they were free, if they could mount a case on the facts, to claim that, before 1 April 2004, they were doing work which was like work to, or of equal value to, their more favourably treated comparators.  All in all, the ET held the arguments against retroactive effect to be overwhelming. </p>

However, in argument, the case came up of whether a woman whose work had been rated as equivalent with a selected comparator under the Green Book could recover in respect of a period before 1 April 2004 when, during that earlier period, both she and her comparator had been rated under the White Book but had not been then rated as equivalent.  The claimants had conceded that such a claim could not be mounted as an RAE claim for the earlier period.  Redcar pointed to the highly unsatisfactory consequences if such a concession were not made; persons RAE under a later scheme would be able later to insist on their being retrospectively treated as equal during a earlier period during which, under the earlier non-discriminatory JES, they had in fact been rated as unequal.  The claimants also accepted that <span style="font-style:italic">Sim Chem</span> (supra) established that JES rulings do not come into force until the JES is agreed but they argued that that did not preclude them being given retrospective effect once they had been agreed.  </p>

Whereas it can be said that someone who is found to have been employed on like work or work of equal value was so employed at earlier periods (on the assumption that the jobs had not changed), it is an impossible construction to say that someone whose job was rated as equivalent with her comparator under a job evaluation scheme from a particular date, was so rated prior to that date.

The EAT explained why that was so; when the respective point scores of various jobs emerge from negotiations and evaluations in the course of preparation for a JES, the employer can then, depending on his policy, divide the jobs into broad bands or brackets covering wide differences in scores or into narrow bands covering differences of very few points.  It will often be convenient to have broad bands in order to achieve a simplified pay structure; Mr Cavanagh told us that Redcar had bands 50 points wide.  But, if the employer does use broad bands, the likelihood is that he will be covering, within any given band, jobs which, having attained different scores, would, had equal value been the issue, have found themselves unequal.  The EAT pointed out that, if the claimants’ argument was right, it would encourage employers to adopt very narrow grade bands in order to limit the potential effect of retroactive claims.  The employer, held the EAT, must be allowed to contend that, whereas he had been willing to treat the two jobs as RAE as from a particular date for the purposes of his job evaluation scheme, he had not thereby accepted that they either then were, or earlier had been, of equal value.</p>

Grade 4 in the employers’ JES in that case embraced employees who had scored from 410 to 449 points in the evaluation.  The claimant employee had scored 410 points, yet she was denied Grade 4.  She asserted inequality under section 2(1)(b) as compared with a Grade 4 man who had scored 428.  The employers had attempted to say that the two jobs, different in several respects, had not been rated as equivalent under a JES because of the marked difference in their respective scores.  However, by a majority, the Industrial Tribunal held that the two jobs had been RAE within the particular broad band approach that had been used and hence the claimant succeeded.  The </span>EAT <span style="font-family:Arial">upheld the decision.  If the grade boundaries had been differently fixed, the jobs would not necessarily have been treated as equivalent but, under the boundaries chosen, the jobs were RAE, both falling within the scores appropriate to the Grade 4.  The case suggests that an RAE is not necessarily a determination that the jobs have equal value, still less that they would be or had been found to have equal value under the system of judicial determination of equal value under section 1(2)(c) of the 1970 Act.  </span></p>

In fact, each of the three cases is treated identically.  Under whichever heading a claimant has applied, she is, if successful, entitled to recover in respect of such parts of the past period of up to six years before she instituted her claim in relation to which the type of equality which she has successfully asserted is either proved or conceded to have existed.  Thus if, in year 10, she institutes a claim, later upheld in year 12, which is based upon “like work” being proved as between her job and that of her comparator under section 1(2)(a) as at year 10, she will be able, looking to the 6 years prior to the institution of her claim, to recover for the inequality over such parts of years 4 to 10 and also of years 11 and 12 during which she can demonstrate that the condition which she has asserted – “like work” – obtained.  So also, correspondingly, as to a claim raised under section 1(2)(c) – equal value – but so also, again, if, in year 10, she is able correspondingly to establish, as to periods even prior to the institution of her claims, that the assertion upon which she has relied -  that she and her comparator were RAE under one and the same JES – was made good. </p>

Some 750 grievances were received by Redcar by 8 February 2005.  In some 20 to 30 cases the form sent contained no identifying address, job or employee reference number.  The grievances, which all included equal pay as a grievance but included other subjects as well, were sent together with a covering letter from the solicitor, Mr Cross, who was acting for the complainant in each case.  We will need to refer later to the terms upon which Mr Cross was so acting. The statutory procedure continues:</p>

Second, the staff available at Redcar were already heavily engaged in dealing with other aspects of the Equal Pay litigation which had begun as early as 27 July 2003, well before any grievance here in issue had been lodged.  By 8 December 2004, there had already been three hearings and three judgments.  Third, Redcar relied on what the ET called a “practicality” reason.  Those who had lodged grievances worked all over the borough, some working short hours, and the difficulties of arranging meetings within working hours, the possible interruption of care services during working hours and the possibility of a query as to whether they should be paid for attending grievance meetings during working hours were  all regarded by Redcar as reasons which made the convening of meetings impracticable.  </p>

There were substantive points of law in the litigation; the Council could not be expected realistically to reply on an individual basis or until the outcome of the litigation was known.  Furthermore, there had been a determined attempt to mediate collectively with Mr Cross in July/August 2004.  Mr David Bean QC, as he then was, had been appointed; meetings had taken place but they were ultimately unsuccessful.  The parties were too far apart.  It was thus reasonable to expect that there was no prospect of settling any grievances with a claimant who was represented by Mr Cross.  In the latter connection, Ms Kavanagh introduced into her oral evidence to the Tribunal the first version of Mr Cross’s CFA terms which have been referred to above.  This is an interesting document.

That would be to present the claimants with a wholly unjustified windfall.  We do not however consider that it would be just and equitable to award no increase because there has been a blatant failure to follow the statutory grievance procedure which was able to be followed, for example, in the South Lanarkshire cases.  Taking all the factors and circumstances into account we considered that if, contrary to our contentions about Regulation 10, there was a breach by the respondents of section 31(3) it would be just and equitable to restrict the increase to 5%.”</span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It had held that the surrounding circumstances were, indeed, exceptional (as section 31(4) requires) so that it was open to the ET, if it chose, to make no increase at all but it declined to do so because, as the sole reason expressly given, of the “blatancy” of Redcar’s failure.  In describing the failure to follow the statutory grievance procedure as “blatant”, the ET used a word which, in this context, suggests that it was not only conspicuous but unashamed, in the sense that it was decided upon and persisted in despite a consciousness that it was wrong.  That the decision was conspicuous was hardly a fault; it would have been wrong of the Council to have hidden it from its employees or their solicitor.  But a finding that it was unashamed in the sense explained seems to have been without any support in the evidence; the ET had held that the Council had had reasons, which it explained in evidence, for its decision not to hold a meeting and nowhere did the ET hold that there was any consciousness in Redcar that it was doing wrong in so deciding or in its persistence in the decision.  The ET had specifically rejected that Redcar had not acted in good faith or had had any improper motive.  The ET made no finding that either the employees or their solicitor had complained about the failure to convene meetings nor did the claimants’ oral or written arguments before us point to any such complaint.  The very fact, if such it was, that Mr Cross had failed to insist on the meetings or complain of their absence might suggest that he was by then more looking to a prospect of windfalls for his claimants than for meetings.  Moreover, it was particularly harsh to speak of any “blatancy” in Redcar’s decision given that the ET, even assisted by full argument, had taken the view, albeit wrongly, that the statutory grievance procedure had not even been applicable. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">If, as in our view is the case, there was no relevant “blatancy”, then the ET’s rejection of there being no uplift and their choice, instead, of an uplift of 5% is left unsupported by any acceptable reason.  Hence it was an error of law.  Moreover, having accepted in terms that there was “considerable force in [Redcar’s] pointlessness argument”, they failed, as far as one can tell, to have that in mind save in their rejecting an increase of “more than 10%”.  To judge from the reasons expressed, the ET had failed to take that into account as a factor which could lead to it being just and equitable to award no increase at all.  A consideration of what is “just and equitable”, which is what section 31(4) invites, requires a consideration of all relevant surrounding circumstances.  Although, in an overall assessment, one factor may, of course, tip the balance one way or another, the ET’s concentration on “blatancy”  as the reason for rejecting a zero uplift, quite apart from being in any event misplaced, seems to have been part not of a consideration of all relevant circumstances, but of a focus upon one to the exclusion of the many others.  We thus agree with the EAT’s analysis that the ET had, in effect, wrongly directed itself on the meaning of “just and equitable”.  We hold that the ET’s decision on uplift was in error of law.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">That being so, it was properly open to the EAT to substitute its own figure for the 5% which the lower Tribunal had settled on.  Once one gets that far it is not possible to find any error of law in the EAT’s conclusion that the appropriate answer was that there should be no uplift.  Mr Allen argues that one of section 31’s purposes is penal.  At the higher percentages – up to 50% - of increase or decrease that may be so, but we see its primary purpose as being to add a form of incentive to encourage parties to engage in negotiations to attempt to settle their differences without their incurring the expense and delay of litigation or of further litigation.  But even if the section’s purpose were to be penal, the punishment would need to meet the “offence”.  As we have found no error of law in the EAT’s award of no uplift it would not be open to us to alter its award, but we would go further.  The ET held – see paragraph 298 above – that there had been a determined attempt to mediate which had failed because the parties were too far apart.  There was no prospect, it held, of settling any grievances with Mr Cross’s claimants.  In those circumstances the meetings which, in order to comply with the required procedure, should have been held, would have been, as Mr Cavanagh’s metaphor rightly described them, merely a ritual dance.  Although there was an “offence”, in all the circumstances we, like the EAT, see it to be one that merited no punishment.</p>

There was no error of law in the EAT’s decision to award no uplift. Thus the uplift of 5% is not restored.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">That is the entirety of the provisions that have been agreed.  What the court has received in addition to the agreed parts of the order are applications for permission to appeal various issues to the House of Lords.  The court has received lengthy written submissions on behalf of Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council in support of an application for permission to appeal to the House of Lords, principally on the question of pay protection as a defence to the equal pay claims that have been made in these cases.  It is said that that the general importance of the pay protection issue is indicated by the fact that the Equality and Human Rights Commission intervened in the appeal.  It is submitted that the court’s ruling on this issue is of the greatest possible practical significance to all concerned in and affected by the implementation of single status in local government.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">The sums involved in these proceedings are very large indeed.  The written submissions set out examples of the practical problems to which the judgment of this court is said to give rise.  It is said that in the Employment Appeal Tribunal, from which these appeals were brought, the lay members recognised the practical difficulties that will face employers who seek, in good faith, to manage themselves out of historic discrimination in matters of pay.  It is said that, in addition to the practical issue which the judgment gives rise to in the public sector, the legal issues dealt with in the part of the judgment relating to pay protection are of the greatest importance to the law of equal pay generally as they relate to fundamental issues of principle.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">The Council also wish to take to the House of Lords the issue that is described in the judgment as <span style="font-style:italic">res judicata</span>.  It is pointed out that, as the judgment noted, this issue gives rise to a novel question of law.  It is submitted by the Council that the issue gives rise to very important questions as to the jurisprudential basis for equal pay claims and the relationship between the three types of claim; namely like work, equivalent work, and work of equal value.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">It is also submitted that the issue is of great practical significance.  It raises the possibility of lengthy, rated as equivalent claims being followed by even lengthier and more onerous and costly equal-value claims relating to the same pay period.  This will happen in practice.  It is said the court itself acknowledged that higher court’s advice about: “Robust case management is easier said than done.”  This is not a difficulty, it is submitted, that can be resolved by case management alone.  There are then set out the legal arguments as to why, at this point, these are of sufficient arguability to justify permission to go to the House of Lords.</p>

They seek permission to appeal on the issue described in the judgment as "retroactive effect".  The Council agrees that this issue is of general public importance; however, the Council goes on to submit that the claimants do not have a sufficiently arguable case on this issue to justify an appeal to the House of Lords.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">The court has also received submissions from the Middlesbrough Borough Council seeking permission to appeal to the House of Lords on the pay protection issue in their case.  They submit that this is a matter of general public importance, as is acknowledged in the judgment itself.  Of all the issues in this complex litigation, pay protection is the most important, because its resolution will affect the outcome of the thousands of equal pay claims which are pending in the Employment Tribunals, principally against local authorities and NHS Trusts.  These claims will extend further so as to affect the way in which all employers, employees and trade unions approach equal pay in general, and in particular, job evaluation exercises and consequential changes to pay and grading structures.</p>

It does not dispute the public importance of the issues which are raised in this case which, in my experience, are the most complex employment issues ever to have been considered by this court.

It is really now for their Lordships to decide how much of this litigation should take up their time and how much should be resolved by other means.  The court therefore refuses permission to appeal to the House of Lords on any of these issues without in any way diminishing the extreme public importance of them.</p>

There will be an extension of time until 30 September 2008 for the presentation of the petition to the House of Lords for leave to appeal.</p>
