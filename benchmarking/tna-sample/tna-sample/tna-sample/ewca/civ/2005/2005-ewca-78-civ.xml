	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">By its decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Kleinwort Benson v. Lincoln City Council </span>[1999] 2 AC 349 (“<span style="font-style:italic">Kleinwort Benson</span>”) the House of Lords abrogated the common law rule that no restitutionary claim lies in respect of money paid under a mistake of law, holding that the claimant bank was entitled to a restitutionary remedy in respect of sums paid to a local authority under an illegal transaction.   The instant appeal raises a question of general importance as to the scope of the principle established by that decision.   The question is whether the principle applies where the payment in question is a payment to the revenue on account of a supposed liability to tax (in the instant case, advance corporation tax (“ACT”)).    The appellants on this appeal contend that it does not apply to such a payment, given (a) that statute provides for the recovery of tax overpaid by error or mistake in certain, albeit limited, circumstances (the statutory provision relating to overpayments of ACT is to be found in section 33 of the Taxes Management Act 1970 (“TMA”)); and (b) that, as the House of Lords held in <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich Equitable Building Society v. Inland Revenue Commissioners </span>[1993] AC 70 (“<span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span>”), a party who has made a payment to the revenue pursuant to an unlawful demand is entitled as of right to a restitutionary remedy, regardless of whether in making the payment the payer was acting under any mistake of law.</p>

Since, in the event, the claimants had set off the sums paid by way of ACT against their subsequent liability for ‘mainstream’ corporation tax (as they were entitled to do under the provisions in question) they did not seek recovery of the sums paid; rather, they sought compensation to reflect the fact that the sums in question had been paid prematurely.   </p>

The limitation issues so raised, which (as will become apparent) are of some considerable complexity, were the only issues which, pursuant to the group litigation order, fell to be decided by the judge in the instant case.    He resolved those issues in favour of DMG, holding that none of the three payments in question was statute-barred.   He entered judgment for DMG accordingly.

First, the appellants accept that the 1993 payment and the 1995 payment (but not the 1996 payment) were made by DMG under a mistake of law, although there is an issue (the mistake of law issue) as to the precise nature of the mistake.    As will be seen in due course, the judge held that, notwithstanding the decision of the ECJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Metallgesellschaft, </span>the ACT in question was due when it was paid, and that DMG’s mistake lay in its erroneous belief that it was not open to it to make a group income election.     The appellants support that conclusion, submitting that a mistake of that nature cannot on any basis found an entitlement to a restitutionary remedy at common law.   DMG, on the other hand, contends that its mistake lay in its erroneous belief that the statutory regime was lawful under Community law. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, the appellants accept that to the extent that the payments in question were made under a mistake of law (whatever the nature of that mistake), the losses in respect of which DMG seeks compensation were caused by that mistake.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in">“6.<marker name="tab"/>At the times with which this case is concerned the general rule of United Kingdom tax law was that, if a company resident in the United Kingdom paid a dividend, it had to pay ACT to the revenue: ICTA s.14. The rate of ACT varied over the years.  At the times with which the present case is concerned it was normally 25% of the dividend.  In the usual case the amount so paid could be set off against the company’s normal liability to pay corporation tax on its profits, sometimes referred to as mainstream corporation tax or (as in this judgment) MCT.  Where the ACT was so set off the payment of it did not cause the company to suffer an absolute loss of the money, because the set-off reduced on a pound for pound basis a later payment of MCT which the company would otherwise have had to make anyway.  However, it did have the effect that the company had to pay some of its corporation tax bill early, so the ACT meant that the company suffered a timing disadvantage and the United Kingdom Revenue received a corresponding timing advantage.  (There could be cases where a subsidiary had paid ACT and could not set it off against MCT.  In such cases the ACT payment did represent an absolute loss of the money and not just a timing disadvantage.  However, in the case of DMG all the relevant ACT payments were eventually set off against MCT, so that the disadvantage for which DMG seeks relief is a timing disadvantage only.) </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">7.<marker name="tab"/><marker name="tab"/>There was an exception to the rule that a company which paid a dividend had to pay ACT.  If it was a subsidiary of a United Kingdom holding company the two companies could jointly make a group income election under section 247 of ICTA.  The effect was that the subsidiary did not have to pay the ACT after all.  It did still have to pay its full MCT when the due date came round, but the group income election removed the timing disadvantage.  However, if the dividend-paying company was a subsidiary of a non-United Kingdom holding company the two companies could not make a group income election, so the subsidiary had to pay ACT and suffer the timing disadvantage, in circumstances where a subsidiary of a United Kingdom holding company, if it and its parent had made a group income election, did not.  That was the feature of United Kingdom law which, in [<span style="font-style:italic">Metallgesellschaft</span>], the CJEC held to have been contrary to EC law and also to entitle the companies which had suffered from it to claim compensation or restitution.  Where, as in this case and as in the case of the [groups of companies involved in <span style="font-style:italic">Metallgesellschaft</span>], the ACT had been set off against MCT, the compensation or restitution would be an amount calculated by reference to interest over the period from the payment of the ACT until it was set off against MCT….”</p>

The German holding company was DBAG.  It was not the simple 100% owner of DMG.  Instead it owned 14% of the shares in DMG directly.  It owned all of the shares in DBI, an interposed United Kingdom holding company, and DBI owned the other 86% of the shares in DMG.  ….</p>

A group income election could have been made between DMG and DBI (because both companies were resident in the United Kingdom), but no such election was made.  The reason was that, although an election would have enabled dividends to flow from DMG to DBI without ACT, onward dividends from DBI to DBAG would have had to be paid subject to a liability on the part of DBI to pay ACT: or at least that was how the matter appeared on the terms of the domestic United Kingdom legislation.  In the circumstances DMG paid ACT by reference to all its dividends – the 86% of them paid to DBI as well as the 14% of them paid to DBAG – and DBI did not pay ACT when it paid onward dividends to DBAG.  DBI did not have to pay ACT on those onward dividends because of the rules about franked investment income in ICTA ss.238 and 241.  </p>

The corollary is that, because section 247 appeared clearly not to permit group income elections to which a parent company in another Member State was a party, the companies did not attempt to make group income elections.  There is no doubt that, if they had attempted to make them, the revenue would have rejected the elections and pointed to the clear terms of the United Kingdom statute [i.e. ICTA] in justification of the rejection.</p>

In the result, the ECJ ruled that the distinction was discriminatory and not capable of objective justification, and that it was accordingly contrary to article 52.    It further ruled that it was basic Community law that the right to a refund of charges levied in a Member State in breach of rules of Community law was a consequence of, and complementary to, rights conferred on individuals by that law; that the Member State was accordingly required to repay charges levied in breach of Community law; and that in the instant case the award of compensation in the form of a capital sum representing interest for the relevant period was essential in order to restore the equal treatment guaranteed by article 52, whether the claim was formulated as a claim for restitution or as a claim for damages.</p>

If it had been possible to bring legal proceedings during this period, the [claimants] would, in my view, have been entitled to interest.   It is neither logical nor just to deprive them of this entitlement merely because, in the meantime, the liability of the United Kingdom to repay the principal sum has been discharged.   In a practical sense also, the claim for interest is closer to a restitutionary rather than a compensatory claim.   The underlying sums are known and indisputable.   All that is necessary is for the national court to establish an appropriate interest rate for the relevant period.”</p>

Having regard to the answer given in the first question, the second question seeks in substance to ascertain whether, on a proper construction of art 52 of the EC Treaty, where a subsidiary resident in the member state concerned and its parent company having its seat in another member state have been wrongfully deprived of the benefit of a taxation regime which would have enabled the subsidiary to pay dividends to its parent company without having to pay advance corporation tax, that subsidiary and/or its parent company are/is entitled to obtain a sum equal to the interest accrued on the advance payments made by the subsidiary from the date of those payments until the date on which the tax became chargeable, even when the national law prohibits the payment of interest on a principal sum which is not due.  The national court frames that question in two hypotheses: in the first alternative, where the claim by the subsidiary and/or parent company is made in an action for restitution of taxes levied in breach of Community law and, in the second, where the claim is made in an action for compensation for damage resulting from the breach of Community law.</p>

The United Kingdom government maintains, first, that if it should be held that it was contrary to Community law to deny resident subsidiaries of parent companies not resident in the United Kingdom the benefit of the group income election regime, Community law would require that breach to be remedied, not through an action for restitution but through an action brought against the state for damages for loss occasioned by its breach of Community law.  In its view, advance corporation tax is not a tax levied contrary to Community law, since subsidiaries are in any event bound to pay by way of mainstream corporation tax the sums paid by way of advance corporation tax.  It is the fact that the United Kingdom legislature failed to provide for the possibility of a resident subsidiary and its non-resident parent making a group income election that is at the origin of the disputes in the main proceedings and that might cause the United Kingdom to incur non-contractual liability.  In <span style="font-style:italic">R v Secretary of State for Social Security, ex p Sutton </span>(Case C-66/95) [1997] ECHRI-2163, the court held,<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>in particular, that in the case of damage arising out of breach of a directive, Community law does not require a member state to pay a sum equivalent to the interest on a sum paid late, in that case arrears of social security benefits.  From this the United Kingdom government concludes that Community law does not require interest to be paid in respect of the loss of use of a sum of money for a certain period on account of the advance levying of a tax contrary to Community law.</p>

Second, the United Kingdom government argues that, even if the plaintiffs’ claims were to be treated as claims for recovery of sums paid in breach of Community law, such claims cannot be upheld inasmuch as settled case law states that it is for national law to determine whether interest is payable in connection with reimbursement of charges improperly levied in the light of Community law.

This principle was established in <span style="font-style:italic">Bilbie v Lumley </span>(1802) 2 East 469.  It has however been the subject of much criticism, which has grown substantially during the second half of the present century.  The principle had [sic] been adopted in most, if not all, Commonwealth countries; though in some it has now been modified or abandoned, either by statute or by judicial action.  No such principle applies in civil law countries, and its adoption by the common law has been criticised by comparative lawyers as unnecessary and anomalous.  This topic is the subject of the Consultation Paper No. 120 published by the Law Commission last year, in which serious criticisms of the rule of non-recovery are rehearsed and developed, and proposals for its abolition are put forward for discussion</p>

In particular: (a) money paid as a result of actual or threatened duress to the person, or actual or threatened seizure of a person’s goods, is recoverable.  For an example of the latter, see <span style="font-style:italic">Maskell v Horner</span> [1915] 3 K.B. 106.  Since these forms of compulsion are not directly relevant for present purposes, it is unnecessary to elaborate them; but I think it pertinent to observe that the concept of duress has in recent years been expanded to embrace economic duress.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Lord Goff then turned to the relevant statutory provisions.   With reference to TMA section 33, Lord Goff said this (at p169B-170D):</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">“There is some doubt whether this section is in any event applicable in the case of composite rate tax, which was the tax demanded of Woolwich in the present case.  By [TMA] section 118(1), the interpretation section of the Act, it is provided that, where neither income tax nor capital gains tax nor corporation tax is specified, the word ‘tax’ means any of those taxes.  Composite rate tax is not defined as falling within the description of income tax, but only as ‘an amount representing income tax’: see section 343 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970.  However there is, in my opinion, a more fundamental reason why the section has no application in the present case.  This is because the present case is not one in which an excessive assessment was made on a taxpayer, through some error of fact or law, as is contemplated by section 33(1).  This is a case where there was no lawful basis whatever for any demand of tax to be made by the revenue.  In such circumstances, the demand itself is <span style="font-style:italic">ultra vires</span> and is therefore a nullity.  It follows that in a case such as the present one there can be no valid assessment.  No assessment was in fact raised on Woolwich in the present case, because the money alleged to be due by way of tax was paid, though under protest.  It was pointed out in argument that, pursuant to regulation 7 of the Income Tax (Building Societies) Regulations 1986, tax which was due but not paid on or before the due date could have been the subject of an assessment on Woolwich under paragraph 4(2) or (3) of Schedule 20 to the Finance Act 1972; but for the reasons I have already given any such assessment would, in my opinion, have been a nullity in the circumstances of the present case.  In particular, I do not see how there could have been an appeal against such an assessment pursuant to paragraph 10(3) of Schedule 20; because such an appeal presupposes an assessment which, apart from the impugned error, would otherwise have been valid.  If the assessment is alleged to have been made (as here) under <span style="font-style:italic">ultra vires</span> regulations, the proper course is to take proceedings by way of judicial review to quash the aberrant regulations and the assessment made thereunder, not by way of an appeal under procedure which presupposes that the assessment, although it may be erroneous, is basically lawful.  Just as the appeal procedure presupposes a lawful assessment, so does section 33(1() of the Act of 1970, which is concerned with a lawful assessment which is excessive by reason of some error or mistake in a return.  ….</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in"><marker name="tab"/>This is, in my opinion, a point of some significance in the present case.  It is for these reasons that Woolwich is not enabled or required to seek its remedy through the statutory framework, but must fall back on the common law.  It also follows that the common law principles, whatever they may be, are applicable to a case such as the present, unconstrained by the provisions of any statute.  It was submitted by Mr. Glick that statutory provisions creating a discretionary regime for the repayment of taxes or charges presuppose that the common law principles give no right to recovery.  Historically, that may be correct; but having, where applicable, overlaid and replaced the common law principles, whatever those principles may be, they become neutral in their effect when the development of those principles is considered by the courts.  Of course, Mr. Glick was fully entitled to point out to your Lordships that the vast majority of cases concerned with the recovery of tax which is not due will indeed be covered by statutory provisions regulating the right of recovery; he also suggested that, if it should be held that section 33 has no application in the present case, steps can easily, and may well, be taken at an early opportunity to bring cases such as the present, which are in any event likely to be very rare, within its ambit.  These are practical considerations, the force of which I accept and understand.  But in my opinion they cannot, in the last analysis, touch the point of principle, which is that we are here concerned with the question of the basis of the common law right of recovery in these circumstances, upon which statute law has no direct impact.”</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">“The justice underlying Woolwich’s submission is, I consider, plain to see.  Take the present case.  The revenue has made an unlawful demand for tax.  The taxpayer is convinced that the demand is unlawful, and has to decide what to do.  It is faced with the revenue, armed with the coercive power of the state, including what is in practice a power to charge interest which is penal in its effect.  In addition, being a reputable society which alone among many building societies is challenging the lawfulness of the demand, it understandably fears damage to its reputation if it does not pay.  So it decides to pay first, asserting that it will challenge the lawfulness of the demand in litigation.  Now, Woolwich having won that litigation, the revenue asserts that it was never under any obligation to repay the money, and that it in fact repaid it only as a matter of grace.  There being no applicable statute to regulate the position, the revenue has to maintain this position at common law.</p>

I turn then from the particular to the general.  Take any tax or duty paid by the citizen pursuant to an unlawful demand.  Common justice seems to require that tax be repaid, unless special circumstances or some principle of policy require otherwise; prima facie, the taxpayer should be entitled to repayment as of right.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Lord Goff went on to consider a number of possible objections to what he described as “the simple call of justice”.   The first was the historical fact that English law had not developed so as to recognise an action for the recovery of money on the ground that it was not due (condictio indebiti); instead, it had recognised actions at common law for the recovery of money paid under a mistake of fact, and under certain forms of compulsion.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">“What is now being sought is, in a sense, a reversal of that development, in a particular type of case; and it is said that it is too late to take that step.   To that objection, however, there are two answers.   The first is that the retention by the state of taxes unlawfully exacted is particularly obnoxious, because it is one of the most fundamental principles of our law – enshrined in a famous constitutional document, the Bill of Rights 1688 – that taxes should not be levied without the authority of Parliament; and full effect can only be given to that principle if the return of taxes exacted under an unlawful demand can be enforced as a matter of right.   The second is that, when the revenue makes a demand for tax, that demand is implicitly backed by the coercive powers of the state and may well entail (as in the present case) unpleasant economic and social consequences if the taxpayer does not pay.   In any event, it seems strange to penalise the good citizen, whose natural instinct is to trust the revenue and pay taxes when they are demanded of him.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second objection identified by Lord Goff was that (as Mr Ian Glick QC, for the revenue, had submitted) the development of the law in this area was a matter for Parliament, and not for the courts.   Mr Glick had further submitted that it would be impossible for the House of Lords, were it to accept the building society’s argument, to set the appropriate limits to the principle; and that an unqualified right to recover overpaid taxes and duties subject only to the usual six-year time bar would be unacceptable.   Addressing these submissions, Lord Goff recognised that what he described as “the armoury of common law defences” might be inapposite to a claim to recover tax paid under an unlawful demand.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">“At this stage of the argument, I find it helpful to turn to recent developments in Canada.  First, in a notable dissenting judgment …. in <span style="font-style:italic">Hydro Electric Commission of Township of Nepean v. Ontario Hydro</span> (1982) 132 D.L.R. (3d) 193, 201-211 [“<span style="font-style:italic">Hydro Electric</span>”], Dickson J. subjected the rule against recovery of money paid under a mistake of law to a devastating analysis and concluded that the rule should be rejected.  His preferred solution was that, as in cases of mistake of fact, money paid under a mistake of law should be recoverable if it would be unjust for the recipient to retain it.  Next, in the leading case of <span style="font-style:italic">Air Canada v. British Columbia, </span>59 D.L.R. (4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>) 161 [“<span style="font-style:italic">Air Canada</span>”], the question arose whether money in the form of taxes paid under a statute held to be ultra vires was recoverable.  It is impossible for me, for reasons of space, to do more than summarise the most relevant parts of the judgments of the Supreme Court of Canada.  Of the seven judges who heard the appeal, four thought it necessary to consider whether the taxes paid were recoverable at common law.  The leading judgment was delivered by La Forest J., with whom Lamer and L’Heureux-Dub<span style="font-family:'Palatino Linotype'">é </span>JJ. agreed.  First, he decided, at p. 192, to follow Dickson J’s lead, and to hold that the distinction between mistake of fact and mistake of law should play no part in the law of restitution.  This did not however imply that recovery would follow in every case where a mistake had been shown to exist: “If the defendant can show that the payment was made in settlement of an honest claim, or that he has changed his position as a result of the enrichment, then restitution will be denied.”  However he went on to hold, at p. 193, that, where “unconstitutional or <span style="font-style:italic">ultra vires</span> levies” are in issue, special considerations arose.  These were twofold.  First, if the plaintiff had passed on the relevant tax to others, the taxing authority could not be said to have been unjustly enriched at the plaintiff’s expense, and he was not therefore entitled to recover.  As La Forest J. said, at p. 193: “The law of restitution is not intended to provide windfalls to plaintiffs who have suffered no loss.”  On that basis alone, he held that the plaintiff’s claim in the case before the court must fail.  However, he went on to hold that the claim failed on another ground, viz., that as a general rule there will, as a matter of policy, be no recovery of taxes paid pursuant to legislation which in unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.  Basing himself on authority from the United States, La Forest J. concluded that any other rule would at best be inefficient, and at worst could lead to financial chaos: see pp. 194-197.  The rule against recovery should not however apply where a tax is exacted, not under unconstitutional legislation, but through a misapplication of the law.  He added, at p. 198, that, in his opinion, if recovery in all cases is to be the general rule, then that was best achieved through the route of statutory reform. </p>

Citizens are expected to be law-abiding.  They are expected to pay their taxes.  Pay first and object later is the general rule. The payments are made pursuant to a perceived obligation to pay which results from the combined presumption of constitutional validity of duly enacted legislation and the holding out of such validity by the legislature.  In such circumstances I consider it quite unrealistic to expect the taxpayer to make its payments ‘under protest.’  Any taxpayer paying taxes exigible under a statute which it has no reason to believe or suspect is other than valid should be viewed as having paid pursuant to the statutory obligation to do so.”</p>

I would respectfully suggest that it is grossly unfair that X, who may not be (as in this case) a large corporate enterprise, should absorb the cost of government’s unconstitutional act.  If it is appropriate for the courts to adopt some kind of policy in order to protect government against itself (and I cannot say that the idea particularly appeals to me), it should be one that distributes the loss fairly across the public.  The loss should not fall on the totally innocent taxpayer whose only fault is that it paid what the legislature improperly said was due.”</p>

Furthermore, like Wilson J., I very respectfully doubt the advisability of imposing special limits upon recovery in the case of “unconstitutional or <span style="font-style:italic">ultra vires</span> levies.”  I shall revert a little later to the defence of passing on.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">“I would therefore hold that money paid by a citizen to a public authority in the form of taxes or other levies paid pursuant to an <span style="font-style:italic">ultra vires</span> demand by the authority is prima facie recoverable by the citizen as of right.  As at present advised, I incline to the opinion that this principle should extend to embrace cases in which tax or other levy has been wrongly exacted by the public authority not because the demand was <span style="font-style:italic">ultra vires</span> but for other reasons, for example because the authority misconstrued a relevant statute or regulation.  It is not however necessary to decide the point in the present case, and in any event cases of this kind are generally the subject of statutory regimes which legislate for the circumstances in which money so paid either must or may be repaid.  Nor do I think it necessary to consider for the purposes of the present case to what extent the common law may provide the public authority with a defence to a claim for the repayment of money so paid; though for the reasons I have already given, I do not consider that the principle of recovery should be inapplicable simply because the citizen has paid the money under a mistake of law.  It will be a matter for consideration whether the fact that the plaintiff has passed on the tax or levy so that the burden has fallen on another should provide a defence to his claim.  Although this is contemplated by the European Court of Justice in the <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> case, it is evident from [<span style="font-style:italic">Air Canada</span>] that the point is not without its difficulties; and the availability of such a defence may depend upon the nature of the tax or other levy.

[TMA] section 33, even if it applies to composite rate tax, is not applicable for a number of reasons, not least that no valid assessment could be made under an invalid regulation, that no assessment was in fact made and that, even if made, the assessment could not on the facts of the present case have been said to be ‘excessive by reason of some error or mistake in a return’: section 33(1).  In other areas Parliament has specifically provided that tax paid which was not lawfully due to be paid may be recovered and it has laid down the machinery and the conditions for repayment, including the payment of interest.  None of these other statutory provisions applies to the present case.</p>

If the principle does exist that tax paid on a demand from the Crown when the tax was the subject of an ultra vires demand can be recovered as money had and received then, in my view, it is for the courts to declare it.  In so doing they do not usurp the legislative function.  I regard the proper approach as the converse.  If the legislature finds that limitations on the common law principle are needed for reasons of policy or good administration then they can be adopted by legislation, e.g.. by a short limitation period, presumptions as to validity, even (which I mention but do not necessarily think appropriate since the matter has not been discussed) a power in the courts to limit the effects of any order for recovery comparable to that conferred on the European Court of Justice by article 174 of the E.E.C. Treaty (Cmnd. 5179-II).  Because of the other legislative provisions dealing with repayment of various taxes it seems in any event that the number of cases where any principle of common law would need to be relied on is likely to be small.  The ‘flood gates’ argument is therefore not a persuasive one in this case.  If it were a risk, then the revenue would need to consider appropriate legislation.”</p>

I am convinced that the law should be changed so as to permit monies paid under a mistake of law to be recovered. I also accept, for the reasons given by my noble and learned friend Lord Goff, that the relevant limitation period applicable to such a claim would be that laid down by section 32(1)(c) of the Limitation Act 1980, i.e. six years from the date on which the mistake was, or could with reasonable diligence have been, discovered. The majority of your Lordships consider that such claim will arise when the law (whether settled by existing authority or by common consensus) is changed by a later decision of the courts. The consequence of this House in its judicial capacity introducing such a fundamental change would be as follows. On every occasion in which a higher court changed the law by judicial decision, all those who had made payments on the basis that the old law was correct (however long ago such payments were made) would have six years in which to bring a claim to recover money paid under a mistake of law. All your Lordships accept that this position cannot be cured save by primary legislation altering the relevant limitation period. In the circumstances, I believe that it would be quite wrong for your Lordships to change the law so as to make money paid under a mistake of law recoverable since to do so would leave this gaping omission in the law. In my judgment the correct course would be for the House to indicate that an alteration in the law is desirable but leave it to the Law Commission and Parliament to produce a satisfactory statutory change in the law which, at one and the same time, both introduces the new cause of action and also properly regulates the limitation period applicable to it. </p>

He noted that in a number of European cases (he referred in particular to cases in Germany and France) it had been held that it was unnecessary for the plaintiff to prove that he was mistaken; and that such cases were concerned with the recovery of taxes.

But the principal reasons given for this were that it might be some time before the matter came before the House, and that one of the dissentients in the <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span><span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>case (Lord Keith of Kinkel) had expressed the opinion that the mistake of law rule was too deeply embedded to be uprooted judicially …. Of these two reasons, the former has not proved to be justified, and the latter does not trouble your Lordships because a more robust view of judicial development of the law is, I understand, taken by all members of the Appellate Committee hearing the present appeals. Moreover, especially in the light of developments in other major common law jurisdictions, not to mention South Africa and Scotland, the case for abrogation is now so strong that the respondents in these appeals have not argued for its retention. In these circumstances I can see no good reason for postponing the matter for legislation, especially when we do not know whether or, if so, when Parliament may legislate. Finally I believe that it would, in all the circumstances, be unjust to deprive the Appellant, Kleinwort Benson, of the benefit of the decision of the House on this point. I would therefore conclude on Issue (1) that the mistake of law rule should no longer be maintained as part of English law, and that English law should now recognise that there is a general right to recover money paid under a mistake, whether of fact or law, subject to the defences available in the law of restitution.” </p>

He is now told that, on the law as held to be applicable at the date of the payment, he was not bound to pay it.

In the course of the argument, both before the judge and in this court, this section of Lord Goff’s speech has been subjected by both Mr Glick and by Mr Lawrence Rabinowitz QC (for DMG) to the most minute, not to say microscopic, analysis.   I must therefore quote it in full:</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">“The question then arises whether, having regard to the fact that the right to recover money paid under a mistake of law is only now being recognised for the first time, it would be appropriate for your Lordships' House so to develop the law on the lines of the Law Commission's proposed reform as a corollary to the newly developed right of recovery. I can see no good reason why your Lordships' House should take a step which, as I see it, is inconsistent with the declaratory theory of judicial decision as applied in our legal system, under which the law as declared by the judge is the law applicable not only at the date of the decision but at the date of the events which are the subject of the case before him, and of the events of other cases <span style="font-style:italic">in pari materia</span> which may thereafter come before the courts. I recognise, of course, that the situation may be different where the law is subject to legislative change. That is because legislation takes effect from the moment when it becomes law, and is only retrospective in its effect to the extent that this is provided for in the legislative instrument. Moreover even where it is retrospective, it has the effect that as from the date of the legislation a new legal provision will apply retrospectively in place of that previously applicable. It follows that retrospective legislative change in the law does not necessarily have the effect that a previous payment was, as a result of the change in the law, made under a mistake of law at the time of payment. (I note in parenthesis that in [<span style="font-style:italic">Royal Insurance</span>] the High Court of Australia was divided on the question whether the retrospective legislation there under consideration had the effect that a previous payment had been made under a mistake of law.) As I have already pointed out, this is not the position in the case of a judicial development of the law. But, for my part, I cannot see why judicial development of the law should, in this respect, be placed on the same footing as legislative change. In this connection, it should not be forgotten that legislation which has an impact on previous transactions can be so drafted as to prevent unjust consequences flowing from it. That option is not, of course, open in the case of judicial decisions. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">At this point it is, in my opinion, appropriate to draw a distinction between, on the one hand, payments of taxes and other similar charges and, on the other hand, payments made under ordinary private transactions. The former category of cases was considered by your Lordships' House in [<span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span>], in which it was held that at common law taxes exacted <span style="font-style:italic">ultra vires</span> were recoverable as of right, without the need to invoke a mistake of law by the payer. Moreover reference was made, in the course of the hearing, to the various statutory provisions (usefully summarised in the Law Commission's Consultation Paper (Law Com. No. 120) at pp. 74-84) which regulate the repayment of overpaid tax. For present purposes it is of interest that, in the case of some taxes (including income and corporation tax), no relief is given ‘in respect of an error or mistake as to the basis on which the liability . . . ought to have been computed where the return was in fact made on the basis of or in accordance with the practice generally prevailing at the time when the return was made’: see the proviso to section 33(2) of the Taxes Management Act 1970. </p>

These are (1) cases concerned with repayment of taxes and other similar charges which, when exacted <span style="font-style:italic">ultra vires</span>, are recoverable as of right at common law on the principle in <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span>, and otherwise are the subject of statutory regimes regulating recovery; and (2) other cases, which may broadly be described as concerned with repayment of money paid under private transactions, and which are governed by the common law. The second observation is that, in cases concerned with overpaid taxes, a case can be made in favour of a principle that payments made in accordance with a prevailing practice, or indeed under a settled understanding of the law, should be irrecoverable. If such a situation should arise with regard to overpayment of tax, it is possible that a large number of taxpayers may be affected; there is an element of public interest which may militate against repayment of tax paid in such circumstances; and, since <span style="font-style:italic">ex hypothesi</span> all citizens will have been treated alike, exclusion of recovery on public policy grounds may be more readily justifiable.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">In the present case, however, we are concerned with payments made under private law transactions. It so happens that a significant number of payments were in fact made under interest rate swap agreements with local authorities before it was appreciated that they were void; but the number is by no means as great as might conceivably occur in the case of taxes overpaid in accordance with a prevailing practice, or under a settled understanding of the law. Moreover the element of public interest is lacking. In cases such as these I find it difficult to understand why the payer should not be entitled to recover the money paid by him under a mistake of law, even if everybody concerned thought at the time that interest rate swap agreements with local authorities were valid. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">Of course, I recognise that the law of restitution must embody specific defences which are concerned to protect the stability of closed transactions. The defence of change of position is one such defence; the defences of compromise, and settlement of an honest claim (the scope of which is a matter of debate), are others. It is possible that others may be developed from judicial decisions in the future. But the proposed ‘settled understanding of the law’ defence is not, overtly, such a defence. It is based on the theory that a payment made on that basis is not made under a mistake at all. Once that reasoning is seen not to be correct, the basis for the proposed defence is, at least in cases such as the present, undermined. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">I wish further to add that the proposal that a payment made under a settled understanding of the law, later proved to be erroneous, should be irrecoverable, does not depend upon the lapse of any period of time after the date of the payment in question. Take the present case. Suppose that, shortly after the payment by Kleinwort Benson to a local authority of the first sum due under an interest rate swap contract, it transpires that the contract was <span style="font-style:italic">ultra vires</span> the local authority and so void, and that the sum so paid was therefore not due. Let it also be assumed that there have been relatively few transactions of this kind with local authorities, but enough for it to be said that that sum was paid on the basis of a settled understanding that the money was lawfully due. I find it difficult to accept that, for that reason alone, the payment would be irrecoverable as having been paid under a mistake of law. Indeed it is an remarkable feature of the proposed principle that, the longer ago the payment was made, the less likely is it to have been made under a settled understanding of the law. An appropriately drawn limitation statute would surely produce a more just result. This is a point to which I will return later in this opinion. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">The Western Australian statutory provision (section 23(2) of the Law Reform (Property, Perpetuities and Succession) Act 1962) takes the same form. It is recognised, however, that the concept of “common understanding” of the law has given rise to difficulty …. and, on this score at least, the statutory provision has been the subject of criticism. In this country the Law Commission has attempted to improve on the New Zealand statute by referring not to a common understanding of the law, but instead to a ‘settled view of the law’ which has been departed from by a subsequent judicial decision.  However, as [counsel for the bank] pointed out in argument, there could be much scope for argument over what constituted a settled view of the law. Take the case of interest rate swap agreements. These were assumed by the banks (and indeed by others concerned) to be within the powers of local authorities; but this assumption appears to have been based on practical grounds, rather than on advice about the legal position. Nor do the local authorities appear to have addressed the legal position until after the matter was raised by the Audit Commission in 1987, over five years after agreements of this kind began to be entered into by local authorities. Had the point arisen under a statute in the form recommended by the Law Commission, it would have been necessary to consider whether the above circumstances gave rise to a ‘settled view of the law’. It is only necessary to pose the question to realise how difficult it would have been to answer it in the present case, and very possibly in the case of other payments made under private transactions. For this reason alone it comes as no surprise that the Law Reform Commission of British Columbia decided …. not to recommend the adoption of any such provision in that Province, though they also considered …. that the New Zealand statutory provision ‘goes far beyond what is required’. The Law Reform Committee of South Australia …. likewise did not recommend the adoption of any such provision, though three years later the Law Reform Commission of New South Wales …. proposed the legislative adoption of a similar but not identical provision. In Scotland, …. the Scottish Law Commission at first recommended its adoption, but later resiled from that recommendation. ….   This division of opinion does not encourage statutory adoption of a provision in these or comparable terms, still less its recognition as part of the common law of this country.” </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">The first question arises because the mistake provides the cause of action for recovery of the money had and received by the payee. Unless the payer can prove that he acted under a mistake, he cannot maintain an action for money had and received on this ground. The second question arises because it will not be enough for the payer to prove that he made a mistake. He must prove that he would not have made the payment had he known of his mistake at the time when it was made. If the payer would have made the payment even if he had known of his mistake, the sum paid is not recoverable on the ground of that mistake. The third question arises because the payee cannot be said to have been unjustly enriched if he was entitled to receive the sum paid to him. The payer may have been mistaken as to the grounds on which the sum was due to the payee, but his mistake will not provide a ground for its recovery if the payee can show that he was entitled to it on some other ground. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">In my opinion the proper starting point for an examination of this issue is the principle on which the claim for restitution of these payments is founded, which is that of unjust enrichment. The essence of this principle is that it is unjust for a person to retain a benefit which he has received at the expense of another, without any legal ground to justify its retention, which that other person did not intend him to receive. This has been the basis for the law of unjust enrichment as it has developed both in the civilian systems and in Scotland, which has a mixed system-partly civilian and partly common law. On the whole, now that the common law systems see their law of restitution as being based upon this principle, one would expect them to apply it, broadly speaking, in the same way and to reach results which, broadly speaking, were similar …. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">What, then, is the function of mistake in the field of restitution on the ground of unjust enrichment? The answer, one may say, is that its function is to show that the benefit which has been received was an unintended benefit. A declaration of intention to confer the benefit, even if unenforceable, will be enough to justify the retention of the enrichment. A mistake, on the other hand, will be enough to justify the restitutionary remedy, on the ground that a benefit which cannot be legally justified should not be retained where it was a mistaken and thus unintended benefit.” </p>

My impression is that the common law tends to place more emphasis on the need for proof of a mistake.   But the underlying principle in both systems is that of unjust enrichment.   The purpose of the principle is to provide a remedy for recovery of the enrichment where no legal ground exists to justify its retention.

A state of doubt is different from that of mistake. A person who pays when in doubt takes the risk that he may be wrong and that is so whether the issue is one of fact or one of law. As for mistake, this may arise where there is no suggestion that the law has changed since the payment was made. If it can be demonstrated by reference to statute or to case law that the law was overlooked or was applied wrongly, the position will be the same as that where the mistake was one as to the state of the facts. It is very unusual for a statute to provide for the law to be changed retrospectively, but this is not unknown: see the War Damage Act 1965. If the law is changed retrospectively by statute, so that a payment which was legally due when it was paid has now become undue, the correct analysis will be that there was no mistake at the time when it was made. The enrichment will have been due to the fact that the law was changed retrospectively by the statute.”</p>

Each case would have to be decided on the evidence, that would create uncertainty, and it is difficult to predict the absurdities which may result. One point however does appear to emerge from the discussions so far. This is that a payment made on a settled view of the law is more likely to be excusable, and thus to be one where restitution would more obviously be justified, than a payment made as a result of one man's mistake or ignorance. Yet a mistake of law which only the payer himself had made would not be caught by the defence. As [counsel for the bank] said, the worse the legal advice the more likely the payer could show that the defence was not applicable. But I do not need to elaborate on this point. The valuable work done by the Scottish Law Commission has shown a need for caution which I consider to be entirely justified. I would not favour the introduction of such a defence judicially. Nor do I think that it would be right to apply it to this case, even if its recognition were to be thought to be desirable on grounds of public policy. The fact that restitution has already been given in many of the interest swap cases, albeit on the ground of failure of consideration, would create a situation which I would find unacceptable. Unless the defence can satisfy the test of denying restitution in all cases on the same facts it ought not, in fairness to all parties, to be applied in any of them.” </p>

It may be that even in mistake of fact cases where restitution is available under English law some further restriction of the circumstances where indefinite postponement is available may be appropriate. But that is a matter which is best considered by the Law Commission.”</p>

The court held that the payments in question were indeed overpayments.   The plaintiff then sought repayment of the sums overpaid (including the payment made in May 1997), on the basis that they were made under a mistake of fact, and were therefore recoverable; alternatively, that even if they were made under a mistake of law, it would be right to order repayment.   The defendant landlord conceded that the payments other than the May 1997 payment were repayable, but it contended that the May 1997 payment had been made not as a result of a mistake as to whether the plaintiff was liable to make it, but because of a mistake as to its right to recover it.</p>

At p.1271A Neuberger J turned to the submission of Mr Nugee QC (for the defendant landlord) that the plaintiff’s case based on mistake was logically unsustainable since if the May 1997 payment were to be held to be recoverable, there would, by definition, have been no mistake; and if it were held <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> to be recoverable, that would be the end of the matter and no question of mistake would arise.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">“In my judgment, Nurdin’s argument on this point is correct.  First, as a matter of principle, it seems to me that the correct question for the court to ask itself when considering whether money was paid under a mistake of law (and is therefore prima facie recoverable) would at least normally be whether the payment would have occurred if the payer had not made the alleged mistake.  It is hard to see a good reason, either in principle or in practice, for holding that a person should be entitled to recover a payment made under a mistake, if that mistake relates to the question of his liability, but that he should not be entitled to recover the payment if the mistake was of some other nature.  As I see it, if there was a mistake, and particularly if it related directly and closely to the payment and to the relationship between payer and payee, and, above all, if the mistake had not been made there would have been no payment, then the payment in question is prima facie recoverable.  I would hesitate, particularly so soon after the decision in [<span style="font-style:italic">Kleinwort Benson</span>], before trying to lay down any general principle, but it does seem to me clear that in order to found a claim for repayment of money paid under a mistake of law, it is necessary for the payer to establish not only that the mistake was made but also that, but for the mistake, he would not have paid the money.  It may be that the payer must go further and establish, for instance, that the mistake was directly connected to the overpayment and/or was connected to the relationship between payer and payee.  I doubt whether such further requirements, if they exist, would take matters any further in most cases.  However, if such further requirements do exist, I believe that they are satisfied here in relation to the May 1997 overpayment …”</p>

As I have mentioned already, I consider that the “but for” test, (possibly coupled with a requirement for a close and direct connection between the mistake and the payment and/or a requirement that the mistake impinges on the relationship between payer and payee), is sufficient, in my judgment, to found a claim based on mistake.

The revenue rejected the claim.   The Special Commissioners dismissed the claimant’s appeal, holding that relief on the ground of mistake was precluded by reason of the settlement under section 54.  On the claimant’s appeal to the High Court, the revenue argued that the High Court had no jurisdiction since, by virtue of section 33(4), there was no appeal from a decision of the Special Commissioners save ‘on a point of law arising in connection with the computation of profits’.    Arden J dismissed the claimant’s appeal, holding that section 33(4) could not be circumvented by submitting that the Special Commissioners had failed to deal with the appeal properly; that could only be done, if at all, by judicial review.

Although the scheme bears none of the features of modern rights-based law that are so evident in the Law Commission's draft clauses, this does not necessarily mean that the court can avoid giving effect to them on this occasion. It goes without saying that if Arden J is right, the scheme provides no facility at all for express recourse to the High Court on a point of law of a preliminary kind such as exercised the mind of the Special Commissioner in this case.

On the interpretation of section 33(4), however, I have read the judgment of Robert Walker LJ and I have nothing to add to his reasons for upholding the decision of the judge, with which I agree. This does not mean that an aggrieved taxpayer has no potential right of redress. One of the reasons for the overhaul in the procedures for judicial review was to facilitate access to the supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court in cases where inferior tribunals, such as the Special Commissioners, were said to have made errors of law in relation to which no statutory rights of redress were available. The judges of the Administrative Court now adopt a benevolent approach to the interpretation of the time limits for judicial review applications in cases where the taxpayer was concerned first with exhausting his statutory remedies. There is also, as I have made clear, a private law action available through the ordinary courts, although this seems a less than ideal forum for complicated disputes about tax law.</span>

While both the plaintiffs in these actions appear to have raised the issue whether their premises ought to be distinguished as industrial at an early stage after occupation relying both upon representations made on their own behalf and with the assistance of agents, it does not seem to me that either of them would have entertained any real reason to reject their interpretation of the law put forward on behalf of the defendant until senior counsel’s opinion was furnished to the group of companies.  Up until that time, I have reached the view, on the balance of probabilities, that the plaintiffs were making payments on the basis of a mistake of law bearing in mind that such a mistake may result from the failure to take advice, the omission to examine the available information, misunderstanding the information that has been obtained or failing to identify the relevant issues.  However, it seems to me that once senior counsel’s opinion had been obtained, despite the fact that it was far from enthusiastic, couching the prospects of success as not ‘great’ and ‘an uphill struggle’, the state of each plaintiff’s mind must have moved from that of ‘mistake’ to one of ‘doubt’.  It seems to me that after considering their solicitor’s advice and taking the benefit of senior counsel’s opinion, the agreement by this group of companies reached as a ‘commercial decision’ not to take the risk of further legal proceedings falls within those cases identified by Lord Hope in which the payers were aware that there was an issue of law which was relevant, but doubtful, and in respect of which a decision was taken to make the payments appreciating the risk that the basis upon which they were made might be mistaken.”</p>

Thames Water’s conduct as a statutory sewerage undertaker was regulated by an elaborate statutory scheme, which gave no direct right of action to persons injured by a contravention of the statutory scheme.  The judge at first instance held that Thames Water was not liable for the escapes at common law, since it had neither caused nor created the nuisance, but that its failure to take steps to abate the nuisance contravened article 8(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights.   The Court of Appeal upheld the judge’s decision, and held in addition that Thames Water was liable at common law.   The House of Lords allowed the defendant’s appeal.   One of its grounds for doing so was that for the common law to provide a direct remedy to the claimant would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme and would thus run counter to the intention of Parliament. </p>

The <span style="font-style:italic">Goldman</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Leakey</span> cases exemplify the standard of conduct expected today of an occupier of land towards his neighbour. But Thames Water is no ordinary occupier of land. The public sewers under Old Church Lane are vested in Thames Water pursuant to the provisions of the 1991 Act, section 179, as a sewerage undertaker. Thames Water's obligations regarding these sewers cannot sensibly be considered without regard to the elaborate statutory scheme of which section 179 is only one part. The common law of nuisance should not impose on Thames Water obligations inconsistent with the statutory scheme. To do so would run counter to the intention of Parliament as expressed in the Water Industry Act 1991. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in">34.  In my view the cause of action in nuisance asserted by Mr Marcic is inconsistent with the statutory scheme. Mr Marcic's claim is expressed in various ways but in practical terms it always comes down to this: Thames Water ought to build more sewers. This is the only way Thames Water can prevent sewer flooding of Mr Marcic's property. This is the only way because it is not suggested that Thames Water failed to operate its existing sewage system properly by not cleaning or maintaining it. Nor can Thames Water control the volume of water entering the sewers under Old Church Lane. Every new house built has an absolute right to connect. Thames Water is obliged to accept these connections: section 106 of the 1991 Act. A sewerage undertaker is unable to prevent connections being made to the existing system, and the ingress of water through these connections, even if this risks overloading the existing sewers. But, so Mr Marcic's claim runs, although Thames Water was operating its existing system properly, and although Thames Water had no control over the volume of water entering the system, it was within Thames Water's power to build more sewers, as the company now has done, to cope with the increased volume of water entering the system. Mr Marcic, it is said, has a cause of action at law in respect of Thames Water's failure to construct more sewers before it eventually did in June 2003.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in">35.  The difficulty I have with this line of argument is that it ignores the statutory limitations on the enforcement of sewerage undertakers' drainage obligations. Since sewerage undertakers have no control over the volume of water entering their sewerage systems it would be surprising if Parliament intended that whenever sewer flooding occurs, every householder whose property has been affected can sue the appointed sewerage undertaker for an order that the company build more sewers or pay damages. On the contrary, it is abundantly clear that one important purpose of the enforcement scheme in the 1991 Act is that individual householders should not be able to launch proceedings in respect of failure to build sufficient sewers. When flooding occurs the first enforcement step under the statute is that the Director, as the regulator of the industry, will consider whether to make an enforcement order. He will look at the position of an individual householder but in the context of the wider considerations spelled out in the statute. Individual householders may bring proceedings in respect of inadequate drainage only when the undertaker has failed to comply with an enforcement order made by the Secretary of State or the Director. The existence of a parallel common law right, whereby individual householders who suffer sewer flooding may themselves bring court proceedings when no enforcement order has been made, would set at nought the statutory scheme. It would effectively supplant the regulatory role the Director was intended to discharge when questions of sewer flooding arise.</p>

Recovery was permitted only in cases in which money was exacted under an unlawful demand by a public authority where the payment was made under a mistake of fact of under compulsion of some kind.   The relevant principles have been examined …., very recently, by the House of Lords in [<span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span>].   In <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span>, the House of Lords, though unwilling to acknowledge that causative mistake of law is a basis for recovery, reformulated the principles so as to recognise a prima facie right or recovery based solely on payment of money pursuant to an ultra vires demand by a public authority.

The general structure of the speech was to begin with an analysis of whether a cause of action for restitution of payments made under a mistake of law existed at all, and then, having concluded that it did, to go on to consider whether there were any defences to such a cause of action which might apply in particular cases.  If His Lordship wished to say that a cause of action for payments of taxes made under a mistake of law did not exist he would surely have dealt with the point in the first part of his speech.  However, the paragraphs which I have quoted appear in the second part of the speech, and in particular in a section where Lord Goff is considering whether the House of Lords should introduce a ‘settled law defence’ along the lines of a proposal which had been made by the Law Commission.  The Commission had considered that legislation would be necessary to create a settled law defence, and in a draft Bill had included a provision expressed as follows: <span style="font-style:italic">‘An act done in accordance with a settled view of the law shall not be regarded as founding a mistake claim by reason only that a subsequent decision of a court or tribunal departs from that view.’</span></p>

In the <span style="font-style:italic">Kleinwort Benson </span>case itself he went on to decide that (at common law, and leaving out of account possible future legislative changes) there was no such defence where the mistaken payments had been made under private law.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In paragraphs 20 to 32 of his judgment the judge addressed the question whether DMG made its payments of ACT under a mistake of law: a question to which, as he made clear in paragraph 20, his answer was Yes.   However, he went on to say that the mistake in the instant case could not be described in terms as simple as those which Lord Goff had used to describe the mistake in <span style="font-style:italic">Kleinwort Benson</span>.   The judge concluded that there were two reasons for this.   He explained the first of these two reasons in paragraphs 21 and 22 of his judgment, as follows:</p>

	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">“21.<marker name="tab"/>The first reason is this.  The relevant United Kingdom tax provisions did not did not take the simple form of providing that, if a subsidiary paid a dividend to another company which was in the same group, it did not have to pay ACT.  They provided: (1) that if the companies were in a group relationship, they could make a group income election; (2) that if there was a group income election in force at the time of payment of a dividend, ACT was not payable (unless the companies specifically gave notice to the contrary as regards a particular dividend); (3) that a group income election did not take effect for three months or, if earlier, until the inspector notified the companies that he accepted it; and (4) that an election would be of no effect if, in those three months, the inspector notified the companies concerned that he was not satisfied that it was validly made.  See generally ICTA s.247(2) and (3), s.248(2).  On the last point, if the inspector gave notice that he was not satisfied that an election was validly made the companies could appeal, but unless and until the appeal was determined in the companies’ favour, there was no group income election in force.  It followed that as a matter of law ACT was properly payable in respect of dividends paid in the meantime, and even a successful appeal against the refusal of a group income election would not change that position.  The dividends paid while the appeal was pending continued to give rise to ACT liabilities, and the success of the appeal would only be relevant to future dividends paid after the appeal decision.  See as to this observations of the CJEC in paragraph 104 of its judgment in [<span style="font-style:italic">Metallgesellschaft</span>].  </p>

He began by noting Mr Glick’s reliance, so far as the 1996 payment is concerned, on the fact that the payment was made after the commencement of the <span style="font-style:italic">Metallgesellschaft</span> litigation (which was commenced in April 1995) and after DMG, through its Head of Taxation Mr Thomason, had become aware of the <span style="font-style:italic">Metallgesellschaft </span>litigation (which the judge found to have occurred by, at the latest, early July 1995).   The judge went on to note that the position in relation to the 1993 payment and the 1995 payment was more complicated because both those payments were made before the commencement of the <span style="font-style:italic">Metallgesellschaft</span> litigation.   He noted Mr Glick’s argument in relation to the 1993 payment and the 1995 payment that even if DMG was suffering from a mistake when it made these payments, it discovered its mistake by July 1995 when Mr Thomason became aware of the argument which the taxpayers in <span style="font-style:italic">Metallgesellschaft</span> were putting forward.   </p>

Because of the CJEC decision in [<span style="font-style:italic">Metallgesellschaft</span>]<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>DMG knows now that the true state of the law then was that the companies were entitled to make group income elections; the revenue knows that now as well; indeed we all do.

If the true state of the law had been known at the time the companies would have made elections and DMG’s dividends would have been paid under them as group income, not attracting a liability on DMG’s part to pay ACT.  At this stage in the analysis it must be assumed that, if the true state of the law had been understood, both DMG and the revenue would have understood it.  In other words we know now that DMG, DBI and DBAG were mistaken in thinking that DMG and DBI could not make group income elections with DBAG; if they had not been mistaken in that respect they would have made elections; if they had made elections all of the DMG dividends which in fact attracted ACT would not have attracted ACT.  Therefore the ACT which DMG in fact paid was paid under a mistake of law: if the mistake had not existed the ACT would not have been paid.  It is, however, important to appreciate that the mistake was not directly a mistake about whether there was a liability to pay ACT.  It was directly a mistake about whether group income elections could be made.  The liabilities to pay ACT arose as secondary consequences of that primary mistake.”</p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">“28.<marker name="tab"/>I now proceed with my own analysis of the position.  It is obvious that, when DMG learned of the argument which Metallgesellschaft was advancing, it had come to know something – to discover something – which it had not known before.  That is true, but DMG did not come to know, or to discover, that it and DBI could make group income elections with DBAG after all.  All that it discovered was that another company was arguing that it could make a group income election with its German parent company in comparable circumstances, and that the revenue were disputing the argument.  I examine the position as matters actually stood before DMG paid the dividend which it was planning to pay and did pay in July 1995.  If at that time DMG and DBI had submitted group income elections with DBAG, it is in my opinion certain that the inspector would have rejected the elections within the three month period which was available to him under section 248(2).  Short of DMG abandoning the intention to pay dividends altogether (which I assume would have been unacceptable to the group as a whole) DMG would have had to pay the ACT.  Further, such ACT would have been correctly paid even if DMG had appealed against the rejection of the elections and a later decision (like the actual decision in [<span style="font-style:italic">Metallgesellschaft</span>]) showed that the inspector ought to have accepted them.  (See as to this paragraphs 21 and 22 above.)</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">29.<marker name="tab"/>Concentrating for the moment on the first and second ACT payments (the payments associated with the dividends which DMG paid in July 1993 and July 1994), I repeat that the mistake which DMG made at those times was that it did not realise that it and DBI could have made valid group income elections with DBAG.  In 1995, when DMG learned of the case which Metallgesellschaft had begun against the United Kingdom Revenue, it did not discover that it (DMG) and DBI could have made group income elections with DBAG after all.  All that it discovered was that there was a possible argument that they could have done that.  So it did discover something, but not something which made any difference to the matters which are critical in this case.  Suppose that back in 1993, when DMG was planning to pay the first of the dividends, it had already known what it actually discovered in 1995: that there was an argument that group income elections could be made with parent companies in Member States other than the United Kingdom, but that the revenue did not agree with the argument.  Would DMG, DBI and DBAG have submitted group income elections then?  I do not think that they would.  Still less do I think that, if they had submitted elections then, DMG would not have been liable to pay ACT when it paid the dividends.  I have no doubt that the revenue would have rejected the elections, and that DMG would have been liable to pay the ACT and would have paid it.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">30.<marker name="tab"/>Accordingly, my conclusions in relation to the first two ACT payments are (1) that DMG did pay them under a mistake of law; (2) that, unless a limitation defence applies, DMG is entitled to claim restitution on the basis of a mistake of law; (3) that DMG did not discover its mistake in 1995 when it learned about the argument which Metallgesellschaft was advancing; (4) that therefore the limitation period applicable to DMG’s mistake of law claim did not begin to run in or about July 1995; and (5) that no limitation defence applies.  In my opinion DMG did not discover its mistake until the decision of the CJEC in [<span style="font-style:italic">Metallgesellschaft</span>]<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>was released on 8 March 2001.  DMG had already commenced its action claiming relief before then: it did so shortly after the Advocate General’s opinion was delivered.  That opinion was in favour of the claimants, and thus it foreshadowed the later decision of the CJEC itself.  It might be arguable that DMG discovered its mistake at the time of the Advocate General’s decision.  I would not take that view myself: it was not inevitable that the CJEC would take the same view as the Advocate General.  But the point does not matter, because, even if the limitation period started to run at the time of the Advocate General’s opinion, DMG commenced its action only a month and a day later (12 September 2000 and 13 October 2000).</p>

Notwithstanding that, I accept that DMG paid the ACT under a mistake of law, and is in principle entitled to restitution for the timing disadvantage which it thereby suffered.  The limitation period would only start to run against DMG on the release of the CJEC decision, by which time it had already commenced its claim for relief.</p>

The critical point is that the particulars claimed relief in respect of all payments of ACT made by reference to ‘the Dividends’.  ‘The Dividends’ was a defined term: it meant the dividends which DMG had paid from time to time to DBI and DBAG, thus (as it seems to me) covering all dividends, including those which had led to [the 1993 payment and the 1995 payment].  The original particulars of claim did say that the payments of ACT ‘include but are not limited to’ certain payments set out in a schedule.  The payments so set out did not include [the 1993 payment or the 1995 payment]: those payments were only added to the schedule by the amendments made more than six years after 1 July 1995.  However, in my view the original particulars of claim claimed relief in respect of all payments of ACT which had been made by DMG in respect of all dividends paid by it to DBI and DBAG.  The claim was not limited to the payments specified in the schedule.  </p>

The particulars of claim in that case (as I interpreted them) only claimed relief in respect of the specific ACT payments which were identified in a schedule, so that when the schedule was amended to add further payments the amendment had the effect of adding new claims in respect of additional causes of action.  In the present case, in contrast, I consider that the amendments did not add new claims, but rather gave further details of claims which had already been made within the causes of action which had already been pleaded.  Therefore, even if, contrary to my view, the six years limitation period started to run in July 1995 as respects [the 1993 payment and the 1995 payment], I still consider that DMG’s claims for relief in respect of those two payments were brought within the period and are not statute barred.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Glick relies heavily on the passage in Lord Goff’s speech in <span style="font-style:italic">Kleinwort Benson </span>at pp. 381A-382A (quoted in paragraph 93 above) in support of the submission that the principle established in that case does not extend to overpayments of tax.   He submits that in that passage Lord Goff is recognising a clear distinction between overpayments of tax made under a mistake of law and other payments so made.    He lays particular stress on Lord Goff’s reference to “<span style="font-style:italic">separate and distinct regimes”</span>, and on his description of the first such regime as comprising payments made pursuant to an unlawful demand – which are recoverable as of right under the principle established in <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich – </span>“<span style="font-style:italic">and otherwise are the subject of statutory regimes regulating recovery</span>”.   He submits that this passage in Lord Goff’s speech makes clear that there is no place for a restitutionary claim at common law in respect of an overpayment of tax simply because the overpayment was made by mistake, and that a restitutionary remedy for such an overpayment is available only on the <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich </span>principle (in cases where the mistaken payment was made pursuant to an unlawful demand) or under the terms of the relevant statutory regime.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Glick submits that the reason for the distinction drawn by Lord Goff in the passage in question is that Parliament has enacted specific provisions dealing with the recovery of tax which has been overpaid by reason of a mistake.   In relation to corporation tax, those provisions are to be found in TMA section 33.   Mr Glick points out that the remedy available under TMA section 33 differs markedly from any remedy at common law for payment made under a mistake.   First, there is the requirement (in TMA section 33(1)) that the mistake is made in a return which results in an excessive assessment.   Secondly, as already noted, there is the six-year time limit imposed by that subsection.   Thirdly, no relief is given under TMA section 33 where the return was made on the basis of, and accordance with, the practice generally prevailing at the time it was made (see the proviso to TMA section 33(2)).   Fourthly, the Board has power (under TMA section 33(3)) to consider whether the granting of relief would result in the exclusion from charge to tax of any part of the claimant’s profits.   In addressing this question, the Board may take into consideration the claimant’s liability to tax and any assessments made on him in respect of chargeable periods other than that to which the claim relates; whereas no such flexibility would be imported into any corresponding common law remedy.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Glick submits that in recognising that repayments of tax are excluded from the common law remedy for mistake, Lord Goff was merely founding on the common law principle, applied recently by the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Marcic</span> (see paragraphs 118 to 122 above), that a common law remedy will be excluded where Parliament has enacted a statutory scheme which is inconsistent with that remedy.    The rationale of that principle, he submits, is that the existence of a limited statutory remedy impliedly negatives any wider remedy at common law.   He submits that a common law right to recover taxes overpaid under a mistake of law would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme in TMA section 33.   He points out (relying on Lord Slynn’s speech in <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span>, quoted in paragraph 70 above) that TMA section 33 cannot operate to exclude a common law remedy where the payment in question is made pursuant to an unlawful demand.   </p>

He submits that this is the clearest indication that in referring to “separate and distinct regimes” Lord Goff was not intending to suggest that no cause of action for mistake of law could exist in relation to overpayments of tax: he was merely considering the circumstances in which a ‘settled law defence’ might be available, and expressing the view that in that context overpayments of tax could be regarded as being on a different footing from payments under private transactions at least to the extent that there may be a stronger case for the recognition of a ‘settled law defence’ where an overpayment of tax is involved. </p>

The latter would be entitled to a restitutionary remedy under the principle in <span style="font-style:italic">Kleinwort Benson</span> whereas the former would not.

He submits that an interpretation of the <span style="font-style:italic">Kleinwort Benson </span>principle which left such a claimant without any restitutionary remedy would leave a huge gap in the law, and that Brooke LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Eagerpath </span>was right to assume that such a claimant would be entitled to such a remedy at common law.</p>

He said he believed he had recommended to Herr Langel that protective elections should be made, but further dividends were paid before any answer was received.

It is not limited to cases where the payment of tax is made pursuant to an unlawful demand (i.e. it is not limited to <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> cases); it includes payments of tax the recovery of which is regulated by statute, to which the <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> principle has no application.

This is not in any way surprising, since <span style="font-style:italic">Kleinwort Benson </span>was concerned with the mistake of law rule, and in the passage in question Lord Goff was discussing the possible ramifications of the abrogation of that rule.   By the same token, however, cases involving a payment to the revenue made pursuant to an unlawful demand <span style="font-style:italic">and </span>under a mistake of law <span style="font-style:italic">are</span> plainly included in the first regime as being payments the recovery of which is governed by the <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> principle.   To my mind this confirms that Lord Goff was not contemplating that the claimant in such a case (i.e. a taxpayer entitled to a restitutionary remedy “as of right” on the <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> principle) might be in a position to found an alternative cause of action for the same remedy, based on a mistake of law.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This interpretation is, to my mind, further reinforced when one considers the second category of cases which Lord Goff includes in the first of his two regimes, viz. cases where a payment is made to the revenue which engages the relevant statutory regime regulating recovery for mistake of law (i.e. cases where the demand is lawful and the <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> principle accordingly does not apply).   If the common law were to recognise a cause of action for mistake of law in such cases, the result would be two separate and potentially conflicting regimes regulating recovery: the common law regime and the statutory regime.   Indeed, the result in the case of ACT would to produce a direct conflict between TMA section 33(1) (with its six year time limit on claims) and the more flexible provisions of section 32(1)(c) of the 1980 Act.   I cannot think that Lord Goff could have contemplated such an unsatisfactory result.   The alternative would be to recognise a cause of action for mistake of law in relation to payments to the revenue only in cases where the payment is made pursuant to an unlawful demand (i.e. only in <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> cases).   However, that would (to my mind) produce a no less unsatisfactory result in that the limitation consequences of the mistake of law would differ, depending on whether or not the demand was lawful.   I can see no basis in principle for distinguishing for limitation purposes between mistake of law cases where the payment to the revenue is made pursuant to a lawful demand and mistake of law cases where the payment to the revenue is made pursuant to an unlawful demand.    Such a distinction would in my judgment be purely fortuitous.   Once again, therefore, I cannot think that Lord Goff could have intended such a result.   </p>

First, he said (referring to <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span>) that “there is certainly no principle that, for policy reasons, there can <span style="font-style:italic">never</span> be restitutionary claims for recovery of taxes wrongly paid” (emphasis supplied).   That is undoubtedly correct, as <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich </span>itself establishes.    However, the mere fact that the common law recognises an entitlement to a restitutionary remedy in respect of a payment to the revenue on the ground that the payment was made pursuant to an unlawful demand (the <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich </span>principle) throws no light on the further question whether the common law also recognises such an entitlement on the ground that the payment was made under a mistake of law.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The judge’s second point is that had Lord Goff intended to say that there was no general common law right of recovery in respect of payments to the revenue, one would not have expected to find such a statement in the section of his speech in <span style="font-style:italic">Kleinwort Benson</span> in which he was discussing possible defences to a claim at common law for a remedy for mistake of law, and in particular the possible recognition of a ‘settled law defence’.   In my judgment, however, it is natural that Lord Goff should have referred to the two “separate and distinct regimes” when considering whether the common law should recognise a ‘settled law defence’ in relation to the second of the two regimes (i.e. recovery of payments made under a mistake of law <span style="font-style:italic">in private transactions</span>), which was the relevant regime in <span style="font-style:italic">Kleinwort Benson </span>itself.    As I read the passage in question, Lord Goff is merely making the point that a ‘settled law defence’ would fit more easily into the first regime than into the second.

The issue as to the possible recognition of a ‘settled law defence’ arose in that context.   In considering the suitability of such a defence in such cases, Lord Goff distinguished between the two regimes and concluded that whilst there were public policy arguments for the recognition of a ‘settled law defence’ in cases within the first regime, those reasons did not hold good in relation to cases within the second regime.

In the light of that concession, Lord Goff considered it unnecessary to consider in detail the criticism of the mistake of law rule made by Dickson J in <span style="font-style:italic">Hydro Electric</span> (a criticism which Lord Goff in <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich </span>(at p.174H) described as a “devastating analysis”), which was later adopted by<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>La Forest J in <span style="font-style:italic">Air Canada</span>.

As I read the relevant passage in Lord Goff’s speech in <span style="font-style:italic">Kleinwort Benson</span>, the only purpose of his brief reference to <span style="font-style:italic">Royal Insurance </span>was to point out that Mason CJ’s criticism of the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich </span>(he had said that the House of Lords was “unwilling to acknowledge that causative mistake of law is a basis of recovery”) was misplaced, since no question of mistake of law arose in <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span>.

That is undoubtedly true, so far as it goes.     However, it must be borne in mind that <span style="font-style:italic">Kleinwort Benson </span>was a case within the second of Lord Goff’s two regimes.    In the circumstances, the fact that none of the rest of their Lordships referred to the first of Lord Goff’s regimes seems to me to be of no significance for present purposes.   </p>

This follows, in my judgment, from the statements in paragraphs 9 and 11 that the claims “include, but are not limited to” the payments specified in the schedules.    It may well be that, when served with a pleading in that form, the appellants could have complained that it was embarrassing.   In the event, however, no objection was taken at the time to the form of the pleading, just as no objection was taken to the fact that it includes a restitutionary claim which finds no mention in the claim form.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, the particular problem which has arisen is of a lower order of abstraction. It is in truth a narrow pleading point which has arisen on very special facts relating to the state of the pleadings in this case. The circumstances have been set out in Lord Justice Jonathan Parker’s judgment at paras 10 and 239/243 above. Like him (and the parties) I ignore the fact that restitution was never claimed in the claim form itself, but only in the particulars of claim. In form the claim form should have been amended, but perhaps because there is no critical difference between the date of the claim form on 13 October 2000 and the date of the particulars of claim on 9 February 2001 the absence of a claim for restitution from the claim form itself has passed without remark. As for the particulars of claim, the essential facts are that in their original form they claimed restitution, quite generally, of “Dividends” which were defined as amounts which “include, but are not limited to” the payments specified in the First and Second Schedules; and in their later amended form those Schedules were expanded to refer to the disputed payments in 1995 and 1996. The question is whether the particularisation in the original Schedules of only a limited number of a more general class expressly pleaded in the main body of the pleading means that the later extension of the amended Schedules to other payments within the general class lies outside the jurisdiction allowed for amendments once the relevant limitation period has expired.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Park J, describing the current issue as “a fine point on the small print wording of the particulars of claim” expressed the view (at paras 34, 35 and 38) that the original form of the particulars of claim (“include but are not limited to”) meant that relief was claimed in respect of all dividend payments not limited to the payments specified in the original Schedules. The amendments therefore “did not plead a new cause of action, but rather gave further factual details of a cause or causes of action which had already been pleaded” (at para 38). Lord Justice Jonathan Parker is of the same view (at para 248 above), and so am I. On this basis, there is no need to ask whether the claims for relief in respect of the additional scheduled payments are “new claims”, nor whether, if they were, they would arise out of the same facts or substantially the same facts as already pleaded. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Lord Justice Buxton differs in his view, apparently on the basis that the particulars of claim (together with the original Schedules) had not adequately or sufficiently pleaded the additional payments. That, however, must in my judgment ultimately be a matter of degree. I would be reluctant to hold that a claim form which sufficiently identified the cause or causes of action sued upon would fail in its purpose because of some lack of particularity. In the present case, the payments in question were identified as dividends paid “from time to time” pursuant to unlawful statutory provisions and demands. It was in the nature of the pleading that there could be no intention to include some such payments but not others. If there had been no schedules identifying specific payments, then no doubt the pleading would refer to all such dividend payments described. Such a pleading may have lacked proper particularisation of dates and amounts, but I would not describe it as lacking in all effect. In other circumstances the original schedules might have been interpreted as deliberately excluding any dividend payments not particularised in them, but such an intention could hardly be taken from the language “include but are not limited to”. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus, in a case where an allegation in the statement of claim had not been pursued in further and better particulars, it was permissible as a matter of discretion by amendment of the particulars after the expiry of the limitation period to resuscitate the allegation without it being said that this amounted to a new cause of action: <span style="font-style:italic">Burton v. MBC (Builders-Ashingdon) Ltd</span> (1995) 69 P&amp;CR 496 (CA). And in another case it was held that a statement of claim which originally disclosed no sustainable cause of action (thus a strong example) might in a proper case be amended with leave of the court despite the expiry of the limitation period so that a cause of action based on the same or substantially the same facts could be introduced: <span style="font-style:italic">Sion v.

That conclusion was not investigated in the judgment below, but it was a submission made on appeal. In my judgment, it is not necessary to reach this submission, but I would not wish it to be thought that it could not provide a feasible and legitimate answer to the problem raised by the issue under discussion.</p>

At the same time, however, these speeches are no ordinary judgments.  In both cases the leading authority in a particular area of the law set himself to explain developments in that law that were acknowledged to be of general significance and which, before those cases, had been feared to be beyond the reach of judicial as opposed to legislative intervention: in <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span>, the recovery of money paid under an ultra vires demand; in <span style="font-style:italic">Kleinwort</span>, the recovery of money paid under a mistake of law.

But that simple approach would not do justice either to the judgment of the judge or to the arguments addressed to us.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I will proceed as follows.  First, I address the development of the law that occurred in <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span>, to demonstrate that that law was intended to form a complete code in relation to recovery of ultra vires payments by use of the common law rather than under statute.  That does not of itself determine the issue before us, but it does serve to explain why Lord Goff spoke as he did in <span style="font-style:italic">Kleinwort</span>.  Second, and following on from the analysis of <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span>, I consider the context in which Lord Goff referred to the <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> rule in <span style="font-style:italic">Kleinwort</span>, to demonstrate that not only did Lord Goff think that <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> recovery was the only remedy for ultra vires payments; but also, on the other side of the coin, that such payments were amenable only to recovery under the <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> rule and not under the rubric of payments under a mistake.   Third, I demonstrate that that conclusion is in any event strongly reinforced by the difficulty of fitting a case of ultra vires payments, such as the present, into the language of and rules applying to recovery on grounds of mistake.   Fourth, I address certain other considerations that were relied on in the course of argument.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Lord Goff recognised that the law of restitution, as it stood in 1992, was limited in the relief that it gave to persons who had paid an ultra vires tax. Recovery was available when a payment was made under a mistake of fact, though not of law: p164D.   And payments were recoverable when made under “compulsion”; but, at least in the then state of English law, that concept did not extend to the act of paying simply in order to obey what was thought to be the law: p173E.  It was necessary to rely on these particular and limited rights of recovery because English law did not recognise a general action for the recovery of money on the ground that it was not due, along the lines of the <span style="font-style:italic">condictio indebiti</span> that had been developed in other systems: p172D.   </p>

And the justification for that step was not any deduction from or development of the existing rules of restitution, but a combination of common justice; the constitutional principle that taxes should not be levied without Parliamentary approval; and the need to protect the citizen against the power of the state.  He said, at p172B-G:</p>

That is demonstrated by the fact that Lord Goff found “most attractive” the reasoning to that effect of Wilson J in her dissenting judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Air Canada v British Columbia</span> 59 DLR (4th) 161: see pp 175F-176D.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">Lord Goff recognised the force of arguments that, because of potential damage to public funds if the right created in <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> were not controlled, restrictions in terms for instance of strict rules of limitation might have to be imposed: see pp 174C-177C.  Lord Goff did not take that step as a matter of judicial decision, nor indeed could he have done, but it is clear that he saw the point as significant: see in particular p174C-E.  Two comments may be made.  First, no such rules are seen as necessary in the case of private law restitutionary claims.  Second, and directly relevant to our concerns in the present case, the respondents’ argument requires us to accept that although he expressed concern in <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> about, and urged review by the Law Commission of, a limitation period even as long as six years in the case of ultra vires demands, Lord Goff nonetheless looked with equanimity in <span style="font-style:italic">Kleinwort</span> upon the prospect of claims in respect of such demands that, in the present case, were not raised until nine or ten years after demand made.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is also difficult to escape the conclusion that that remedy was seen by Lord Goff to be the sole remedy available in respect of a payment under an ultra vires demand.    As already noted, before <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> the sole grounds of relief were thought to be based on mistake of fact or on compulsion: see paragraph 6 above.  The strong tide of jurisprudence flowing in favour of recognising relief also in cases of mistake of law was already very apparent: see p 164E-F.  But Lord Goff did not see that as an appropriate route through which to found relief in cases of ultra vires payments:  not merely because in some such cases, of which <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> itself was one, no mistake had been made by the payer, but more fundamentally because issues of mistake on the part of the payer were seen as simply irrelevant to claims based on unlawful action on the part of the revenue.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally in analysing <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> I must acknowledge (I hope that it is not disrespectful to say, by way of a footnote) that in the last of his many major contributions to the law of restitution before his untimely death Professor Peter Birks suggested that, had the <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> problem been addressed after the “swaps” cases, and in the light of their jurisprudence, it would have been clear that the case fell entirely consistently within the same rules of restitution as were subsequently applied in those swap cases: <span style="font-style:italic">Unjust Enrichment</span> (Second Edition, 2005) p134.  I find it difficult to share that view, in the light of the actual exposition in <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> as set out above.   And the commonality that Professor Birks sees between recovery of ultra vires payments and restitutionary recovery in other cases springs from the view that all of them rest on recovery on the single ground of “absence of basis”: <span style="font-style:italic">ibid</span>, p134.  That argument was not adopted before us, and understandably so.  That was because it is essential to the respondents’ case, applying <span style="font-style:italic">Kleinwort</span>, to stress that recovery was achieved in that case on the basis of mistake: so as to attract the period of limitation envisaged by section 32(1)(c) rather than the six years to which restitutionary claims generally are restricted.  That last aspect of <span style="font-style:italic">Kleinwort</span> was equally stressed in the case itself by Lord Hope of Craighead.  Having, at p415, referred to  <span style="font-style:italic">Sandwell </span>[1994] 4 All ER 890 and <span style="font-style:italic">Guinness Mahon v Kensington and Chelsea LBC</span> [1999] QB 215 (cases that as Professor Birks emphasised, <span style="font-style:italic">op. cit. </span>p110, were decided on absence or failure of basis) Lord Hope continued, at p415H, to point out that those cases did not assist because they had not been decided on the ground of mistake,  which was the ground on which the bank had to rely in order to meet the local authorities’ limitation defence.</p>

The judge also thought that to be of importance: see paragraph 18(ii) of his judgment.  I respectfully agree.  From p381B onwards Lord Goff was considering, in the context of his adoption of the declaratory theory of judicial decision, whether there should be recognised a defence of payment under a settled understanding of law, as was recommended by the Law Commission in clause 3(1) of the draft Bill annexed to its report on <span style="font-style:italic">Restitution: Mistakes of Law</span> (Law Com No 227, 1994): see pp 376H-377A.

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Lord Goff drew that distinction because he considered that the arguments in favour of a defence of payment under a settled understanding of the law applied differently in the two cases.  “In cases concerned with overpaid taxes a case can be made” (p 382D) for the existence of such a defence; for somewhat the same reasons as had led Lord Goff in <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> to contemplate strict time-limits for claims in ultra vires cases: see paragraph 7(iii) above.  But no such case could be made in respect of payments under private transactions, where   the element of public interest is lacking: see p 382F.  It is therefore entirely clear that Lord Goff regarded the contrast that he underlined between the two separate and distinct regimes as essential to the development of his argument.  Not only the language used but also the structure of this part of the judgment demonstrates that Lord Goff’s analysis of the two separate streams of relief was regarded by him as setting out the substantive law that pointed to a particular solution to the issue of the settled law defence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It follows that I am unable to accept the argument of the respondents that the crucial part of Lord Goff’s judgment is in some way limited in its generality because it occurs during a discussion of the settled law defence.  It occurred there precisely because Lord Goff needed to set out the general structure of the law before identifying the different effect of the arguments about the settled law defence as applied to one chapter of the law and to the other.   It also follows that I am unable to adopt the view of the judge, in his paragraph 18(ii), that if Lord Goff had intended to lay down a contrast between recoverability of money generally paid under a mistake of law and recoverability of money paid in taxes under a mistake of law, he would not have waited to do so until this stage in his speech.   In the earlier parts of his speech Lord Goff was concerned to demonstrate, in considerable detail, the current throughout the world towards recognising mistake of law as a ground of restitutionary recovery.  Lord Goff did not need at that stage to address the position with regard to ultra vires payments because, as indicated in paragraph 10 above, he thought that “mistake” and recovery on the ground of ultra vires demand were two quite separate institutions.  The latter ground of recovery only needed to come into the reckoning when Lord Goff explained how it was that arguments that potentially supported a defence of payment under settled law in the case of ultra vires demands could not apply in the case of payments made under a mistake, be it of fact or of law.</p>

If, as the respondents argue in the present case, any claim in respect of an ultra vires demand where a “mistake” can be said to have been made by the payer can also be pursued under the latter rubric, then that presumably attracts the whole of the law attaching to recovery on grounds of mistake, however difficult it may be to apply.  That in turn severely undermines the principle strongly stated in <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> that recovery should be as of right, to the extent that Lord Goff expressed doubts as to whether even a defence that the plaintiff had passed on the tax or levy should be available: see <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> at pp 177H-178A.  And the difficulty of applying the normal restitution defences to a right based simply on an ultra vires demand is cogently demonstrated by Professor Gareth Jones in <span style="font-style:italic">Goff and Jones</span> (5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> edition), pp 675-677.</p>

That conclusion may be difficult to reconcile with at least the latter part of Lord Hope’s analysis set out in paragraph 281 above.  The more general point, however, is that persons who pay in response to a demand by the revenue are in a quite different position from persons who pay under a private transaction.  The demand for tax is implicitly backed by the coercive powers of the state, as Lord Goff emphasised at p 172F in <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span>, see paragraph 270 above.   That consideration lay behind the view expressed by Mr Thomason.  That consideration, allied to the public nature of the responsibility, caused Lord Goff to think, at p 176D in <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span>, see paragraph 272 above, that the taxpayer’s opinion as to the content of the law was irrelevant.</p>

And to attempt to do so produces the very remarkable outcome asserted in the present case.  Both the Woolwich Equitable Building Society and the present respondents paid under claims made by public authorities.  In each case the cost of not paying, both in terms of litigation and in terms of public exposure, would have been significant.    Woolwich was certain, as it turned out correctly, that the demand was indeed ultra vires, but paid nonetheless.  The present respondents were aware of the doubts raised by other persons, and indeed of pending litigation, but either formed no concluded view about the issue, or as Mr Thomason suggests paid because they thought, as it turned out incorrectly, that the law was the law.  On the basis of these two states of mind, the respondents claim relief because of payment under a mistake, whilst Woolwich is restricted to a claim with a six year limitation period because, as Lord Goff pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic">Kleinwort</span>, it had made no mistake.</p>

Mr Rabinowitz argued strongly that that demonstrated that Lord Goff saw no distinction between revenue and non-revenue cases when dealing with the jurisdiction in mistake.  The judge adopted a similar argument in respect of the reference to <span style="font-style:italic">Willis Faber</span>: see his paragraph 18(v).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The reference to <span style="font-style:italic">Commissioner of State Revenue</span> does not assist in this connexion.  Lord Goff cited the case only to correct a dictum of Mason CJ about what had been decided in <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span>: see [1999] 2 AC at p 375B.  <span style="font-style:italic">Willis Faber</span> was not subjected to any detailed analysis by Lord Goff.   In any such analysis I have little doubt that Lord Goff would have pointed out that the basis of recovery in Roman-Dutch law is the <span style="font-style:italic">condictio indebiti</span>: which, as Hefer JA put it at p220H, “has since Roman times always been regarded as a remedy <span style="font-style:italic">ex aequo et bono</span> to prevent one person being unjustifiably enriched at the expense of another”.   That is the general remedy for recovery of money on the simple ground that it was not due that, as Lord Goff had explained at p 172D in <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span>, English law had decided not to adopt: see paragraph 269 above.  The <span style="font-style:italic">condictio</span> does not rest on the mistake, but rather on the effect of the mistake.  So, as Hefer JA went on to point out, “where such a payment is made in error, it matters not whether the error is one of fact or of law: in either case it remains the payment of an <span style="font-style:italic">indebitum </span>and, if not repaid, the receiver remains enriched”.   <span style="font-style:italic">Willis Faber</span> thus addresses a system of law with a basis different from that explained by Lord Goff in <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span>.  It is quite impossible to spell out of his passing reference to the case a conclusion that conflicts with the specific language used everywhere else in his speech.</p>

The national state is therefore obliged to provide a remedy, in the shape of restitution of charges, but according to the rules of the domestic legal system and subject to the procedural rules of that system: Joined Cases C-397/98 and C-410/98, Metallgesellschaft, at paragraph 85.  The only restriction on the reach of those domestic rules is that they must not make the exercise of the Community right practically impossible or excessively difficult.   The domestic rules that fall under this rubric include rules as to time-limits: Case C-261/95 [1997] ECR I-4025 (<span style="font-style:italic">Palmisani</span>).   A remedy is provided for the  wrongful acceleration of payment of tax in the present case under the <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> principle.   It was not suggested, nor could it have been, that the limitation rules attaching to that principle made the exercise of the Community right practically impossible or excessively difficult.

That approach does not give weight either to the exclusive nature of the remedy created in <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> or to the difficulty of applying the rules as to mistake of law to a payment under an ultra vires demand.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is however a further reason why this argument is ill-founded.  Where there are alternative causes of action in tort, they are nonetheless both based on the same damage or loss suffered by the claimant.  As Lord Hobhouse said in <span style="font-style:italic">Platform Homes v Oyston Shipways </span>[2000] 2 AC 190 at p209A, citing the headnote in the official report of <span style="font-style:italic">The Wagon Mound</span>, in the case of claims in tort it is not the act but the consequences on which tortious liability is founded.  But restitutionary claims have a different structure, because they are indeed founded on an act, the act of payment.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> “the subject who make a payment in response to an unlawful demand of tax acquires forthwith a prima facie right in restitution to the repayment of the money”: per Lord Goff at p 171F.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Kleinwort</span>, “It is well established that the cause of action for the recovery of money paid under a mistake of fact accrues at the time of payment”: per Lord Goff at p 386F, a passage considered further in paragraph 292 below.  Whether the payer has in consequence suffered loss does not enter into consideration when determining the <span style="font-style:italic">constitution</span> of the action.  Loss, or rather lack thereof, is only relevant as a matter of <span style="font-style:italic">defence;</span> and quite possibly, in <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span>, not even then: see paragraphs 270(ii) and 280 above.  In the absence in English law of a general right to recovery (see paragraph 270 above), the claims turn on the reason why in law that payment should be returned.  But that reason is completely different in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> on the one hand and of <span style="font-style:italic">Kleinwort</span> on the other.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> it is payment under an unlawful demand.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Kleinwort</span> it is payment by mistake of the type and for the reasons described by Lord Hope: see paragraphs 281-283 above.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This contrast is quite different from the comparison that is appropriate in a case where the claimant bases his claim on an allegation that the defendant has caused him loss, and has more than one ground upon which he can assert that the defendant’s conduct in causing that loss was unlawful.  The difficulty of fitting into the requirements for a <span style="font-style:italic">mistake</span> by the payer that are laid out in <span style="font-style:italic">Kleinwort</span> a case, such as <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span>, where the right to repayment is based on the nature of the <span style="font-style:italic">demand</span> only serves further to underline the ineptitude of seeking to apply the jurisprudence of mistake to the separate and distinct regime that controls ultra vires conduct by public authorities. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> Lord Goff, with the concurrence of the majority of the House, crafted a carefully designed and limited remedy to address the specific problem of ultra vires demands.  He recognised that it might be necessary to limit the ambit of recovery of right against public funds, for instance by the  introduction of specific time-limits.  He emphasised that the remedy turned on the nature of the demand, and not on any mistake by the payer.  Quite apart from the language used in <span style="font-style:italic">Kleinwort</span>, it is wholly implausible that Lord Goff in that case envisaged that the same problem could be addressed by a remedy with much more extensive time-limits and formulated entirely in terms of mistake by the payer.  It is not open to the claimants in this case to adopt the remedy in terms of mistake of law that was introduced for private law cases in <span style="font-style:italic">Kleinwort</span>.</p>

But the case has been argued throughout as an orthodox exercise in restitution; and in any event the respondents cannot make good, and by their pleading accept that they cannot make good, any claim for compensation unless they first establish the fact and date of the payment.  For the reasons already given, each such payment creates a new cause of action; and therefore the amendments seeking to assert further payments added new causes of action, causes of action that on the above principles were out of time if the amendment was made out of time.  </p>

That of course depends on the nature of the new factual allegations: see the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Paragon</span> at p406<span style="font-style:italic">c</span>.  But, more fundamentally, the essence of a claim in tort is of tortious conduct causing loss.  It may therefore be sufficient to plead the tortious conduct as the foundation of the action, causing unspecified loss, with subsequent particularisation of the loss merely filling out an already sufficiently pleaded claim.  That indeed is the approach adopted in paragraphs 9 and 11 of the particulars of claim in this case.   But in a claim for restitution the essence of the claim is the fact of the payment, with the reasons for that payment serving to assert why that payment should be returned: see paragraph 288 above.
