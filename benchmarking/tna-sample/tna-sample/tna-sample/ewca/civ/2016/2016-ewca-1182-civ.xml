	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This is the judgment of the court, to which each of its members has contributed, on four linked appeals from an order of Green J dismissing claims for judicial review of The Standardised Packaging of Tobacco Products Regulations 2015 (“the Regulations”).  The Regulations were made by the Secretary of State pursuant to section 94 of the Children and Families Act 2014 (‘the 2014 Act’) and section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972, following a lengthy consultation process and with Parliamentary approval by way of affirmative resolutions.  They make provision for the retail packaging of cigarettes and hand rolling tobacco to be standardised, substantially limiting the ability of tobacco companies to place branding on the outer packaging or the tobacco products themselves.  In part, they implement Directive 2014/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 April 2014 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco and related products (the Tobacco Products Directive or “TPD”, but generally referred to in the appeals as “TPD2” because it replaces a 2001 directive on the subject).  But they go further than TPD2 in the restrictions they impose, and it is those additional restrictions that are the subject of the present appeals.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Regulations were challenged by the claimants on numerous grounds.  There was a very large volume of evidence in the court below, including 27 witness statements and 30 expert reports; there were 16 bundles of authorities; the skeleton arguments and written submissions ran to many hundreds of pages; the hearing before the judge lasted 7 days; and the exercise undertaken by the judge after the hearing included, as his judgment makes clear, an in-depth review of all the expert evidence in the case.  His judgment, extending to 1,000 paragraphs, is on any view a <span style="font-style:italic">tour de force</span> but we consider it to be much longer than was necessary or desirable.  For those with the stamina it is available on BAILII (under neutral citation number [2016] EWHC 1169 (Admin)) and in the law reports (see [2016] ETMR 38) and also in Reports of Patent Cases: [2016] RPC 22. In those circumstances we refer to it so far as possible by way of summary and cross-reference rather than by quotation or repetition.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The judge grouped the issues before him under 17 grounds, all of which he dismissed, as follows:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">Ground 1 (see Green J at [9] and [251]-[275]) was a challenge to the lawfulness of the Regulations on the basis that TPD2 was itself illegal.  The issue was resolved against the claimants by the judgment of the CJEU of the European Union (“the CJEU”) in (Case C-547/14), <span style="font-style:italic">Philip Morris Brands SARL and Others v Secretary of State for Health </span>[2016] 3 WLR 973 (“<span style="font-style:italic">Philip Morris</span>”) and is not pursued on the appeals.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">The specific issue in ground 2 (see Green J at [10] and [276]-[404]) was whether the Secretary of State had erred in according only limited weight to the expert evidence served by the tobacco companies during the consultation process.  As the judge said at [277], however, “the point <span style="font-style:italic">also </span>resonates in the context of the other freestanding grounds which involve a consideration of the Claimants’ evidence such as proportionality and in the context of alleged violations of property rights”.  In finding against the claimants, the judge concluded at [404] that “measured against internationally accepted research and evidence standards, that evidence, as a generality, was materially below par”.  </p>

Proportionality was raised as a free-standing ground of challenge but also played an important part in the grounds alleging breach of Article 1 of Protocol 1 to the European Convention on Human Rights (“A1P1”) and article 17 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (“the Charter”), described below.  The judge found that the Regulations were proportionate both on the evidence at the time when they were considered by Parliament and on the further evidence before the court.</p>

Ground 10 (see Green J at [865]-[883]) was that the Regulations violated the unitary character of Community trade marks (“CTMs”) contrary to Council Regulation (EC) No. 207/2009 of 26 February 2009 on the Community trade mark (“the CTMR”): the CTMR has since been amended by Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2424 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2015, and is referred to in its amended form as “the EUTMR”.</p>

This ground included consideration of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (Annex 1C of the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation of 15 April 1994) (“the TRIPs Agreement”) and the compatibility of the Regulations with the TRIPs Agreement.</p>

	    <p class="ColorfulGrid-Accent11" style="margin-left:1.00in">“The Regulations standardise the material, shape, opening and content of the packaging of readymade cigarettes. Similar controls are applied in relation to roll your own cigarettes. The Regulations also include specific prohibitions in relation to the labelling of tobacco products. The objective of the Regulations is to introduce plain or standardised packaging and, in substantial measure, to restrict the branding permitted on tobacco packaging. The Regulations achieve this end by mandating the design elements of a package. The only permitted colour for the packaging of a tobacco product [is] what is described as “<span style="font-family:Times">a drab brown with a matt finish</span>”. The Regulations prescribe the text that may be lawfully printed on packs. Other than standardised text as to the number of cigarettes and the producer only the brand name and the variant of the cigarette is permitted. And, moreover, this is permitted only in a uniform presentation with a specified Helvetica font, case, colour, type face, orientation, and size (font size 14 for brand name and 10 for variant name). The surface of the packaging must be smooth and flat with no ridges, embossing or similar distinguishing features. The package must contain uniform lining. The appearance of the cigarettes must be plain white with a matt finish with white or imitation-cork coloured tipping paper. Permitted text must adopt a uniform presentation with a specified font, case, colour, type face, orientation and placement identifying the brand and variant name. Packaging which makes a noise, produces a smell or changes after retail sale is prohibited.” </p>

This is the common objective of all tobacco policies or measures. The goal is not to reduce smoking by any particular percentage figure. The control programmes apply a mix of complementary and mutually reinforcing educational, clinical, regulatory, fiscal, economic and social strategies in the effort to reduce smoking prevalence and use. The need for states to adopt multifaceted and complementary approaches is one recognised by the WHO in the FCTC which explicitly encourages the adoption of “comprehensive” anti-smoking strategies, and is also an approach adopted by other jurisdictions across the world, such as Australia. The importance of this is that, as the FCTC reflects, there is a broad consensus at the level of international health policy that to combat smoking requires a portfolio policy approach in which the problem is treated in a variety of different ways.” </p>

Following the introduction over the past 20 years or so of policy measures targeting the impact of advertising, promotion and sponsorship (including the introduction of an advertising ban and display ban), the packaging of tobacco products and the appearance of the cigarettes themselves have become key promotional vehicles for tobacco manufacturers. In 2006, a spokesman for Gallaher (now part of JTI) noted that “<span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Times">marketing restrictions make the pack the hero</span>”. Branded packaging has been described as the <span style="font-family:Times">“</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Times">silent salesman</span><span style="font-family:Times">” </span>and the manufacturers’ <span style="font-family:Times">“</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Times">billboard</span><span style="font-family:Times">”</span>. Tobacco companies do not divulge their internal documents and they have not done so in this litigation. But in the course of litigation elsewhere, and especially in the United States, they have been compelled to provide discovery and there is thus a large body of indicative material that gives an insight into the internal thought processes within the manufacturers. This material suggests that a cat and mouse game is employed between the companies and Governments. As the scope for promotion shrinks through successive legislative interventions so the tobacco companies focus increasingly upon the territory that is left. The importance of the present case is that the packaging and the product itself constitute virtually the last opportunity for tobacco companies to promote their product. </p>

The Defendant’s position is that there is clear evidence establishing a causal relationship between packaging advertising and smoking initiation, especially among the young. Psychology is critical. Brand imagery appeals to the psychological and social needs of the consumer. Over the last decade the tobacco market has seen a proliferation of tobacco brands and brand variants. Colours and branding on packaging and on cigarettes themselves are used to enhance the appeal of products, including to the young, and to communicate different messages to the consumer in relation to the strength, quality and harmfulness of the product. The market has also seen the introduction of innovative packaging intended to introduce a ‘<span style="font-family:Times">wow</span>’ factor through, for example, ‘GlideTec’ packs (Imperial) which are designed to embrace the <span style="font-family:Times">“</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Times">sociability of smoking</span><span style="font-family:Times">”</span>.

He gives a detailed account of the FCTC and its associated Guidelines at [151]-[175] of his judgment.  We have already quoted the reference to the FCTC in recital (7) of TPD2, which implemented the mandatory provisions of the FCTC within the EU, and the judge’s reference to it at [68] of his judgment; and it will be necessary to make further reference to it in various contexts later in this judgment.  We confine ourselves here to developing the judge’s point about the policy laid down in the FCTC.  He states at [18]-[19] that one of the propositions at the heart of the FCTC is that “tobacco use is an ‘<span style="font-style:italic">epidemic</span>’ of global proportions which exerts a catastrophic impact upon health” and that this is the premise for most of the substantive provisions of the FCTC.  Although those provisions include obligations relating to the packaging and labelling of tobacco products (article 11) and tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship (article 13), they do not extend to standardised packaging of the kind introduced by the Regulations.  Article 2, however, encourages the parties to implement measures going beyond those required by the FCTC, and the Guidelines to the FCTC include recommendations that do extend to the subject-matter of the Regulations.  </p>

For various reasons as cited it is not possible to carry out a randomised controlled trial. Even if it was possible it would be extremely difficult to control for all the various confounding factors which are known to affect smoking. However after a careful review of all of the relevant evidence before me I am satisfied there is sufficient evidence derived from independent sources that the introduction of standardised packaging as part of a comprehensive policy of tobacco control measures would be very likely over time to contribute to a modest but important reduction in smoking prevalence especially in children and young adults. Given the dangers of smoking, the suffering that it causes, the highly addictive nature of nicotine, the fact that most smokers become addicted when they are children or young adults and the overall cost to society, the importance of such a reduction should not be underestimated.” </p>

It presented a balanced account of the competing arguments.  Ministers were also provided with a further impact assessment (“the 2014 Impact Assessment”).  The impact assessment considered three options: (a) to do nothing and await the introduction of TPD2, (b) to adopt standard standardised packaging, or (c) to defer the decision again.  It concluded in the light of a detailed cost/benefit analysis that the expected societal benefits from reduced smoking prevalence and the resultant lives saved would be materially larger than the expected costs to society from reduced taxation revenue and costs to businesses:  the total quantified benefits were put at £30 billion, with total quantified costs of £5.2 billion and therefore a net benefit to the public of about £25 billion.  At [138] of his judgment the judge sets out, in full, paragraphs 1-38 of the impact assessment, which he describes at [137] as representing in summary form “the most comprehensive statement of reasons which it might fairly be said reflected the view of the Secretary of State when laying draft regulations before Parliament and … the reasons upon which Parliament acted”.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is not in dispute that a registered trade mark is a species of property. Nor is it in dispute that although one cannot “possess” a trade mark in the sense that one can possess a chattel or a piece of land, it counts as a “possession” for the purposes of the ECHR, the Charter and similar provisions. However, before one can say that a person’s proprietary rights have been affected, it is necessary to identify what those proprietary rights are. Thus before going any further it is necessary to consider what a trade mark is, and what rights the registration of a trade mark confers, because there is a fundamental difference between the parties. BAT says that the registration of a trade mark gives it a positive right to use the mark on the goods in the class for which it has been registered. JTI and Imperial do not go that far, but say that restrictions on their ability to use their registered trade marks in consumer-facing situations are an interference with the rights or freedoms conferred by a registered trade mark. The Secretary of State on the other hand says that the rights conferred by a trade mark are purely negative rights: that is to say the right to stop someone else doing things. If those rights continue in being, and the Secretary of State has not done one of the prohibited acts, there is no interference.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Traders have attached signs to their goods to denote their origin since antiquity. Roman potters often stamped their amphorae with their names, initials or symbols; and mediaeval masons left distinguishing marks on the stones with which they built cathedrals. Goldsmiths and silversmiths applied distinguishing marks to their wares as early as the fourteenth century. They needed no registered trade mark to be able to do this. At common law, subject to the law of passing off which depends on misrepresentation, rival traders were entitled to use similar marks.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">One of the key features of intellectual property, unlike corporeal property, is that infringement of intellectual property rights does not exhaust the property itself. If A takes possession of B’s land, or borrows his car, B is deprived of the use of his land or his car, at least temporarily. But if A works B’s invention, that does not prevent A from working it too, although it may affect the profitability of exploiting it. Likewise if A marks his goods with a sign that is confusingly similar to B’s registered trade mark, that will not prevent B from continuing to use his own registered mark. In addition, registered trade marks, like other intellectual property rights but unlike land or chattels, do not exist in nature. They are the products of legislative intervention. So the legislation must be a good starting point to examine their characteristics. Trade marks exist at two levels: national marks and what were called CTMs.  It is convenient to begin with national marks.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In order to register a sign as a trade mark it is necessary that the sign possesses a distinctive character. Some signs have a character that is inherently distinctive. But other signs may be registered if they have acquired a distinctive character before registration. A sign will only have acquired a distinctive character in that way if it has been used in the course of trade or business. It makes little sense to say that a trader who has in fact distinguished his goods or services by the use of an unregistered sign, thus acquiring distinctiveness, had no right or freedom to use that sign in the course of his trade or business before registering it as a trade mark. Plainly he had every right or freedom to do so (provided that no one else had the right to stop him). Thus in our judgment a right or freedom to affix a distinguishing sign to goods or to designate services by a distinctive sign exists independently of the registration of any trade mark. When a trader registers that sign as a trade mark the registration does not confer on him any right to use the sign that he did not have before. What the registration gives him is the right to stop other people from using a confusingly similar sign (and the other things that the proprietor of a trade mark is entitled to prevent).</p>

First, they say that all the essential functions of a trade mark depend on actual use. Mr Hobbs argued that the description of a registered trade mark as conferring only negative rights was a relic of the common law; and had been superseded by the creation of a positive right in EU law. Second, they say that if a trade mark is not used it is vulnerable to revocation and cannot be relied on to oppose the registration of a similar sign. In its origin a trade mark was a sign of the origin of goods or services. But as the law has developed the courts have recognised that use of a distinguishing sign in relation to goods or services has other functions too. It has done so in the context of determining what functions the exclusive rights conferred by the registration of a trade mark are intended to protect.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is, however, important to appreciate the context of that statement. The court was considering article 4 (1)(b) of Directive 89/104 (now to be found in article 4 (1)(b) of the TMD). That provides for the refusal to register a mark if because of its identity with, or similarity to, an earlier registered trade mark and the identity or similarity of the goods or services covered by the trade marks, there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public, which includes the likelihood of association with the earlier trade mark. All that the court was saying was that in considering the likelihood of confusion between a mark and a sign in use, the analysis must concentrate on the context in which the sign was actually used, whereas in considering the likelihood of confusion between a registered trade mark and a candidate for registration, the question of confusion must be analysed on a broader basis. Moreover, the proposition that registration gives the proprietor a right to use the mark cannot stand with the decision of the court in (Case C-561/11) <span style="font-style:italic">Fédération Cynologique Internationale v Federación Canina Internacional de Perros de Pura Raza </span>[2013] ETMR 399 in which it held that the registered proprietor of an earlier mark was entitled to prevent confusingly similar use of a later mark even though the later mark was itself registered. At [41] the court specifically rejected the argument that registration of a trade mark conferred on its owner a right that could only be called into question by an action for invalidity or by a counterclaim for invalidity in infringement proceedings.

This concerned copyright directives that provided for “exclusive rights to authorise or prohibit” reproduction of works or communication of works to the public. They also provided for in whom such rights should vest. Austrian national law, transposing those rights, described them as “exploitation rights”, and they were so referred to in the question that the national court posed to the CJEU.  The relevant issue before the court was whether these rights were validly conferred by the national legislation on the director of a film or on its producer. In the course of its judgment the court undoubtedly used the expression “exploitation rights” and “the right to exploit” a cinematographic work both in the context of the national legislation and also EU legislation. But the nature of the rights was not in issue; the only issue was: who was entitled to them? Moreover the rights were expressed in the legislation as the right to authorise or prohibit reproduction or communication to the public. The legislation did not purport to confer on the person entitled to the rights the positive right himself to reproduce the work or communicate it to the public.</p>

The official explanation accompanying article 17 emphasises the importance of intellectual property and says that “The guarantees laid down in paragraph 1 shall apply <span style="font-style:italic">as appropriate</span> to intellectual property”. We accept that article 17 of the Charter protects proprietary rights in intellectual property. However we do not accept that article 17 changes the nature of those rights. If (for example) the rights conferred by a trade mark are only negative rights, we cannot see that article 17 creates positive rights. Second, the way in which a person uses property is by exercising the proprietary rights inherent in ownership of that property. If the proprietary rights are negative rights to prevent others from infringing the mark, the owner exercises those rights by preventing infringement. Third, the explanation says that the guarantees in article 17(1) shall apply “as appropriate” to intellectual property. This explanation recognises that some adaptation of the language of article 17 (1) may be necessary in its application to intellectual property.</p>

The court held that such use did not fulfil the essential function of a trade mark which was “to create or preserve an outlet for the goods or services that bear the sign of which it is composed”. Thus the court said at [19] that the rights conferred by a registered mark in relation to a particular class of goods or services could only be maintained “where that mark has been used on the market for goods or services belonging to that class.”</p>

However, the earlier mark had not in fact been put to genuine use. Rather, it was one of a series of marks one other of which had been put to genuine use. Italian law permitted a registration to be maintained if the proprietor was also the proprietor of one or more similar marks at least one of which had been actually used. The CJEU in effect held that that national provision was incompatible with EU law. At [72] the court pointed out that there is genuine use of a trade mark where it is used in accordance with its essential function which is to guarantee the identity of goods or services; and that token use for the sole purpose of maintaining the registration is not enough. At [88] to [101] the court discussed so-called “defensive marks” and held that such marks were incompatible with EU law.

However, Rivella’s CTM had not been used within the EU, although it had been used in Switzerland. It relied on the terms of a convention between Germany and Switzerland which predated the CTMR,   and which provided that a mark was not liable to revocation in Germany if it had been used in Switzerland.  The CJEU held, in effect, that deemed use did not count for the purposes of the CTMR or its predecessor directive. The court pointed out at [48] that the CTMR was an autonomous system which applied independently of any national system.

Article 51 provides for the revocation of a CTM if it has not been put to genuine use “and there are no proper reasons for non-use”. Article 42 deals with opposition to an application for registration based on the existence of an earlier CTM. It provides that an opponent must prove that during the five years preceding the application for registration the earlier CTM has been put to genuine use “or that there are proper reasons for non-use.” There are similar provisions in the TMD dealing with sanctions in article 10 (“unless there are proper reasons for non-use”) and revocation in article 12 (“and there are no proper reasons for non-use”). Article 11 provides that a trade mark must not be declared invalid on the ground that there is an earlier conflicting mark if the latter “does not fulfil the requirements of use set out in Article 10 (1)” but the requirements of use in article 10 (1) expressly include proper reasons for non-use. Likewise article 11 (3) envisages that a trade mark may not be successfully invoked in an infringement action if “the trade mark could be revoked under article 12 (1)”. But a trade mark cannot be revoked under article 12 (1) if there are proper reasons for non-use. </p>

Plainly one highly relevant factor in considering whether an interference amounts to a deprivation or a control of use is whether the complainant has retained legal title to the possession in question. But even if the complainant has retained legal title the ECtHR has recognised that there can be what it has called a “<span style="font-style:italic">de facto</span> expropriation”.  The Tobacco Appellants criticised the judge for using the expression “expropriation” rather than deprivation, but since the ECtHR itself uses that expression we do not consider that it is a valid criticism.</p>

We note from [38] of the court’s judgment that it considered that the case law had been summarised in <span style="font-style:italic">NA v Turkey</span> (2007) 45 EHRR 9; and from [39] that it was not in dispute in <span style="font-style:italic">Yildirir </span>that the demolition of the complainant’s house amounted to a deprivation. The question of what amounted to a deprivation was not therefore in issue in <span style="font-style:italic">Yildirir</span>. We turn then, to <span style="font-style:italic">NA v Turkey</span>. The complainants in that case had built a hotel with the benefit of certificates from two Turkish ministries. Their title was registered at the Turkish Land Registry. A year later an expert reported that the hotel was part of the coastline and could not be the subject of a registration. In consequence the District Court ordered the cancellation of the registration and the demolition of the hotel. On the face of it, it seems to us to be clear that this was a deprivation because not only was the hotel demolished, but the complainants lost their title to it. The court said at [37]:</p>

Quite why it was common ground in <span style="font-style:italic">Yildirir</span> that there had been a deprivation even though it appears that title to the land itself remained with the complainant is by no means clear. As we have said it was common ground in <span style="font-style:italic">Yildirir</span> that what had happened did amount to a deprivation, so the court did not need to discuss that issue. Another case of a <span style="font-style:italic">de facto</span> expropriation is that of <span style="font-style:italic">Papamichalopoulos v Greece</span> (1993) 16 EHRR 440. The complainant owned land in Greece for which he had a construction permit. However, without formally divesting him of title, in 1967 the land was transferred to the Greek Navy Fund, which built a naval base and holiday resort for naval officers on the land. The Greek state in effect refused to return use of the land to the complainant and although some offers of alternative land were made, they came to nothing. At [45] the court concluded:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On the other side of the line, even where the complainant does lose his legal title to the possession in question, that loss does not necessarily amount to a deprivation as opposed to a control of use. In <span style="font-style:italic">JA Pye (Oxford) Ltd v United Kingdom</span> (2008) EHRR 45 the complainant was the owner of land, which had been in the possession of squatters for over twelve years. In consequence, under the system of land registration then in force, it was deemed to hold its registered title on trust for the squatters. (Had the land been unregistered land, title would have been extinguished at the end of that period.) The loss of title was held not to have amounted to a deprivation because it took place under the general law regulating questions of title to land: see [66]. Likewise in <span style="font-style:italic">AGOSI v United Kingdom</span> (1997) 9 EHRR 1 the complainant sold gold coins subject to a retention of title clause. Before title had passed to the buyers they attempted to smuggle the coins into the UK. They were caught and the coins were forfeited. The sellers, who were wholly innocent, complained about the loss of the coins which were still their property. The court held that the prohibition on the importation of gold coins into the UK was a control of use. Since the forfeiture was a measure for the enforcement of that aspect of control of use, it too was a control of use rather than a deprivation. Thus even though the forfeiture of the coins did involve a deprivation of property as far as the sellers were concerned it still fell to be treated under the provisions of A1P1 dealing with control of use. </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Pinnacle Meat Processors v United Kingdom</span> (1998) 27 EHRR CD 217 the ban in question was a ban on the sale of meat deboned from the heads of cattle, which was introduced following the BSE crisis. Although the complainant was forced out of business, and thus lost its goodwill, the Commission nevertheless treated the interference as a control of use. One of the points that it made was that it was still open to the complainant to use its tangible assets in an alternative business. In <span style="font-style:italic">Ian Edgar (Liverpool) Ltd v United Kingdom</span> (Application 37683/97) the ban was a ban on firearms following the Dunblane massacre. The complainant suffered a large drop in turnover and claimed for the loss of goodwill. Again it was held that this amounted to a control of use rather than a deprivation. In <span style="font-style:italic">R (Eastside Cheese) v Secretary of State for Health</span> [1999] 3 CMLR 123 an order was made prohibiting dealing in cheeses which were thought to be unsafe. The effect of the order was to paralyse two businesses which processed cheeses. The Court of Appeal held that the case should be regarded as a control of use rather than a deprivation of property, not least because the order did not transfer ownership and was made with the object of restraining the use of property in the public interest.</p>

The complainant in that case was a shopkeeper. His business was a grocery business but he also sold tobacco products under an excise licence. Hungary introduced a new licensing scheme. The complainant was entitled to apply for a new licence, but he did not get one. In consequence he was forced to stop selling tobacco products with the result that the business was no longer profitable and was wound up. At [29] the court noted that the subject matter of the case was “the statutory cancellation of the applicant’s former licence to sell tobacco, instead of which he was not awarded another one in the tender procedure.” It went on to say:</p>

Given the obvious economic interests connecting tobacco retail with the applicant’s business in general, the Court is satisfied that the statutory removal of the applicant’s long-standing tobacco licence amounted to an interference with his rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1… and this notwithstanding the harmful consequences of smoking as facilitated by tobacco retail.”</p>

We accept that even if an interference amounts to a control of use rather than a deprivation, it is possible in principle for compensation to be required if the control is sufficiently severe.  An illustration of this in the domestic context is <span style="font-style:italic">R (Mott) v Environment Agency </span>[2016] EWCA Civ 564.  In practice, however, a requirement for compensation is rare in a case of control of use.

The main thrust of the challenge to his reasoning relates to the second basis and does not now arise for consideration.  The judge’s reasoning on the basis of control of use is at [791]-[799].  In finding that the Regulations do strike a fair balance in the absence of compensation, he relies primarily on his conclusions in relation to the main proportionality challenge (his ground 5), limiting himself to some additional observations by reference to cases such as <span style="font-style:italic">Vékony v Hungary </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Booker Aquaculture Ltd v Scottish Ministers </span>(Joined Cases C-20/00 and C-64/00) [2003] ECR I-7411.  </p>

If it does not, then the limitation is contrary to the Charter and unlawful under EU law. The Tobacco Appellants therefore argue that the requirement that any limitation must respect the essence of the rights is a separate legal requirement from the requirement of proportionality. We have been referred, among other cases, to the decision of the CJEU in (Case C-477/14) <span style="font-style:italic">Pillbox 38 (UK) Ltd v Secretary of State for Health </span>[2016] 4 WLR 110.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In our judgment this argument fails for a number of reasons. First, as we have explained the <span style="font-style:italic">essence</span> of the right created by registration of a trade mark is a series of negative rights; and those remain in being. The judge made this point at [838]. So far as BAT’s registered community designs are concerned, it remains free to use them for the packaging of anything except cigarettes in the UK, and for packaging cigarettes in the majority of Member States. Second, the right to property recognised by the Charter includes the provision that the use of property may be regulated by law in so far as is necessary for the general interest. This is borne out by (Case C-56/13) <span style="font-style:italic">Érsekcsanádi Mezőgazdasági Zrt v Bács-Kiskun Megyei Kormányhivatal </span>[2015] 2 CMLR 12. In that case the lessee of a turkey farm was prevented by an EU Directive from keeping turkeys on the farm because of an outbreak of avian flu not far away. The argument was that article 17 of the Charter (among other articles) required the payment of compensation. The CJEU rejected that argument. Similarly in (Joined Cases C-120/06 P and C-121/06 P) <span style="font-style:italic">FIAMM SpA v Council of the European Union</span> EU:C:2008:98; EU:C:2008:476 the court stated at [183]:</p>

It has thus held that, while the exercise of the right to property and to pursue a trade or profession freely may be restricted, particularly in the context of a common organisation of the market, that is on condition that those restrictions in fact correspond to objectives of general interest pursued by the Community and that they do not constitute, with regard to the aim pursued, a disproportionate and intolerable interference which infringes upon the very substance of the rights guaranteed.”</p>

In fact the court’s decision in that case was that the use of a particular trade mark (e.g. a mark containing the description of a cigarette as “light” or “mild”) could lawfully be prohibited. One of the factors that led the court to this conclusion was that tobacco companies could still distinguish their products by other distinctive signs. Since the Regulations permit the use of the word marks, we consider that they do not fall foul of the ruling in <span style="font-style:italic">British American Tobacco</span>. It is also notable that in that case (a) the court considered the question of trade marks in the round, rather than mark by mark; and (b) that whether the restrictions were lawful was treated simply as a question of proportionality.</p>

The former are protected against revocation on the ground of non-use whereas the latter are not. Moreover, regulation 13 (2) (b) says in terms that:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There are, in our judgment, at least three answers to this point. First, article 110(2) (which we have quoted) entitles a member state to use its<span style="color:#000000"> civil, administrative or criminal law to prohibit the use of a CTM to the extent that the use of a national trade mark may be prohibited under the law of that member state. It is pertinent to note in this connection that article 110(2) authorises the prohibition of the use of the CTM itself, whether or not the goods or services distinguished by the CTM are prohibited. Mr Hobbs argued that article 110(2) was directed at specific marks rather than classes of marks, but we cannot see any indication in the text of article 110(2) which would support that submission. The Regulations prohibit both CTMs and national marks from being used except in ways permitted by the Regulations. In our judgment this is precisely the kind of measure that article 110(2) permits. So far as the TMD is concerned, it effected an approximation of law rather than a harmonisation; and Recital (7) to the TMD (which we have quoted) left the way open to Member States to apply law other than trade mark law to national marks. Again it is pertinent to note that Recital (7) envisages the application of national law to marks rather than to the underlying goods or services.</span></p>

Thus the Regulations discriminate between national marks and CTMs with the consequence that the Regulations fall outside article 110(2). We consider that this argument has lost all touch with reality. The whole purpose of the Regulations is to prohibit the use of both national marks and CTMs on retail packaging of cigarettes, and that is precisely what the Tobacco Appellants complain about. To suggest that the Regulations do not have this effect is pure Alice in Wonderland. In addition the argument mischaracterises the effect of regulation 13(2)(b). It relates only to section 3 (4) of the Trade Marks Act which deals with grounds on which<span style="font-style:italic"> registration </span>of a trade mark may be refused. The Regulations leave the registrations intact and, as we have explained, there are circumstances in which the exercise of the rights conferred on national marks by registration is permitted.</p>

In addition, the protection given to the national marks is confined to the UK, so that there is no prospect of reliance on the negative rights conferred by registration outside the UK. By contrast the CTMs may be used on retail packaging in almost all other Member States, which in itself will protect them against sanctions for non-use. We pause to note at this point that we were told that there were two brands which are sold exclusively within the UK and that there is no market for them in other Member States. However, it is clear from the jurisprudence of the CJEU that the proprietor of a trade mark need not distort its ordinary commercial activities in order to be able to rely on “proper grounds” for non-use. </span>

Word marks must be treated in the same way as graphic marks and vice versa. There is no category of goods recognised by the TRIPs Agreement as “lawful but lethal”. Although the sale of lethal products could be banned by legislation, with the result that the mark could in practice not be used, it was not possible to ban the mark alone while leaving the sale of the underlying product intact. Thus it was incompatible with the TRIPs Agreement to discriminate against marks associated with tobacco products by outlawing them except in the very limited circumstances permitted by the Regulations.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Underlying much of BAT’s argument on this point was the proposition that the TRIPs Agreement recognises a right to use a trade mark. We have already rejected this argument, not least because article 16 of the TRIPs Agreement itself defines the rights in a negative way; and because the WTO Disputes Panel so ruled. In addition article 19 does not require use as a condition for registration: it begins with the words “<span style="font-style:italic">If </span>use is required”, which appears to give members the option not to require use. Mr Hobbs referred to part of the drafting history of the TRIPs Agreement and its predecessors, notably the Paris Convention. As Mr Hobbs pointed out, the principle that the nature of the goods to which the mark is applied should not be an obstacle to registration was formulated to cover cases in which the placing of the goods on the market was itself unlawful. It seems to us that this is another reason why the TRIPs Agreement does not provide for registration of a trade mark to carry with it a positive right to use. How could it, if a mark can be validly registered for goods that cannot be placed on the market? BAT also accepts that the TRIPs Agreement would not in fact be breached by a subsequent ban on the sale of goods for which a mark had already been registered. But if that is so (and we agree that it is) it makes little sense to say that a member cannot control the circumstances in which a mark may be used in a “consumer-facing” situation. Moreover, article 19(2) specifically contemplates that a <span style="font-style:italic">trade mark</span> may not be capable of being used because of “government requirements” for <span style="font-style:italic">goods</span>. This is an entirely general provision which does not entail that the goods themselves must be banned.</p>

Nor do we consider that article 17 of the TRIPs Agreement is contravened by the Regulations.

It therefore remained open to the EU to legislate in the area of the internal market in a manner which impacts upon intellectual property provided that the legislation is consistent with the TRIPs Agreement, and the EU is permitted to exercise its exclusive power by delegating certain measures to Member States, and thus leaving it open to them to decide what to do.

The fact that the EU is a contracting party to the WTO in its own right necessarily requires fully co-ordinated implementation of the obligations that the TRIPs Agreement prescribes. Where the provisions of the TRIPs Agreement are binding in their entirety upon the EU and its Member States, the effect is to preclude Member States from legislating or adopting legally binding measures having effects upon the availability, scope and use of intellectual property rights of the kind imposed by the Regulations. Accordingly, Member States retain no competence to legislate independently of the EU in relation to the common rules concerning the scope, availability and use of intellectual property rights prescribed by the TRIPs Agreement. BAT’s fallback submission was that, even if some national legislative competence could be said to have survived, Article 2(2) cannot be relied on where the matters belong to “fields in large measure covered by” existing EU legislation relating to trade marks and designs.  </p>

It stated (at [71] – [72]) that the former would amount, in essence, to undermining the harmonisation effected by the TPD2 and such an interpretation would render Article 24(2) incompatible with Article 114, but that permitting further requirements in respect of matters not harmonised by TPD2 would not have this effect.  It concluded (at [83]) that an interpretation of Article 24(2) of TPD2 that “permits the Member States to maintain or introduce further requirements solely in relation to aspects of the packaging of tobacco products that are not harmonised by the Directive renders [it] consistent with [A]rticle 114 TFEU”, and adopted that interpretation. </p>

Article 24(2) expressly provides that it “does not affect” the right of a Member State to introduce further measures standardising the packaging of cigarettes where this is justified on grounds of public health and thus enables it to do so. TPD2 thus only partially harmonises regulation and law in this area. In relation to packaging, within the interpretation given to article 24(2) by <span style="font-style:italic">Philip Morris </span>to render it compatible with TFEU Article 114, that provision therefore empowers Member States to escape from the prohibition on restricting free movement in article 24(1).

That would be in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, which aims to guarantee that action is taken at a local level where it proves to be necessary. The area of the internal market is an area of shared competence save where the EU has occupied the field.  It would be surprising for the Grand Chamber to have made such a major departure from that established position by implication and without an express statement. We consider that it necessarily follows that if the EU has competence to further legislate in the area of the internal market, to the extent that the EU has not occupied the field, Member States also have competence. There is nothing inconsistent with this conclusion in either <span style="font-style:italic">Daiichi </span>or <span style="font-style:italic">Philip Morris, </span>and indeed both decisions support it. In substance this may not be different to the judge’s third reason, although we have not used the term “delegate” which he used at [914]. The term may not be problematic in the precise way the judge used it, i.e. in relation to internal legislation for the internal market, but since the common commercial policy applies to external action, the suggestion that in relation to such action there can be delegation of a power the TFEU gives exclusively to the EU may be inconsistent with the principle that a power should be exercised by the authority upon whom it is conferred: delegatus non potest delegare. </p>

Article 24(1) and (2) of TPD2 are partially harmonising measures, so that the UK has competence to legislate in so far as it is allowed by Article 24(2) or in so far as the matter falls outside the scope of the TPD2.

In response to the claims, the Secretary of State served reports by Professor Hammond and Professor Chaloupka.  This led to second reports from, among others, Professor Viscusi and Mr Dryden on behalf of BAT and from Professor Mulligan on behalf of the Philip Morris claimants.

He states that a remarkable feature of the FCTC is that it marks out the tobacco companies as entities which have deliberately sought to undermine national health policies.  That is based upon the experience of the US courts in litigation in the course of which certain tobacco companies were required to divulge stupendous quantities of internal documentation which has since been placed in the public domain and is searchable on-line.  The material shows <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia </span>that the outward facing public statements of those certain tobacco companies are contradicted by their own inward facing private deliberations and analyses. In the circumstances the FCTC requires that contracting states should exercise vigilance when dealing with the tobacco companies and should ensure that they act with accountability and transparency.  The conclusions of the WHO and the US courts bear upon the dispute between the Secretary of State and the tobacco companies as to the reliability of the evidence submitted by the tobacco companies.  The conclusions from the US courts are so far-reaching and the evidence so compelling that it is not surprising that the WHO concluded that there was an evidence base upon which to found their recommendations to apply vigilance and demand accountability and transparency in their dealings with the tobacco companies.  </p>

The requirement that experts should act with transparency and accountability is the cornerstone of “best practice” regimes applied by regulators worldwide when seeking to evaluate empirical evidence advanced by companies under investigation.  The approach now adopted by the international research community and by regulators represents common sense rules of evaluation.

I say “largely” because the quality of the evidence submitted to this Court (which included all of that tendered during the consultation) was sometimes of remarkably variable quality. Some of it was wholly untenable and resembled diatribe rather than expert opinion; but some was of high quality, albeit that I am still critical of it, for instance, because it ignores internal documents or was unverifiable. </p>

This entailed taking each criticism (for instance that a piece of research was not peer reviewed, or was outside the expert’s normal field of competence, or included assumptions which were not backed up with evidence, or which ignored the existing literature base, or which appeared to arrive at a conclusion which ran counter to internal documents of the tobacco companies) and checking its accuracy against the other documents in the voluminous Court file. My conclusion was that, where I was able to conduct a proper cross-check, it was a validly made criticism. It is notable that the Claimants have not materially challenged the detailed and highly particularised methodological criticisms made of their expert evidence. Rather they attack the criticism at source, contending that the “best practice” principles advocated by the Secretary of State are irrelevant, misguided or flawed and that accordingly criticisms based upon these principles simply do not strike home. </p>

In relation to basic methodological principles, he explains at length the importance of independence, of the process of peer review, of being able to benchmark the claimants’ expert opinions against the internal documents generated by the claimants themselves, of addressing the existing literature base, and of transparency and the ability to verify.  He examines the Secretary of State’s criticisms of the claimants’ evidence and finds in particular that Professor Hammond’s methodological critique of the claimants’ expert evidence should be taken as essentially accurate.  He then summarises the claimants’ submissions and details their criticisms of evidence relied on by the Secretary of State.  At [368]-[376] he sets out his general conclusions, which are reflected in the summary passages we have already quoted.  He goes on to examine particular criticisms of the methodologies used by BAT’s experts.  For that purpose he takes his general conclusions as the starting point; he refers to Professor Hammond’s criticisms but makes clear that he has come to his own conclusions about particular pieces of expert evidence relied on by BAT and that his own cross-referencing of Professor Hammond’s methodological criticisms substantially bears out the professor’s conclusions about methodology.  He applies his overall conclusion, at [404], both to the generality of the tobacco companies’ expert evidence and to the evidence specifically relied on by BAT.</p>

He starts by referring to recent decisions of the Supreme Court and CJEU to the effect, as he expresses it, that in relation to proportionality challenges the courts must consider the most up to date evidence and must engage in detail with that evidence, that the actual intensity of review may be variable and may depend upon the margin of appreciation to be afforded to the decision-maker, but that nonetheless the court must form its own conclusion about the evidence, even though the assessment might be of evidence that was not before the original decision-maker.  He points to the difficulties arising in a case such as this, where the claimants have launched a root and branch attack upon the suitability and appropriateness of the Regulations and have adduced a very substantial body of new expert economic, econometric and other evidence concerning the position in Australia which was not considered during the process leading up to the promulgation of the Regulations.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The shape of the case before him on the appropriateness issue is set out at [31]-[34] of his judgment.  He refers to the claimants’ submission that their new evidence is utterly compelling:  the evidence relied upon by Parliament was essentially qualitative and “soft”, whereas post-implementation of the Australian legislation there is now “hard” evidence of how standardised packaging will actually work in a market which is similar to that of the United Kingdom.  Put shortly, the claimants argue that the evidence now generated in Australia proves that measures of this sort will harm but not improve public health and that accordingly the Regulations are neither suitable nor appropriate.  They advance a theory which, in very simplified terms, works like this: standardised packaging will by its very nature wipe out the attractiveness of branding. As such all tobacco packaging and products will become uniformly drab. Brand loyalties will in consequence weaken and consumers will “downtrade” to the lower priced products. In further consequence they will, on average, spend less on tobacco products than before. All things being equal, if prices go down demand tends to go up, so that downtrading will lead to an increase in use of tobacco. This increase will not be counterbalanced or netted off by the demand depressing effects of standardised packaging because there is no proper evidence that factors such as the increased saliency of health warnings and/or the reduction in appeal of tobacco packets and products will exert any serious demand depressing effects. As such they will not counteract the stimulant effect on demand of downtrading. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The judge then refers to the Secretary of State’s contention to the contrary, that standardised packaging will generate modest but significant reductions in prevalence. The Secretary of State relies upon the substantial corpus of qualitative research worldwide conducted over more than two decades which analyses, from a wide variety of perspectives, how different consumers react to different advertising, promotional and branding techniques and he says that this type of evidence is powerful and one directional and that it remains cogent and relevant even in a world where data relating to prevalence and use from Australia is becoming available. The Secretary of State also relies upon quantitative regression analyses conducted by his own instructed experts and by experts instructed by the Australian Government based upon the actual experience in Australia which it is said, and notwithstanding that it is still early days, shows that standardised packaging <span style="font-family:Times">is </span>working in Australia. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The judge explains that the response of the claimants is to adopt three broad lines of attack: (i) they adduce expert evidence which challenges the worldwide qualitative evidence and research base upon the basis that it is simply illogical and adopted flawed and unreliable techniques; (ii) they adduce expert economic evidence to establish that the economic theory of downtrading leading to increased demand is logical and consistent with normal principles of market economics; and (iii) they adduce new quantitative regression analyses to establish that in actual fact their prediction that downtrading would cause demand to increase has been borne out by experience and events in Australia.</p>

I have found that the econometric regression analyses conducted by the experts instructed by the Secretary of State is consistent and in line with the qualitative evidence and also consistent with a detailed post-implementation review conducted by the Australian Government (2016) which included new quantitative analysis. I reject the submission of the tobacco companies that their evidence is compelling; it is far from such. I accept the thrust of the methodological criticisms levelled by the Secretary of State at the Claimants’ evidence, though I emphasise that my conclusion on proportionality is independent of my findings on methodological quality.

He considers the test to be applied to the evidence and its practical application.  He then considers the applicable principles of law and identifies a number of relevant considerations, including the point that health is an area of legislative activity to which immense importance is attached and where decision-makers are habitually accorded a wide margin of appreciation (see [438]-[441]); the prospective nature of the decision-making exercise, in seeking to predict the health outcomes in a future counter-factual market where advertising or branding on packaging and on products is substantially outlawed (see [443]-[445]); the existence of a margin of appreciation in the area of partially harmonised health measures (see [446]-[447]); that the complexity of the economic, social or scientific evaluation feeds into the breadth of the margin of appreciation (see [448]-[449]); the fact that the Regulations were approved by Parliament under the affirmative resolution procedure (see [450]-[454]), picking up a point also made at [149], albeit the force of the point is said to be somewhat diluted by the requirement for the court to assess evidence that was not before the decision maker; the fact that there is to be a mandatory review of the Regulations within 5 years (see [455]-[460]); the absence of objection from the European Commission (see [461]-[463]); the existence of an international consensus that standardised packaging would contribute to enhanced public health (see [464]); and the applicability of what the judge describes as “the precautionary principle” (see [465]-[472]).</p>

He examines the qualitative evidence relied upon by the Secretary of State, both as to whether there would be “intermediate effects” (i.e. reduced prevalence due to the increased efficacy of health warnings and/or the reduced appeal of packaging) and, if so, whether they would be of sufficient magnitude to offset any negative effects flowing from downtrading.  This involves consideration of Professor Hammond’s evidence (see [491]-[500]).  There is also an account of qualitative evidence from Australia as to the effect of the standardised packaging legislation in that country (see [501]-[508]).  The judge then moves to the quantitative evidence relied upon by the Secretary of State, in particular the evidence of Professor Chaloupka, a post-implementation report (“the PIR”) prepared by the Government of Australia, and a report by Dr Chipty relied upon in the PIR  (see [509]-[534]).  </p>

He then considers the claimants’ criticisms of the Secretary of State’s reliance on the pre-existing literature (see [561]-[568]), followed by consideration of the Secretary of State’s challenge to the assumptions underpinning the claimants’ criticisms of the quantitative evidence relied upon by the Secretary of State (see [569]-[574]).  This leads to an analysis of what were alleged by the claimants to have been “hard-edged” errors undermining Professor Chaloupka’s own research analysis and his criticisms of Professor Mulligan (see [575]-[584]).  The judge makes repeated findings to the effect that the dispute between the experts in this area is not capable of resolution by the court: that, for example, “This is, in my judgment, <span style="font-style:italic">par excellence </span>an area where reasonable experts can disagree” (see [556]); that “it is virtually impossible to say who is right and who is wrong” (see [579]); and that “this is a point over which there is reasonable disagreement between the experts” (see [583]).</p>

He finds that the <span style="font-style:italic">qualitative</span> evidence relied upon by the Secretary of State is “cogent, substantial and overwhelmingly one-directional in its conclusion, which is that various types of advertising and branding <span style="font-style:italic">are</span> effective in influencing consumer reactions” (see [592]).  As to the Secretary of State’s quantitative evidence, he refers to the regression analysis conducted by Professor Chaloupka and to the challenge by Professor Mulligan and Mr Dryden to that evidence, and finds that “the disputes represent reasonable differences between reasonable experts” (see [595]).  This leads to the <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> conclusion at [596] that the evidence base clearly establishes that the Regulations are suitable and appropriate as measures designed to achieve the stated objective of reducing prevalence and use of tobacco.  He then turns to consider whether this <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> conclusion “is affected by other factors relating to the probative value of the claimants’ quantitative evidence and other margin of appreciation factors” (<span style="font-style:italic">ibid.</span>).  His consideration of those factors, at [597]-[629], sets out some of the main reasons why in his opinion the claimants’ quantitative regression analyses do not have the probative value claimed for them; applies the conclusions he had reached under ground 2 on the relevance of adherence to proper methodological standards; and refers to the considerations he had identified as indicating that he should apply “a relatively broad latitude to the evidence adduced by the Secretary of State”.</p>

The qualitative and quantitative evidence submitted by the Secretary of State during the litigation establishes <span style="font-family:Times">prima facie </span>a proper basis for demonstrating the suitability and appropriateness of the Regulations. That conclusion is supported and reinforced by my analysis of the Claimants’ evidence. The quantitative (econometric) evidence adduced by Professor Mulligan and Mr Dryden was sophisticated and thorough. It does not however serve to exclude the competing quantitative evidence relied upon by the Secretary of State. The Claimants’ evidence was not benchmarked against potentially inconsistent internal documents from the Claimant tobacco companies, it had not been through any verification process (whether peer review, or regulatory evaluation, or a pre-hearing process such as that described above), and the assumptions which provided its bedrock were opaque. Furthermore, there are serious doubts as to whether the data which is relied upon is, as yet, sufficiently voluminous or longstanding to be robust and reliable. Ultimately, the disagreements between the experts were no more than reasonable experts disagreeing over the nuts and bolts of the regression analysis. There were no “hard edged” errors identified of a type which would lead a Court to conclude that the Secretary of State’s quantitative evidence was so flawed that it should be discounted or ignored. My conclusion is further supported by various factors which indicate that a relatively broad margin of appreciation must be applied to Parliament even when viewed through the up to date evidential optic of the proceedings before this Court. For all of the above reasons, and on the basis of the most up to date evidence, I reject the Claimants’ submission that the Regulations are disproportionate because the measures are not appropriate or suitable.”</p>

I also reject the submission that applying a “<span style="font-style:italic">fair balance</span>” test of proportionality and balancing the public and private interests the Regulations are disproportionate.  As to this latter point the submission of the tobacco companies was that there was nothing exceptional about tobacco which was a lawfully marketed product.  The companies had a powerful private interest in their property rights (mainly trade marks) which trumped the public interest arising.  Counsel for the Secretary of State reformulated the argument as a claim that the tobacco companies had the right to maximize their profits for the benefit of shareholders by promoting a product that shortened lives and caused a health epidemic of colossal proportions and which imposed upon the state a vast financial cost. If one examines the issue purely by comparing the monetary losses the tobacco industry assert that they will incur against the costs which would be saved to the public purse by the Regulations, the balance comes out very clearly indeed on the side of the public purse.  Yet it is wrong to view this issue purely in monetised terms alone; there is a significant moral angle which is embedded in the Regulations which is about saving children from a lifetime of addiction, and children and adults from premature death and related suffering and disease.  I therefore reject the Claimants’ case that the Regulations are disproportionate.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At [666]-[679] he sets out his analysis and conclusions.  He gives a series of reasons why in his view the claimants’ argument does not succeed.  He refers to “the absence of quantitative or indeed any evidence as to the actual level of tax increase that the claimants submit would be sufficient to achieve the objective of standardised packaging”, expressing the view that the claimants’ argument amounts to mere assertion.  He notes the linkage between excise duty increases and the incentive for duty unpaid products to be imported, but he states that the claimants have conducted no material analysis or evidence of the impact on illicit trade of a significant further rise in excise duty.  He points to a core tenet of the FCTC that contracting states should use a range of different measures to attack tobacco supply and demand from all angles; that tobacco control policies should be comprehensive.  He observes that one aspect of the justification for standardised packaging is the removal of health inequalities and that using tax as the sole or dominant method of control risks placing a disproportionate burden on the socially and financially disadvantaged, whereas standardised packaging does not have this financial effect.  Under the heading of consistency with international law, he states that the FCTC specifically identifies advertising on packaging and products as causative of a health risk, with no hint of a suggestion that the same suppressive effect as an advertising ban could or should be achieved through tax.  He states that if, as was accepted, the precise effect of the Regulations is not quantifiable, then it is impossible to modulate tax so as to achieve the same effect, and that all that could be done is “to err on the side of caution and impose a tax increase which was of a magnitude which would safely exceed any possible effect of the Regulations”, but this risks being a blunt instrument and “highlights why tax and advertising restrictions are part of a complementary suite of measures rather than substitutes for each other”.  He says that no evidence has been adduced to support BAT’s assertion that other measures would suffice.  He indicates that it is not possible to analyse relative restrictiveness, stating that in the light of the fact that the core objection of the claimants concerns the impact upon their property rights and their ability to use those to maximise profit, “it is hard to see how a tax which reduces the profits of the tobacco companies is more or less restrictive than advertising restrictions which achieve the same end”.  He refers finally to the margin of appreciation, stating that in <span style="font-style:italic">Scotch Whisky </span>the CJEU did not say how the margin of appreciation translated into an actual test but had wrapped everything up in a test of objective reasonableness, which the judge says he has applied.

He states that he must balance the interests of the claimants with those invoked by the State.  As to the latter, the protection of public health is recognised in law as one of the highest of all public interests that can be prayed in aid, and the unchallenged facts about the specific adverse health consequences of tobacco consumption place the suppression of tobacco usage towards the top end of the public health category.  To be set against this are the rights of the tobacco manufacturers in their trade marks and other property rights to use those rights to promote the consumption of tobacco, their bottom line interest being profit.  The judge examines the financial figures in the 2014 Impact Assessment and the claimants’ expert evidence as to the losses the tobacco companies are likely to sustain.  He refers in addition to non-monetary factors relating to quality of life.  He concludes:</p>

It was to the effect that if, contrary to his primary submissions, it is open to a member state to impose limitations upon the tobacco companies’ use of their intellectual property rights, full and proper effect must be given to article 52(1) of the Charter and article 8(1) of the TRIPs Agreement when assessing the proportionality of any such limitations.  Article 52(1) of the Charter, which we have already quoted in full at [118] above, provides that such limitations must “respect the essence” of the rights and may be made “only if they are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others”.  Article 8(1) of the TRIPs Agreement, also quoted in full at [142] above, provides that the parties “may adopt measures necessary to protect public health and nutrition … provided that such measures are consistent with the provisions of this Agreement”.  It is submitted that those provisions must be read together and that if the judge had given full and proper effect to them he would have found that the Regulations failed the test for proportionality under them.  It is further submitted that any assessment of proportionality must be made upon the footing that the tobacco products themselves are entirely lawful, that from the perspective of EU law the FCTC is not intended to create a competition-free market for tobacco products, and that trade mark rights are an essential element in the system of undistorted competition which the TFEU seeks to establish and maintain.</p>

In previous sections we have rejected the Tobacco Appellants’ case that the Regulations fail to respect the essence of their intellectual property rights and that they are inconsistent with the provisions of the TRIPs Agreement.  Neither article 52(1) of the Charter nor article 8(1) of the TRIPs Agreement requires the principle of proportionality to be applied otherwise than in the normal way.  Each of them allows limitations to be imposed where necessary for the protection of public health.  The judge was entitled to place the weight he did on the public health objectives of the Regulations:  his approach was in line with the high level of human health protection provided for in EU law (see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">Philip Morris </span>at [60]-[61] and [153]-[157]).  He gave detailed consideration to the necessity test:  separate criticisms of his approach to that issue are considered below.  He understood and took properly into account the impact of the Regulations on the Tobacco Appellants’ use of their intellectual property rights, whilst at the same time recognising the insignificant effect this would have on competition between them:  as he put it at [2], “The manufacturers can still place the brand name and variant name upon the box and in this way they can still communicate their identities to consumers and differentiate themselves from their competitors”.  In short, we see nothing in his analysis of proportionality to support the contention that he approached it from an incorrect intellectual property perspective.</p>

Moreover, his findings as to best practice are not dependent on what is said in the FCTC.  Separate criticisms of his approach are considered below; but in so far as the criticism concerns his use of the FCTC and the guidelines, we reject it.  </p>

BAT complains that no submissions were made or invited in relation to the US Judgment; that it was not even included in the bundle of authorities; and that if submissions had been solicited by the judge, BAT would have explained that the judgment did not address the issues before the judge, that the parties were not the same as in the present case (save for British American Tobacco (Investments) Limited, which was ultimately released from the US proceedings), that the UK is a different market with a different regulatory regime, and that the judgment covered a different time period from that at issue in the present case.

Its findings were in line with the conclusions reached by the WHO, and reflected in the FCTC and the guidelines, on the basis of the vast quantity of internal documentation disclosed in various US court proceedings (see, for example, Green J at [300]-[310]).  In the circumstances, the judge was plainly entitled not just to refer to the US Judgment but to deploy it more extensively than the parties had done in argument.  Procedural fairness did not require him to invite specific submissions on it.  Moreover, the points that BAT says it would have made if submissions had been invited do not go to the heart of the judge’s use of the judgment, and we are satisfied that an opportunity to make such submissions would not have affected his essential reasoning or the conclusions he reached.</p>

In summary, it is contended that the judge (a) disregarded important expert evidence from BAT which should have demonstrated to his satisfaction that the Secretary of State had failed to discharge the burden of proof that standardised packaging would be likely to achieve a reduction in tobacco consumption and prevalence that could not be achieved by less restrictive means; and (b) applied different standards so that the expert evidence upon which the Secretary of State primarily relied was given considerable weight and accepted although not independent, not peer reviewed and not compliant with the CPR, whereas BAT’s evidence attracting the same or similar criticisms was dismissed or given little or no weight.</p>

Another section of Professor Hammond’s report examined the evidence on the impact of standardised packaging in Australia, making reference <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia </span>to studies that relied on the Cancer Institute’s Tobacco Tracking Survey (“CITTS”) and the National Tobacco Plain Packaging Tracking Survey (“NTPPTS”).  In October 2015 Professor Viscusi produced a second report, which reviewed the CITTS and NTPPTS data then available, critiqued studies relying on those data and other post-implementation studies referred to by Professor Hammond (and by Professor Chaloupka), and responded to specific criticisms in Professor Hammond’s first report.  In early November 2015 Professor Hammond produced a second report which included trenchant criticisms of Professor Viscusi’s analyses of the CITTS and NTPPTS data and took issue with other aspects of Professor Viscusi’s second report.  This prompted a third report from Professor Viscusi, rejecting Professor Hammond’s criticisms, to which Professor Hammond responded in a third report of his own.</p>

One of the judge’s general complaints about BAT’s experts was the lack of reference to BAT internal documents, but Professor Viscusi was responding to Professor Hammond’s reliance on real-world Australian data and could not fairly be criticised for reviewing the data, forming his own expert view on them and reviewing and responding to the studies discussed by Professors Hammond and Chaloupka.  Professor Viscusi’s evidence was important because, <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>, he addressed the literature base that formed one of the main elements of the qualitative evidence relied on by the Secretary of State; and if the professor’s evidence had been accepted, the judge could not have concluded that the Secretary of State’s qualitative evidence was “overwhelmingly one-directional in its conclusion” (see [592]).</p>

In similar vein, when introducing the facts, he stated at [48] that although he had read and absorbed the <span style="font-style:italic">totality </span>of the voluminous material before the court, it had not been necessary to record or refer to it all in the judgment.  We have no reason to doubt those statements.  It cannot be inferred that because the judge does not discuss or mention particular parts of the evidence, he disregarded that evidence or failed to take it into account.  In any event, at the end of [387] the judge does mention Professor Viscusi’s response to Professor Hammond’s criticisms, thereby showing his awareness of Professor Viscusi’s second and third reports; and he makes further express reference to those reports at [604], where he refers to the limitations in the CITTS and NTPPTS data used by Professor Viscusi.

As to that, the fact that Professor Viscusi’s second and third reports related in part to a review of the CITTS and NTPPTS “real-world” data does not touch the methodological criticisms that Professor Hammond made of Professor Viscusi’s first report and adhered to in the subsequent exchanges.  The judge said at [403] that he had not simply accepted Professor Hammond’s criticisms without verification but had come to his own conclusions as to the applicable best practice standards and the extent to which the BAT evidence matched up to those standards.  The judgment does not deal expressly with Professor Hammond’s separate and additional criticisms of Professor Viscusi’s review of the CITTS and NTPPTS data (see e.g. paragraph 6.23 of Professor Hammond’s second report, where he opines that “Professor Viscusi’s analyses of the CITTS and NTPPTS data violate the most basic standards of data analysis”), but the judge was plainly not persuaded by Professor Viscusi’s evidence.  These were all matters for assessment by him.  It cannot be concluded that he misunderstood the evidence or that he wrongly gave it no weight or that he treated the evidence unfairly.</p>

Mr Crookshank’s evidence consisted of a first report submitted in response to the 2014 Consultation, and a second report served in October 2015 in the judicial review proceedings.  The subject of illicit trade was addressed by the judge at several points in his judgment (see e.g. [132]-[133], [261]-[263] and [669]), although he observed that the subject was raised only lightly in the written submissions to the court and that the risk of the Regulations increasing illicit trade was not seriously pursued by the claimants at the oral hearing (see [261] and [609]).

It is put forward as a separate argument but in practice it has some overlap with the matters just considered.   It is submitted that whereas the judge downgraded and dismissed BAT’s expert evidence on the basis of lack of independence, lack of compliance with CPR Part 35, lack of expertise in smoking behaviour and failure to account for addiction, and lack of peer review, such criticisms applied equally to the Secretary of State’s expert evidence.  Sir Cyril Chantler, who carried out the Chantler Review, was a retired paediatrician with no claimed expertise in relation to smoking behaviour, addiction, psychology or marketing and his report does not purport to be compliant with the CPR, does not address the impact of addiction on consumer behaviour, and is not peer reviewed.  Professor Hammond is an advocate of tobacco control generally and of standardised packaging in particular; his reports in these proceedings are not peer reviewed; and his separate report for the Irish Department of Health, relied on by the Secretary of State, is not compliant with the CPR and does not address the impact of addiction upon consumer behaviour.  A study by Pechey and others which was relied on in the 2014 Impact Assessment was based on subjective judgments elicited from experts on tobacco control.  The Chipty report, relied on in the Australian PIR, was unverifiable, did not address the impact of addiction upon consumer behaviour and was neither compliant with the CPR nor peer reviewed.  </p>

It is submitted that if, as should have been found, the value of the Pechey study was seriously undermined, there was no sound basis for the quantification of alleged benefits in the 2014 Impact Assessment, and Parliament was presented with incomplete information.  In this context, BAT also seeks to make much of the point that in July 2013, after the date of the Pechey study, it was stated in a Prime Ministerial statement that “there isn’t yet sufficient evidence” for going ahead with standardised packaging.</p>

We agree that it was inappropriate to apply CPR Part 35 to expert reports submitted in response to the consultations:  that is a point to which we will return in our comments on the judge’s observations as to the procedure to be adopted in a case such as this.  It may also have been unrealistic to expect that reports prepared within the tight time-frame of a consultation (or indeed that of expedited judicial review proceedings) should themselves be peer reviewed, though the same consideration does not apply to the studies on which such reports were based. But the judge’s concerns about the methodological deficiencies of the claimants’ evidence went wider than failure to comply with CPR Part 35 or absence of peer review: see e.g. the passage quoted above from [23]-[27] of his judgment.

It is submitted that none of the reasons given by the judge is a good reason for applying the principle.  The principle applies only where there is a difference of scientific opinion as to whether particular goods present a risk to human health or the environment; it has no application where there is no uncertainty as to whether the goods present a risk.  For a classic statement of its applicability, see (Case C-41/02) <span style="font-style:italic">Commission v Netherlands </span>[2004] ECR I-11397 at [49]-[54].  The mere existence of a public health objective is not sufficient to bring it into play:  for example, judgments in (Case C-358/14) <span style="font-style:italic">Poland v Parliament and Council</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Pillbox 38 (UK) Limited</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Philip Morris</span> were all handed down on the same date and concerned the same public health measure, TPD2, but the CJEU applied the precautionary principle in only one of them, <span style="font-style:italic">Pillbox 38 (UK) Limited</span>, and did so because it concerned a product in respect of which there remained significant differences of scientific opinion as to the risks presented.  Similarly, the fact that the product is recognised to be “causative of a public health epidemic” is not a good reason:  if goods are known to present a risk, as in the case of tobacco products, the legislature may intervene on the basis of <span style="font-style:italic">prevention </span>of harm, not on the basis of the precautionary principle.  Mere uncertainty as to whether a legislative measure will be effective in restricting products known to present such a risk is not enough: see, for example, the opinion of Advocate General Geelhoed in (Case C-434/02)<span style="font-style:italic"> Arnold André GmbH &amp; Co KG v Landrat des Kreises Herford </span>[2004] ECR I-11829, at [95]-[107], and the opinion of Advocate General Szpunar in (Case C-148/15), <span style="font-style:italic">Deutsche Parkinson Vereinigung eV v Zentrale zur Bekämpfung unlauteren Wettbewerbs eV</span> (Opinion of 2 June 2016) at [69]-[71].   It is submitted that the judge’s erroneous application of the precautionary principle fed into each stage of his analysis, rendering it legally unsound.  Even where the principle does apply, its effect is to enable the legislature to proceed as if the relevant product does present a risk; it does not fundamentally alter the proportionality analysis applied to test the validity of the ensuing measure.  Yet the judge applied it in a haphazard fashion across all assessments falling to be made, widening unjustifiably the Secretary of State’s discretion and distorting the judge’s review of the Regulations.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We accept that in its paradigm application the precautionary principle operates to justify the taking of restrictive action where there is scientific uncertainty as to the existence or extent of the risks at which the action is aimed, not where the risks are known and certain.  It is far from clear to us, however, that the principle (or a close equivalent) has no permissible application in a case where the risks are known but there is uncertainty as to whether a measure will be effective in preventing or reducing them.  It is true that the Advocate General’s opinions in the <span style="font-style:italic">Arnold André </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Deutsche Parkinson </span>cases tend to support BAT’s argument that the principle cannot be applied in that situation.  On the other hand, Advocate General Kokott took a different approach in <span style="font-style:italic">Philip Morris</span>.  In that case there was no scientific uncertainty about the health risks presented by mentholated tobacco products but there was uncertainty as to how a prohibition on menthol cigarettes would affect consumer habits.  It is plain from [155]-[159] of her opinion that the Advocate General considered the precautionary principle to be applicable in those circumstances.  The judge refers to that passage at [269] of his judgment, where he also states that the judgment of the CJEU in the case “did not refer to the precautionary principle in terms, but it did refer to the discretion of the EU in terms which are redolent of the precautionary principle”.  We note too that the CJEU in <span style="font-style:italic">Scotch Whisky</span> stated at [57] that “the referring court may take into consideration the possible existence of scientific uncertainty as to the actual and specific effects on the consumption of alcohol of a measure such as the MUP for the purposes of attaining the objective pursued”.</p>

We say that for two main reasons.  First, the precautionary principle was only one of many factors referred to by the judge as justifying a wide margin of appreciation.  We have (at [185] above) already summarised the passage in his judgment, at [438]-[472], in which he set out those factors.  Exclusion of reference to the precautionary principle would not have altered the judge’s essential reasoning on the margin of appreciation, especially given that the first of his reasons for holding the precautionary principle to apply, namely the public health objective of the measure, echoes his separate and plainly valid point, at [438]-[441], that public health is an area where decision-makers are habitually accorded a wide margin of appreciation.  </p>

The judge pointed out at [410] that the claimants eschewed any test of manifest inappropriateness.  At [412] he noted that he had asked the parties how the court was to be expected to absorb and then process material of the volume and complexity faced by the court in this case, and that this question had resulted in helpful analysis from the parties of how the overarching principles of judicial review translated into practical forensic analysis.  The claimants had put the focus on the Australian evidence.  He said at [413]-[415] that the claimants were not asking the court to decide what the effect of standardised packaging had in fact been in Australia but were inviting the court to accept Professor Mulligan’s quantitative econometric analysis and to reject Professor Chaloupka’s quantitative evidence on the basis that it was flawed and the Secretary of State had no reasonable answer to the evidence of Professor Mulligan; that there were certain errors in the analysis and reasoning of Professor Chaloupka that were so obvious as to be “hard edged” and capable of being categorised as such by the court.  At [416] he said that the claimants had explained further what they meant by a “hard edged” error of reasoning and had done so in terms which provided a broader set of terms of reference for a judicial review in this area:</p>

If there is no (adequate) response or the response is not reasonable, then the Court must quash the measure.  This is what we mean by a hard edged point.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The judge stated at [417] that the claimants’ approach had much to commend it, at least as a starting point; it reflected the fact that the State had the initial burden of proof; and it also accepted that the court could not be asked to decide the merits or demerits of the underlying dispute save where there were clear and unequivocal black/white, right/wrong answers.  He said at [419] that the Secretary of State did not significantly disagree with that overall approach.  This led in to [420]-[421].  Read in its proper context, those paragraphs can be seen not to be introducing an enhanced rationality obstacle or a test of manifest inappropriateness, but to be accepting in substance the approach contended for by the claimants themselves as a practical means of assessing expert evidence of this nature in the context of judicial review.  This did not involve any error of law by the judge, and in any event it is not a point about which BAT can properly complain in this appeal.

Whether or not he is strictly correct to refer to this as a consensus that standardised packaging<span style="font-style:italic"> will </span>contribute to enhanced public health, we see nothing wrong with the broad point he makes by reference to the guidelines.  Nor do we find any error of law in his reliance on the consensus underlying the guidelines.

It is submitted that the judge was wrong to accept the Secretary of State’s argument that suggested alternatives to standardised packaging were not true <span style="font-style:italic">alternatives </span>but were additional measures that could be adopted as part of the government’s comprehensive anti-tobacco strategy, and that the alleged benefits of the Regulations relative to other alternatives did not have to be quantified.  The ultimate objective pursued is a reduction in smoking, including youth smoking, and it is no answer to the contention that there are more proportionate or effective means of achieving the objective to say that the alternative does not fall to be considered as an alternative at all but merely as an additional measure.   The approach taken by the judge to the comprehensive tobacco control strategy empties the concept of proportionality review of all substance.  Further, TPD2 requires that any “further requirements” that may be introduced by Member States must take into account “the high level of protection of human health achieved through this Directive”, which is an exercise that can only logically be performed on a case by case basis whereby the incremental benefit to public health of each “further requirement” is assessed against the benefit achieved by TPD2.  In addition, by accepting that there were temporal uncertainties in assessing the impact of the Regulations and that the goal was not to reduce smoking by any particular percentage figure (these are references to other parts of the judgment, at [614] and [68] respectively), the judge effectively removed the burden on the Secretary of State to establish that the Regulations would deliver <span style="font-style:italic">any </span>identifiable benefit.  The judge erred in concluding that there were no less restrictive measures which met the objectives of standardised packaging.

It is said that those alternatives were wrongly dismissed by the judge on the basis that they did not address the specific objectives of the Regulations and that BAT’s submissions were not supported by evidence and were mere assertions which did not impose upon the state a burden to disprove them.  The burden of proof as to the value and impact of the alternatives identified by BAT lay on the Secretary of State, not BAT.  BAT had discharged its burden by identifying them, including the provision of some supporting explanation and reference to research; it did not have to go further and produce evidence to demonstrate that the alternatives would in fact reduce smoking consumption or prevalence or initiation.  No one suggested that the identified alternatives were absurd or hypothetical or incapable of having an impact on the objectives of the Regulations.  It was for the Secretary of State to demonstrate that the objectives could not be met by one or more of them.  He had not done so.

The judge refers at [667] to the absence of a case as to the <span style="font-style:italic">level</span> of any tax increase and finds at [668] that the claimants “have not modelled the relative benefits of any particular measure of tax increase against the benefits of the new advertising regime” and that their argument “amounts to mere assertion”.  It is submitted that this reasoning is bad.  The judge states at [670] that “no WHO contracting state has adopted a tax only policy”; but it was not part of BAT’s case that there should be a “tax only” policy without any restrictions on advertising etc.  At [673] the judge sets out his view that a tax increase would have to be of a magnitude which would safely exceed any possible effect of the Regulations, which would risk being a blunt instrument “and highlights why tax and advertising restrictions are part of a complementary suite of measures rather than substitutes for each other”; which again fails to treat tax as a true alternative.  At [674] the judge wrongly treats other measures put forward by BAT as “mere assertion” which do not impose upon the State a burden to disprove them.</p>

We have quoted the relevant part of the judgment at the beginning of this section.  We note in particular what the court said at [54]-[56], that the reasons invoked by a member state by way of justification of a measure must be accompanied by “appropriate evidence or by an analysis of the appropriateness and proportionality of the restrictive measure adopted by that state, and specific evidence substantiating its arguments”; that the burden of proof does not extend to proving positively that no other conceivable measure could enable the legitimate objective pursued to be attained under the same conditions; and that the national court must “examine objectively whether it may reasonably be concluded from the evidence submitted by the member state concerned that the means chosen are appropriate for the attainment of the objectives pursued and whether it is possible to attain those objectives by measures that are less restrictive of the free movement of goods”.  In reaching his conclusion on the issue of necessity, the judge applied the test of objective reasonableness laid down in <span style="font-style:italic">Scotch Whisky</span>.

It refers to the multiple policy objectives pursued by the Regulations:  as we have previously explained, those objectives went beyond the “overarching” objective of reducing smoking to the maximum degree in order to improve health, and encompassed a range of specific aims which were substantially the same as the factors listed by Parliament in section 94(4) of the 2014 Act.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The judge plainly had this evidence well in mind.  His analysis took into account both the general policy and the various specific objectives of the Regulations (see e.g. the language of the passage at [671] criticised by Mr Pleming).  We do not accept Mr Pleming’s submission that the specific objectives are to be treated simply as the means by which the overarching objective of a reduction in smoking is to be achieved: effect should properly be given to their separate identification in section 94 of the 2014 Act and in the Secretary of State’s account of the policy pursued by the Regulations.  The existence of those objectives makes the exercise much more nuanced than allowed for in BAT’s submissions; and the existence of evidence that increased taxation discourages smoking, or even that it discourages initiation of smoking by the young, is not enough to get BAT home. The judge was entitled to accept the Secretary of State’s evidence that none of the claimed alternatives, including increased taxation, would achieve <span style="font-style:italic">all</span> of the objectives pursued by the Regulations and that they should be regarded instead as complementary measures forming part of a comprehensive tobacco control strategy, an approach supported by the FCTC.  The Secretary of State’s evidence dealt sufficiently with the case put forward (in fairly general terms) by the claimants as to possible alternatives, and the judge was entitled to find that the Secretary of State had done enough in the circumstances to discharge the burden of proof upon him.  We do not accept that the judge’s approach emptied the concept of proportionality review of all substance or removed the burden of proof on the Secretary of State.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The essence of BAT’s case under this heading is that the judge applied the wrong test to evidence concerning the empirical data generated in Australia following the implementation of standardised packaging in that country.  In particular, there was a serious dispute between, on the one hand, Professor Mulligan and Mr Dryden on behalf of the claimants and, on the other hand, Professor Chaloupka on behalf of the Secretary of State with regard to the use and interpretation of the Australian data. The judge found the dispute to be incapable of resolution, on the basis that it was an area of reasonable disagreement between the experts.  BAT contends that this amounted to the erroneous application of a test akin to the “reasonable body of professional opinion” test in the context of medical negligence (see <span style="font-style:italic">Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee </span>[1957] 1 WLR 583 and <span style="font-style:italic">Bolitho v City and Hackney Health Authority </span>[1998] AC 232).

As there explained, it was the claimants themselves who invited the court to approach the expert evidence (with the focus on the Australian evidence) by determining whether the Secretary of State’s evidence was flawed by “hard-edged” errors or amounted to a reasonable response to the claimants’ evidence.  The judge followed that approach.  His assessment was that the Secretary of State’s evidence was not vitiated by hard-edged errors and that the differences between the experts fell within an area of legitimate disagreement.  It followed, in effect, that the Secretary of State’s evidence amounted to a reasonable response to the claimants’ evidence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In any event we do not accept that the judge’s approach involved the erroneous importation of a “reasonable body of professional opinion” test from the context of medical negligence.  It was compatible with the general approach of the court in judicial review (where it is exceptional for the court to be drawn into the resolution of factual disputes, let alone complex disputes between technical experts) and with the particular role of the court in assessing the proportionality of a measure of this kind.  It is not in doubt that the court is required to make its own assessment of whether a measure satisfies the proportionality test and that, as Lord Sumption put it in <span style="font-style:italic">Bank Mellat </span>at [20], “the question depends on an exacting analysis of the factual case advanced in defence of the measure”.  It is also common ground, as previously noted, that the court’s assessment is not limited to the evidence before the decision maker but also has to take account of any additional evidence before the court.  That is the effect of [63]-[64] of the judgment of the CJEU in <span style="font-style:italic">Scotch Whisky</span>.  But the same judgment, at [54]-[59], places the emphasis on assessment of the evidence adduced <span style="font-style:italic">by the member state</span> and an objective examination of whether “it may reasonably be concluded from the evidence submitted by the member state concerned” that the appropriateness and necessity tests are met.  We do not read this as in any way excluding consideration of evidence submitted by those opposing the measure: on the contrary, such evidence may help to test the analysis and evidence adduced by the state.  But the passage focuses on the evidence adduced by the state and applies a test of objective reasonableness to it.  It seems to us that in expressing the matter in that way, the CJEU was not requiring the national court to go so far as to resolve disputes between technical experts.  In finding in relation to the Australian evidence that reasonable experts may differ, and factoring that in to his assessment of proportionality, the judge in the present case was adopting an approach that in our view fits well with that laid down in <span style="font-style:italic">Scotch Whisky.</span></p>

That was an entirely realistic position for him to adopt. The assessment of the evidence was a matter for the judge and, as we have said, this court would be extremely slow to interfere with his assessment in the absence of an error of law.  We doubt very much, in any event, whether the dispute between the experts with regard to the Australian data could sensibly have been resolved on the basis of the written reports alone.  We were told that at a case management conference prior to the hearing of the claims, the Philip Morris claimants made an application for cross-examination of experts, but this was refused by the judge and his refusal was not appealed.  BAT itself did not even make an application for cross-examination.  It was correct in our view not to pursue the question of cross-examination, but the absence of cross-examination serves to underline the difficulty of determining which of the experts was right and which was wrong in relation to the issues in question.</p>

He states that the approach he has adopted seeks to reconcile the need on the authorities to review the new evidence and form his own judgment on it with the need to pay proper respect to the fact that he is assessing, in a judicial review, the legality of legislation promulgated by a democratically elected Parliament.

As to the test itself, the judge stated (at [892] – [893]) that the duty on Member States to “take into account” the high level of protection provided for by TPD2 “cannot act as a duty to prove with exactitude that TPD2 <span style="font-style:italic">will</span> be effective and/or that standardised packaging measures <span style="font-style:italic">will</span> provide incremental efficacy” because it is a predictive exercise.

What is required by the term “taking into account the high level of protection” is (see [895]) that the Member State must address itself to the issue and it must factor it into its analysis of the evidence.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the application of the test, the Tobacco Appellants submitted that the judge had erred because the UK’s 2014 Impact Assessment and the earlier impact assessment by the European Commission referred to in the UK assessment did not address the relevant questions. The attempt in the 2014 Impact Assessment to compare the health benefits of TPD2 packaging with standardised packaging was fundamentally flawed. They argued this was so because the comparison made was between standardised packaging and pre-TPD2 packaging rather than with TPD2-compliant packaging. Without the proper comparative evidence, the Secretary of State could not discharge his obligation to take into account the high level of protection of health achieved through TPD2. There was no relevant comparative evidence when the Regulations were made. Even if, by the date of the hearing before the judge, such evidence had been provided (which it had not) that could not have cured the defects that existed at the material time. </p>

We consider that those concerning the test itself are not consistent with a fair reading of article 24(2) or the decision of the CJEU in <span style="font-style:italic">Philip Morris, </span>and we do not regard the reasoning in <span style="font-style:italic">Germany v Commission </span>as applicable to article 24. Article 24(2) expressly preserves the right of a Member State to maintain or introduce further requirements to those in TPD2 provided they are justified on grounds of public health, are proportionate, and “take account of” the high level of protection of human health achieved through TPD2. For the reasons we give at [163] ff. above, <span style="font-style:italic">Philip Morris </span>makes it clear that article 24 is a partially harmonising measure<span style="font-style:italic">. </span>The reasoning in <span style="font-style:italic">Germany v Commission</span> is not applicable because it was concerned with article 114. That provision empowers the EU to adopt measures relating to the internal market (see article 114(4) and (5)) but also allows Member States to seek to maintain or introduce measures despite the adoption of a harmonisation measure which “fills the field”. It is for this reason that we do not consider that any appropriate analogy can be drawn between article 114 and the partial harmonisation measure in article 24(2).

We consider that it is unreal and possibly even illogical to maintain that an evidence-based comparison is required to “take into account” the high level of protection of TPD2. We do not find anything in the wording of article 24(2) to suggest that there must be a direct comparative exercise based on specific evidence addressing the relative health benefits of TPD2 packaging and standardised packaging. Indeed, we consider that its language points away from such a construction. As the judge stated (at [889]), the word “maintain” in article 24(2) contemplated such measures which predated TPD2. The fact that, as the judge also stated, the effects of the measures in TPD2 might take quite a long time to become evident after it came into effect also points away from such a construction.  There is no suggestion in article 24(2) that the right of a Member State to introduce further requirements is one that will only exist and be exercisable in the future after evidence as to the effect of TPD2 becomes available.</p>

That assessment was the method which the Secretary of State used to quantify the predictions as to the effect of standardised packaging in the earlier reports, in particular Sir Cyril Chantler’s review (see [28(iv)] above) and the Pechey study to which we have referred (see [213]-[214] above).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Sir Cyril Chantler had concluded that standardised packaging would result in a modest but important reduction in smoking prevalence. The Tobacco Appellants criticised the use in the 2014 Impact Assessment of Sir Cyril’s review on the ground that he had regard to factors which were subsequently banned by TPD2 and that he and the earlier Stirling Review did not compare the post-TPD2 position with the position under plain packaging requirements. We consider that these criticisms and the criticism of the Secretary of State’s reliance on the 2014 Impact Assessment are misplaced and flawed. This is because they are based on the premise that the only way to “take into account” the level of protection achieved by TPD2 is to conduct an evidence-based comparison with the measures in the Regulations, which we have rejected. We agree with the judge that that would involve imposing an impossible burden of proof on a Member State. </p>

They argued that it is fanciful to rely on them as specific evidence. As well as proceeding on the premise that we have rejected, that submission overlooks the usefulness of the FCTC guidelines. They explain that one of the problems is branding on cigarette packaging and presentation of the product. Packaging that complies with TPD2 will retain  logos which are branded, whereas standardised packaging will not. Standardised packaging is a way of overcoming the problem of branding. It is therefore wrong to say that the Secretary of State did not consider evidence on the difference between what will be achieved by TPD2 and standardised packs.</p>

Specific comparative evidence of the impact of TPD2 and the standardised packaging measures under consideration is not required by article 24(2). This is because, when the Secretary of State promulgated the Regulations in 2015, it would be impossible for him to know, with any degree of certainty, what the effect of TPD2 would be. We consider that the judge correctly analysed the evidence taken into account by the Secretary of State and that that evidence shows that the Secretary of State considered the benefits of standardised packaging, which is plainly an aspect of tobacco regulation that is not covered by TPD2.</p>

He relied on the judgment of the CJEU in <span style="font-style:italic">Philip Morris</span> that TPD2 is a measure of partial harmonisation leaving other aspects to be determined by Member States. Kokott A-G considered (at [110]-[111] of her opinion), which on this point was essentially adopted by the court,  that TPD2, in the words of Article 1(b), seeks only “to approximate the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning aspects of the labelling and packaging of tobacco products”. She also relied on Recital 53 in the preamble.

After making preliminary observations (at [981]-[986]) on the need for additional evidence, he considered the evidence on tipping at [987]-[994]. He stated that once there is a proportionate need to regulate the outer packaging of cigarette boxes, there arises a proportionate need to regulate the product itself on anti-avoidance grounds. This, he stated, is because of the inference from the acceptance by tobacco companies that the importance of particular surfaces increases as the scope for other forms of advertising decreases, evidence as to the correlation in design strategies between packaging and the stick and tip, and the unchallenged point that the only difference between advertising on the outer packaging and product was physical location: see [986] of the judgment. </p>

He refers (at [987] ff.) to studies that show the characteristics and appearances of the cigarette itself affect perception of the attributes of the cigarette. He refers to studies by Borland and Savvas; Ford, Moody, MacKintosh and Hastings cited by Professor Hammond and by Mr Mean; a further study by Moody, Ford, Mackintosh and Purves; and qualitative research conducted on behalf of the Australian Government: see [987]-[991]. The judge also referred at [992]-[993] to internal documents by Philip Morris in 1989 and RJ Reynolds in 1985 which demonstrated that colour and brand imagery placed upon the cigarette sticks themselves operated in a manner which is similar to that upon the outer packaging. </p>

It suffices to show that there were and are reasonable grounds for believing that there will be a beneficial effect on public health as a result of implementing the entire range of measures, of which Regulation 5 is just one: see [242] – [243] on the range of policy objectives and the range of complementary measures forming part of a comprehensive tobacco control strategy. He considered and rejected submissions by the Tipping Appellants that the introduction of product restrictions will increase the incidence of illicit tobacco (see [996]-[997]) and the counterfeiting of tipping paper (at [998]), and that an increase in counterfeiting could result in uncontrolled substances being included which would be injurious to public health: see [999]. </p>

Three concerned the <span style="font-style:italic">ultra vires </span>ground. The fourth concerned the rejection of the submission that Regulation 5 is not justified on public health grounds and is disproportionate. The starting point of Ms Bacon’s oral submissions was that the judge erred in finding that, even if Article 24(2) did not provide a basis for Regulation 5, it would fall within the competence of Member States because TPD2 only partially harmonised an aspect of the presentation of the products. She started with this because, if the Secretary of State is correct on partial harmonisation, whatever the meaning of the word “packaging” in Article 24(2), Member States would be entitled to legislate beyond the provisions of TPD2 provided that the measures adopted do not conflict with or replace measures in it. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The first two stages of the Tipping Appellants’ argument are that the basic prohibition in Article 24(1) of TPD2 prevents Member States from restricting free movement of products that otherwise comply with the Directive and that tipping paper is not “packaging” within the meaning of Article 24(2), and therefore that provision does not permit the United Kingdom to legislate for plain cigarettes. We consider the second point below but here assume it is correct. The third stage of the argument is that because the appearance of cigarettes is regulated by Article 13 of TPD2, if cigarettes comply with the requirements of that provision their free movement cannot otherwise be restricted, and that it is only possible to escape from the prohibition on restriction of free movement in Article 24(1) if it is possible to rely on Article 24(2). </p>

She argued that the CJEU’s discussion of Article 24(3) is irrelevant because that provision covers matters that are not harmonised by the Directive. Article 24(2), by contrast, has legal effect and is not purely declaratory. The CJEU in <span style="font-style:italic">Philip Morris</span> at [71]-[72] considered that permitting Member States to maintain or introduce further requirements in relation to packaging would render it incompatible with TFEU Article 114 and concluded that the provision permits Member States to do so “only in relation to aspects of the standardisation of the packaging of tobacco products which have not been harmonised by the Directive”. Ms Bacon also submitted that the judge erred in referring to “pre-existing rights” (for example in [265](i)(v)(vi)) because the question is not what rights Member States would or might have had absent the Directive, but what rights they have in the light of the Directive. </p>

We are also not persuaded by Mr Rogers’ argument that the CJEU in <span style="font-style:italic">Philip Morris</span> at [76] stated that there is nothing in TPD2 which stops the Member States from regulating colour. That paragraph specifically refers to packaging and its logic is not necessarily transferable to the products themselves given that Article 24(2) specifically provides for further regulation of “packaging”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The key point of the decision of the Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Phillip Morris, </span>however, is that TPD2 is a partial harmonisation Directive. The fact that Article 13 contains some regulation of the tobacco stick does not mean that the EU has occupied the entire field and that Article 13 has defined the extent of the permitted regulation. Article 13 regulates the appearance of a very limited category of marks, designs and features and does so only if they mislead or create a false impression about a tobacco product. We do not consider that by implementing Article 13 of FCTC, which is silent on the topic of plain cigarettes, the EU in Article 13 of TPD2 made a positive choice to prevent Member States from standardising the colour of cigarettes more generally. The fact that Article 13 did not explicitly outlaw coloured cigarette papers has to be seen in its context. It is a provision that is aimed at preventing novelty packs and its limited restrictions on the appearance of cigarettes do not in our judgment mean that the EU has “occupied the field” as to all aspects of the appearance of cigarettes. There is also a certain inconsistency in arguing, as Ms Bacon did, that the purpose of the FCTC and therefore of the Directive is not to provide for plain cigarettes or to regulate the appearance of cigarettes, but then to maintain that all aspects of the appearance of cigarettes must fall within the ambit of the Directive.</p>

In view of our conclusion on the “partial harmonisation” point, it is not strictly necessary to consider the other grounds of appeal. We, however, do so relatively briefly. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The first ground is that the judge erred in deciding that the word “packaging” in TPD2 is ambiguous. Ms Bacon submitted that on its ordinary meaning the term “packaging” does not encompass the product that is being packaged and pointed to the distinction drawn in Article 1 of TPD2 between tobacco products and “labelling and packages” of such products. As the Judge recognised (at [977 (ii)]) the fact that there is a definition of “outside packaging” in Article 2 (29) suggests that are different types of packaging. But, contrary to the view of the Judge that the concept has a wide remit embracing all that surrounds the tobacco and is capable of being used to promote it whatever guise or form, the fact that there are different types of packaging does not mean that the term includes the tobacco product itself. The distinction between the tobacco product and “labelling and packaging” is also seen in Recital 27, Article 13 and section 94 (4) of the Children and Families Act 2014 which authorises the Regulations, including Regulation 13. Moreover the definition of tobacco products in Article 2 of TPD2 includes all the components of it, such as paper.  If the paper is part of the tobacco product, it cannot be part of the packaging of that product.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On behalf of the Secretary of State it was argued that “packaging” could be interpreted as including the appearance of the tobacco product as well as its external packaging. The natural and ordinary meaning of the word clearly has two potential meanings. The first is the packet in which the tobacco is sold. The second is the external components of a tobacco product. Reliance was placed on the distinct definitions of “unit packets” and “outside packaging” in Article 2 and the Recitals, in particular Recital 53.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On this point we reject the Secretary of State’s submissions. Although he, like the Judge, is able to point to parts of the Directive which suggest that “packaging” might bear multiple meanings, as Ms Bacon submitted, the fact that there are different types of packaging does not mean that the term includes the tobacco product itself. Accordingly, the definitions relied on do not in our judgement assist the Secretary of State. We consider it strange to argue that the ordinary meaning of the term “packaging” can cover the external parts of the product itself. Article 24 (2) was designed to enable Member States to take plain packaging further than the Directive but the provision is plainly targeted at only plain packaging. It was implementing the FCTC which did not recommend plain cigarettes. Accordingly we consider that the Judge erred in using a purposive approach because it is well established in case law of the EU that a purposive approach can only be used where a provision is ambiguous.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally, we turn to the proportionality argument. We refer to the approach to proportionality in our consideration of the Tobacco Appellants’ appeals. We consider that the Tipping Appellants’ arguments overlook the multiplicity of aims pursued by the Regulations and proceed on the basis of an erroneous and unnecessary requirement of very specific targeted evidence. The evidence before Parliament concerned the impact of tobacco consumer behaviour generally and the Tipping Appellants’ submissions neglect the evidence of the benefit of standardising more broadly. We consider that there was sufficient material before the judge and taken into account by him, to justify his conclusion that there were reasonable grounds for believing that there will be a beneficial effect on public health as a result of implementing the entire range of measures including the restrictions on tipping paper.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For the reasons we have given we have concluded that the appeal against Regulation 5 should be dismissed because the Tipping Appellants have failed to show that the Judge erred in regarding TPD2 as a partial harmonisation measure and in rejecting the argument that Article 13 has occupied the field for regulating the appearance of tobacco products. The Tipping Appellants have requested that the matters arising under the <span style="font-style:italic">ultra vires </span>part of their appeal should be referred for a preliminary reference to the CJEU. In oral submissions, when asked about this, Ms Bacon stated that she was not asking us to make a reference before making a decision but that she would be asking for a reference if she did not succeed. We have considered this question and have concluded that, notwithstanding the fact that this part of this case is concerned with the tobacco product itself, in circumstances in which the CJEU has recently given a detailed judgment on the interpretation of Article 24 (2) of TPD2 in <span style="font-style:italic">Phillip Morris</span>, a case in which the Tipping Appellants participated as interveners, we should not make a reference. The CJEU has indicated that courts should be slow to make a second reference concerning a provision of EU law that has already been considered in a first reference: see (Case C-388/95) <span style="font-style:italic">Wiener SI GmbH v Haputzollamt Emmerych</span> [1997] ECR 6495 and <span style="font-style:italic">R v Secretary of State for Social Services,</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Ex Parte Bomore Medical Supplies Ltd </span>[1986] 1 CMLR 229<span style="font-style:italic">.</span></p>
