The litigation arises out of the way in which, under the regime in force until 5 April 1999, advance corporation tax (“ACT”) and corporation tax under Schedule D Case V were charged on dividends received by UK-resident companies from non-resident subsidiaries.  The original test Claimants in the litigation are all UK-resident companies in the British American Tobacco (“BAT”) group; but they have since been joined, in respect of specific issues, by companies in the Ford and GKN groups.  We will refer to them simply as “the Claimants”.  The Respondents are the Commissioners for Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”).</p>

The Claimants were given permission to appeal on some of the remedy issues.  Those issues included an issue as to the effect of legislation – specifically, section 320 of the Finance Act 2004 and section 107 of the Finance Act 2007 – which was designed to limit or preclude recovery on the basis of mistake in claims such as these.  </p>

The debate between the parties is whether, as the Claimants submit and as Henderson J held, domestic law must give credit for the higher of (i) the actual tax paid by the foreign subsidiary in its own country on the profits distributed by way of the dividend (the effective rate) and (ii) the nominal rate of tax applicable on those profits in its own country (the “foreign nominal rate” or “FNR”) or, as HMRC submitted below and in this court, only at the foreign nominal rate.

This is because the UK system provided tax credits against Case V tax that were normally equal to the tax paid by the foreign company on the distributed profits in its own country. Tax credits were provided either in accordance with bilateral double tax treaties to which effect was given under section 788 ICTA or in accordance with section 790 ICTA. The benefit of such credits was taken at the time when the Case V tax otherwise became due for payment. By contrast, ACT was payable at an earlier time and might be irrecoverable because no Case V tax, or insufficient Case V, became payable.</p>

In the first place, I do not agree that a sharp distinction can, or should, be drawn between the initial stage of determining whether there is a restriction on freedom of establishment, and subsequent stages when issues of justification, cohesion and proportionality are considered. Although it is helpful for analytical purposes to sub-divide the question in this way, and the ECJ frequently does so, the single question which always has to be answered is whether there has been a breach of the relevant freedom. I would find it very surprising if a prerequisite for a compliant hybrid system which the Court has repeatedly identified at the first stage of the analysis were then to become completely irrelevant at the stage when justification is considered. </p>

There was no doubt that the UK provided a credit for underlying tax on dividends paid by foreign subsidiaries; and it is fairly clear that the Court expected its query on domestic tax rates to be answered in the affirmative (i.e. in the sense that the tax rate applied to foreign-sourced dividends was not higher than the rate applied to nationally-sourced dividends). It was therefore unnecessary for the Court to prolong its analysis, in what was anyway an exceptionally long and complicated judgment, to consider what the position would have been if a restriction were found to exist. That only became necessary in [<span style="font-style:italic">FII CJEU2</span>], in the light of the (probably) unexpected answer returned by the national court to the question which (as it then thought) had been remitted to it. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.98in">34.<marker name="tab"/>Thirdly, I am satisfied that the reason for the almost exclusive focus on rates of tax in the Court's discussion of justification is not that the need to provide a credit for underlying tax had suddenly become irrelevant, but (again) that it was not in issue, because nobody disputed that the UK tax system did provide such a credit. It is clear, to my mind, that the Court had not lost sight of the additional requirement of a credit for underlying tax, not least because of the express reference to such tax in the answer to the first question in paragraph 65 of the judgment (and see too paragraph 71, in the context of the second question relating to ACT). If the Court had intended to hold that the only prerequisite for a compliant hybrid system was the grant of a credit at the FNR, it would surely have said so in terms, and also explained why its standard jurisprudence, to which reference was made in paragraph 39, was no longer applicable. I find it particularly implausible that such a radical restatement of principle was intended, in view of the fact that the judge rapporteur in [<span style="font-style:italic">FII CJEU2</span>] was Vice-President Lenaerts, who had also been the rapporteur in [<span style="font-style:italic">FII CJEU1</span>],  and in the Portfolio Dividends case. </p>

Thus the Court clearly did not intend to say "solely", even though it evidently derived considerable assistance from the Commission's submissions. The word which the Court chose ("notamment") was in my view apt to make the point that a credit at the FNR would normally suffice, but a credit for underlying tax also had to be given in case it was higher.”</p>

It therefore prima facie contravened articles 49 and 63. Secondly, that conclusion was displaced because the need for cohesion in the tax system justified some restrictions on the freedom of establishment and the movement of capital. But, thirdly, the restrictions went further than was necessary to achieve that purpose and so were disproportionate. The UK provisions were therefore unlawful only to the extent that they went beyond what was proportionate. Fourthly, the CJEU (unusually) spelt out the modification required to make the system proportionate and therefore compliant with EU law in its judgment at [62], cited above.</p>

This requirement was satisfied by the double taxation arrangements to which we have referred. In very large part, credit was given for the amount of tax paid on the distributed profits in the foreign company’s home state, whether that was less than, more than or the same as tax on those profits at the foreign nominal rate. In considering the problem posed by the difference between effective rates and nominal rates, the court in <span style="font-style:italic">FII CJEU2</span> did not need to, and in our view did not, re-visit that requirement. It was concerned to examine only the need to comply with the other condition as a result of the finding by the English court that in a majority of cases in the UK the effective rate was less than the nominal rate.

The fact that, in the case of non-portfolio dividends, the UK company was generally entitled to a credit against its charge to Case V tax on the dividend at a rate equal to the rate paid by the foreign company on its profits does not displace the requirement but shows how, in the case of Case V tax, the UK generally met it.</p>

In this way, maximum advantage can legitimately be taken of the credit for tax actually paid, calculated in accordance with section 801 ICTA which is itself applied to dividends paid by mixer companies on the basis of blending and weighting the tax that has been paid overseas on the underlying profits. </p>

Those practical considerations do not apply where the dividends have throughout remained in a single multi-national group of which the UK recipient is a member. It is therefore not suggested by the Claimants that either the second or the third solutions would in practice be unworkable. Indeed, it is common ground that the necessary information can be retrieved without undue difficulty, because it had to be collected and submitted to the Revenue for the purposes of claiming double taxation relief for the actual underlying tax on the dividends. I do not, therefore, start with any predisposition to hold that solution (a) is the correct one in cases of the present type.”</p>

The question of the unlawfulness of the Case V charge does not arise in a legislative vacuum. It has to be considered in the context of the actual tax system operated by the UK, which was binding as a matter of domestic law and has to be applied by the English court subject only to any disapplication or conforming construction which may be needed in order to make it compliant with EU law. The introduction of a credit for tax at the FNR should therefore be implemented in a way which, as far as reasonably possible, reflects and goes with the grain of the existing UK legislative scheme. It seems to me that the claimants' approach respects this principle more closely than the Revenue's, because it adapts and builds on the existing machinery for giving credit for underlying tax. It is not an objection to this approach, in my judgment, that the grant of relief from juridical double taxation of cross-border dividends, of which the s 801 machinery forms part, is not itself required by EU law. The point is, rather, that the machinery formed an integral part of the UK's existing system for taxation of cross-border dividends which has to be made compliant with EU law.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">55.<marker name="tab"/>Another aspect of the same point, in relation to mixer companies, is that the claimants' approach does less violence to the actual facts than the Revenue's approach. The main (if not the only) purpose of such companies, before the introduction of the eligible unrelieved foreign tax ('EUFT') rules in 2001, was to blend income streams which carried different rates of creditable underlying tax in such a way that the higher rates were offset by the lower, and the weighted average rate was no higher than the UK nominal rate. This is what actually happened, and the onward dividends received by the UK water's edge company were blended ones to which the s 801 machinery applied. By contrast, the notional disaggregation of the blended income streams in accordance with the Revenue's methodology contradicts the actual blending which the mixer company was designed to achieve, and seeks to undo (in relation to nominal rates of tax) the legitimate tax planning which led to the actual blending of the dividends in the first place. The significance of this becomes apparent when it is recalled that, if the Revenue's argument on Issue 1 were correct, the only credit required by EU law would be a single credit at the FNR. The Revenue say that this credit should be calculated on a basis which, in effect, posits a lawful Case V charge even where such a charge could not in fact have been imposed because of the availability of double taxation relief for underlying tax. A reconstruction of this nature seems to me to go well beyond the proper bounds of conforming interpretation.”</p>

It is only in respect of distributions of profits originating in the EU that the operation of the Case V charge needs to be modified in order to make it compliant with EU law. This follows from the fact that, in relation to distributions by subsidiaries, in contrast to portfolio dividends, the only fundamental freedom under EU law which was infringed by the Case V charge was freedom of establishment. Although the Case V charge was in principle capable of engaging art 56 EC (free movement of capital) in relation to distributions by third country subsidiaries, any infringement of it, at least prior to the introduction of the EUFT rules, was admittedly protected by the standstill provisions of art 57(1) EC: see FII (CA) at [72]. Accordingly, I believe it to be common ground, and (if not) it appears to me correct in principle, that any third-country source income which was paid up through an EU mixer company in whose hands it was exempt from tax should be disregarded in calculating the FNR credit required by EU law. There can be no objection in principle to the imposition of the unmodified Case V charge on distributions of profits which originated in a third country, and which have not been subjected to tax in the EU, even if they formed part of a blended dividend paid up by an EU mixer company.”</p>

It rests on a misconception regarding the operation of the Marleasing interpretive principle and of the ruling given in FII (CA). Application of that principle does not make it irrelevant which particular statutory provision in a group of provisions is being interpreted. On the contrary, it is a principle of interpretation which is applied to give a specifiable and specific meaning to a particular provision (or series of provisions, taken one by one), even if it allows considerable latitude as to the wording which may be read into the provision (or provisions). In considering whether a particular conforming interpretation can be given to a particular provision, the court has to check to see that that proposed interpretation does not go against "the grain" of the legislation in question or conflict with its cardinal features. This was the exercise performed by this court in FII (CA) to arrive at the particular conforming interpretation it identified for a specific section, namely section 231(1) of ICTA.”</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“[54]<marker name="tab"/>As to the difference in approach which is reflected in the example which I have discussed, I consider that the Claimants' approach as set out in their alternative case is to be preferred. The question of the unlawfulness of the Case V charge does not arise in a legislative vacuum. It has to be considered in the context of the actual tax system operated by the UK, which was binding as a matter of domestic law and has to be applied by the English court subject only to any disapplication or conforming construction which may be needed in order to make it compliant with EU law. The introduction of a credit for tax at the FNR should therefore be implemented in a way which, as far as reasonably possible, reflects and goes with the grain of the existing UK legislative scheme. It seems to me that the Claimants' approach respects this principle more closely than the Revenue's, because it adapts and builds on the existing machinery for giving credit for underlying tax. It is not an objection to this approach, in my judgment, that the grant of relief from juridical double taxation of cross-border dividends, of which the section 801 machinery forms part, is not itself required by EU law. The point is, rather, that the machinery formed an integral part of the UK's existing system for taxation of cross-border dividends which has to be made compliant with EU law.”</p>

So, in calculating the amount of tax that the UK could lawfully charge under EU law, the UK tax rate should be applied to the gross amount of the dividend received by the UK company (i.e. the dividend received is grossed up to include both withholding tax and the underlying foreign tax) and then compared with the FNR or foreign effective tax. The difference is the amount of tax that may be charged as a matter of EU law. If the difference is equal to or more than the amount of Case V actually charged, which amount would be calculated after giving credit for withholding tax, HMRC submit that no tax will have been unlawfully charged as a matter of EU law. In other words, in making this calculation, the UK company’s entitlement under domestic law to a credit for withholding tax is ignored but HMRC takes it into account in calculating whether it has charged too much tax.</p>

The claimants' approach, in outline, is to take the UK system as it actually operated, and make adjustments to it designed to accommodate the tax credit required by EU law at the point of entry of the EU dividend into the UK. The dividend is thus regarded as carrying a tax credit in the same way as a dividend received by the water's edge company from a UK subsidiary would have done, although the quantum of the credit is not necessarily the same because the credit required by EU law may in certain circumstances be less than a domestic credit at the ACT rate. The credit thus identified is then treated as available for use within the group in the same way as a credit attaching to domestic FII, and is set against the actual ACT payable on subsequent distributions (usually at the level of the top company in the group, because of group income elections). </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">119.<marker name="tab"/>The Revenue's methodology, by contrast, starts from the proposition that it is only when ACT was actually paid that it is necessary to determine whether any of it was unlawful. It is therefore necessary to begin by identifying the EU source income comprised in the dividends which trigger the actual charge to ACT. Since the charge was usually imposed at the top of the group, after payment up of all or part of the EU income originally received by the water's edge company through one or more intermediate holding companies, and since all the UK companies involved usually had other sources of income, the Revenue have to devise a mechanism for tracing the original EU income as it passed up the group until the stage when ACT became payable. This is an exercise which has no analogue in the UK ACT system, and it involves the making of a number of sometimes arbitrary assumptions, as well as calculations of very considerable complexity. </p>

For this purpose, the Revenue calculate the maximum rate of ACT which they say could lawfully have been charged in respect of each stream of EU income represented in the dividends, and express that rate as a percentage which is then compared to the actual ACT rate charged on the dividend. Only to the extent that the ACT actually charged on the EU income components of the dividend exceeds the maximum lawful percentages attributable to those components is the charge unlawful.”</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“145.<marker name="tab"/>In arguing for the claimants' approach, Mr Aaronson rightly went back to first principles. That which needs to be remedied, he submits, is the failure of the ACT system to provide a credit for underlying tax and/or tax at the FNR in the case of EU dividends, because only in that way (according to the analysis of the ECJ) could the UK have justified its decision to counter economic double taxation of corporate profits by the adoption of a dual system of exemption for domestic dividends and imputation for EU dividends. The remedial tax credit needs to be given, and fed into the ACT system, at the UK water's edge, rather than at the level when ACT in fact became payable, because when the dividend reaches the UK it has already been subjected to foreign tax on the distributed profits. The essence of the domestic ACT system is that, when a dividend is paid out of profits which are subject to corporation tax, ACT is payable and the aggregate amount of the dividend and ACT then constitutes FII in the hands of the recipient company. Thus in order to achieve parity of treatment of EU dividends in the hands of the UK water's edge company they must be treated in the same way as dividends received from UK subsidiaries in respect of which ACT has already been paid. The critical point is that, at the stage of receipt in the UK, the EU dividends have already borne actual foreign tax. In order to remedy the unlawful discrimination identified by the ECJ, the foreign tax must be regarded as equivalent to domestic ACT, and the sum of the dividend and the foreign tax credit must be treated as equivalent to FII. </p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">146.<marker name="tab"/> If the matter is viewed in this way, submits Mr Aaronson, it can be seen to be irrelevant that EU dividends were in fact normally paid up the UK group under group income elections, with ACT only becoming chargeable at the top level. In order to remedy the unlawful discrimination under EU law, the dividends must be treated as if they had already borne a tax equivalent to ACT when they were received at the UK water's edge. In order to avoid a double charge to tax, the dividends and their associated tax credits must thenceforth be treated as equivalent to FII. For remedial purposes, it is too late for the dividends to be the subject of notional group income elections, because the payment of ACT which such an election would postpone has already taken place.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The judge noted as important at [147] that in <span style="font-style:italic">FII CJEU2 </span>the court had rejected the UK's argument that where the UK water’s edge company paid dividends under a group income election there was no discrimination at that stage, because there was no actual charge to ACT. In holding, contrary to the UK's case, that a restitutionary claim could be made by the parent company which in fact paid the ACT, the court was focusing on the ACT system as it operated in practice, and in particular on the way in which tax credits generated at a lower level would be passed up so as to frank dividend payments at a higher level. Dividends at the higher level would be franked by those tax credits, regardless of whether a later dividend was paid out of the same profits as the original dividend and regardless of any other sources of income which may have fed into the parent company's profits and the dividend paid by it. Henderson J described this as a cardinal feature of the ACT system, which was respected by the Claimants' method but contradicted by HMRC's method.</p>

He considered it be conceptually unsound, in particular because it ignored the operation of the FII system and lacked the essential element of assimilating EU income into the FII system from the water’s edge company. This fatally undermined HMRC's method.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The fundamental submission for HMRC before us, as before the judge, was that no issue of unlawful ACT arises until ACT is charged in respect of a dividend which comprises or includes profits derived from EU-sourced dividends. At that stage, the amount of unlawful ACT can be calculated. In the context of a group of companies where a group income election is in place, as was in fact the case with the Claimants, the unlawful ACT is not charged until a dividend is paid by the ultimate holding company to its shareholders.  By reason of the group income election, no ACT would be payable on dividends paid by subsidiaries up the corporate chain. These submissions were summarised by the judge at [119]-[120], cited above. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">HMRC submit that the amount of unlawfully charged ACT is determined by identifying the sources of the profits comprised within the dividend declared by the ultimate holding company.  In the broadest of terms, this would involve analysing the accounts of each of the subsidiaries in the corporate chain to determine, in the case of each dividend paid by them, the profits out of which the particular dividend was paid.  As Mr Ewart emphasised, this is not an exercise in tracing the cash out of which the dividend is paid but tracing the profits comprising the dividend.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">To illustrate the point, Mr Ewart took the simplest of examples.  A UK company has two subsidiaries, one incorporated in an EU member state and one incorporated in a country outside the EU.  Each of those subsidiaries pays a dividend of 100 to the UK company.  The UK company pays a dividend of 100 to its shareholders.  Unless the UK company has for some reason designated the dividend paid by it as coming from one or other of the dividends received from its subsidiaries, HMRC submits that the dividend will be assumed to be derived equally from the two dividends paid to it.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In practice, of course, the exercise would be very much more complicated.  As dividends pass up a corporate chain, income will be received from multiple sources. A company will receive dividends from one or more subsidiaries and income derived from its own trading or other business activities. In order to determine the distributable profits of any particular company, there must be deducted from that company’s various sources of income, its own costs, depreciation and so on.  The result is a single figure of its profits, available for distribution in such amount as the company acting by its directors or shareholders decide.  HMRC’s approach involves a notional apportionment of each company’s profits to its various sources of income on a pro rata basis, net of all appropriate deductions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On behalf of the Claimants, Mr Aaronson provided an example of how the approach of HMRC would operate.  Assume a corporate chain of three companies, an ultimate holding company (A), a directly owned subsidiary (B) and a further subsidiary (C) owned by B. C pays a dividend to B of 100, on which it pays ACT of 25.  In addition to receiving the dividend of 100 from C, B also receives other income of 100 from a different source.  B pays a dividend of 100 to A.  If HMRC’s apportionment method were to be adopted, it would follow that the dividend of 100 paid by B would comprise an equal amount drawn from the dividend it had received from C and its other income.  On that basis, it would be entitled to a tax credit of 12.5 against its gross liability to ACT of 25.  It would therefore be liable to pay ACT of 12.5.  If A also had its other income of 100 and also paid a dividend of 100 to its shareholders, precisely the same result would follow.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As Mr Aaronson submitted, this is not how the ACT system operates in a purely domestic context.  If C paid ACT of 25 in respect of its dividend of 100 to B, a tax credit of 25 would be available both to B and to A when they respectively paid dividends of 100.  Neither A nor B would pay any ACT, notwithstanding that each of them had other income of 100.  It was a fundamental feature of the UK system that, whenever a company paid a dividend of an amount which was equal to or less than the amount of dividends it had received on which ACT had been paid, the dividend carried a tax credit.</p>

A UK company receiving a dividend from an EU subsidiary paid out of profits chargeable to corporation tax in its home state will be in a worse position than a UK group receiving a dividend from a UK subsidiary. As Mr Aaronson submitted, and as the judge accepted, the critical point is that, at the stage of receipt in the UK, the EU dividends have already borne actual foreign tax. In order to remedy the unlawful discrimination identified by the CJEU, the foreign tax must be regarded as equivalent to domestic ACT, and the sum of the dividend and the foreign tax credit must be treated as equivalent to FII.</p>

HMRC’s renewed oral applications for permission to appeal were directed to be heard with the present appeal, with the appeal to follow if permission were given.  In fact, we heard full argument and reserved the applications for permission to be decided as part of this judgment. </p>

It was introduced by the Finance Act 1994 as a response to the ever-increasing problem of surplus ACT caused by the large volume of foreign dividends received by UK-based groups and the lower volume of domestic profits giving rise to mainstream corporation tax against which the ACT could be set off.  The relevant provisions were enacted as sections 246A to 246Y ICTA. </p>

The unlawfulness of the FID regime as a whole under EU law has been definitively established by the ECJ. It follows that the ACT levied on the FIDs was unlawful, and the companies should have been placed in the same position as a UK company in receipt of FII from a UK subsidiary. The matching rules mean that all of the dividends matched with the FIDs will have been paid out of profits which bore an underlying rate of tax higher than the UK corporation tax rate. Accordingly, had the company which paid the FIDs instead received the same dividends in a purely domestic scenario, they would have been received as FII and would have franked the onward distribution in its entirety. Moreover, EU law would require credit to be given for the whole of the notional foreign tax, up to the UK corporation tax limit, because only thus could economic double taxation of the same underlying profits be avoided. In other words, in cases of the present type the notional tax credit required by EU law under the modified section 231 would in effect require the matched dividends to be treated as if they were domestic dividends, with the result that no ACT on the FIDs was payable.”</p>

If possible, under English law, this is achieved by a conforming interpretation. As it seems to us, there is no difficulty in producing a conforming interpretation of the FID regime, as the judge has done. Far from ignoring the existence of the FID regime as HMRC’s approach does, it simply makes the necessary adjustment of requiring a credit for the tax paid on the foreign profits, which inevitably results in the entire ACT being unlawful.

Mr Ewart submitted that a system which permitted payment of ACT to be considered unlawful only for it subsequently to become lawful was not coherent. We see no force in this point.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This part of the judgment addresses the remedies issues decided by the judge under issues 15 and 17-27.  As we have already said, once it is established (as it has been) that the Claimants are entitled under EU law to recover unlawfully levied Case V tax, and to be compensated for the use value of prematurely paid ACT, questions arise as to how those <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> rights are to be given effect under English law.  The Claimants have advanced both <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> claims and mistake-based restitutionary claims for that purpose.  In broad terms, the judge dealt with three arguments advanced by HMRC.  First, that they were entitled under English law to set off certain credits against the overpaid tax; secondly, that the Claimants were only entitled to recover the “actual benefit” that HMRC had received from having obtained the overpaid or prematurely paid tax; thirdly, that HMRC were entitled to defend the mistake-based restitutionary claims under English law on the basis that they had a valid “change of position” defence.  In relation to each of these arguments, however, the Claimants responded by contending that none of them was open to HMRC as a matter of EU law. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In considering remedies, it is important to understand when the discussion concerns English law and when it concerns EU law.  The position is, however, complicated by the fact that the Claimants’ primary claims are their mistake-based restitutionary English law claims brought to enforce their EU law <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> rights.  The logical approach in this case requires an understanding of the EU law right <span style="font-weight:bold">before</span> considering the English law remedies that are being deployed to give it effect.  We acknowledge that Lord Walker took a different view in <span style="font-style:italic">FII SC</span> at [36], but that was because the issues were different on that appeal.  Here, the two most important remedies issues concern the evaluation or quantification of HMRC’s enrichment (i.e. the set-off and actual benefit arguments) and the question of whether EU law prevents HMRC arguing that they should not provide restitution of the entirety of the overpaid tax, the objective use value of that tax, and the objective use value of the prematurely paid ACT.  Whilst the enrichment issues (and the change of position issues) are primarily matters of English law, they have to be understood against the background of the <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> right to which the English law remedies are giving effect.</p>

The other, issue 15, is a more specific issue, which – as noted above – the judge dealt with under the heading “Other issues of principle”: the issue is whether, in compensating one particular claimant in the Ford group, FCE Bank Ltd (“FCE”), for its overpayments of ACT, HMRC could take credit for the double taxation treaty half tax credits that it had to provide to FCE’s US parents.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">One of the main remedies questions is whether the judge was right to decide that EU law required the mistake-based claims made by the Claimants to be treated as <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> claims, even when the Claimants were also theoretically able (subject to the applicable six-year limitation period) to make <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> claims to recover the same overpaid tax.  HMRC’s central contention is that the availability of <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> claims is sufficient as a matter of EU law to vindicate the Claimants’ <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> rights.  HMRC accept, as the judge recorded at [249], that the <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> claims allow the Claimants to recover both the full principal amounts of overpaid Case V tax and unutilised ACT, in addition to the time value of prematurely levied ACT measured in accordance with <span style="font-style:italic">Sempra Metals </span>principles (see paragraph 213 below).  The only defence available to such <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich </span>claims would be one of “passing on”, or unjust enrichment of the claimant, which is not alleged in the present case.  It is common ground that none of the arguments raised by HMRC to reduce the quantum of, or as defences to, the mistake-based claims (namely set-off (issues 15, 17 and 18), change of position (issues 19-21) and actual benefit (issues 22-24)) would be available to reduce or defeat the <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> claims.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The judge decided that HMRC’s argument that only the <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> claims were required to vindicate the claimants’ <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> rights was plainly wrong.  He dealt with the question directly or indirectly in a number of parts of his judgment (particularly [247-249], [253-263], [288-289], [293-296], [303-308], [400-407], and [425-430]), though HMRC would say that he never really addressed it head-on.  In short, HMRC submitted to us, as they had to the judge, that none of the authorities he relied upon, and certainly none of the CJEU decisions, have concluded that, where there are two available domestic remedies to vindicate a <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> right, both must be moulded equally to satisfy the requirements of EU law.  HMRC accept that <span style="font-style:italic">Littlewoods CJEU</span> establishes that an available domestic remedy cannot be retrospectively made less favourable by curtailing a previously existing limitation period without proper transitional arrangements, but not that each of two available domestic remedies must be made equally effective to vindicate the <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> right, if one of them already does so.  The reason, of course, why the argument is so important is that the Claimants’ <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> claims can only go back six years, whilst the mistake-based claims can go back much further, and are therefore far more valuable.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First, there is a fundamental difference between claims in restitution and claims for compensation or damages.  In EU law, a damages claim is generally subject to the three conditions explained by the CJEU in <span style="font-style:italic">Francovich v. Italy</span> (case C-6/90) [1991] ECR I-5357, as formulated by the CJEU in <span style="font-style:italic">Brasserie du Pêcheur S.A. v. Federal Republic of Germany </span>and<span style="font-style:italic"> R v Secretary of State for Transport ex p. Factortame Ltd </span>(joined cases C-46/93<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>and C-48/93) [1996] Q.B. 404 (the “<span style="font-style:italic">Francovich</span> conditions”), namely that (i) the rule of law infringed must be intended to confer rights on individuals, (ii) the breach must be sufficiently serious, and (iii) there must be a direct causal link between the breach of the obligation and the damage sustained by the injured party.  The CJEU, however, does not always make a clear distinction between damages claims, or “claims for compensation for loss”, on the one hand, and restitution on the other.  This has given rise to some confusion particularly in understanding <span style="font-style:italic">FII CJEU1</span>.  Whatever the descriptions used by the CJEU, it is clear that the <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> right in EU law to recover overpaid tax is not itself a damages claim to which the <span style="font-style:italic">Francovich</span> conditions apply.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second point to bear in mind is that there is an inherent tension between the English law remedies in restitution, whether they are <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> claims or mistake-based claims, and the <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> right to recover overpayments of tax.  The <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> right to recover overpaid tax is not a right that takes any account of the level of enrichment of the tax authority receiving that overpaid tax.  The English law of restitution considers the level of actual enrichment of the recipient, which is irrelevant to both the existence and extent of the <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> right. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The third point is related to the second, in that it is clear that if the domestic law remedy is not adequate to vindicate the EU law right, the remedy must be moulded or reformed in order to do so.   Thus, the exercise that the domestic court is engaged upon is to “mould” a restitutionary remedy, which focuses on the enrichment of the defendant, in order to provide full compensation for overpaid tax.  That might be regarded more accurately as a total transformation than any kind of moulding process.</p>

The CJEU also held [13] that EU law did not prevent a domestic legal system from disallowing such repayment where the claimant would thereby be unjustly enriched, as where the unduly levied taxes had been “passed on” to other persons.  No other possible defences to domestic claims in unjust enrichment were mentioned by the CJEU.</p>

The issues related to EU companies and their UK subsidiaries, which were denied the right to make group income elections that UK companies with UK subsidiaries could make.  The EU companies with UK subsidiaries claimed, therefore, that the rules concerning group income elections discriminated against them, because UK subsidiaries were thereby excused from paying ACT on distributions to their UK parents.  The CJEU was asked four questions.   The first was answered by saying that it was contrary to article 49 on freedom of establishment for UK legislation to afford UK companies the possibility of making group income elections which allowed them to pay dividends to their UK parent company without paying ACT, but to deny that possibility to UK companies with EU parents [76].</p>

That question was answered by saying that EU law required the claimants to have an “effective legal remedy in order to obtain reimbursement or reparation of the financial loss which they have sustained” [96], and that was not altered by the fact that the claim was only for interest on the ACT paid too early.  It will be recalled, of course, that at the time that <span style="font-style:italic">Hoechst</span> was decided, English law prevented recovery of interest on a principal sum that was not due.  The CJEU reframed the question, but stressed that it was not for the CJEU to assign a legal classification to domestic claims.  The claimants had to classify their claims subject to the supervision of the national court [81].  The breach of EU law arose from levying ACT prematurely [87], and the award of interest represented the “reimbursement” of what was improperly paid [87].  Accordingly, the treaty entitled those claimants to such interest by way of restitution [89].  The same applied if the claim were brought as a claim for damages [92-95].</p>

Dividends had been paid by UK subsidiaries to Italian and Netherlands resident parents, but they had not been able to make a group income election.  The UK subsidiaries paid ACT, but the EU parents did not receive tax credits under section 231, although they did receive convention double taxation tax credits that were immediately paid by HMRC to those parents.  The basic issue was whether, in paying “compensation”, HMRC could claim credit for the convention tax credits it had had to pay the EU parents.  The first question looked at the position that would have pertained had the group been entitled to make a group income election, and asked whether the EU parents would then have been entitled to the convention tax credits.  The House of Lords put a purposive construction on the relevant legislation so as to conclude that the EU parents would not, in that situation, have been entitled to convention tax credits (Lord Nicholls at [12-15], Lord Hope at [35-39], and Lord Walker at [103-106]).  The second question focused on the distinction between the legal personalities of the subsidiary and the parent.  The question was whether HMRC could have credit against the “compensation” payable to the UK subsidiary for a payment they had made to the separate EU parent.  The House of Lords held that HMRC were able to take that credit because, as a matter of commercial reality, the loss of the opportunity to make a group income election was the loss of a group fiscal package (see Lord Nicholls at [20-22]).  It is important to note that the speeches in the House of Lords did not address the type of “compensation” with which they were dealing.</p>

Again, the House of Lords had to consider the consequences of the <span style="font-style:italic">Hoechst</span> decision.  In <span style="font-style:italic">DMG</span>, however, the UK subsidiary of a German parent was claiming “compensation or restitution” for the premature payment of ACT, under a mistake of law, as a result of its inability to make a group income election.  The House of Lords held that a taxpayer who had wrongly paid tax under a mistake of law was entitled, under English law, to a restitutionary remedy, notwithstanding that it might have another common law claim (a <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> claim) with a shorter limitation period.  HMRC had unsuccessfully argued that <span style="font-style:italic">Kleinwort Benson</span> did not extend to the payment of tax under a mistake. The decision is of some importance to the limitation question under issue 28, to which we will come later in this judgment.  For present purposes, we have mentioned it as an important step in the establishment of the common law cause of action to recover tax paid under a mistake of law.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The next significant development was the CJEU’s decision on the first reference in this case in <span style="font-style:italic">FII CJEU1</span> (12 December 2006).  The decision in that case has already been summarised.  They concerned the lawfulness of the corporation tax and ACT payable in the circumstances of this case.   Those circumstances are obviously different from the factual situation in the cases already mentioned which all concerned the consequences of a UK subsidiary paying ACT, because it was unable to make a group income election where it was paying dividends to an EU parent.  The CJEU did, however, make a comparison with the <span style="font-style:italic">Hoechst </span>situation that is relevant to the remedies that may be available in this case.  In answering the second and fourth questions about the lawfulness of ACT paid by UK companies with EU subsidiaries which had made distributions to it, the CJEU relied on <span style="font-style:italic">Hoechst</span> as demonstrating that the failure to give the UK company a tax credit when it received dividends from its EU subsidiary was not justified by the fact that the EU subsidiary was not required to pay ACT.  In that situation, the EU subsidiary had paid foreign corporation tax instead ([84-93] and [152]).   On the same day (12 December 2006) the CJEU delivered its decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Test Claimants in Class IV of the ACT Group Litigation v Commissioners of Inland Revenue</span> (case C-374/04) [2007] STC 404 including the cases brought by <span style="font-style:italic">Pirelli</span> and others.  It held there that it was compatible with EU law for the member state only to grant a corporation tax credit to resident companies receiving a dividend, and not to non-resident companies receiving a dividend, because the non-resident companies are not liable to UK corporation tax.</p>

The House upheld the decision to award compound interest by way of restitution for the premature payment of ACT under a mistake of law in circumstances where the group had been deprived of the opportunity to make a group income election.  It treated the matter as one of English law.  Lords Hope, Nicholls and Walker all considered the approach in English law to a claim for restitution of the use value of money, holding that it was open to a recipient including HMRC to show that there was no actual enrichment once the money fell into their hands (Lord Hope at [48], Lord Nicholls at [117-119], with whom Lord Walker agreed).</p>

But consistently with that, it does not give to the national court any power of selection which it does not have under domestic law. The national court is left to apply its ordinary domestic rules in the form of the causes of action which are available to a taxpayer seeking to enforce its EU claims. The difficulty with HMRC's argument on this point is that it seeks to attribute to or invest the national court as a function of the principle of effectiveness with the power to select which remedies the Claimant should be permitted to pursue when the object of the principle of effectiveness as explained in [<span style="font-style:italic">Littlewoods</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">CJEU</span>] is to ensure that the taxpayer’s <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> rights are enforced. <span style="font-weight:bold">The ECJ in para 33 and the earlier cases there referred to has made it clear that the choice and availability of remedies is exclusively a matter of domestic law subject only to their being effective remedies for the purpose of enforcing the EU rights in question</span> … Once it is clear that the domestic law rules for the recovery of overpaid tax are incapable of providing recovery in accordance with the <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> principle, they fall to be disapplied in favour of the Claimant’s EU rights. The national court has no power in our view to disapply the domestic bar to the enforcement of those rights on a selective basis.

The ACT in question is recoverable by FCE because FCE paid ACT on its distributions to Ford US, having itself received dividends from FCE’s subsidiaries in Germany, Denmark and Austria.  Those subsidiaries distributed profits made in those jurisdictions, upon which the foreign corporation tax had been paid at a rate equal to or exceeding the UK rate of corporation tax, for which full double taxation relief was afforded.</p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Pirelli</span>, of course, a group income election was not available because the parent companies were resident in Italy or the Netherlands.  The House of Lords held that the fact that the double tax credits were due to the EU parent companies rather than the English company paying the ACT did not prevent HMRC from claiming credit for them when providing restitution of the ACT for two main reasons:  first because, according to the judge’s analysis, the group income election could not have been made by the subsidiary alone (see Lord Nicholls at [21] in <span style="font-style:italic">Pirelli</span> and the judge at [236]), and secondly because the Pirelli group was complaining about breaches of the freedom of establishment provisions in article 52 which had caused detriment to the group as a whole (see Lord Scott at [80] and Lord Hope at [42] in <span style="font-style:italic">Pirelli</span>, and the judge at [238]).  The judge distinguished the House of Lords’ decision on the second issue in <span style="font-style:italic">Pirelli</span> by pointing out that neither of these two reasons applied to the position of FCE and Ford US.  FCE and Ford US were never in a position to say they ought to have been allowed to exercise a group income election (as the Pirelli parent and subsidiary had been), and Ford US had no right of establishment under EU law (to which the Pirelli parents had been entitled).  Moreover, even though there was an indissoluble link between FCE’s payment of ACT and the HMRC’s payment of the half tax credits to Ford US, such a link could not justify disregarding the separate corporate identities of FCE and Ford US. </p>

They submit that <span style="font-style:italic">ITC CA</span> can be distinguished on the basis that the input tax there was directly and immediately returned to the managers, which was not the case here, and argue that HMRC have not proved what credits they are entitled to claim.  More importantly, however, Mr Aaronson relies on his respondents’ notice and makes three separate points of distinction with <span style="font-style:italic">Pirelli</span>.   First, the tax credit in this case was not given, as it was in <span style="font-style:italic">Pirelli</span>, because of the payment of ACT, but to alleviate the economic double taxation caused by the payment of foreign corporation tax by the EU subsidiaries as explained at [85-89] and [159] of <span style="font-style:italic">FII CJEU1</span>.  Secondly, <span style="font-style:italic">Pirelli</span> was one of the <span style="font-style:italic">Hoechst</span> line of cases concerning the unavailability of a group income election.  In such a case, section 231 (1) says that a tax credit will not be obtained if a group income election is made.  But in this case, the tax credit arises from the payment of foreign corporation tax by the EU subsidiaries and had to be paid regardless of whether ACT was paid on the dividend paid by FCE.  It was said, therefore, that the link between the ACT payments and the tax credit in <span style="font-style:italic">Pirelli</span> was not present here, because the claim has nothing to do with the inability to make a group income election.  The third point concerned the difference of legal personality between the shareholders to whom the tax credit was provided, and the UK subsidiary which had paid the ACT. </p>

The problem in <span style="font-style:italic">Pirelli</span> was the same as in this case, namely how do you construe UK legislation when it has to apply to a situation that nobody would have assumed when it was enacted.  Lord Nicholls held that there was an unspoken link between the ACT and the tax credit, applying a purposive construction, so that HMRC had to be able to set off the tax credit that would never have been paid in practice, had the unlawful ACT not been paid. </p>

He thought that Ford US would have had no entitlement to the treaty half tax credits “if FCE had not paid the relevant ACT”.  That much, as it seems to us, was clear from the agreed statement of facts: “[u]pon the payment of the dividends which attracted those ACT liabilities … [Ford US] were entitled to receive a tax credit pursuant to Article 10(2) of the UK-US double taxation convention … calculated as one half of the ACT paid less …”.  The question, however, is whether the judge was right to say that the tax credits would not have been available if the tax system had operated in accordance with EU law.  Mr Aaronson says they would have been available anyway, because economically they were the “reciprocal” of the foreign corporation tax paid by FCE’s EU subsidiaries, not of the unlawful ACT, as the reasoning in <span style="font-style:italic">FII CJEU1</span> made clear.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In our view, the answer to this question follows from our conclusions on the nature of the unlawfulness determined under the tax issues dealt with above.  The relevant unlawfulness is the failure to treat a UK company in receipt of EU dividends on which EU tax has been paid in the same way as a UK company in receipt of domestic dividends on which ACT has been paid.  Thus FCE ought to have been in a position in which it could distribute its dividend income (even if derived from EU subsidiaries) to its US parents without paying ACT.  Had it done so, however, the agreed facts make clear that the treaty half tax credit would not have been received by Ford US.  So, it seems to us that the first question in this case must be answered in the same way as it was in <span style="font-style:italic">Pirelli</span>.  The fact that the reason for the unlawfulness of the payment of ACT is different in the two cases seems to us to be, as HMRC submitted, nothing to the point in the particular circumstances being considered under this issue.

He held, as we have said, that this did prevent HMRC claiming credit for the tax credits, relying on both the corporate personality point and the fact that in two respects there was no proper analogy between <span style="font-style:italic">Pirelli</span> and this case (a group income election was not available to a group with a US parent, and Ford US was, unlike the <span style="font-style:italic">Pirelli</span> parent not able to complain about breaches of the freedom of establishment provisions in article 49).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It does not seem to us that the appropriate question is really whether the decision on the second issue in <span style="font-style:italic">Pirelli</span> can be distinguished.  It is rather whether the proper restitutionary award as a matter of English law should or should not allow HMRC to take credit for something they would not have had to pay <span style="font-weight:bold">but for</span> the unlawful payment of ACT.  In that regard, the question of legal personalities should be considered first.  <span style="font-style:italic">Pirelli</span> allowed HMRC the credit because, as a matter of commercial reality, the loss of the opportunity to make a group income election was the loss of a group fiscal package.  That reasoning has no read-across to the facts of this case, where the question is simply one to be determined under the law of restitution.  The Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">ITC CA</span> did, however, make it clear that the court had to decide “whether there has been unjust enrichment at the end of the process and not merely at the time of the original mistaken payment”.  We think that the situation in this case is akin to the situation in <span style="font-style:italic">ITC CA</span>, because the credit paid to Ford US was paid (or at least credited) immediately the ACT was paid by FCE.   <span style="font-style:italic">ITC CA</span> demonstrates that restitution looks to the enrichment of the recipient, not the loss sustained by the claimant.  For that reason, the Claimants cannot, it seems to us, rely on the fact that the credits were given to legal persons distinct from FCE as a reason for denying HMRC the right to point to those credits as reducing the amount by which they were enriched.  Just as “the amount of the overcharged tax levied on the managers in <span style="font-style:italic">ICT [CA] </span>was never more than £75”, the amount here was the ACT paid by FCE less the tax credit granted to Ford US.  In these circumstances, whilst we agree with the judge that there are the two important points of distinction between the House of Lords’ reasoning on the second issue in <span style="font-style:italic">Pirelli</span> and this case, we do not agree that those distinctions are fatal to HMRC’s case.  </p>

The question is similar to that posed under issue 15, but the judge answered it somewhat differently.  He held that HMRC’s case that they were entitled to deduct the tax credit from the restitution due to the Claimants was “hopeless”, because HMRC were immediately enriched by the full amount of the relevant receipts of ACT, so that the link to the tax credits had no impact on HMRC’s initial enrichment.  The right of the recipient of the dividend to a tax credit derived from section 231, whilst the liability to pay ACT on the UK claimant was to be found in section 14, and the one was in no way conditional on the other.  The liability to pay ACT was triggered only by the making of a qualifying distribution.  Moreover, HMRC’s simplified model made no allowance for three complexities: (a) the fact that ACT may be paid low down in a chain of companies and the tax credit may arise high up in that chain, (b) there will often be a considerable delay between the payment of the ACT and the allowance of the tax credit (whether by way of repayment or allowance against tax due), and (c) the recipient of the dividend may be outside the UK and therefore not entitled to a tax credit in any event.

The question, as under issue 15, concerns the proper evaluation, as a matter of English law, of HMRC’s enrichment as a result of the overpayment of ACT.  In this case, however, the tax credits were granted to a multitude of shareholders in a large variety of differing positions.  Some corporate shareholders will have utilised the dividend plus the tax credits against ACT otherwise due on their own distributions within months of the grant of the credits,  while others may never have utilised them. Non-corporate shareholders may have claimed repayment almost immediately (for example, in the case of pension funds) or at a later date, while others will have used the tax credit against income tax otherwise due, normally over the following 9 to 21 months.   There is, therefore, force in the judge’s central point that the HMRC was “immediately enriched by the full amount of the relevant receipts of ACT”.</p>

The link, submit HMRC, between the ACT and the credits is inextricable, as held in <span style="font-style:italic">Pirelli</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic">ITC CA</span> makes clear that it does not matter that the credit is given to a different legal person.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In our judgment, HMRC’s case is successfully met by Mr Aaronson’s principal submission on this issue. He submits that there is no proper analogy with <span style="font-style:italic">Pirelli</span>.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Pirelli</span>, what was lost by the breach of EU law relied upon was the ability to make a group income election that meant that no ACT was payable; it followed inexorably from that that, in such a case, section 231 meant that no credit was obtained.  But here the position is different.  The vice that EU law seeks to cure is the failure to treat UK companies with EU subsidiaries in the same way as UK companies with UK subsidiaries.  If they had been treated equally, the ACT on the distribution up to shareholders would not have been payable because the (EU) subsidiary had paid its (foreign) corporation tax.   But if the foreign corporation tax is to be treated as UK ACT, then the UK company to whom the dividend was paid by the EU subsidiary would have obtained an ACT credit, and that credit would have passed on to the shareholders receiving the ultimate distribution.  Thus, the ACT paid in this situation is not properly analogous to the ACT paid in <span style="font-style:italic">Pirelli</span>, where the double taxation tax credit was, as a matter of construction, inextricably linked with the payment of the ACT.  Here the tax credit granted to the shareholders is properly to be regarded, as a matter of EU law, as the <span style="font-style:italic">quid pro quo</span> or what Mr Aaronson called the “reciprocal” for the payment of foreign corporation tax at the bottom of the chain by the EU subsidiaries making the original distribution (see <span style="font-style:italic">FII CJEU1</span> at [85-89]).</p>

But that is only because one is asking the English law question of whether HMRC were truly enriched at the expense of the claimants, and to answer that question, one has to consider the reason why the credit was given.  If the credit would have arisen even without the payment of ACT in the reformulated world of compliance with EU law, then it follows that it cannot be set off against the proper value of the restitution HMRC must make.  </p>

They are addressed to the submission made by HMRC that they “were not enriched <span style="font-weight:bold">at all</span>” by the receipts of ACT because of the obligation to grant corresponding tax credits. The judge was right to regard that as a hopeless submission, assuming that there was always a delay between the payment of the ACT and the use of the tax credit. At the very least, HMRC had the use of the money in the intervening period. In fact, it appears from what we were told that, at least in the case of pension funds (which had significant holdings of shares in those Claimants with publicly-traded shares), payment of the amount of the tax credits would be claimed and made simultaneously, or virtually simultaneously, with the distributions and the payment of ACT.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First, there was an insufficient connection between the ACT and the tax credits, because they “were the subject of independent statutory provisions, neither of which was made conditional upon the other” [278-279]. While literally true, we do not consider that this gives sufficient weight to the link between the payment of ACT and the grant of tax credits that lay at the heart of corporation tax regime in force between 1972 and 1999, as clearly recognised by the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Pirelli</span>. In our judgment, it was not necessary, as the judge thought, that HMRC should be “a mere channel for the transfer of money from companies to their shareholders” [279]. The link between ACT and tax credits was, in practice and in law, so strong that in our judgment it would be right to take account of tax credits in determining the benefit received by HMRC through the unlawful payment of ACT, were it not for the reason given above for rejecting HMRC’s case on this issue.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, the judge appears to have considered that because HMRC was immediately enriched by the full amount of ACT paid to them, no account is to be taken of any later credit or payment that it had to give in respect of the tax credits, even though the tax credits were granted immediately, and the obligation to give effect to them in due course arose immediately, under the relevant statutory provisions. We do not accept this. The link exists, even though HMRC will in most cases not have to give effect to the credit for some time after its receipt of the ACT. We readily accept that HMRC must make restitution of the time value of the money for the relevant period, but we do not see why HMRC’s enrichment should be calculated on a basis that wholly ignores their obligation to give effect to the credits. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As for the three points raised by the judge at [280], we do not regard them as, individually or collectively, providing grounds for rejecting HMRC’s case in principle. The first point was that the company paying the ACT may not be the company that pays the dividend attracting the tax credit, and the absence in some cases of “a close correspondence in time and amount between the payment of ACT and the grant of tax credits to individual shareholders”. Given the inextricable link between the payment of ACT and the grant of tax credits, we do not consider that this point can defeat HMRC’s case in principle. The second was that there will usually be a period of time between the payment of ACT and the tax credits taking effect. We have earlier addressed this point and while we accept that HMRC should make restitution in respect of the time value of the payment of ACT, it does not follow that HMRC are entitled to no credit at all in respect of the tax credits. The third point was that some shareholders will have been non-resident and therefore not entitled to a tax credit. The effect of this point is to reduce the credit to which HMRC might be entitled, rather than to eliminate it. </p>

The judge acknowledged at [413] that, though the “actual benefit” arguments bear a close similarity to the defence of change of position, they actually concern the quantification of the government’s enrichment.  Vos J had previously observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Littlewoods HC1</span> at [129] that there were two potentially significant differences between “actual benefit” and “change of position”.  First, the legal burden of proof lies on the claimant to establish the quantum of HMRC’s enrichment, whereas the burden lies on HMRC to establish the defence of change of position.  Secondly, the causal link required by the defence of change of position as between the initial enrichment and the subsequent disenrichment does not have to be demonstrated to reduce the restitution on the grounds of a reduced actual benefit.  Therefore, even if the answers may often be the same, “actual benefit” arguments are legally distinct from the defence of “change of position”.</p>

Vos J also concluded at [131] that it was open to HMRC to argue on the assessment of quantum (and to call evidence to support the case) that the government had not benefited from the overpayments of VAT after the first fiscal year, so that no use value should thereafter be awarded.  Henderson J decided in <span style="font-style:italic">Littlewoods HC2</span> that as a matter of English law the correct approach to quantification was to ascertain the objective use value of the overpaid tax, which was properly reflected in an award of compound interest, and that the claimants were content to receive the use value of the overpaid tax to the government (which was less than the use value to the claimants), and that the actual benefit derived by the government from the overpayments was irrelevant to the objective use value.</p>

The Court of Appeal dealt in detail with <span style="font-style:italic">Sempra Metals</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Benedetti </span>before concluding at [187] that “since HMRC proved to the satisfaction of the judge that the actual benefit it obtained from Littlewoods’ overpayments was less than market value of the time value of that money, actual use value could be relevant to valuing the benefit which the government received as a result of the overpayments”.

Nonetheless, we do not consider that HMRC should be treated as if it were an involuntary recipient of overpayments of tax. Taxpayers have to pay tax even though they may not have received any assessment from HMRC. In this case there were also assessments. Even if HMRC had no idea at the time that Littlewoods was making overpayments of tax, it still cannot in our judgment be said to be in the position of an involuntary recipient of a benefit. It is obvious that, under a system of self-assessment, tax will from time to time be paid in error and that that tax will have to be repaid. That is an inherent risk of a system of self-assessment. Statistically a certain percentage of tax receipts will have to be repaid, and we consider that government should not be able to discharge its obligations in restitution to the taxpayer by choosing to take a course which would dilute its repayment obligations.</p>

It was free to use the money for greater financial benefit by repaying borrowings or (subject to any restrictions on government investment) by placing the money on deposit. No doubt it would have repaid government borrowings if government borrowing rates were particularly high. The fact that it did not do so suggests that the rates may have been particularly favourable to government at the time.</p>

He contended that the only role of the distinction between voluntary and involuntary receipt was to distinguish between cases where a benefit had been freely accepted and where it had not; and he submitted that it necessarily followed from the statement at the start of [195] – that is, that HMRC were unaware that the payments in question were overpayments – that they could not have been freely accepted.  He submitted that none of the factors identified in the rest of the passage justified the contrary conclusion.  It was not enough that the Government knew that there were bound to be some overpayments from time to time, which is the point made in the rest of [195].  Nor was it relevant that the Government had a choice how to use the money [196] or that it could be assumed to have been well spent [197].  That did not get over the basic problem that the benefit of the overpayments had not been freely accepted.</p>

But in any event we do not think that Mr Burrows’ submissions fairly engage with the Court’s reasoning.  As is shown by the preceding paragraphs on which he relies, the Court fully acknowledged, at [193], that the starting point should be that an innocent recipient of an overpayment should not have to make restitution of more than he actually received, not knowing it was an overpayment, unless he freely accepted the benefit of having an overpayment and the obligation to pay for it at market rates; and, further, [194] that “generally” where a person is the involuntary recipient of a benefit – as in Baron Pollock’s example of someone cleaning his shoes without being asked or the modern equivalent of the motorist whose car windows are cleaned while he is waiting at the lights – he cannot be regarded as having freely accepted it.  But in the paragraphs with which we are concerned the court was explaining why the case of overpaid taxes justified a rather particular approach to “voluntariness”.  That was as a result of a combination of two features.  First, while the Government may not know that a particular payment was an overpayment, it is inherent in the system of self-assessment, which is a mechanism for discharging obligations imposed by the state, that overpayments will occur: that is the point made at [195].  Secondly, as a matter essentially of policy, it must be taken that the Government will have applied the money for its own – that is, for the public’s – benefit: that is the point made at [196-7].  That combination of features is peculiar to the case of overpaid taxes, and means that the simple proposition that free acceptance requires knowledge needs some modification in this context: the position of the Government cannot be equated with that of the motorist who has his windows cleaned at the lights.  The Court was careful to acknowledge that it was not saying that the Government’s acceptance of these particular overpayments was in the most obvious sense voluntary.  Rather, at [195] it says that it should not be “treated as if it were” an involuntary recipient; and at [196] it refers to the receipt not being involuntary “in another sense”.   </p>

We do not rule out that there may be cases where that would be the result, but they will not be frequent.  With that introduction, we turn to deal with the specific actual benefit issues.</p>

That case could only succeed if government borrowing were rigidly fixed in advance, so that any unforeseen reduction in receipts would automatically lead to a reduction in expenditure rather than an increase in borrowing (as the judge had accepted in <span style="font-style:italic">Littlewoods HC2</span> at [395-396]). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">HMRC’s argument relies here on the same arguments that they advance in relation to change of position.  We will deal with those arguments under issue 20.  HMRC point specifically in this connection to the presumed distribution of government spending between capital, income expenses, and repayment of debt.  HMRC rely on the fact that Henderson J put that reasoning specifically to the Claimants’ expert, Dr Andrew Sentance.  In essence, HMRC argue that they did show that the government did not benefit in the longer term from the time value of the money because the receipts were spent in precisely the same proportions as all other monies.  Thus, the government only benefited from the capital expenses and debt reduction payments.  The income expenses were dissipated and that proportion of the time value should not be repayable.</p>

The government was to be treated as a voluntary recipient, and cannot discharge its obligations in restitution to the taxpayer by choosing to take a course that dilutes its repayment obligations.   It was not, therefore, open to HMRC to say that the tax overpayments were “wasted” on income expenses.  HMRC must make restitution to the claimants at no less than the government borrowing rate as a voluntary recipient which was able to choose what to do with the overpayments.</p>

In that case, the Court of Appeal held that, even though HMRC had not actually known of the overpayments, the government was to be regarded as a voluntary recipient, and, therefore, to have freely accepted the benefit.  We can see no basis to distinguish that decision.  The circumstances here are the same, even if, as the judge pointed out, the evidence was different.  That evidential difference did not affect the fact that, in this case as in <span style="font-style:italic">Littlewoods CA</span>, the government was aware that ACT would be overpaid from time to time, and that the government could choose how to spend those overpayments and whether or not to repay borrowing.   Most importantly, however, here as in <span style="font-style:italic">Littlewoods CA</span>, we agree that the court should err in favour of applying the objective use value to the benefits obtained by government, whose spending is exclusively for the public benefit.</p>

We have seen nothing in the evidence that the judge accepted, which takes this case outside the parameters explained in <span style="font-style:italic">Littlewoods CA</span>. The fact that the government may have shown that, over the long term, there were fixed proportions spent on income, capital and debt repayment does not mean that the government did not choose how to spend its tax receipts, including those that were overpaid.  We do not accept that the income expenses, which make up the vast majority of government spending, were “dissipated” in the way that HMRC submitted.  Once it is established that HMRC have freely accepted overpayments of tax, the mistake-based restitution claim must be valued on the basis of the objective use value of the money.  Here, that objective use value is accepted by the Claimants to be limited to compound interest at the government borrowing rate. </p>

Its judgment recorded that it had been “common ground that, notwithstanding the apparently absolute terms of [declaration 14], the Judge was not making a final determination in respect of the change of position defence, but rather was acknowledging that, on the facts available at this stage, there is nothing to preclude [HMRC] from raising the defence at trial”.  The Court of Appeal continued by recording that the Claimants had nonetheless appealed on the issue, and that the only proper basis for an appeal would have been that the judge should have ordered that “there would be no proper basis for the successful invocation of the defence at trial”.  In fact, however, the Claimants were simply arguing that the judge had misstated the applicable law and should not have formed a preliminary view that the defence was likely to succeed.  The Court of Appeal held that that was not a sound basis for an appeal.  It then held that the defence of change of position did not anyway call for consideration, since it was common ground that the EU law principle of effectiveness precluded the application of any change of position defence to <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio </span>claims, though all the <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio </span>claims in the case fell within the <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich </span>cause of action.  The Court of Appeal said that the mistake-based claims were, as they had held, limited by section 33 of the Taxes Management Act 1970, section 320 of the Finance Act 2004, and section 107 of the Finance Act 2007 (a decision later held to be contrary to EU law in <span style="font-style:italic">FII CJEU3</span>).   The court then declined to deal with the parties’ substantive submissions on change of position, as the defence was “highly fact-sensitive”, and anything said would be <span style="font-style:italic">obiter</span>, and raise important and difficult questions of law and policy.</p>

He recorded in [317] that he had held in <span style="font-style:italic">FII HC1</span> at [339] that “the defence should in principle be available to the Revenue when restitution is sought of overpaid tax on the basis of mistake”, and that he had distinguished mistake-based claims from <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> claims because “the unlawfulness of the tax [formed] no part of the cause of action in mistake”.  Though his discussion had been confined to restitution claims which went beyond <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> claims, the position under English law could not, he held, depend on whether the defence was precluded by EU law.  Thus the judge accepted that his reasoning in relation to mistake-based claims which were <span style="font-weight:bold">not</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> claims must extend to the mistake-based claims which <span style="font-weight:bold">were</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> claims.  By implication, the Court of Appeal’s amended declaration 14 had to be taken to apply to all mistake-based claims.  Moreover, the Claimants had not resisted these propositions in <span style="font-style:italic">FII HC1</span>, and there was no suggestion that this part of his decision in <span style="font-style:italic">FII HC1</span> was of a preliminary nature.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On this issue, HMRC attack the conclusion (at [399]) that a change of position defence was not available to HMRC on the facts that the judge found.  There is no challenge to any of those factual findings.  HMRC say, in essence, that the judge misapplied the law on the change of position defence to a restitutionary mistake-based claim to the facts that he found.  HMRC submit that the evidence did show a long-term link between tax receipts and government expenditure and that HMRC should, therefore, have succeeded in their defence insofar as the proportion of that expenditure was in the nature of income, rather than capital or debt repayment expenditure.  The defence was available generically for the government’s change of position resulting from its enrichment by all ACT paid by taxpayers, whether Claimants or not, as a result of the particular mistake relied upon.   The defence is available in relation to mistakenly paid corporation tax, and also mistakenly paid ACT, which was later utilised (by far the largest amount as a matter of quantum).  </p>

The recipient’s loss is a consequence of obtaining the benefit if it is causally relevant, and though there is no relevant test for “causal relevance” in the cases, the relevant starting point is a “but for” test (see <span style="font-style:italic">Scottish Equitable plc v. Derby</span> [2001] EWCA Civ 369 per Robert Walker LJ at [30-31], where he had also endorsed the “wide view” of the defence).

The expenditure had to be “extraordinary” in the sense only that it would not have been incurred but for the overpayment.  The fourth point was to accept that the defence is essentially concerned with disenrichment, and that it may in that context be relevant to consider whether the relevant expenditure was reversible.  The judge thought, however, that it would be wrong to elevate that consideration into a general test of irretrievability.

In cross-examination, Sir Jonathan accepted that borrowing would normally take the strain in the short-term as a response to an unexpected reduction in taxation revenue.   The default position was that borrowing would always take at least some of the strain.   Having dealt in detail with Sir Jonathan’s evidence on the ACT system, the judge concluded at [391] that he was “left with no credible evidence about how the cash flow aspect of ACT was taken into account in government forecasts of receipts and expenditure”. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:0.95in">“… The methodology propounded by [HMRC’s experts] depends on the supposed existence of a fixed link between taxation revenue and government expenditure, such that any increase or diminution in forecast receipts is automatically reflected in a corresponding increase or diminution in government expenditure within the same fiscal year. </p>

In the short-term, the experts agree that “tax receipts, spending and borrowing can all fluctuate significantly and there are often variations from forecasts and plans” (paragraph 1(f) of the joint report). The correctness of this view was abundantly confirmed by the evidence which I heard from both Sir Jonathan and Dr Sentance. In particular, Sir Jonathan expressly accepted that, in the short-term, borrowing often takes the strain when tax receipts are lower than forecast. </p>

Indeed, for all I know it may be the case that all receipts of ACT were routinely left out of account when planning future government expenditure … I consider, therefore, that a full explanation of the way in which payments of ACT were in fact taken into account in government forecasts would have been a prerequisite for any successful establishment of the defence on the facts in relation to the ACT claims, and that the absence of such evidence is in itself a fatal flaw in the Revenue’s case. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">HMRC’s basic position on this issue is that the mistaken payments resulted in equivalent extra expenditure, so that the Government would be worse off by having to make restitution.   They support this by relying on Sir Jonathan’s  evidence that the planned overall level of borrowing is set first independently of expected tax revenues of this magnitude.  Thus, when deciding on tax and spending, lower planned receipts are reflected in lower planned expenditure or higher taxes.  Consequently, the mistaken payments would have been factored in to the Government’s plans for tax and spending.  They would not have been “lost in the rounding”.   Any excess tax payments were also used to increase spending rather than reduce borrowing.  The judge was entitled to hold as a matter of fact that there was no link between taxation revenue and government expenditure in the short term, but was wrong to misunderstand HMRC’s case that the desired fiscal position is fixed before spending and tax plans are drawn up, so lower receipts result in lower spending or higher taxes, and the lack of a short-term relationship between tax and spending is not contrary to HMRC’s case.  In any event, there was a long-term relationship between tax receipts and spending, which was enough for HMRC’s case.  HMRC should not have to make restitution of the proportion of the vast majority of the overpayments that went towards increasing spending or reducing taxes, as opposed to capital investment or repayment of borrowing. </p>

Lord Goff said that he did not wish to state the principle any less broadly than “that the defence is available to a person whose position has so changed that it would be inequitable in all the circumstances to require him to make restitution, or alternatively to make restitution in full”, though the mere fact that the defendant has spent the money is not enough to make it inequitable that he should repay it, as the expenditure might in any event have been incurred in the ordinary course of things.</p>

The latter was referred to by the judge, as we have mentioned, but it is worth noting that in that case, Robert Walker LJ expressly approved Jonathan Parker J’s statement in <span style="font-style:italic">Philip Collins Ltd</span> (which concerned over-payments of royalties to members of a rock band) to the effect that it may be right for the court not to apply too demanding a standard of proof when an honest defendant says that he has overspent by improving his lifestyle, but cannot produce any detailed accounting.  The Claimants, however, suggested that cases about personal overspending were hardly pertinent to issues of government spending and budgeting.  Subject to that caveat, <span style="font-style:italic">Philip Collins Ltd</span> showed that a change of position defence could in some circumstances succeed, even where the musicians in question could not show that any of their specific additional expenditure was directly referable to overpayment of royalties.

HMRC pointed to three errors in the judge’s reasoning.  They submitted that the judge had actually found the necessary long-term relationship between receipts and spending in [394] where he said that “[t]he only firm correlation between taxation receipts and government expenditure is a long-term one, and even then it has not been demonstrated by [HMRC] that there is a direct causal relationship between receipts and expenditure (as opposed to a link of a multi-factorial nature)”, but had not recognised it.  The judge then, HMRC submitted, wrongly introduced the need for a direct causal relationship between receipts and expenditure.   His treatment at [395] of the number of years it might take to establish a “statistically significant return towards equilibrium” misunderstood that it did not matter whether the relationship was short term or long term provided it was shown to exist.  Professor Myles had shown that there was a long term 1:1 connection, and Dr Sentance had accepted that those calculations were valid.  In the meantime, all that had happened was that extra borrowing had taken the strain.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We should say at once that, it having been decided that the defence of change of position is available to HMRC in this case, we cannot support Mr Mitchell’s contrary views in Goff &amp; Jones.  We do, however, accept Mr Beazley’s submission that [195-197] of <span style="font-style:italic">Littlewoods CA</span> (which we have already set out at paragraph 260 above) are relevant to the defence of change of position in this case.  Those paragraphs draw attention to the injustice of denying the taxpayer restitution of the objective use value of the overpaid tax, when government has freely accepted the benefit and made use of the money for the public benefit.  They are relevant because injustice or inequity is at the heart of the defence of change of position as Lord Goff’s famous <span style="font-style:italic">dictum</span> in <span style="font-style:italic">Lipkin Gorman</span> explains (page 580).  To make good the defence on the facts, HMRC have to persuade the court that it would be inequitable that they should be called upon to repay the overpaid corporation tax and to make good the objective use value of the prematurely paid ACT.  It may be noted at the outset that, although the judge does not appear to have made a direct decision on whether it would be inequitable to require HMRC to make restitution, it may be clearly inferred from what he has said at [342-399] that his answer would have been that it would not. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second point we would make is that, whatever may be the position in relation to overpaid corporation tax, the position on utilised ACT is in our judgment clear.  The judge makes clear factual findings at [397] of his judgment which HMRC simply cannot undermine, having not appealed the facts he found.  Those findings were that he was not “satisfied on the evidence before me that [HMRC’s methodology] could be applied to the payments of utilised ACT” because the benefit to the government was of a cash flow nature, and the judge had “no reliable evidence of the way in which this was reflected in government forecasts”.  The judge continued by saying that “for all I know it may be … that all receipts of ACT were routinely left out of account when planning future government expenditure”.  The judge’s view was that “a full explanation of the way in which payments of ACT were in fact taken into account in government forecasts would have been a prerequisite for any successful establishment of the defence on the facts in relation to the ACT claims, and that the absence of such evidence is in itself a fatal flaw in [HMRC’s] case”. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We turn then to deal with the question of whether HMRC were right to say that, on the judge’s findings, they had established a long term causative connection between overpaid corporation tax and government expenditure and that they should at least be relieved of the requirement to make restitution in respect of that proportion (the vast majority in fact) of the expenditure that was represented by increased spending or reduced taxes (as opposed to capital expenditure or borrowing repayment). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As we have already said, we think these arguments were open to HMRC.  We do not, however, accept that the judge’s factual findings were sufficient to support the change of position defence even in relation to overpaid corporation tax, as opposed to prematurely paid ACT.  There are three reasons.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First, HMRC places great reliance on two lines in [394] of the judge’s judgment.  They say that he decided that “[t]he only firm correlation between taxation receipts and government expenditure is a long-term one”, and that there was a causative link of a “multi-factorial nature” between receipts and expenditure.  These findings, if that is what they were, are a very tenuous basis for the defence that HMRC seek to run.  The judge plainly thought that many other factors came into the mix, and one cannot help thinking that he would have found considerable force in Mr Beazley’s submission that it was “just nonsense” to think that HMRC had proved that these small overpayments of corporation tax had affected spending or tax rates even in the longer term.  Vos J reached a similar conclusion on different evidence in <span style="font-style:italic">Littlewoods HC1</span> at [112-125], where he said at [124] that “the change of position defence fails because [HMRC] have failed to prove, the burden being on them, that they increased their spending in any way on the basis of the expectation or the happening of the overpayment”, accepting Professor John Kay’s evidence that “had the Government not expected to receive these sums by way of VAT, it would not have changed its budgetary or spending decisions”.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As regards causation, we do not accept that government can be regarded in the same way as the members of the rock band in <span style="font-style:italic">Philip Collins Ltd.  </span>The government needs to show, as a starting point, that “but for” these particular receipts, expenditure would not have been made or taxes would not have been reduced.  HMRC were miles away from demonstrating that to be the case here.  The reason why a proper link must be shown is because, otherwise, as it seems to us, it is very unlikely to be possible to say that it is inequitable for the government to make restitution.  It may be difficult to think of plausible examples, but if, say, an unlawful windfall tax were imposed on the oil industry, and the government had announced that the monies from that tax were to be used to cut stamp duty on house purchases by 1%, and the figures showed that to have been done, one might imagine that the defence could achieve some airspeed.   The facts found by the judge did not come close, in our judgment, to demonstrating a real link between these modest overpayments of ACT and government expenditure, even in the medium to long term.  The link was “multi-factorial” which is simply not sufficient to make it unjust to require restitution.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Our third reason comes back to <span style="font-style:italic">Littlewoods CA.  </span>There, the Court of Appeal made clear that the court should err in favour of applying objective use value to benefits obtained by government.  We think that the court should normally err also in favour of awarding restitution to taxpayers who have overpaid tax as a result of a mistaken view of the facts or the law.  That is not depreciating the existence of the defence or the fact that change of position plays a fundamental part in the law of unjust enrichment, enabling it to develop broadly.  But if the government is to succeed in mounting a change of position defence, it must establish that it is truly inequitable for it to have to make restitution.  In our judgment, that was not established here, and could not have been established on the basis of the kind and quality of the evidence that HMRC adduced.  At the risk of repetition, there was simply no satisfactory evidence that, if the government had not had the modest levels of overpaid corporation tax and prematurely paid ACT, it would have cut back on expenditure rather than, for example, repaying borrowing.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In our judgment, HMRC’s appeal on this issue should be dismissed.  HMRC failed to make out the defence of change of position on the facts, and failed to show that the judge had misapplied the law to the facts that he found (which were not themselves appealed).  Apart from our three generally applicable reasons in [309-311] above, the position may be summarised as regards each of the elements of BAT’s claim that the judge described in [358].  In respect of the claim for utilised ACT (totalling about £228.2 million), the change of position defence failed because there was no short term correlation established between tax receipts and government expenditure, and there was no evidence of the way that any short-term cash flow advantage was reflected in government forecasts (see [397] of the judge’s judgment). In respect of the claim for unutilised ACT (totalling about £95.3 million), the change of position defence failed because no direct link was established between tax receipts and government expenditure even over the long term.  The general relationship of a multi-factorial nature was not sufficient to establish the defence.  Moreover, there was a fatal absence of evidence of how <span style="font-weight:bold">any</span> ACT (utilised or not) was taken into account in government forecasts.  In respect of the claim for overpaid Case V tax (totalling about £700,000), the change of position defence failed for the same reasons as the claim for unutilised ACT, and also because of the relatively modest amounts involved.</p>

He said that it was elementary that EU law requires the national court to provide the Claimants with an effective restitutionary remedy to vindicate their rights under EU law.

The judge concluded at [405-406] that it was “abundantly clear from the whole of the judgment [in <span style="font-style:italic">FII CJEU3</span>] that it regarded the two remedies available under English common law as alternative remedies for the recovery of taxes levied in breach of EU law” (see [2-6], [24], [25], [39], [41], [43] and [46-49]).   The judge then addressed HMRC’s argument and rejected it as “plainly wrong” for the reasons previously given: “for as long as English law permits claimants to choose between the two causes of action in order to recover tax unlawfully levied under EU law, both remedies must be taken to rank equally in the eyes of EU law, and claims of each type must be regarded as <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> claims”.</p>

It is an argument that deals with all three of the issues 18, 21 and 24.  HMRC acknowledge that there is a right in English law to repayment of unlawfully charged tax under the <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> principle, and that there can be no exception to that remedy (applying <span style="font-style:italic">Lady &amp; Kid</span>).  They submit that it is for the domestic legal system to lay down detailed procedural rules and forms of action.  The EU treaties were never intended, they say, to create new remedies, unless no legal remedies existed at all.  If there is such a remedy, EU law has nothing to say about other domestic remedies.  EU law does not require the alteration of domestic remedies.  Since the UK legal system provides the <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> remedy, which makes it possible for the Claimants’ individual rights to be protected, there is no need to reform or alter the mistake-based remedy.  </p>

Lord Reed had concluded that “so long as they must both be available, they must both be effective”.   Mr Ewart submitted that Lord Reed had said nothing about the <span style="font-weight:bold">nature</span> of the two remedies. The mistake-based claims are available to give effect to the <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> rights, but the domestic defences apply and those defences do not require moulding or reformation.  Mr Ewart also revisited these submissions in a series of written propositions, which we do not think we need to record expressly in this judgment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In response, Mr Aaronson supported the reasoning of the judge, and relied particularly on [92-103] of <span style="font-style:italic">Littlewoods CA</span>.  The Court of Appeal said in [93] that “it was now tolerably clear that EU law requires national law to reimburse the losses occasioned by the unavailability of money as a result of tax being levied unlawfully”.  It said at [103] that “the EU law right is, in the terms in which it is expressed in the case law, a private or personal right of the taxpayer.  National law must give effect to that right, and it is no answer to the individual taxpayer’s claim that national law has done so for other taxpayers, or even for the vast majority of them”.  He relied also on [130], which we have already referred to at paragraph 226 above.  Even if <span style="font-style:italic">Littlewoods CA </span>were not conclusive, the whole thrust was to follow <span style="font-style:italic">FII CJEU1</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Hoecsht</span>.   The <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> right is simply not vindicated by a <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> claim.  Both claims have to be moulded to vindicate the <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> rights.  Since HMRC accept that none of the three arguments can succeed against a <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> claim, they cannot succeed against mistake-based claims either.  That is clear from Lord Reed’s judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">FII SC</span>.  <span style="font-style:italic">Lady &amp; Kid</span> at [20] and [25] made it unequivocal that the only defence to claim for reimbursement of tax unlawfully levied is passing on.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Zuckerfabrik Julich AG v British Sugar </span>(cases C113-10, C147-10 and C234-10) the question was whether EU law precluded the claimant from recovering interest on overpayments to the Rural Payments Agency where the Agency had recovered no interest itself when it was repaid by the European Commission.  The CJEU made it clear at [64-67] that EU law required the RPA to repay interest, even though it had not itself been repaid with interest.  The claimant’s <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> right entitled the claimant to interest.  The decision is informative as to the nature of the <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> right.</p>

The closest he got was in [405-406] where he said that the argument was plainly wrong.  We agree with HMRC that <span style="font-style:italic">Lady &amp; Kid</span> is not conclusive on this point, since all that case makes clear (as a line of other CJEU authorities do also) is that the only defence to a domestic claim to vindicate a <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> right is a defence of “passing on”.  It says nothing about whether each of two domestic remedies that <span style="font-weight:bold">could</span> vindicate a <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> right must be moulded so as to enable them to do so.  Mr Ewart pointed out that all <span style="font-style:italic">FII CJEU3</span> decided was that if such a remedy exists it cannot be amended retrospectively or without proper notice so as to curtail a limitation period.  That case also says nothing about whether an existing right must be moulded to vindicate the <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> right when another domestic remedy is already available to do so.</p>

We refer, in particular to [130], following the citation of [37-39] of <span style="font-style:italic">FII CJEU3</span>, where they said (as recorded already above) that: “[t]his seems to us to be a clear rejection of the Court of Appeal’s view that the test claimants in <span style="font-style:italic">FII </span>were not entitled to protection in respect of both existing domestic causes of action which were capable of giving effect to their <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> rights” (and see also [136] of <span style="font-style:italic">Littlewoods CA</span>).

The national court’s “procedural autonomy” does not mean that a claimant seeking to enforce a <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> right can be deprived of one of two available domestic remedies because of the application of defences or arguments that make it ineffective to give effect to that right.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We also think that the decision of the Supreme Court in this very case is of the greatest importance.  The present situation is, we think, another example of HMRC running an argument that has already been run in the same case at another level.  We find it very surprising that HMRC should take up so much time with arguing this point again at Court of Appeal level, when the Supreme Court has already disagreed with <span style="font-style:italic">FII CA1</span>, even if, at the same time, it decided to make a reference to the CJEU.  We understand Mr Ewart’s argument that [212] of Lord Reed’s judgment does not expressly say that the mistake-based remedy has to be moulded to vindicate the claimants’ <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> rights, even when the <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich </span>claims are available to do so, but we do not agree with it for two simple reasons.  First, Lord Reed said in terms that he <span style="font-weight:bold">disagreed</span> with the argument that “the additional ground of action which English law provides [the mistake-based claim] falls outside the scope of the [principle of effectiveness]”.  Secondly, Mr Ewart’s construction of Lord Reed’s [212] ignores the words “in similar circumstances” in his pre-penultimate sentence.  There he said, again clearly we think, that “[w]here an action for recovery of taxes under domestic law can be based either on the ground of mistake or on [a <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> claim] (or, as in the present case, on both grounds) it follows from the principle of equivalence that <span style="font-weight:bold">both grounds of action</span> should also be available <span style="font-weight:bold">in similar circumstances</span> to enforce an analogous right under EU law.  <span style="font-weight:bold">The principle of effectiveness therefore applies to both grounds of action</span>” (emphasis added).  Lords Hope at [20-23], Lord Clarke at [136], Lord Walker at [91], [102] and [115], and Lord Dyson at [140] either agreed with Lord Reed or were to similar effect.  </p>

But we think it is now reasonably clear, as the judge said, that where domestic law allows two possible remedies to vindicate a <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> right the EU law principles of equivalence and effectiveness require that both those remedies are moulded so as to vindicate the Claimants’ <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> rights to recover the overpaid tax and an adequate indemnity for the losses occasioned (see [29] in <span style="font-style:italic">Littlewoods CJEU</span>).  As we have pointed out already, it is hard to “mould” a domestic restitutionary claim which looks only to the enrichment of the defendant to satisfy such an unequivocally compensatory right.

However, some of the other claimants in the FII group did not initiate proceedings until after the 8 March 2007, and HMRC in due course made it plain that, although pleadings had not been required in the cases of those claimants, it would be raising a limitation defence in them.  Although we were not given details, it appears that there are about half a dozen claimants (or groups of claimants) in this class.  In the “Statement of Agreed Facts and Disputed Issues” prepared in the run-up to <span style="font-style:italic">FII HC2</span> HMRC contended that “the Claimants could reasonably have discovered their mistake on 8 March 2001”.

That decision essentially endorsed the opinion of the Advocate General, which was promulgated on 12 September 2000.  In consequence of Hoechst’s challenge, a large number of UK-resident subsidiaries of non-resident parents brought proceedings for restitution of ACT which they had paid when it was not in fact lawfully due.  Some did not do so until the decision of the CJEU was known; but others anticipated it, including DMG which issued proceedings on 18 October 2000.

On this question it is important to bear in mind the special nature of the mistake, namely that it was deemed to have been made because of the retrospective operation of a later decision of the Court of Justice. The ‘reasonable diligence’ proviso depends upon the true state of affairs being there to be discovered. In this case, however, the true state of affairs was not discoverable until the Court of Justice pronounced its judgment. One might make guesses or predictions, especially after the opinion of the Advocate General. This gave DMG sufficient confidence to issue proceedings. But they could not have discovered the truth because the truth did not yet exist. In my opinion, therefore, the mistake was not reasonably discoverable until after the judgment had been delivered.”</p>

Until the determination was made the mistake could not have been "discovered" in the sense referred to in section 32(1) of the 1980 Act. In this situation I would hold, in agreement with Park J and Jonathan Parker LJ, that DMG was not in a state of doubt, when it paid the ACT.

Surely, when DMG learned in July 1995 that there was a serious legal challenge to the legality of the ACT regime, it must then have been obvious to them that these payments might not after all be due. Of course they could not be sure and of course nothing short of a final judgment from the European Court of Justice would have persuaded the revenue to accept any claim by DMG here for group income relief. But it does not seem to me to follow that DMG paid under a mistake of law-any more than Woolwich would be regarded as having paid under such a mistake simply because the revenue in that case were insisting on the validity of the contested regulations.</p>

Those provisions were said to infringe a number of different principles of EU law, but for present purposes we need be concerned only with the principle of protection of legitimate expectations: the Claimants’ case was that as at the cut-off date they had a legitimate expectation of being able to bring a mistake-based restitution claim in relation to payments of ACT going back more than six years.  We are not in this case concerned as such with the principle of protection of legitimate expectations, but the consideration of that issue involved the Court in considering what the FII claimants could reasonably have understood their rights to be in 2003 and in 2007, and there is an obvious overlap between that question and the issue of when the Claimants could reasonably have discovered their mistake.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The correct starting-point must be the reasoning of the majority in <span style="font-style:italic">DMG</span>, which was concerned directly with the issue of when a mistake of law can be regarded as “discoverable”.  It is in our view quite clear that the majority held that in the case of a point of law which is being actively disputed in current litigation the true position is only discoverable, for the purpose of section 32 (1) (c) of the 1980 Act, when the point has been authoritatively resolved by a final court.  That is wholly explicit in the speeches of Lord Hoffmann and Lord Hope quoted at paragraphs 355 and 356 above.  Mr Ewart argued that Lord Walker’s reasoning – see paragraph 357 – was different because of his endorsement of Lightman J’s observations in the <span style="font-style:italic">First Roodhill</span> case and his statement that “it all depends on the facts”; and that accordingly there was no majority <span style="font-style:italic">ratio</span>.  We do not agree.  It is in our view clear that Lord Walker was acknowledging that in other circumstances the law may be regarded as established, and thus discoverable, even without a relevant judicial decision.  But that was evidently not so where the correct legal position was being actively argued through the courts.  We see no difference between Lord Walker’s reasoning and that of Lord Hoffmann and Lord Hope.  That reasoning confronts but neutralises the apparent logical difficulty referred to by Henderson J that a mistake of law may not be discoverable in the relevant sense until the conclusion of proceedings even though the claimant has based his whole claim on that very mistake.  Henderson J’s analysis at [465] of his judgment, quoted at paragraph 369 above, is in our view correct.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In our view it follows by parity of reasoning – as indeed Henderson J said – that the mistakes relied on by the Claimants were not discoverable until the decision of the CJEU in <span style="font-style:italic">FII CJEU1</span>.  It was only at that point that it was authoritatively established that, to quote from the pleading, the ACT provisions were not lawful or enforceable, and that they had not been lawfully obliged to make the ACT payments.  (The same goes for the Case V tax provisions, though those were not the focus of the argument.)  The situation is substantially identical to that considered in <span style="font-style:italic">DMG</span> and we are bound by the reasoning of the majority.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The only basis on which the discoverability date could be 8 March 2001 would be if the mistake of law that was authoritatively exposed by the CJEU in <span style="font-style:italic">Hoechst</span> was in substance the same mistake as had led the Claimants to make the ACT payments.  But on their pleaded case that was plainly not so.  The provisions which they had mistakenly believed obliged them to make the payments are not the same as the provisions pursuant to which Hoechst had made the payments in that case; nor was it contended that the fact that the latter provisions infringed EU law necessarily meant that the former did also.  There is no doubt that the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Hoechst</span> prompted the question whether the ACT system infringed EU law in other respects, and if the opinion of Lord Brown in <span style="font-style:italic">DMG</span> had prevailed 8 March 2001 might indeed have been the crucial date; but it did not.   </p>

We do not think that he should have been.  The issue under discussion in that paragraph, and the longer passage of which it forms part, was whether the state of the law as it stood at the cut-off date of 8 September 2003 was such that the Claimants had a legitimate expectation of being able to rely on the extended limitation period in claiming restitution in relation to their payments of ACT (his conclusion in fact being, despite what he said in [104], that it was not).  The importance of the reference to the date of the Hoechst decision was that it was arguable that time did not start to run until that date: the question of whether it might be postponed any later was of no significance.  The phrase “(but not subsequently)” was thus unnecessary – which is no doubt why it was it was in brackets (and also perhaps why it was not picked up in the passages from the judgments of Lord Clarke and Lord Reed to which Henderson J referred).  It is not possible to know why Lord Walker included it, but on any view it was <span style="font-style:italic">obiter</span> and it is highly unlikely that the question was the subject of any submissions.  </p>
