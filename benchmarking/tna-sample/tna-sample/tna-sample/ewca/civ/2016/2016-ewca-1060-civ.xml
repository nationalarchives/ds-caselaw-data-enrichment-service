	      </authorialNote> there.  MR did not claim asylum in Italy.  The essential issue raised by the appeals is whether the Secretary of State can return them to Italy under the Dublin regime (as to which see paras. 36-38 below) without considering their asylum claims, on the basis that NA already has protection there and that MR is entitled to claim it.  It is their case that the conditions encountered in Italy by asylum-seekers and BIPs are so inadequate that there is a serious risk that they will suffer inhuman and degrading treatment and that their enforced return would accordingly constitute a breach of their rights under article 3 of the European Convention of Human Rights (“the Convention”) and be unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The procedural route by which that issue arises is as follows.  First, in both cases the Secretary of State has in both cases certified, under paragraph 5 (4) of Schedule 3 to the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants etc) Act 2004 (“the 2004 Act”), that the Appellants’ claims that their removal to Italy would be in breach of their human rights are “clearly unfounded”.  The effect of such a certificate is that they can be returned to Italy without a right of appeal in this country: I set out the relevant provisions at para. 31 below.  Both have brought judicial review proceedings challenging the certification of their claims.  NA’s case was listed with two others raising similar issues, the claimants being known as MS and SG, and the case is generally referred to as <span style="font-style:italic">MS</span>.  The claims were heard by Lewis J between 24 and 26 March 2015.  By a judgment handed down on 22 April 2015 ([2015] EWHC 1095 (Admin)) he dismissed all three.  His judgment was very substantial and considered a great deal of evidence relating to the treatment of asylum-seekers and BIPs in Italy.  As for MR, his claim was dismissed by Whipple J at a hearing on 15 December 2015 ([2015] EWHC 3645).  Her judgment was much shorter since she proceeded on the basis that she would follow Lewis J’s decision unless the evidence before her demonstrated a material change in the circumstances since the date of his decision, which she held that it did not.  </p>

They had no money.  The church provided them with some food, but not reliably, and they were reduced to begging and searching in waste bins.

Dr Obuaya has diagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”) and a severe depressive disorder without psychotic features.  In his earlier report he noted that NA appeared to be convinced that she would be at great risk of further harm if returned to either Sudan or Italy. Regardless of whether that fear was objectively well-founded, Dr Obuaya was of the opinion that the threat of forced return to either country would be likely significantly to worsen her psychological symptoms.  The report notes that previous experience of sexual trauma is a strong predictor of future victimisation and that that applies to NA.  Dr Obuaya also considered that the risk of suicide or serious self-inflicted harm was likely to increase to a high level in certain circumstances, including during the removal process or when back in Italy.  The 2014 report notes that the risk of suicidal behaviour could be minimised by regular monitoring of her mental state in primary and/or secondary care services as well as through the provision of regular psychotherapy and notes that the risk on return to Italy would be high enough to warrant assessing NA for an inpatient psychiatric admission. The 2015 report confirms that the opinions expressed in 2014 remain unchanged.</p>

But he made no application for asylum and almost at once travelled to Milan, where he had a contact.  He came to the UK, concealed in the back of a lorry, on 15 February 2013: for most of the intervening period he had been staying with another Iranian, but he does not know whether that was in Italy or some other country.  </p>

It requires the Home Secretary to certify all claims from the listed states 'unless satisfied that the claim is not clearly unfounded'. It is useful to start with the ordinary process, such as section 115(1) calls for. Here the decision-maker will (i) consider the factual substance and detail of the claim, (ii) consider how it stands with the known background data, (iii) consider whether in the round it is capable of belief, (iv) if not, consider whether some part of it is capable of belief, (v) consider whether, if eventually believed in whole or in part, it is capable of coming within the Convention.

In order to decide whether they are satisfied that the claim is not clearly unfounded, they will need to consider the same questions. If on at least one legitimate view of the facts or the law the claim may succeed, the claim will not be clearly unfounded. If that point is reached, the decision-maker cannot conclude otherwise.

If any reasonable doubt exists as to whether the claim may succeed then it is not clearly unfounded. It follows that a challenge to the Secretary of State's conclusion that a claim is clearly unfounded is a rationality challenge. There is no way that a court can consider whether her conclusion was rational other than by asking itself the same question that she has considered. If the court concludes that a claim has a realistic prospect of success when the Secretary of State has reached a contrary view, the court will necessarily conclude that the Secretary of State's view was irrational.”</p>

This forms part of the Common European Asylum System, which includes also the Reception and Qualification Directives to which I refer in more detail below.  Its essential purpose is to allocate responsibility between member states for determining asylum applications.  Very broadly, the principle is that asylum-seekers must claim asylum in the member state of the European Union in which they first arrive (“the responsible member state”): if they move on to another member state without claiming asylum they can be returned to the responsible member state.  I should, however, note that a member state is never obliged to implement the Dublin procedures: the so-called “sovereignty clause” allows it to entertain a claim for asylum even where it is not the responsible state if it chooses to do so. </p>

Nothing turns on its detailed provisions.  It is common ground, subject to the points made below, that since each of the Appellants first entered the EU through Italy the UK was not obliged to determine their asylum applications and was entitled to require the Italian government to accept their enforced return, and it has agreed to do so.</p>

We were told that both the UK and the Italian governments take, or at least took, the view that in the case of BIPs (i.e. as opposed to asylum-seekers) the right to return them to the responsible member state does not arise under the terms of the Dublin Regulation as such.  The contrary conclusion was reached by the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">EM (Eritrea)</span>: see para. 79 of the judgment of Lord Kerr (p. 1346 E-F).  No submissions were made to us about the substance of that question, because it was common ground that, subject to the issue about her article 3 rights, the UK is entitled to return NA to Italy.  For convenience, and in accordance with what seems to be general usage, we will refer to both asylum-seekers and BIPs who are sought to be returned to the responsible member state as “Dublin returnees”.  </p>

This point is made, albeit in a different context, by the ECtHR in <span style="font-style:italic">MSS </span>(see para. 53 below).

The establishment of such responsibility inevitably involves an assessment of conditions in the requesting country against the standards of Article 3 of the Convention. Nonetheless, there is no question of adjudicating on or establishing the responsibility of the receiving country, whether under general international law, under the Convention or otherwise.

In the light of the above and in view of the obligations incumbent on the Greek authorities under the Reception Directive …, the Court considers that the Greek authorities have not had due regard to the applicant’s vulnerability as an asylum-seeker and must be held responsible, because of their inaction, for the situation in which he has found himself for several months, living on the street, with no resources or access to sanitary facilities, and without any means of providing for his essential needs. The Court considers that the applicant has been the victim of humiliating treatment showing a lack of respect for his dignity and that this situation has, without doubt, aroused in him feelings of fear, anguish or inferiority capable of inducing desperation. It considers that such living conditions, combined with the prolonged uncertainty in which he has remained and the total lack of any prospects of his situation improving, have attained the level of severity required to fall within the scope of Article 3 of the Convention.</p>

At para. 81 it refers to the possibility that the system for the reception of asylum-seekers in a given country may “experience major operational problems” giving rise to a substantial risk that returnees may be treated in a manner incompatible with their fundamental rights (para. 81).

To allow asylum seekers the opportunity to move about various member states, applying successively in each of them for refugee status, in the hope of finding a more benevolent approach to their claims, could not be countenanced. This is the essential underpinning of Dublin II. Therefore, that the first state in which asylum is claimed should normally be required to deal with the application and, where the application is successful, to cater for the refugee's needs is not only obvious, it is fundamental to an effective and comprehensive system of refugee protection. Asylum seeking is now a world-wide phenomenon. It must be tackled on a co-operative, international basis. The recognition of a presumption that members of an alliance of states such as those which comprise the European Union will comply with their international obligations reflects not only principle but pragmatic considerations. A system whereby a state which is asked to confer refugee status on someone who has already applied for that elsewhere should be obliged, in every instance, to conduct an intense examination of avowed failings of the first state would lead to disarray.</span></p>

The debate must centre, therefore, on how the presumption should operate. Its essential purpose must be kept clearly in mind. It is to set the context for consideration of whether an individual applicant will be subject to violation of his fundamental rights if he is returned to the listed country. The presumption should not operate to stifle the presentation and consideration of evidence that this will be the consequence of enforced return.

He published a report on 18 September 2012.  He made a number of criticisms broadly in line with those in the UNHCR report of July 2012.   In particular, though he was complimentary about the quality of the service provided by SPRARs, he was concerned at the “woefully inadequate” number of SPRAR places available, leading to the risk of BIPs becoming homeless or having to live below minimum subsistence standards.</span>

In May and June 2013 the Swiss Refugee Council (“the SRC”) which is an independent NGO associated with Caritas and various Swiss humanitarian charities and the Swiss section of Amnesty International, sent a three-person delegation to Rome and Milan to report on the current situation for asylum-seekers and BIPs in Italy, and in particular Dublin returnees.  The subject is one of particular importance in Switzerland because in 2012 over 80% of Dublin returnees to Italy were from Switzerland.

The Introduction explains that the report is based on the delegation’s interviews with a wide range of NGOs, representatives of the Italian authorities, refugees and other interested persons.  The report draws attention, <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>, to a serious shortage of accommodation in both CARAs and SPRARs and to the fact that as a result many asylum-seekers and, in particular, BIPs are living in inadequate accommodation or are homeless and destitute.</p>

The assessment of whether there are substantial grounds for believing that the applicant faces a real risk of being subjected to treatment in breach of Article 3 risk must necessarily be a rigorous one … and inevitably requires that the Court assess the conditions in the receiving country against the standards of that Convention provision … . These standards imply that the ill-treatment the applicant alleges he or she will face if returned must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this is relative, depending on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration, nature and context of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim … . The Court reiterates that it is in principle for the applicant to adduce evidence capable of proving that there are substantial grounds for believing that, if the measure complained of were to be implemented, he or she would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 … .</p>

The Court lastly notes that the applicant, as a single mother of two small children, remains eligible for special consideration – where it concerns admission to reception facilities for asylum seekers – as a vulnerable person within the meaning of article 8 of Legislative Decree no. 140/2005 ….</p>

Taking into account the reports drawn up by both governmental and non-governmental institutions and organisations on the reception schemes for asylum seekers in Italy, the Court considers that, while the general situation and living conditions in Italy of asylum seekers, accepted refugees and aliens who have been granted a residence permit for international protection or humanitarian purposes may disclose some shortcomings (see paragraphs 43, 44, 46 and 49 above [being the paragraphs setting out the criticisms made by the UNHCR and others]), it has not been shown to disclose a systemic failure to provide support or facilities catering for asylum seekers as members of a particularly vulnerable group of people, as was the case in <span style="font-style:italic">M.S.S. v.

The reports drawn up by the UNHCR and the Commissioner for Human Rights<span style="background-color:FFFFFF"> </span>refer to recent improvements intended to remedy some of the failings and all reports are unanimous in depicting a detailed structure of facilities and care to provide for the needs of asylum seekers …. The Court would also note the manner in which the applicant was treated upon her arrival in Italy in August 2008, in particular that her request for protection was processed within a matter of months and accommodation was made available to the applicant along with access to health care and other facilities. Against this background, the Court considers that the applicant has not shown that her future prospects if returned to Italy, whether taken from a material, physical or psychological perspective, disclose a sufficiently real and imminent risk of hardship severe enough to fall within the scope of Article 3 (see [various authorities, including <span style="font-style:italic">MSS</span> at para. 219]).

The Court was well aware of the deficiencies in the Italian system, as revealed in particular in the reports of UNHCR and Mr Muižniek, but it also noted that, unlike in Greece, there remained “a detailed structure of facilities and care to provide for the needs of asylum seekers”, and it held that the various shortcomings disclosed by the reports were not such as to demonstrate a risk that Ms Hussein would suffer hardship of sufficient severity.  The reasoning cannot have been that there was a real risk that Ms Hussein would have to live on the streets or in a squat or emergency accommodation, but that that did not constitute sufficient hardship: that would be inconceivable in the case of a mother with young children.  Rather, it plainly was that the Italian authorities could be trusted, in the circumstances of her case, to find her accommodation which, if not ideal, was sufficient to prevent the kind of inhuman and degrading treatment suffered by the applicant in <span style="font-style:italic">MSS</span>. </p>

He said that that formulation derives from a different line of Strasbourg authority and that the only correct formulation was that which appears in <span style="font-style:italic">Soering</span>, namely “real risk”.

While not disregarding the criticism raised in various reports concerning factual obstacles to the lodging of asylum applications in Italy …, the Court finds that the information available does not point to the conclusion that those singular incidents amount to such a systemic failure as was the case in <span style="font-style:italic">M.S.S. v Belgium and Greece …</span> . The same applies as regards the reports concerning the shortcomings of the general situation and living conditions for asylum seekers in Italy (see for the reports <span style="font-style:italic">Mohammed Hussein</span>, cited above, §§ 43-44, 46 and 49). Therefore, the Court establishes that there is no indication in the applicants’ submissions or deriving from the general information available that the applicants would not be able to access sufficiently thorough asylum proceedings upon their arrival in Italy or that the reception schemes failed in such a way to provide support or facilities for asylum seekers as members of a particularly vulnerable group of people (see also ibid., § 78).</p>

The Italian Government’s observations also indicate that the Italian authorities are aware of the second applicant’s considerable mental health problems. The Court therefore concludes that the Italian authorities consider that the applicants, as a group of vulnerable persons within the meaning of Article 8 of Legislative Decree no. 140/2005 …, will be eligible for special consideration as regards access to housing and psychological and medical care. Furthermore, the Italian authorities emphasised in their comments on the report of the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights that, when the transferring country reported a particular vulnerability of a Dublin-returner, appropriate medical measures were taken. Special attention was paid to aliens with physical and psychological trauma, who were entrusted to the medical stations of the reception centres or at local level to receive treatment and support in a professional and appropriate way … .</p>

Under these circumstances, the Court finds that there is no basis on which it can be assumed that the applicants will not be able to benefit from the available resources in Italy or that, if they encounter difficulties, the Italian authorities will not respond in an appropriate manner to any request for further assistance (see for comparison <span style="font-style:italic">Mohammed Hussein, </span>cited above, § 78).”</p>

The Court further finds, also in view of the manner in which the applicants who stayed in Italy were treated by the Italian authorities after their initial arrival in Italy, that none of the applicants – whom the Court regards as asylum seekers – have established that their future prospects, if returned to Italy, whether taken from a material, physical or psychological perspective, disclose a sufficiently real and imminent risk of hardship severe enough to fall within the scope of Article 3.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First, something should be said about what implications can be drawn from the way in which the Supreme Court disposed of the case.  There were four cases before it – <span style="font-style:italic">EM (Eritrea), EH (Iran), AE (Eritrea) </span>and<span style="font-style:italic"> MA (Eritrea)</span>.  EM’s case was heard at first instance by Kenneth Parker J – see [2011] EWHC 2012 (Admin) (also reported at [2012] 1 CMLR 42) and [2012] EWHC 1799 (Admin) (<span style="text-decoration:underline">sub nom</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">R (Medhanye) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span>): he had initially stayed the decision pending the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">NS</span>, but following that decision he dismissed the claim.  MA’s claim was dismissed by Langstaff J – see [2012] EWHC 56 (Admin) (<span style="text-decoration:underline">sub nom</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">R (Meaza Asefa) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span>).  EH and AE had both been refused permission to apply for judicial review at first instance but permission was given by the Court of Appeal and the claim for judicial review retained there.  In at least three of the cases the claimants were, on the facts as alleged, peculiarly vulnerable.  EH suffered from PTSD and depression, and there was a real risk that if he were returned to Italy he would be homeless.  AE had been granted asylum in Italy but had had to live in a squat where she was repeatedly raped.  MA had also been granted asylum in Italy but said that she had had to live on the streets and had been raped.  She was said to be suicidal at the prospect of having to return to Italy.  As I have already explained, the Court of Appeal said that, but for what it understood to be the requirement that a “systemic” deficiency in reception arrangements be proved, it would have quashed the certificates in all four cases because it could not be said to be unarguable that there was a risk of the claimants suffering inhuman and degrading treatment if returned (see para. 61 of its judgment).  Although the Supreme Court held that the Court of Appeal’s understanding of the law was wrong, it did not itself proceed to quash the certificates, as it should have done if it had positively endorsed the Court of Appeal’s conclusion that the facts relied on arguably disclosed a real risk of a breach of article 3.  That means that the observations of the Court of Appeal cannot be relied on as an authoritative statement of what the outcome should have been on the correct test.  However, it would be wrong to rely on the course taken by the Supreme Court as a positive rejection of the Court of Appeal’s approach, since it is not clear that it was in fact invited itself to quash the decisions: the relevant passage of Lord Kerr’s judgment, at paras. 65-68, is directed only to the question whether the first-instance decisions of Kenneth Parker J and Langstaff J should be allowed to stand.  </p>

The finding of facts by a court of law on the scale involved here is necessarily a problematical exercise, prone to influence by accidental factors such as the date of a report, or its sources, or the quality of its authorship, and conducted in a single intensive session. The High Commissioner for Refugees, by contrast, is today the holder of an internationally respected office with an expert staff (numbering 7,190 in 120 different states, according to its website), able to assemble and monitor information from year to year and to apply to it standards of knowledge and judgment which are ordinarily beyond the reach of a court. In doing this, and in reaching his conclusions, he has the authority of the General Assembly of the United Nations, by whom he is appointed and to whom he reports. It is intelligible in this situation that a supranational court should pay special regard both to the facts which the High Commissioner reports and to the value judgments he arrives at within his remit.”</p>

In a report of July 2012 containing recommendations in relation to Italy, UNHCR did not call for a halt to all Dublin transfers to Italy. But, as Mr Fordham QC, for UNHCR, submitted, this does not mean that the organisation considered that there were no legal obstacles to particular transfers taking place or that UNHCR had given Italy a ‘clean bill of health’.</span>

The recommendations contained in UNHCR's report of July 2012 and its more recent report of July 2013 will doubtless be examined carefully by the Administrative Court. While, because of their more muted contents, they do not partake of the ‘pre-eminent and possibly decisive’ quality of the reports on Greece, they nevertheless contain useful information which the court will wish to judiciously consider. Assumptions should not be made about any lack of recommendations concerning general suspension of returns under Dublin II to Italy but it is of obvious significance that UNHCR did not make any such proposal. The UNHCR material should form part of the overall examination of the particular circumstances of each of the appellant's cases, no more and no less.”</span>

The sixth child was born in Switzerland.  It was their case that reception arrangements for asylum-seekers in Italy were wholly inadequate, by reason in particular of (a) the slowness of the relevant procedure, (b) the fact that there were insufficient places available in the CARA and SPRAR systems, so that they risked having to live in a squat or even on the streets, and (c) the living conditions in the CARAs, drawing on their experience in Bari.

Those cases are not directly comparable with the cases before us but it is worth identifying the basis on which they were decided.  In June 2015 the Italian government formally notified the other states in the Council of Europe that arrangements of the kind which had operated post- <span style="font-style:italic">Tarakhel</span>, under which specific guarantees of accommodation were given on a case-by-case basis, were proving wasteful because too often the families in question never took advantage of them.  Its policy was accordingly to earmark 161 places in SPRARs which would be available as required for families with children (an assurance was given that the number would be increased if necessary) and no longer to give specific guarantees. The Court in each case held that in the light of that policy there was no breach of article 3 in the families in question being returned to Italy and declared the applications inadmissible.  The starting-point of its reasoning is the statement of principle in <span style="font-style:italic">Tarakhel</span> and the conclusion in that case (paras. 114-115) that the situation in Italy was in no way comparable to that in Greece and could not justify a general bar on returns.  The issue was accordingly case-specific, and the essential question was whether the Italian government’s assurance about accommodation in one of the 161 places should be accepted: in each case the Court found no reason to doubt it.  Case-specific points raised in <span style="font-style:italic">JA</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">ATH </span>based on the health of the mother (in <span style="font-style:italic">JA</span> there was a risk of suicide) were rejected on the basis that the Italian authorities could be relied on to provide the necessary care.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in;text-indent:-0.39in">(1)<marker name="tab"/>The fundamental question is whether “substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person concerned faces a real risk of being subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in the receiving country” (<span style="font-style:italic">MSS</span>, para. 365, adopting the test originally formulated in <span style="font-style:italic">Soering</span>).</p>

But the anticipated treatment relied on must attain “a minimum level of severity”.  In particular, a breach is not shown merely by showing that “the applicant’s material and social living conditions would be significantly reduced if he or she were to be removed from the Contracting State” (<span style="font-style:italic">Tarakhel</span>, paras. 93-95).  Nor is it sufficient to show no more than that there is a risk of a breach of the applicable EU Directives: this is not explicitly stated in the case-law but it is necessarily implicit in the approach of the Court in the cases cited, and in particular the two Grand Chamber decisions of <span style="font-style:italic">MSS</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Tarakhel</span>. </p>

But that presumption is of course rebuttable (<span style="font-style:italic">EM (Eritrea)</span>, para. 41; <span style="font-style:italic">Tarakhel</span>, para. 103); and there is no requirement that in order to rebut it the applicant must show that that the risk which he alleges is the result of “systemic” defects in the arrangements made for asylum-seekers or BIPs in the receiving country (<span style="font-style:italic">EM (Eritrea)</span>, paras. 41-42; <span style="font-style:italic">Tarakhel</span> paras. 104-105).    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The last of those points does not of course mean that evidence about problems with the system for dealing with asylum-seekers and BIPs in the receiving state is irrelevant.  Applicants will not be able to show that there is a real risk of their suffering inhuman or degrading treatment if returned merely by showing that there have been some particular cases of such treatment: they will in practice need to show that such cases are widespread.  Proving that will often, or indeed generally, involve proving that there are systemic failings, or “major operational problems”, in the arrangements in the receiving country; and references to such failings or problems are found frequently both in the decision of the CJEU in <span style="font-style:italic">NS (Afghanistan)</span> and in numerous decisions of the ECtHR.  The error of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">EM (Eritrea)</span> was only that it treated the proof of a “systemic” deficiency as a legal pre-condition for a breach of article 3 instead of a means by which a risk of such a breach might be established.  That is clearly acknowledged in the judgment of Lord Kerr in the Supreme Court: see particularly para. 63.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Although the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">MSS</span> was concerned with an asylum-seeker, it is in my view clear that the relevant principles apply equally in the case of Dublin returnees who have already been granted international protection.  In both <span style="font-style:italic">Hussein</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">AME</span> the applicants were BIPs, but the Court adopted the same approach in principle as in <span style="font-style:italic">MSS</span>: see, for example, para. 75 of the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Hussein</span>, finding no breach of article 3 in respect of the applicant’s treatment “either as an asylum seeker or as an alien having been accepted as a person in need of international protection”.  That is consistent with Lord Kerr’s approach in <span style="font-style:italic">EM (Eritrea)</span> (see para. 85 above) and with what one would in any event expect.  The special needs of refugees do not necessarily disappear at the moment that they are granted asylum, and those who were peculiarly vulnerable before the grant of asylum may remain peculiarly vulnerable thereafter.  Access to integration facilities of the kind required by article 25 of the Qualification Directive, including a limited period of free accommodation, may – depending on the circumstances of the case – be essential if they are to avoid falling into circumstances sufficiently degrading to constitute a breach of article 3.  I must emphasise that I am referring only to the question of principle – that is, whether it is open to a BIP to advance an “<span style="font-style:italic">MSS</span>-type” claim at all.  I am not saying that the actual situations of asylum-seekers and BIPs are identical.  On the contrary, it is clear that they are not, which is the point being made by the ECtHR at para. 179 of its judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Hassan</span> (para. 80 above).  On the whole, because of the more extensive rights enjoyed by BIPs it may be reasonable to regard them as being at lesser risk of suffering inhumane or degrading treatment than asylum-seekers; but that may not always be so, and it is necessary to look at the actual circumstances on the ground in each case. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">So far so good, but the more difficult question is what light the authorities cast on how those principles apply in the case of returns to Italy.  The Strasbourg cases are not formally authoritative on that question.  It is for the domestic courts to decide on the application of the relevant principles to the facts of the particular case before them, and on the basis of the evidence adduced.  However, how the ECtHR has applied the principles which it has itself enunciated to the particular cases before it gives valuable guidance as to the content and interpretation of those principles; and in a case where the facts and evidence are very similar the domestic decision-taker (whether that is a tribunal or the Secretary of State in forming a view as to what a tribunal would decide) is entitled to take its lead from the Strasbourg court.  On the specific question of whether it is legitimate to return asylum-seekers to Italy it is indeed highly desirable that the ECtHR and the domestic tribunals adopt a consistent approach, provided always (a) that that approach is founded on good evidence and (b) that decision-makers recognise that the facts of a particular case, or evidence of significant changes in the situation in Italy, may require a departure from it.  I do not believe that any of that is contentious.  Both parties urged us to follow the Strasbourg decisions (or some of them): where they differed was about where those cases led.</p>

The crucial question is whether that conclusion is limited to cases of that specific kind or whether it follows from the Court’s reasoning that the obligation to seek assurances arises in other cases also.  That question was explicitly raised by the dissentients, who indeed raised the possibility that the reasoning of the majority entailed that (since it had been said in <span style="font-style:italic">MSS</span> that asylum-seekers as a class are particularly vulnerable) such assurances would have to be sought in every case of the return of an asylum-seeker to Italy.  But a less extreme reading would be that the Court’s reasoning extends at least to the case of all other asylum-seekers who are peculiarly vulnerable, such as victims of rape or torture or those with mental health problems, so that returns of such asylum-seekers to Italy would be in breach of article 3 in the absence of specific assurances that they would be suitably accommodated.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Although in his original skeleton argument Mr Husain advanced both those possible readings, in the supplementary skeleton and his oral submissions he focused on the latter.  He reminded us in particular that the Reception Directive required special provision to be made for “vulnerable persons such as minors, unaccompanied minors, disabled people, elderly people, pregnant women, single parents with minor children, victims of human trafficking, persons with serious illnesses, persons with mental disorders and persons who have been subjected to torture, rape or other serious forms of psychological, physical or sexual violence” (see para. 44 above).  Since the basis of the Court’s conclusion was the risk of accommodation, or suitable accommodation, not being available, and that risk would impact on all peculiarly vulnerable persons, and not just children, the reasoning must extend to the entire class.  The distinction which the Court drew between the situation in Greece and that in Italy was only that in the case of a return to Greece there would necessarily and in all cases be a real risk of inhuman and degrading treatment while in the case of Italy that risk could be removed by the giving of sufficiently specific assurances. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not accept Mr Husain’s submissions on this question.  In my view it is wrong to treat the reasoning of the majority in <span style="font-style:italic">Tarakhel</span> as going any further than the particular kind of case with which the Court was concerned – that is to say, families with minor children.  There is some indication to that effect in the judgment itself, but the position is confirmed by the subsequent authorities.  I take them in turn.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">So far as the judgment itself is concerned, para. 119 is a central part of the Court’s chain of reasoning.  It refers to the “specific needs and extreme vulnerability” of children: that picks up on para. 99, which records the special protection accorded to asylum-seekers who are minors by reason of their specific needs.  It says that it follows that they must have “reception conditions … adapted to their age”.  The immediately following paragraphs, which address the circumstances of the particular case, are founded on that point.  The conclusion in paras. 120 and 122 is that the Swiss authorities must obtain assurances that the applicants would be received in facilities “adapted to the age of the children, and that the family will be kept together”: the element of the family being kept together was evidently particularly important to the Court.  The passage as a whole is very specifically directed to the position of children.  The Court was explicitly referred to the 2013 decisions.  Its decision would seem to represent a departure from some of them, since they included cases, one being <span style="font-style:italic">Hussein</span>, where the applicants included a child.  But although the dissentients suggest that the departure was fundamental in character, there is no suggestion that the majority believed that that was the case, as opposed to applying the relevant principles (in connection with which it referred explicitly to <span style="font-style:italic">Hussein</span>) to a particular situation and on the particular evidence adduced.  The Court’s analysis does not refer at any point to the provisions of Chapter IV of the Reception Directive or to any general concept of peculiar vulnerability.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I also regard it as of some significance that in the most recent cases referred to at para. 104 above the Court has departed from the position that specific assurances are required in the case of the return of a family with children and has held that a more general assurance about the availability of accommodation, as there recorded, was sufficient.  That change of position cannot be read across directly to the present case, because the Italian authorities have not offered even that more generalised kind of assurance for vulnerable persons other than children.  But the cases in question are a useful reminder of the nature of the relevant exercise.  What is required in each case is an assessment of the risk that the Italian authorities will be unable comply with their article 3 obligations; and in a case where the evidence showed that the Italian authorities had adapted their system to reinforce the protection of particularly vulnerable returnees the Court was prepared to proceed on the basis that the system would work even in the absence of specific assurances.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I of course understand the argument that if, as the Court believed in <span style="font-style:italic">Tarakhel</span>, there is a real risk that there will be insufficient accommodation to meet the demand for suitable accommodation for families it must follow that there will also be insufficient accommodation for other classes of vulnerable returnees who need equivalent accommodation.  But I think it is clear, for the reasons given, that the Court has not gone that far.  That is not necessarily illogical. The problems of accommodating a family together (particularly a family of eight), in child-friendly accommodation, might reasonably be thought to be substantially greater than those of finding suitable accommodation for a single vulnerable person, and the risks of failing to do so might also be thought to be greater; so that the fact that specific assurances were required in the former case did not necessarily mean that they were required in the latter. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In short, therefore, reading the Strasbourg authorities as a whole, I believe that the message of the cases to date is that the evidence to which the ECtHR has been referred (including and in particular the evidence about the shortage of accommodation in CARAs and SPRARs) is not sufficient generally to undermine the presumption that Italy will comply with its obligations under article 3 and the relevant EU Directives, the only exception being for the case of families with minor children.  It is important to emphasise that I am at this point concerned only with the question of how far the case-law has gone.  I am not to be taken as saying that it is not open to us in this case, on the basis of the evidence before us, to reach an equivalent decision to that in <span style="font-style:italic">Tarakhel</span> in the Appellants’ cases: I am saying only that the reasoning in the cases to date, and in particular in <span style="font-style:italic">Tarakhel</span>, does not point towards such a decision.</p>

At that stage they will advise them if the returnee is particularly vulnerable or has particular needs (para. 18).  In the case of returnees with health needs they will supply a copy of their medical records, provided they consent (para. 19).  Mr Dangerfield says that if the information provided suggests that this is necessary medical staff will be present at the point when the ordinary verification procedures are performed by the border police.  He says that following verification the police will refer the returnee to the airport NGO for assistance (para. 20).  That evidence is of course consistent with what was said in the most recent decision letter in NA’s case: see para. 17 above.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In his witness statement for these proceedings Mr Dangerfield gives substantially the same evidence though in a slightly different form.  He appears to say in the case of each category of returnee that they will be “medically assessed” at the airport (see paras. 20, 21, 23 and 24), but it may be that he means only that the NGOs will conduct a medical assessment where the UK authorities have provided prior notice of health problems or where they identify them for themselves: he deals with the latter category at para. 25 (making no distinction between BIPs and others).  The point does not matter for our purposes because in the cases of both NA and MR the Respondent says that she will notify the Italian authorities of their health problems.  In such a case he says that following the assessment the NGO will transfer the returnee either to a hospital or to “an appropriate accommodation centre”, where they will receive a further medical assessment.  </p>

He says that BIPs will be entitled to SPRAR accommodation unless they have already been in such accommodation and that even in that case they will still be entitled to it if they are vulnerable (which must mean, in the terminology adopted above, peculiarly vulnerable).  He says that in his experience “returnees with refugee status who are assessed to be vulnerable are always accommodated in some form, usually in a SPRAR” (para. 23).  He says at para. 25 that certain accommodation centres have special provision for dealing with people with special needs, such as those suffering from PTSD, and the authorities will endeavour to arrange for returnees with such needs to be accommodated accordingly.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As for availability of accommodation, Mr Husain asked us to note that the report says (at p. 53) that “the main negative aspect of the Italian reception system consists in the reduced number of places and structures that are not sufficient to provide to all asylum seekers in need an adequate reception”.  It is necessary to look, however, at what it says specifically about the SPRAR accommodation.  As to that, it notes the rapid expansion of SPRAR places, giving a figure of 19,900 as at the end of 2014 and noting a very substantial increase in the allocation of government funding (p. 53).  But it makes clear that some of that extra capacity is taken up by asylum-seekers rather than BIPs.  In the context of Dublin returnees it refers to the number of SPRAR places available as “limited” (p. 31), though the problem is to some extent mitigated by the ERF-funded accommodation, which it describes as available to “either all the Dublin returnees or to vulnerable categories among Dubliners” (<span style="font-style:italic">loc. cit.</span>): Mr Husain submits that there is a doubt whether the ERF accommodation is in fact available to BIPs as opposed to asylum-seekers, but it is not necessary to resolve the point.  Beyond the reference to SPRAR accommodation being limited, AIDA gives no specific figures: in particular, nothing is said about waiting-times.  It does refer to accommodation in SPRARs being dependent “on the availability of places and the urgency and vulnerability of the case” (p. 53), which suggests that an element of prioritisation occurs.  It refers to the authorities sometimes filling centres beyond their official capacity and also to BIPs and asylum-seekers who are unable to access accommodation having to live in settlements such as the notorious “Selam Palace” in Rome where conditions are very poor.  </p>

But it does not significantly alter the picture appearing from the earlier evidence.

As is to be expected, different courts express themselves in different language, reflecting their differing judicial traditions. But in substance, the approach adopted by the Supreme Court involved recognising that Member States can be presumed to be complying with their obligations under EU law and international law. That can be rebutted in one of two ways. First, it may be rebutted in the case of all asylum seekers if there were sufficient evidence of substantial operational difficulties in the receiving state. Secondly, while the presumption would be the backcloth for considering individual cases, there may be situations where, on the individual facts of the case viewed against the overall situation (even if that situation did not rebut the presumption in all cases), there were still substantial grounds for believing that there would be a real risk on return.

In<span class="apple-converted-space" style="font-size:13.5pt;color:#000000"> </span><span style="font-style:italic">MSS v Greece</span>, for example, it effectively considered that the circumstances were such that the assumption that an EU Member State was complying with its obligation was rebutted.

But it is important to appreciate that there is no necessity for a two-stage approach of this kind.  There is no sharp distinction between cases that depend on the general situation in the country of return, to be assessed by reference to whether the presumption of compliance has been rebutted, and cases that depend on some “individual facts” peculiar to the particular returnee.  The ultimate issue is always whether the individual applicant has shown a real risk that if returned he or she will suffer a breach of their article 3 rights: the role of the presumption of compliance is to condition the assessment of that issue.  In all cases the assessment will involve considering both the characteristics of the individual returnees and the general situation in the country of return so as to assess whether a returnee with those characteristics is at real risk of being subjected to inhumane and degrading treatment.</p>

I can see that the way that the Judge framed the issues could have led to his losing focus on the essential question in that way: see my observations at para. 140 above.  But I do not believe that it in fact did so.  He framed the second issue squarely in terms of the <span style="font-style:italic">Soering</span> test and answers it in those terms in the cases of the individual claimants (see, as regards NA, para. 153, quoted at para. 148 above).  </p>

That is a “significant evidential presumption” not for some reason of theory but because it is indeed reasonable as a matter of practical reality to believe that a member state of the Council of Europe will comply with its obligations under the Convention unless the evidence demonstrates that there is a real risk that it will not.  I see no sign that the ECtHR in <span style="font-style:italic">Tarakhel</span> intended to depart from that approach.  On the contrary, in the very paragraphs on which Mr Husain relies it uses the language of a rebuttable presumption and refers specifically to its own previous decision in <span style="font-style:italic">MSS</span> acknowledging the existence of such a presumption and to the decision of the CJEU in <span style="font-style:italic">NS (Afghanistan)</span>, which it discusses at length (see para. 94).  </p>

The essential issue for the Judge was thus simply whether there was a serious risk that if she were returned NA would not be accommodated in a SPRAR: this subsumes the question whether she would receive proper healthcare, and specifically psychiatric care, since it is not argued that even if she were in a SPRAR her needs would not be attended to.

Although the terms of the Reception Directive were relevant in the way identified in <span style="font-style:italic">MSS</span> (see para. 55 above), article 3 does not import an obligation to comply with its terms as such, and still less with those of article 25 of the Qualification Directive (integration facilities).  Long-term homelessness in conditions of the kind described in <span style="font-style:italic">MSS</span> would no doubt constitute such inhumane and degrading treatment but short-term homelessness need not, nor would a situation where she was obliged to live in accommodation which was merely sub-standard.  I accept all that, but I do not think that it is relevant in NA’s case, for the reason already given, namely that she is (at least arguably) sufficiently vulnerable to require not only accommodation but SPRAR accommodation.  Ms Giovannetti’s point is, however, a useful reminder of the “minimum level of severity” qualification.  It would not in my view even arguably be a breach of article 3 if there were, for example, a short delay in SPRAR accommodation being found for her or if the quality of such accommodation and the associated support were merely sub-optimal.     </p>

That would yield a total of persons entitled to accommodation of 64,491.  A further 6,313 migrants had arrived in December, which would yield a total of 70,804, but he said that that total overstated the demand because (a) not all the BIPs would be vulnerable and thus entitled to twelve months in a SPRAR as opposed to six; (b) not all the migrants who arrived in December would seek asylum in Italy; and (c) not all those who were entitled to accommodation would in fact require it (because they might seek to live with family already established in Italy, or within their own ethnic communities or in organisations outside the official network).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.57in">“Ultimately, … in my judgment, the court is not able to resolve precisely the amount of demand against provision for the reasons given. An attempt at absolute precision is likely to be futile. The following conclusions are, however, clear and any tribunal would be bound to accept them. First, the amount of provision made by the Italian authorities has increased over the period up to February 2015. Secondly, when the Italian authorities faced a crisis in 2011 with a large influx of migrants, they ‘responded to the extraordinary strains placed upon the system by creating extra accommodation places’ (per Elisabeth Laing J. in <span style="font-style:italic">Tabrizagh </span>at paragraph 72). Thirdly, the figures of possible shortfalls presented by the Claimants, and which are said to show a glaring discrepancy between demand and the provision of places are unrealistic and could not reasonably be taken by any tribunal as representing the likely position. Fourthly, on any reasonable analysis, no tribunal could consider that the current official figures demonstrate a shortfall due to the absence of key figures (the number of persons coming to Italy who claim asylum and accommodation and the number of BIPs who ceased to occupy a place at a SPRAR during 2014 or by the end of February 2015). Consequently, having regard to all those matters, no tribunal could reasonably conclude on the statistical evidence that the Italian authorities were leaving persons who claimed asylum, or who were BIPs entitled to some form of integration programme, in a situation of homelessness. A tribunal could not, in my judgment, reasonably conclude on the evidence available that there was a glaring discrepancy between demand for facilities and provision and it could not conclude, on the figures, that there were omissions to provide facilities on a widespread or substantial scale, amounting to substantial operational problems, sufficient to displace the presumption of compliance.”</p>

In that case a Kosovar asylum-seeker was resisting being removed to Germany under the Dublin Convention on the basis that if returned he was at risk of refoulement to Yugoslavia in breach of his rights under article 3.  Part of his case depended on a remarkable discrepancy between the rate of grants of asylum to Kosovars in the UK and in Germany which it was said should have put the Secretary of State on enquiry as to whether unlawful refoulement was a real risk.  The Court accepted that case.  Buxton LJ, giving the leading judgment, said at p. 429 that the statistics called for an explanation and that it was for the Secretary of State to investigate the reasons for the discrepancy before deciding whether the claim could be certificated.

The waiting list is long and obtaining a place is a matter of luck. Plans exist to significantly increase the number of places from 3,000 to 16,000 starting in 2014. It remains to be seen whether implementation will be successful and the extent to which this will defuse the accommodation problem in Italy. SPRAR places are always temporary, and the length of stay in the project is not long enough to ensure lasting independence afterwards. Dublin returnees make up only a small percentage of SPRAR participants. It is striking how few of those returned from Switzerland are accommodated in SPRAR. For this reason, the chances of finding a place in a SPRAR programme appears to be very small for returnees with protection status.”</p>

Furthermore, that was the conclusion of Elisabeth Laing J. in <span style="font-style:italic">Tabrizagh</span> at paragraphs 91 to 99 who had subjected the report to what McCloskey J. has described as a ‘more intense, more penetrating’ analysis than the European Court of Human Rights, in the Upper Tribunal decision of <span style="font-style:italic">Weldegaber v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span>. I agree that the material in the report discloses some failings in May and June 2013 but not on the sort of scale which would entitle a tribunal, or other objective observer, to conclude that Italy was breaching its obligations on a widespread scale. Furthermore, the reports were based on visits which took place 2 years ago. There is now further information, discussed above, which indicates the current position in relation to the supply and demand for accommodation. Nor, in my judgment, are the Claimants correct to say that the … report was approved by the European Court of Human Rights in <span style="font-style:italic">Tarakhel v Switzerland</span> so that it is no longer appropriate to rely upon Elisabeth Laing J.'s assessment.

The evidence before the Judge was that by 28 February 2015 over 20,000 SPRAR places were being occupied, as against 3,000 in the period covered by the SRC report.

When they leave the airport they may get in touch with an NGO, who may then be able to arrange for accommodation in a SPRAR or ERF facility (if they have not been so accommodated in the past), but the waiting-lists are very long, sometimes as long as a year: the authors make it clear that they do not have access to authoritative figures for waiting times but are dependent on what the BIPs tell them.  Unless and until they can enter a SPRAR they are dependent on the ordinary services available to the homeless, which are limited, and many accordingly have to live in squats or on the street.

The MEDU report confirms that it is not in a position to provide information on the reception and living conditions for asylum seekers. The report could not, therefore, assist in relation to that group of persons (who include SG). In relation to the report, it is relevant to note its inherent limitations. It is based on BIPs living in Florence and the report expressly states that its expertise is limited to Florence. It refers to serious shortcomings on the part of the authorities in identifying BIPs and vulnerable people. It refers to 13 cases in a squat in Florence, occupied by asylum seekers and BIPs, during the period from September 2013 to May 2014 when such persons had no contact with health care services. The report does not indicate whether these were asylum seekers or BIPs. It does not indicate whether they were returned under the Dublin Regulation.

	      </authorialNote>  It appears that Amnesty understood Lewis J’s observation to the effect that the report was not based on specific data-gathering or studies of the kinds embodied in some of the other reports as meaning that no value could be accorded to its experience based on its presence in Italy and its ongoing monitoring of the position of migrants there.  I do not think that that is what the Judge meant; but he was entitled to point out that the report is more in the nature of a general overview than, say, those of MEDU or SRC.  I am quite sure that the English courts and tribunals will approach any report emanating from Amnesty International with careful attention, but of course what weight should be given to it in any particular case will depend on the extent to which its contents add to the knowledge available from other evidence.</p>

He also relies on the fact that the Respondent did not in her evidence or written submissions prior to the hearing advance the criticisms relied on by the Judge, so that neither she nor he as counsel had the opportunity to answer them.  In support of his submissions Mr Husain seeks to adduce a further witness statement from Ms Leo, dated 31 July 2015: I will refer to this as her “appeal statement”.  He submits that the statement should be admitted because its purpose is to give factual evidence relevant to procedural and other mistakes made by the Judge.  To the extent that that is indeed what it purports to do I can see no objection to it being admitted.  In fact much of what it contains is argumentative and could have been made by way of submission; but the convenient course is to admit it in its entirety.</p>

Where a criticism is flagged up in advance (for example in the other party’s skeleton argument), there is usually an opportunity to answer it by way of submission or by provision of a further statement or other clarificatory material, though there will occasionally be cases – even in judicial review proceedings – where oral evidence and cross-examination may be appropriate; but the problem in the present case is that the criticisms in question were not foreshadowed in submissions of any kind.  Having said that, </span>I would not wish to be understood as saying that a judge in judicial review proceedings must always ensure that a witness has the opportunity specifically to meet every point of criticism that may contribute to their evidence being rejected, in whole or in part.   In many, perhaps most, cases the nature of the issue will be sufficiently clear to enable the judge to make a fair assessment without such an opportunity being given.  What justice requires will inevitably depend on the circumstances of the particular case.</p>

Those criticisms were put forward in support of his conclusion that the reports did not give a “fair, balanced [and] objective picture” and were “partisan”.  I have carefully read both reports in full, and I believe that he was entitled to form the impression that they were written more from the standpoint of a campaigner than as a dispassionate observer.  </span>Although I do not in any way question Ms Leo’s integrity or her knowledge of her subject, her reports do at some points have the flavour of advocacy.  It is because of the importance of obtaining, so far as possible in this difficult field, dispassionate evidence that the courts tend to put particular weight on the reports of established institutions such as UNHCR or the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe or AIDA.  I do not propose to lengthen this already lengthy judgment by giving examples of where Ms Leo may have erred in this direction, since, even though I think the judge’s overall assessment was legitimate, that does not affect my view that he was wrong to exclude her report from consideration altogether<span style="color:#000000">.  It is necessary to distinguish between the weight to be given to her broader conclusions about the risks facing NA if returned and the factual evidence that she gives on specific points.

In his supplementary skeleton argument he added some criticisms of how the Judge dealt with other reports in the evidence – such, for example, as the Brunswick report (see para. 66 (1) above) – though these were not developed in oral submissions.  In the circumstances I can deal with those criticisms compendiously.  Not all the reports in question were concerned with SPRAR accommodation, or the position of Dublin BIPs, at all; but to the extent that they mentioned those aspects none of them addressed the situation as it stood in late 2014. </p>

I have given a sufficient outline of NA’s experience at paras. 11-13 above and of MS’s and SG’s at para. 125.  Mr Husain says that those experiences were “central to the enquiry” for a number of reasons.  They were evidence of the practical realities of the Italian system, as opposed to how it might be supposed to work, showing that there was, to put it no higher, a real risk that the claimants would be exposed to homelessness and destitution if returned.  He submits, on the basis of such cases as <span style="font-style:italic">Demirkaya v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> [1999] EWCA Civ 1654, [1999] INLR 441, that “past ill-treatment is a good indicator of future risk, absent a material change of circumstances”.

That is consistent with what UNHCR told SRC (see para. 178 above).  It is also consistent with the passage from the AIDA March 2015 report quoted at para. 134, though I would not attach decisive importance to it because of the ambiguity there referred to.  Against that is the evidence of MEDU that the airport NGOs do not assist Dublin BIPs (para. 188); of SRC that what they were told by the airport NGOs was different from what they were told by UNHCR (para. 178); and of Ms Leo that Dublin BIPs “<span style="background-color:FFFFFF">did not receive any kind of reception on their arrival in the country” (para. 201).  </span></p>

It may be – though I express no view either way – that the evidence relied on by NA raises a real question as to whether BIPs whose arrival has not been pre-notified in the way described by Mr Dangerfield would be referred to the airport NGOs.  I take the point that the formal position is that a BIP has the full rights of an Italian citizen and does not, other things being equal, require any support: that would explain the response which SRC and Ms Leo apparently received on this question.  But the evidence relied on by NA does not relate to the particular case of a “pre-notified” peculiarly vulnerable Dublin BIP.  I do not think it could reasonably be regarded as outweighing the specific evidence of Mr Dangerfield about what happens in such cases.  That evidence is consistent with the presumption of compliance: to put it less technically, it conforms to what one would expect of a country like Italy which, for all the stresses which it is encountering, has been recognised by UNHCR as having a functioning system for the treatment of asylum-seekers and BIPs.  It is in truth most implausible that a peculiarly vulnerable person, returned in accordance with the procedures described by Mr Dangerfield, and in all probability accompanied by a medical escort, would be offered no assistance by the airport NGOs. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="background-color:FFFFFF">I should also mention in this connection a particular point made by Mr Husain.  It </span>is said that whereas when the Italian authorities accepted responsibility for MS and SG under the Dublin procedures their letter requested at least ten days’ notice “about any particular health situation, both from the physical and from the psychical point of view, as well as about any disability or delicate situation which can entail considerable reception problems” – which would in practice require the provision of her medical records – no such request appears to have been made when it was first sought to remove NA in May 2013.  Mr Husain suggests that this reflects the fact that the Ministry did not believe that they had any responsibility for her as a BIP and thus also that it would take no steps to assess her condition on arrival.  It is not clear from the papers before us what communications there were between the UK and the Italian authorities on that earlier occasion.  I accept that it is not implausible that the standard forms employed would be different in the case of a returning BIP – though in fact MS was also a BIP – and thus there might not have been an explicit request from the Italian authorities for ten days’ notice of any medical condition.  But even if that were so it could not possibly be the basis for rejecting the explicit evidence of Mr Dangerfield that NA’s medical records would be sent (if she consented) and that the Italian authorities would conduct an assessment accordingly.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Husain also refers in his skeleton argument to two passages in reports that were before the Court.  The former says that “Italy … do[es] not have standard practices in place to conduct a vulnerability assessment”; and the latter that assessments are not performed “systematically” and are performed only in the accommodation to which the asylum-seeker is allocated, where the quality will depend on the expertise available.  He complains that the Judge did not deal with this evidence.  It is far from clear to me that the evidence in question was ever relied on by the claimants: I see no reference to it in their skeleton argument below, and the documents referred to were in the Respondent’s bundle rather than the claimants’.  But even if the Judge was referred to these passages I can understand why he felt it unnecessary to address them specifically.  Once it is accepted, as he found, that NA’s return would be pre-notified to the Italian authorities, with notice of her vulnerability and (subject to her consent) a copy of her health records, there is no reason to believe that there is a real risk that that vulnerability will simply be ignored – still less, again, if she is accompanied by a medical escort.  It may be that the procedures for assessment are variable and that some may be sub-optimal, but that fact alone cannot come close to the attaining the minimum threshold of severity required to give rise to a breach of article 3.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The question then is whether there is a risk that even if NA is offered support and assistance by the airport NGO – and by any other organisation to which they may refer her – they will be unable to offer her SPRAR accommodation (in which term I include other forms of accommodation suitable to her condition).  I do not believe that such a risk has even arguably been established.  There was no doubt an acute shortage of SPRAR accommodation in 2012, when there were only some 3,000 places.  But the official figures, relied on by both parties, show that by 28 February 2015 over 20,000 people were being accommodated in SPRARs: see para. 163 (2) above.  I accept that SRC, MEDU and Ms Leo all refer to the existence of waiting lists, and SRC and MEDU refer to the waiting time sometimes being as long as a year.  But SRC’s data comes from the period before the recent increase in provision (as it explicitly acknowledges), and MEDU’s is of uncertain date and admittedly anecdotal.  Ms Leo’s is the most recent.  It refers to a circular from the Ministry of the Interior from March 2014 referring to the SPRARs being “saturated”, and to evidence of waiting-lists experienced by “some operators” of two to three months: see para. 200 above.  The lack of particularity about the “operators” in question is unsatisfactory, but I would not for that reason discount it altogether.  However, the date of the Ministry’s circular is almost a year before the date with which the Judge was concerned.  In other circumstances such a time-lapse might not be significant, and I appreciate that it will never be possible to present the Court with evidence that is completely up-to-date.  But the crucial point about the present case is that it was accepted by all concerned that the SPRAR system was being expanded as a matter of urgency, and that the figures showed that its capacity had grown very rapidly over the previous year: in those circumstances the passage of time was likely to have made a real difference.  I note also that the possible waiting period of two to three months referred to by Ms Leo’s evidence is already much less than that reported in the earlier reports.  Taken as a whole, this evidence does not in my view justify the conclusion – contrary to the evidence of Mr Dangerfield – that there is a real risk that NA would not if returned be found a SPRAR place if she were judged sufficiently vulnerable to require one.</p>

It is not realistic to suppose that the recent efforts by the authorities to improve support and provision for Dublin BIPs, among others, have removed all the problems previously encountered; and it is possible that there may be some difficulties, delays and uncertainties before she is fully assessed and securely settled in SPRAR accommodation.  But temporary inadequacies in provision would not meet the minimum level of severity on which the ECtHR case-law insists.  What, on the evidence, I am sure of is that as a Dublin returnee NA will not be simply abandoned by the system in the way that occurred when she was required to leave Cassa Calenga and be left homeless and destitute.  I should also say that Mr Husain expressly accepted that the evidence showed that if NA is adjudged to be in need of immediate medical attention she will receive it.  </p>

The evidence does not support the proposition that they include BIPs who have been returned from this country, in the circumstances that NA would be returned, and have nevertheless ended up on the streets because no provision has been made for them.  </p>

The evidence about the problems in the Italian system for both asylum-seekers and BIPs was similar to that in the present case: indeed in some respects it showed a worse position, particularly as regards the availability of SPRAR accommodation.  But the Court found that there was no risk of a breach of her article 3 rights, having regard to the fact that her return would have been pre-notified and that she was entitled to special consideration as a vulnerable person: see paras. 76-78 of its judgment, quoted at para. 71 above.  <span style="font-style:italic">Daytbegova</span> is not on all fours because the applicants were not BIPs, but it is nevertheless significant that the Court was prepared to proceed – without requiring specific assurances – on the basis that hand-over arrangements could and would be made between the Austrian and Italian authorities which would meet the daughter’s particular health needs.  </p>

In that case the appellants were Sri Lankan Tamils, brother and sister, who had been the victims of torture and rape by the security forces and suffered from PTSD and depression in consequence.  Their claims for asylum in the UK failed on the basis that there was, objectively, no risk of further ill-treatment if they were returned; but they resisted removal to Sri Lanka on the basis that if they were returned they were likely to be driven to suicide.  Their case was they had a genuine and overwhelming fear, whether or not well-founded, that on return they would again be tortured and abused by the security forces, and also that they had no-one to turn to there for support because their entire family had been killed in the tsunami.  That case was accepted by this Court.  Its essential reasoning appears from para. 61 of the judgment of Sedley LJ, where he said:</p>

In the first place, there is no certainty that she will persist in her refusal: on the contrary, it must be more likely that, when she appreciates that she will indeed be returned and has the benefit of further advice, she will change her mind.  But, even if she does not, the result of her refusal will not be to deprive her of access to treatment.  It will still be the Respondent’s responsibility to notify the Italian authorities of her vulnerability and of Dr Obuaya’s diagnosis, including the risk of suicide, and explain why it has not been possible to supply her records.  The lack of the records may be a hindrance to treatment but it will not mean that she cannot be treated at all or that appropriate steps cannot be taken to ensure against the risk of suicide.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">That conclusion means that I need not consider a further question raised in Mr Husain’s skeleton argument which may not be entirely straightforward.  There is plainly a powerful argument that even if the non-transfer of the records did prevent steps being taken to treat NA and mitigate the risk of suicide, that is the result of her own deliberate decision and not of the act of the UK government in returning her to Italy: it would be different if she were not competent to take that decision, but that has not been argued.  However, Mr Husain seeks to draw analogies with the situation considered by the ECtHR in <span style="font-style:italic">Saadi v Italy </span>(2009) 49 EHRR 30 and/or with that considered by this Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Danian v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> [1999] EWCA Civ 3000, [2000] Imm AR 96, which both in (very) different ways involve the proposition that in an article 3 context it may be necessary to disregard risks created by the applicant’s own conduct.  I doubt if those are useful analogies.  If I had a concern in this area it would be more about whether the question whether NA was legally competent to take the decision to refuse to consent to the disclosure of her notes is the only touchstone: perhaps it might be enough for her to show that, as Dr Obuaya says, her decision was significantly affected by her mental ill-health.  But I am not willing to express any definitive view on these points where it is unnecessary to do so and where we did not have the benefit of oral argument.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, the position as regards grounds 2-4 requires slightly fuller consideration.  The primary difference between MR’s case and NA’s is that he is an asylum-seeker rather than a BIP.  As explained above, the legal positions of asylum-seekers and BIPs in Italy are different, and that difference has practical consequences as regards accommodation and support.  The essential question is thus whether Lewis J was entitled to find that there was no risk that SG – in whose shoes MR stands for these purposes – would be subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment if returned to Italy.  Again, the focus of the case is squarely on the availability of suitable accommodation: see para. 99 of the judgment, quoted at para. 121 above.   I consider in the following paragraphs whether that question is answered by the conclusions that I have reached in NA’s case. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As we have seen, there is an issue in NA’s case as to whether she would have access to the airport NGOs because she was a BIP.  That issue does not arise in MR’s case.  It is common ground that as a returning asylum-seeker he would be referred to the NGO for appropriate advice and support.  The question is whether, even with that assistance, he would be found appropriate accommodation pending the determination of his claim.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to that, it is MR’s case that, like SG, he has serious mental health problems – see paras. 22-23 above – and accordingly that he is peculiarly vulnerable.  Asylum-seekers who are peculiarly vulnerable are typically accommodated in SPRARs.  It follows from my conclusions in NA’s case that appropriate accommodation will be available for MR if required.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On that basis it is unnecessary for me to consider what the position would be if MR were not peculiarly vulnerable and accordingly did not qualify for accommodation in a SPRAR and fell to be accommodated in a CARA.   Although some of the reports relied on by the claimants in <span style="font-style:italic">MS</span> dealt with the availability of CARA places and the conditions of accommodation there, Lewis J did not consider that evidence, and it was not the focus of the submissions before us.  I would only observe that the clear message of the post-<span style="font-style:italic">Tarakhel</span> decisions of the ECtHR discussed at paras. 100-104 above – and indeed of <span style="font-style:italic">Tarakhel</span> itself – appears to be that the acknowledged problems about reception conditions for asylum-seekers in Italy are not such as to act as a bar to the return of those without any peculiar vulnerability: see in particular the passages from the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">AME v Netherlands</span> quoted at para. 101 above.  That is consistent with the fact that UNHCR has not made any general recommendation against returns to Italy equivalent to that made in the case of Greece.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is one observation that I wish to make by way of coda.  I think it is a pity that the issues raised in these cases have had to be decided in the context of a judicial review challenge to a certification decision.  In a certification challenge the Court has to focus not on what it believes is the right decision but on what a tribunal – which is in principle the primary forum for determination of the underlying issues – might decide: that is an inherently awkward exercise, and it carries the risk that if the Court believes that the answers are less than clear-cut the litigation will have to start all over again in the tribunal (as nearly happened in <span style="font-style:italic">EM (Eritrea)</span>).  Also, the judicial review procedure is less well-adapted to deciding disputed issues of primary fact or expert evidence: indeed the types of issue raised by a case of this kind would be peculiarly suitable for the employment of a version of the “country guidance” procedure of the Upper Tribunal.  To the extent that the Respondent enjoys a discretion whether to certify a claim of the present kind, I would urge her to consider very carefully whether that is always the best course, at least if a challenge is practically inevitable by one route or another.  However, I appreciate that the scope for the exercise of any discretion is constrained by the way in which the applicable provisions are drafted: by paragraph 5 (4) of Schedule 3 to the 2004 Act she is positively obliged to certify the claim <span style="color:#000000">unless “satisfied that [it] is not clearly unfounded”.</span></p>

At the end of my thematic visit concerning Syrian refugees last December I urged EU member states to refrain from using the “Dublin Regulation” for returning Syrian refugees to other European countries whose asylum systems are already overstretched or highly dysfunctional, in particular Bulgaria, Greece, Italy and Malta. Bulgaria was caught unprepared for the influx, and its staffing levels and reception conditions are woefully inadequate. Shortly after my visit, UNHCR came to a similar conclusion about ‘Dublin returns’ to Bulgaria. I was glad to learn that on 5 February the Danish authorities announced their decision to suspend the return of asylum seekers to Bulgaria.”</p>

The full text, not exhibited to Ms Leo's statement, gives a very different view. In context, the document sets out recommendations for implementing the recast Directives. It notes that, despite major improvements, problems remain in relation to reception and integration. The first sentence of the paragraph containing the quotations relied upon by Ms Leo, but not cited by her says: ‘Experience in recent years has demonstrated the importance of moving beyond CARAs as reception centres’.

Ms Leo says in her appeal statement that the difference between the phrases “do away with” and “move beyond” simply reflect two different translators’ (i.e. those employed by the Secretary of State to translate the Note and those employed by Wilsons to translate her statement) translation of the same Italian word (</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">superamento</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">).  She was not intending to use any different language from UNHCR.  As to the addition of the word “absolute”, she says that that was done in her own text rather than in the passage which she quoted, and it will accordingly have been quite apparent that it represented her own emphasis.   She says that it is a legitimate emphasis.  She points out that in any event in a later passage the English version of the Note recommends “abandoning the CARA model”, which seems pretty “absolute”.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">I do not agree with most of the Judge’s criticism of this part of Ms Leo’s report.  Even without the benefit of her explanation about the different translations I do not believe that there is, in this context, a substantial difference between “do away with” and “move on from”: the substance is that UNHCR was recommending that the Italian authorities abandon the CARA model because of the deficiencies to which it refers.  I do not believe that that point required to be qualified by reference to other parts of the Note, which deal with other matters; and if, as seems to be implied, the Judge was intending to criticise Ms Leo for not exhibiting the full Note, which was a public document fully identified by her in a footnote, I cannot agree.  I am not clear whether the Judge meant to say that Ms Leo did not quote the sentence beginning “Experience in recent years”; but if he did he was simply wrong, perhaps being misled by the different translations.  The one point on which I can agree to some extent is that the use of the word “absolute”, even if it can be justified as accurate, may tend to suggest a degree of advocacy rather than strict impartiality; but it is no more than a small straw in the wind.  </span>

But that is not the same as saying, as the Judge appears to do in his introductory sentence (though it may not be quite what he meant), that Ms Leo’s evidence was not based on research at all.  On the contrary, there is no reason to doubt her statement that it was based on the three-month ASGI study: the problem is that she gives us no details.  The Judge was also, with respect, wrong to describe the Milan research as “unspecified” and (which is the clear implication of his putting “a few years ago” in quotes) undated.  The published report is identified in a footnote, with its date (2010).

It contains a statement about the absence of any reception facilities for returning BIPs equivalent to that in Ms Leo’s first report, but so far as I can see it gives no further details about the nature or the research or the data relied on.</span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.57in">“Similarly, Ms Leo refers … to a Ministry circular dated 19 March 2014 and gives a quote saying that all the centres of government and those backed by some local authorities are saturated. Ms Leo then says there is a waiting list and, based on ‘reports by some operators’, there is a waiting list of around 2-3 months. The identities, roles and numbers of such operators are unspecified. No properly sourced data giving an up to date picture of the position or demonstrating that there is such a waiting list is provided.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:-0.50in">(16)<marker name="tab"/>My view about that criticism is similar to my view about the third.  The Judge is right to point out that the reference to the length of the waiting list – presumably waiting list<span style="text-decoration:underline">s</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span>– is unsatisfactory both because it is not specifically sourced and because it is very general.    But a criticism that Ms Leo’s report is inadequately particularised is not the same as a criticism that it is not based on research at all – which would be a much more serious matter.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:-0.50in">(17)<marker name="tab"/>In her appeal statement Ms Leo says that if she had been asked to particularise the sources for her statement about waiting lists she would have explained that she had interviewed twelve SPRAR operators as part of her research for the ASGI project (and forty by the time that the research was finalised) and that what she said about waiting-lists was based on what they told her.  But of course that information was not before the Judge.  Nor does she say how many of the twelve (or the forty) operators reported waiting lists of two or three months: her report referred only to “some”.</p>
