The redacted paragraphs are based on information derived by our intelligence services from the intelligence services of the USA. The Foreign Secretary was unable to persuade the Divisional Court that their publication would constitute a danger to the national interest and public safety in this country of such magnitude that it overwhelmed any other considerations.  The appeal was advanced by Mr Jonathan Sumption QC on the basis that the Divisional Court’s decision was in many respects “unnecessary and profoundly damaging to the interests of this country”, and indeed that part of the reasoning of the Divisional Court was “irresponsible”.</span>

The question for us is whether this appeal should be allowed.  No advantage is achieved by bandying deprecatory epithets.  Nevertheless at the very outset I shall record that even a cursory examination of the history of this litigation demonstrates the painstaking care with which the Divisional Court addressed the public interest arguments advanced by the Foreign Secretary. The approach of the Divisional Court to the questions requiring its decision represented an exemplary model of judicial patience.  Even if at the end of the argument I had disagreed with the Divisional Court there can be no doubt that its judicial responsibilities were discharged with scrupulous regard to the many difficult questions to which the litigation gave rise and with a clear understanding of the potential significance of an order that the redacted paragraphs should be published.  </span>

In the subsequent judgments the redaction question was reconsidered more than once in the light of ongoing developments and unanticipated problems. Anyone seeking a close understanding of the detailed facts as well as the issues which arose for decision should examine the open judgments in chronological order.   </span>

An incident in an aeroplane flying to the USA over this Christmas period demonstrates its ever present nature.  In this country some terrorist plots have succeeded, with catastrophic results.  They have succeeded abroad, with similar catastrophic results.  Other plots have failed.  And thanks to reliable intelligence and meticulous investigation, yet other plots have been identified and foiled before they could come to fruition.  It is difficult to exaggerate the value of good intelligence and its contribution to the safety and wellbeing of the nation.  Just as terrorism is international, so the process of intelligence gathering needs to be international.  Intelligence comes from many sources, some at home, some abroad.  Co-operation between the intelligence services of friendly nations is a critical element in the battle against the terrorist and without mutual inter-dependence based on trust, the risks would be almost irremediably heightened.</span>

He reminded us that the relationship had, for many years, been “highly productive”.  There is no reason to minimise the inestimable contribution made to public safety by the longstanding co-operation between the intelligence services of this country and those of the USA.  It is a relationship between allies, and the provision of valuable assistance is not one-way traffic.</span>

If the redacted paragraphs are published the USA will “review” the workings of the present intelligence sharing arrangements.  Quite apart from any formal “review”, publication may also serve to stultify many of the less formal arrangements which currently work to the advantage of the battle against terrorism.   Accordingly the control principle must be upheld in its full rigour. On the findings of the Divisional Court, this opinion is formed and held by the Foreign Secretary in good faith. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">To put these contentions into immediate perspective, it is not suggested that there is anything in the redacted paragraphs themselves which would involve a breach of security, or disclose what may be summarised as intelligence material, such as names, or places, or means of communication, the disclosure of which would, of itself damage the national interest. Moreover it is no secret – and indeed it has been an unbroken theme of the Foreign Secretary’s position – that there is a close intelligence sharing arrangement between the UK and the USA.  If the redacted paragraphs do not themselves contain secret or intelligence material, and the intelligence sharing arrangements between the UK and the USA are publicly declared, one may enquire why the redaction is necessary.  In essence it comes to this: unless the control principle prevails, the intelligence sharing arrangements between the USA and the UK will be reviewed, and following the review may, not will, become less “productive” to presumably, the disadvantage of both countries, although I shall assume to the much greater disadvantage of the UK.  The Foreign Secretary believes that such consequences will inevitably follow any contravention of the control principle, whatever the circumstances in which or the reasons for the court’s decision that it should be disapplied. The difficulty therefore arises from the control principle itself, and its application in troubled times.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Information about terrorist plots is needed in sufficient time to expose them before they come to murderous fruition. The urgency notwithstanding, the use of torture – and any of the euphemisms which describe it – to obtain information from those believed to be in possession of useful information about terrorist plots is outlawed.  The prohibition against torture has two facets.  First, it is condemned, in effect on the grounds of common humanity, perhaps best illustrated in the principles which underpin the Geneva Conventions and provide protection against the ill-treatment of prisoners of war.  One of the problems with those detained with Mr Mohamed in Guantanamo Bay is that they were originally described as “enemy combatants” who were not prisoners of war and whose treatment was therefore not governed by the Geneva Conventions.  Second, in any event, the fruits of torture cannot provide incriminating evidence against the defendant.  The United Nations Convention against Torture or other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment requires that the administration of justice shall “ensure that any statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made”.  In short, it cannot be used as incriminating evidence against the person who has been subjected to torture.</span>

The issue is one of constitutional principle, whether evidence obtained torturing another human being may lawfully be admitted against a party to proceedings in a British court irrespective of where, or by whom, or on whose authority the torture was inflicted.  To that question I would give a very clear negative answer…the principles of the common law, standing alone, in my opinion compel the exclusion of third party torture evidence as unreliable, unfair, offensive to ordinary standards of humanity and decency and incompatible with the principles which should animate a tribunal seeking to administer justice.  But the principles of the common law do not stand alone.

Mr Mohamed will be deprived of the full reasons which led the court to conclude that, notwithstanding the initial rejection of his claim of involvement in wrongdoing by UK authorities, it was not merely sustainable, but amply vindicated, whereas the Foreign Secretary, whose initial stance was to deny that there was any basis or justification for Mr Mohamed’s claim, will have access to all of the court’s reasoning. This facility will extend to the UK intelligence services, notwithstanding that the redacted paragraphs are directly relevant to the adverse findings against them.  As already recorded, the Divisional Court acquitted the Foreign Secretary of any element of bad faith or improper manipulation of the process.  However the stark fact remains that if the redacted paragraphs are not revealed to Mr Mohamed, the parties to this litigation will not be treated equally. Although this may be a necessary consequence of the application of the wider public interest, as a matter of principle, and for obvious reasons, this is always undesirable, not least because it almost inevitably and unsurprisingly leads to a sense of grievance in the mind of the party subjected to this disadvantage.  In this particular case, the problem is aggravated by the reality that the claim for continued redaction is advanced by the Foreign Secretary who has ultimate responsibility for the SIS whose conduct is successfully impugned by Mr Mohamed</span>

He no longer needs the material which was in the possession of the UK authorities to achieve his acquittal.  It can indeed be safely assumed that proceedings based on the confessions while he was held incommunicado at the behest of the USA authorities will never again be contemplated.  It therefore follows that later events made disclosure of the redacted paragraphs “unnecessary” and “gratuitous” in the limited sense that  Mr Mohamed is no longer at risk of prosecution on a capital charge.  Putting it shortly, he has won.  That however is not the whole story.  At the time when the redacted paragraphs (excluding the redacted paragraph from the sixth judgment which was based on the redacted seven sub-paragraphs themselves) were intended to be included in the open judgment, Mr Mohamed was still held in Guantanamo Bay, at risk of a capital charge, and the redacted paragraphs formed an essential part of the court’s reasoning that he was entitled to the relief he was seeking. </span>

If and when it becomes necessary to address the material relevant in those proceedings through the discovery process, the problem will have to be addressed.  The fact that civil proceedings have been taken by Mr Mohamed does not, of itself, advance the argument for the open publication of the redacted paragraphs.

From time to time judges of the highest distinction have identified the reasons which underpin this principle, naturally enough, in the overall context of the possible application of the principle to the individual case.  For present purposes I derive the following principles from the authorities.</span>

The public must be able to enter any court to see that justice is being done in that court, by a tribunal conscientiously doing its best to do justice according to law. For that reason, every judge sitting in judgment is on trial. So it should be, and any exceptions to the principle must be closely limited.  In reality very few citizens can scrutinise the judicial process: that scrutiny is performed by the media, whether newspapers or television, acting on behalf of the body of citizens.  Without the commitment of an independent media the operation of the principle of open justice would be irremediably diminished.  </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">There is however a distinct aspect of the principle which goes beyond proper scrutiny of the processes of the courts and the judiciary.  The principle has a wider resonance, which reflects the distinctive contribution made by the open administration of justice to what President Roosevelt described in 1941 as the “…first freedom, freedom of speech and expression”. In litigation, particularly litigation between the executive and any of its manifestations and the citizen, the principle of open justice represents an element of democratic accountability, and the vigorous manifestation of the principle of freedom of expression. Ultimately it supports the rule of law itself.  Where the court is satisfied that the executive has misconducted itself, or acted so as to facilitate misconduct by others, all these strands, democratic accountability, freedom of expression, and the rule of law are closely engaged.  </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Expressed in this way, the principle of open justice encompasses the entitlement of the media to impart and the public to receive information in accordance with article 10 of the European Convention of Human Rights. Each element of the media must be free to decide for itself what to report. One element would report those matters which reflect its distinctive social or political stance, and a different section of the media will report on different matters, reflecting a different, distinctive position.  This may very well happen with this judgment,  reflecting the diversity of the media, and symbolising its independence. In short, the public interest may support continuing redaction, or it may not.  If it does not, each element of the media will decide for itself what, if anything, to publish.  In the context of two further features of the evidence I should add that the investigative role of the media exists independently of the principle of open justice, and that the right of the media to enlist the assistance of legislation like the Freedom of Information Act to acquire access to information is similarly distinct.  Neither diminishes the principle of open justice.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Although expressed in wide and general terms – and perhaps inevitably so expressed – in my judgment the principles of freedom of expression, democratic accountability and the rule of law are integral to the principle of open justice and they are beyond question.  They do not enable the media to require parties to litigation to continue it if they do not wish to do so in order for the media to have a better story, or permit the media to study material which has been made subject to non-disclosure on well established PII principles, or to report proceedings where, in the interests of justice, by operation of law, such reporting is prohibited. It is, of course, elementary that the courts do not function in order to provide the media with copy, or to provide ammunition for the media, or for that matter private individuals, to berate the government or the opposition of the day, or for that matter to berate or laud anyone else.  They function to enable justice to be done between parties.  However where litigation has taken place and judgment given, any disapplication of the principle of open justice must be rigidly contained, and even within the small number of permissible exceptions, it should be rare indeed for the court to order that any part of the reasoning in the judgment which has led it to its conclusion should be redacted.  As a matter of principle it is an order to be made only in extreme circumstances.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">The effective combating of international terrorism involves mutual co-operation and intelligence sharing.  There is no obligation on the intelligence services of any country to share intelligence with those of any other country.  The relationships cannot be considered in contractual or commercial terms.  The process is entirely voluntary. The arrangements are not permanent, and they are not set in stone. Either country can end the relationship, or alter it, and certainly review it at any time, for good reason, or for none.    Although in the modern world national safety is almost inevitably linked with the defeat of terrorism and international crime whenever and wherever they may arise, the first responsibility of any intelligence service is the safety of the country it serves.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">At the risk of repetition, in general terms, it is integral to intelligence sharing arrangements that intelligence material provided by one country to another remains confidential to the country which provides it and that it will never be disclosed, directly or indirectly, by the receiving country, without the permission of the provider of the information. This understanding is rigidly applied to the relationship between the UK and USA. However although confidentiality is essential to the working arrangements between allied intelligence services, the description of it as a “control principle” suggests an element of constitutionality which is lacking.  In this jurisdiction the control principle is not a principle of law: it is an apt and no doubt convenient description of the understanding on which intelligence is shared confidentially between the USA services and those in this country, and indeed between both countries and any other allies.  If for any reason the court is required to address the question whether the control principle, as understood by the intelligence services, should be disapplied, the decision depends on well understood PII principles. As the executive, not the judiciary, is responsible for national security and public protection and safety from terrorist activity,   the judiciary defers to it on these issues, unless it is acting unlawfully, or in the context of litigation, the court concludes that the claim by the executive for public interest immunity is not justified.  Self evidently that is not a decision to be taken lightly.  </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">The Foreign Secretary’s first PII certificate referred to the uncertainty which would be introduced into the working relationship between this country and the USA if disclosure were ordered.  The second PII certificate stated in terms that “disclosure of US intelligence information by order of our Courts would breach the trust and the fundamental requirement for confidentiality that lies at the heart of the UK’s liaison relationship with the US intelligence agencies…it is not simply confidentiality and the secrecy of intelligence material that is an issue, however, but also the issue of the control that one government has over the intelligence information that it shares with another government in the expectation of confidentiality…Breaching this principle will have significant implications that run far more broadly than this case”.  The third PII certificate, acknowledging that the UK courts had power “in principle to disclose information provided by a foreign liaison service or derive from such information without the consent of the provider (and even against its expressed will)”, concluded that the exercise of the power would be “extraordinary”.  That was close to the Foreign Secretary’s assertion in the meeting with Secretary of State Clinton on 12 May that “the British Government would continue to make the case that it continued to be an inviolable principle of intelligence co-operation that we did not give away other people’s secrets”.  An “inviolable” principle does not appear to acknowledge or permit of any exceptions.  Expressed in this way the control principle assumes a level of primacy which diminishes the responsibility of the court as the ultimate decision maker virtually to extinction. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">It is nevertheless accepted by and on behalf of the Foreign Secretary in this litigation that in our country, which is governed by the rule of law, upheld by an independent judiciary, the confidentiality principle is indeed subject to the clear limitation that the government and the intelligence services can never provide the country which provides intelligence with an unconditional guarantee that the confidentiality principle will never be set aside if the courts conclude that the interests of justice make it necessary and appropriate to do so. The acknowledgement that the control principle is qualified in this way is plainly correct, and it appears to be accepted that the same limitation on the control principle would apply in the USA. Presumably therefore our intelligence services accept that although the control principle applies to any information which they disclose to their colleagues in the USA, the ultimate decision on disclosure would depend on the courts in the USA, and not the intelligence services, or for that matter the executive.  Although the Foreign Secretary accepts that the principle is not absolute, he contends that, having made his own examination of the overall interests of justice, the control principle should be upheld.  On the basis of all the evidence including the Sensitive Schedules, I have been unable to eradicate the impression that we are being invited to accept that once the Foreign Secretary has made his judgment of all the relevant considerations, including the interests of justice, and notwithstanding that in law the control principle is not absolute, so far as the court is concerned, as a matter of practical reality, that should be that. However although in the context of public safety it is axiomatic that his views are entitled to the utmost respect, they cannot command the unquestioning acquiescence of the court. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Nothing in this judgment should be seen as devaluing the confidentiality principle, and the understanding on which intelligence information is shared between this country and the USA.  It is clearly established that the publication of the redacted paragraphs will result in a review of these sharing arrangements.  The review might or might not produce a change. There is a clear risk, and the Foreign Secretary believes, that any such review would culminate in new, and from the point of view of national security, disadvantageous arrangements.  However that risk would be the inevitable concomitant of any occasion when the court decided to reject the claim to preserve confidentiality on public interest immunity grounds.   </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">The enormous concentration on the redacted paragraphs may have led us to overlook that this litigation has endorsed the application of public interest immunity and the maintenance of confidentiality over secret information.  The Divisional Court has in effect upheld and applied PII principles to a vast body of material.  Set against the redacted paragraphs over which the argument has ranged for something like 18 months there is, it must be remembered, a very lengthy closed judgment, not the subject of any further litigation, produced by the Divisional Court when the first open judgment was handed down.  It is clear that the crucial importance of the confidentiality principle was recognised by the Divisional Court and in overwhelmingly large measure applied by it.  This litigation therefore demonstrates that the courts in the UK treat the confidentiality principle with the importance it requires, and have endorsed it in this litigation.    </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">I therefore repeat that (and unless the redacted paragraphs are published, what follows depends on my assertion) publication of the redacted paragraphs would not reveal information which would be of interest to a terrorist or criminal or provide any potential material of value to a terrorist or a criminal.  The redacted paragraphs do not, for example, identify methods of surveillance currently unknown to potential terrorists, or reveal the methods employed by the security and intelligence services to penetrate terrorist groups.  Indeed it seems right to emphasis that the publication of the redacted paragraphs would not and could not, of itself, do the slightest damage to the public interest.  Equally, again by way of repetition, it is public knowledge, and clear from the open judgments and the submissions made on behalf of the Foreign Secretary, that there is and for many years has been an intelligence sharing relationship between the UK and the USA.  No one can doubt it.  Certainly, no on can conceal it.  Moreover a close analysis of the redacted paragraphs in the context of all the open judgments would demonstrate that in reality they do not contain anything which cannot be read or inferred from the existing open judgments.  For example, paragraph 87(iv) of the first open judgment is itself revealing about the detention of Mr Mohamed and the involvement of our intelligence services with him.  It records that the “details of the reports” are set out in the redacted paragraphs.  It is also clear from the open judgments that these reports were received by the intelligence services while Mr Mohamed was detained in Pakistan, when he was being interviewed by US authorities.</span>

Presumably, too, the review would take into account the potential disadvantages to the battle against terrorism and the security of both countries if the intelligence sharing arrangements were reduced, and address the relationships between allies in a common cause, and with a common understanding of the possibility that it remained open to a court, whether in the UK or the USA, to refuse the PII application.</span>

We are no longer dealing with the allegations of torture and ill-treatment: they have been established in the judgment of the court, publicly revealed by the judicial processes within the USA itself.  And this serves to highlight that the redacted paragraphs represent part of the Divisional Court’s reasoning, directed not to wrongdoing by the USA authorities but involvement in that wrongdoing by our own intelligence services, and the successful argument by Mr Mohamed that he was entitled to the relief he had sought against the Foreign Secretary.  In the context of intelligence sharing arrangements, the decision to disclose evidence critical of the USA authorities by a court in the USA does not reflect identical considerations to its possible disclosure by a court in the UK. Nevertheless, there is at least one common theme. The former represents the proper working of the judicial processes in the USA, and although the latter would constitute a breach of the confidentiality arrangements, the breach would be consequent on the proper working of the judicial processes in this country.</span>

That, however, is a consequence of his vindication through the operation of the litigation process and the prolonged delay consequent on the apparently endless arguments about the possible publication of the redacted paragraphs.  The successful party is no less entitled to know the reasons for the court’s judgment than the unsuccessful parties.  I have already noted the strange consequence that if the redaction is maintained, Mr Mohamed will know less about the reasons for the court’s decision than the intelligence services which, even if innocently, were involved in or facilitated the wrongdoing of which he was the victim.  There is a clear interest in Mr Mohamed knowing, and the community at large also knowing, not only that his allegations were vindicated, but also the full reasons (even if not the entirety of the evidence) which led the court to its conclusion.  The redacted paragraphs are integral to the reasoning that Mr Mohamed’s entitlement to relief fell within the ambit of executive involvement in wrongdoing.</span>

However dealing with this appeal as a matter of practical reality rather than abstract legal theory, unless the control principle is to be treated as if it were absolute, it is hard to conceive of a clearer case for its disapplication than a judgment in which its application would partially conceal the full reasons why the court concluded that those for whom the executive in this country is ultimately responsible were involved in or facilitated wrongdoing in the context of the abhorrent practice of torture.  Such a case engages concepts of democratic accountability and, ultimately, the rule of law itself.</span>

However, the specific issue between the parties below seems to me to have been within a very narrow compass indeed, not least because the essence of the content of the redacted paragraphs, set out in the appendix at the end of these judgments, could have been gleaned from available open material, and was in any event already in the public domain.

He was at that time detained in Guantanamo Bay, and required the documents in order to assist in his defence against charges which he anticipated would be brought against him by the US Government. Those charges, which were essentially based on the allegation that he was involved in terrorist activities, were formally raised on 28th May, and, if established, they could have carried the death penalty. The charges were based, at least in part, on confessions which Mr Mohamed was alleged to have made. He denied any involvement in terrorism and claimed that his confessions were false, having been made to US interrogators as a result of his being subjected to torture, or at least inhuman treatment, and that the documents would help him establish this.</span>

During that period, he said that he had been interrogated by US officials, beaten, threatened with a gun, fed only every other day, suspended by his wrists, and given limited access to the lavatory, by the Pakistani authorities, and threatened by US officials with worse treatment elsewhere. As the court went on to say in paragraph 35, Mr Mohamed’s evidence was that, in July 2002, he was sent by way of so-called extraordinary rendition by the US authorities to Morocco, where he was interrogated further by US officials, and was beaten, subjected to sleep deprivation and cut on his private parts with a scalpel. In paragraphs 36 to 40, the court recorded that, in January 2004, he was transferred by the US authorities to Afghanistan, first to the “Prison of Darkness” in Kabul, where he was again interrogated by US agents, and “deprived of sleep, starved, and then beaten and hung up”, and thence to Bagram in May 2004, where he said he was tortured and subjected to “cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment”.

Those ten subparagraphs, which are set out in paragraph 32 of the judgment of Lord Judge LCJ, reveal, in very summary terms, that Mr Mohamed was detained in Pakistan and interviewed by the US authorities, who gave  the SyS particulars of his detention and treatment in reports “details of [which] are set out in [the redacted paragraphs]”, and that SyS personnel had read the contents before one of them (known as “witness B”) went to Karachi to interview Mr Mohamed, that witness B told Mr Mohamed that the UK would not assist him unless he cooperated with the US authorities, and that the SyS were supplying information about, and questions for, Mr Mohamed to the US authorities “from the time of his arrest whilst he was held incommunicado and without access to a lawyer or review by a court or tribunal” both while he was detained in Pakistan and after he had been removed to “a covert location” (i.e. in Morocco).  In particular, in paragraph 87(iv), the court said that: “[i]n May 2002, the SyS and the SIS received reports containing information relating to [Mr Mohamed's] detention and treatment in Pakistan.

On those three points, as on the first two points, the court found in favour of Mr Mohamed. The court did not however grant the relief which he sought. As the court explained in paragraph 149 of the first judgment, it did “not propose to make an order until the Foreign Secretary has had the opportunity to consider whether in all the circumstances he will invoke public interest immunity in respect of the disclosure of the information which would otherwise follow from [the] decision”, and if such a certificate was issued, there would have to be further argument. </span>

Accordingly, pursuant to an order which had been made by Sullivan J on 20th June 2008, the hearing of the application was partly held in closed session, Mr Mohamed was represented by “special advocates” in connection with the closed material, and the draft judgment of the court was first shown to SyS officials to enable the Foreign Secretary to argue that certain passages should not be included in the open version of the judgment. In accordance with this arrangement, the first judgment, when handed down in public on 21st August 2008, was edited by the removal of the redacted paragraphs (and two or three small consequential redactions), over Mr Mohamed’s objections. </span>

The inhibition which this would place on the sharing of information would in my judgment be profound. We would have the same concerns. There is also a risk of wider repercussions to the international relations of the UK more generally and to liaison relationships with third parties.” He also said, in paragraph 15, that, “on the balance of public interest”, he “may well have been inclined” to supply Mr Mohamed’s lawyers with the documentation he sought, if “the US authorities [had not] made the commitments to make the documents in question available” to Mr Mohamed’s US lawyers, given the court’s conclusion on the first judgment “that it [was] essential to [Mr Mohamed’s] defence to any charges that may be brought against him that he has access to [such] material”.  </span>

It is quite clear that the [US] considers it paramount that it is able to retain control of its intelligence information and, where disclosure is required, to handle this within its own adjudicatory system and subject to its own protective measures. We would have exactly the same concerns. Breaching this principle would have significant implications that run far more broadly than this case.” In paragraph 48, he added that the “disclosure would be perceived by the [US] to be gratuitous as it would not secure any additional benefit for [Mr Mohamed].”</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Accordingly, in paragraph 54 of the fourth judgment, the court had little difficulty in concluding that: “it is our clear view that the requirements of open justice, the rule of law and democratic accountability demonstrate the very considerable public interest in making the redacted paragraphs public, particularly given the constitutional importance of the prohibition against torture and its historic link from the seventeenth century in this jurisdiction to the necessity of open justice”. The court also considered that Mr Mohamed was “entitled to have the evidence relating to [the] injustice and wrongdoing [of which he had been the victim] made public” – paragraph 59. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">The court then turned to “[t]he public interest in keeping the information out of the public domain: national security and international relations”. In paragraph 62, the court summarised the effect of the Foreign Secretary’s view in the first and second certificates as making it “clear that the [US] Government's position is that, if the redacted paragraphs are made public, then the [US] Government will re-evaluate its intelligence sharing relationship with the [UK] with the real risk that it would reduce the intelligence provided. It was and remains (so far as we are aware) the judgement of the Foreign Secretary that the [US] Government might carry that threat out and this would seriously prejudice the national security of the [UK]”.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">The court found it “difficult to understand how objection can properly be made” by any foreign government to the release of the information in the redacted paragraphs. This was because, at least on the face of it, “the reports summarised in the redacted paragraphs gave rise to an arguable case of  cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and torture”, and it would not appear to affect the ability of any country’s intelligence service to gather information or to disseminate it to other intelligence services (paragraph 71).</span>

It is a fundamental part of that trust and confidentiality which lies at the heart of the relationship with foreign intelligence agencies.” The court then made the point in paragraph 76 that there was evidence supporting the Foreign Secretary's views “that the [US] Government would perceive making public the redacted passages as ‘gratuitous’”, and “that the threat is real, and serious damage to national security may result”. The court also considered the argument that the position had changed with the election of President Obama, as his attitude to inhuman treatment differed markedly from that of his predecessor, President Bush. The argument was rejected in paragraph 77 on the basis of the Foreign Secretary’s written submission referred to above.</span>

On 23rd February 2009, Mr Mohamed was released from Guantanamo Bay and arrived back in the UK. On 16th April 2009, President Obama announced that the US Department of Justice would release memoranda prepared by its officials under the previous administration, between 2002 and 2005, dealing with interrogation techniques which had been cleared for use by US Government employees and agents, and which were now accepted as being illegal. Those memoranda set out details of the treatment meted out to detainees by the US Central Intelligence Agency (“CIA”). One memorandum related to an alleged high-ranking member of Al-Qaida, Abu Zubaydah, and specified ten techniques which were said to be permissible: in summary terms, these were attention grasp, walling, facial hold, facial slap, cramped confinement, wall standing, stress positions, sleep deprivation, insects in a confinement box, and waterboarding.</span>

The reason for this was given essentially in paragraphs 33 and 34 of a judgment handed down on 16th October 2009 (“the fifth judgment”), [2009] EWHC 2549 (Admin); [2009] I WLR 2653. The court said that, when coming to its conclusion in the fourth judgment, it had understood from what had been written on behalf of the Foreign Secretary “that the position was unchanged in that the Obama Administration was maintaining the same position as that of President Bush, not only as to the principle of control over intelligence but also in relation to the specific statement that it would reconsider the intelligence sharing arrangements, if we made the redacted paragraphs public”. However, the court said, “all the Foreign Secretary could properly have stated to the court (because he had no basis for saying any more) was that he did not expect there would be any change in the position of the Obama Administration in relation to the general principle of control over intelligence, namely that information obtained as a result of intelligence sharing is not to be made public without the consent of the State of origin. He should have informed the court that he did not know what the position of the Obama Administration was as to the specific consequences of publication.”</span>

In his declaration, Mr Halperin explained that he had been “exposed to the intelligence relationship between the [US] and the [UK] at the highest levels”, most recently between 1998 and 2001, as director of Policy Planning Staff at the Department of State. He described the intelligence relationship between the two countries as “unprecedented in its interdependence and depth” and “staked on mutual trust and commitment to open dialogue and communication” for more than 60 years. He emphasised the benefits to the US, as well as the UK, of this relationship. He pointed out that both governments “have always understood that the commitment to keep secret what was provided by the other could not be an absolute commitment”, and referred to requests made under Freedom of Information legislation, the fact that both governments understand that “some information may reach the press and the public by leaks” and the fact  that they “also understand that courts in both countries have the right to order the disclosure of information under constitutional or statutory procedures.” He said that “while the US government would expect the UK government to resist disclosure of classified information in this proceeding”, “a respect for the rule of law would prevent the US government from taking umbrage at a reasoned decision by a UK court finding that public interest demands disclosure of information regarding [Mr Mohamed]”. He also referred to cases where US courts had ordered disclosure of “classified information obtained from foreign sources”.</span>

The court said that the communication to the SyS of the treatment Mr Mohamed was suffering at the hands of US officials was relevant “as witness B disputed what he knew about the treatment of Mr Mohamed.” The court also made the point that “the suppression of wrongdoing by officials which cannot in any way affect national security is inimical to the rule of law.” Thirdly, in paragraph 73(ii), the court made the point that the case was “exceptional”.</span>

Fifthly, in paragraph 74, the court said that publishing the redacted paragraphs would put no sensitive information into the public domain; in a passage which the Foreign Secretary now accepts can be in the open version of the fifth judgment, the court also said that publication of the redacted paragraphs “would … put into the public domain matters relating to interrogation techniques that have been widely discussed and made public by the [US]”. Sixthly, the court said that the debate stimulated by the Presidential statement and release of documents in April 2009 made the public interest in publication of the redacted paragraphs even greater than at the time of the fourth judgment – paragraph 76. The court, in paragraph 77, therefore reaffirmed the view reached in the fourth judgment that, subject to the Foreign Secretary’s concerns expressed in the certificates, it would be in the public interest to publish the redacted paragraphs.</span>

It was therefore, said the court, “impossible to believe that he would take action against the [UK], the [US’s] closest ally, when the release of similar information is required to uphold the rule of law in the [UK]”. Accordingly, at least in the absence of any other evidence, the court concluded in paragraph 82 that it was “difficult on an objective basis to see any grounds for rejecting the submission … that there is any evidence of any real risk of serious harm to the national security of the [UK]”. </span>

The court then said (in the course of a discussion which is fully set out in paragraph 256 of the judgment of Sir Anthony May PQBD) that “the statements of both the Foreign Secretary and Secretary of State Clinton proceeded on the erroneous basis that the principle of control of intelligence was inviolable”, that the notes of the discussion were directed to the 42 documents, and therefore “the statement made by Secretary of State Clinton that intelligence sharing would be affected was made without a proper analysis or understanding of what the [redacted] paragraphs contain” – paragraph 96.</span>

The court accordingly concluded in paragraph 108 that “as the public interest in making the paragraphs public is overwhelming, and the risk to national security is not a serious one”, it should “restore the redacted paragraphs to [the] first judgment”.</span>

Accordingly, the fifth judgment was handed down with those four paragraphs partly redacted, on the basis that there would be a subsequent hearing on that issue, as well as on the issue of whether the Foreign Secretary should have permission to appeal against the fifth judgment.

The court then repeated in paragraph 13(ii) its view that there was “nothing secret or of an intelligence nature in the redacted paragraphs”, and that, “[o]f itself, the treatment to which [Mr Mohamed] was subjected could never properly be described in a democracy as ‘a secret’ or an ‘intelligence secret’ or ‘a summary of classified intelligence’.” </span>

In the Treasury Solicitor’s letter, the contents of Judge Kessler’s Opinion are said to have no effect on the views of the Foreign Secretary or on the arguments that have been advanced on his behalf. Mr Mohamed’s solicitors, on the other hand, submitted in their letter that Judge Kessler’s descriptions of his mistreatment while “being held at the behest” of the US, mistreatment which she characterised in terms as “torture”, must dispose of any suggestion that there could be “operational sensitivity” (an expression used in oral argument on behalf of the Foreign Secretary) in the contents of the redacted paragraphs, and that, even if it would have been possible before seeing Judge Kessler’s Opinion, it is now impossible to believe that the US Government would take objection to the publication of the redacted paragraphs. Mr Mohamed’s solicitors also say that, now that a US court has publicised the mistreatment, indeed torture, which he suffered at the behest of the US, “the principal effect of allowing this appeal would simply be to suppress findings detailing the degree of knowledge of [Mr Mohamed]’s mistreatment which the UK authorities had at the time in question, when they decided actively to participate in his interrogation.”  </span>

The court has to decide whether to adopt or to override that view. This assessment potentially involves two steps. The first is to determine whether the publication of the redacted paragraphs would be against the national interest; the second step (which may not arise if the threat to the national interest would not exist or would be very significant) is to weigh that aspect of public interest against the public interest in the first judgment being fully open. </span>

The reason he gives for this opinion is, in summary terms, that the redacted paragraphs self-evidently reveal information supplied by the intelligence services of the US to the SyS on a confidential basis, and, if they are released into the public domain, the future supply of information from the intelligence services of the US and of other countries to the SyS will be reviewed, and may consequently be constricted to the potential detriment of the security of this country. </span>

All parties are agreed, correctly in my view, that the issue must be assessed as at the date of the decision, so we must consider matters as at today, which inevitably involves a reconsideration of the issue. Further, in the fifth judgment, the Divisional Court said, and was I suspect influenced by its view, that, at the time it gave the fourth judgment, it had been misled by the Foreign Secretary, unintentionally albeit wrongly, as to the attitude of the Obama administration’s attitude to the disclosure of the redacted paragraphs.

The effect of that Opinion is that, in proceedings in which one of the parties was the US Government, a US Judge has found as a fact in an open judgment that Mr Mohamed’s evidence as to the mistreatment he suffered at the behest of US officials in Pakistan (and indeed in Morocco and Afghanistan) was true. It is therefore now in the public domain, as a fact found by a US court in proceedings in which the US Government was a party, that he was mistreated, indeed tortured, in the ways in which he has described, when under US control and interrogation, and that representatives of the US intelligence services knew of the mistreatment and must have observed the effect of such mistreatment of him. Whatever may have been the position before the Opinion was published, details of Mr Mohamed’s mistreatment, and their effect on him, as have been publicly recorded by Judge Kessler, and cannot be said any longer to be in any way confidential information, or information which is somehow in the control of the US Government. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">In the light of that, it appears to me that the whole basis for the Foreign Secretary’s case for redaction of the redacted paragraphs, as advanced in the three certificates, and supported by the recorded views of the CIA, the White House, and the Secretary of State, and by the submissions to the Divisional Court and this court, has fallen away. In these circumstances, I am of the view that there is simply no longer any basis for the Foreign Secretary maintaining the case for excision of the redacted paragraphs. As Sir Anthony May PQBD vividly puts it in paragraph 295 of his judgment, as a result of Judge Kessler’s Opinion, the Foreign Secretary’s case is now based on “a principle entirely devoid of factual content on which to hang it”. It is true that he still maintains that case, but it is a case which is now no longer consistent with the evidence relied on, or with the arguments pursued by, the Foreign Secretary; indeed, it seems to me to be logically insupportable and therefore irrational. Accordingly, a court of law should not accede to it. It follows that the balancing exercise need not be carried out: the Foreign Secretary’s case falls at the first hurdle, as this is one of those very rare cases where the court cannot accept a minister’s view (which is now expressed in a letter from his lawyers) that national security would be at risk if the material in issue were published against the wishes of the US. The reason for that unusual conclusion is that the material concerned has now been published by the US, and the Foreign Secretary’s views, as expressed in the certificates, and the representations from the US on which it was based, were expressed before that publication, and that publication undermines the basis of those views and representations. </span>

The first stage involves considering the issue as it was at the time of the fifth judgment, and before Judge Kessler’s Opinion had become publicly available. The second stage involves considering the issue in the light of that Opinion. I could go straight to the second stage, as the question whether the redacted paragraphs should be redacted must be determined as at the date of determination. However, I prefer to consider the issue as it was at the time of the fifth judgment as that raises a dispute of importance which has been fully argued, and it informs the present situation.</span>

The second step is to consider the arguments in favour of publishing the redacted paragraphs. The third step involves striking a balance between the two competing sets of arguments. The second stage, which requires Judge Kessler’s Opinion to be taken into account, is rather simpler.</span>

I mention the length of the certificates because it helps to demonstrate the degree of detail in the reasoning they contain, and the care with which they appear to have been prepared. It is, however, fair to acknowledge that each certificate contains quite a lot of background material and a fair amount of repetition, no doubt at least in part for reasons of emphasis, but that does not seriously detract from the fact that they are detailed and closely reasoned. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">First, the ultimate question was not so much what, on a fair reading by a court of law, the CIA letter meant; it was whether there was a risk, and, if so, how great a risk, of the US intelligence agencies reducing the flow of information to the SyS. While I agree that that assessment must take into account the terms of the CIA letter, it ultimately involves a judgment as to the likely attitude and actions of the CIA. I come back, therefore, to the point that, at least on the face of it, the Foreign Secretary, with the benefit of his Foreign Office and SyS and SIS advisers, is better able to assess that risk than a judge. Accordingly, the court would normally expect to give great weight to the views expressed in the third certificate, unless, of course, there are very solid reasons for doubting it.</span>

The CIA letter stated that publication of the redacted paragraphs “could reasonably be expected to cause serious damage to the [UK]’s national security”, that it “may result in a constriction in the US-UK relationship” and “could likely result in serious damage to UK and US national security”, and that it would mean that the US “will necessarily have to review with the greatest care the sensitivity of information [the US] can provide in the future.” In paragraph 15(ii) of the fifth judgment, the court said that the conclusion it reached in the fourth judgment was based on the understanding that “The Bush Administration … was making clear that, if the court ordered disclosure, specific consequences would follow, namely the reconsideration of the intelligence sharing relationship”, which seems to me to amount to much the same as what was said in the CIA letter.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">[1985] AC 191, 201D). I can well understand why the court was astute to enquire whether the letter, when properly analysed, actually did support the notion that there would be a real risk to national security if the redacted paragraphs were published. However, the fact that the letter contained no guarantee of any reduction in intelligence sharing in that event is nothing to the point. The fourth judgment did not proceed on that basis. Furthermore, the language of the two earlier certificates, like that of the third certificate, and even that of the more belligerently expressed email from Mr Matthias, was that of possible, rather than certain, disadvantages. It is also fair to say that a communication such as the CIA letter, sent by an arm of a foreign country’s government with a view to being shown to, and influencing, an English court, could be expected to be moderately and diplomatically expressed. Any sensible person in the position of the writer of that letter would have been well advised to avoid saying anything which could be regarded as a threat or ultimatum to the court. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Fourthly, when focussing on the CIA letter, the court concentrated on the US intelligence services, effectively disregarding other sources of intelligence, although the letter, like the certificates, refers to information shared not only by the intelligence services of the US, but also to those of other countries.  The basis for the sanguine view expressed by the court in paragraph 107 of the fifth judgment as to the likely reaction of the US to the publication of the redacted paragraphs does not apply to such other countries, about which far less information is available. I infer from what was said in the certificates and the CIA letter that the publication of the redacted paragraphs could impact adversely on (i) the information supplied by such other countries directly to the UK, (ii) the information supplied by such other countries to the US, and hence to the UK, and (iii) the terms on which information is supplied by such other countries to the US, thereby preventing the US supplying it on to the UK. It may well be, of course, that no aspect of this three-pronged risk would eventuate, but that very fact highlights the difficulties involved in any judicial attempt to “second guess” the Foreign Secretary’s assessment of the risk in this case. That, of course, brings one back to the certificates, and in particular the third certificate, with its plainly expressed opinion about the risk of “considerable damage to our national security”, based on the breach of the control principle which would be involved by the publication of the redacted paragraphs.</span>

The court’s expressed rationale in the fifth judgment for going back on the conclusion which it had reached in the fourth judgment was its belief that the Obama administration would not adopt the same view as the Bush administration. Yet, the note of the meeting of 12th May 2009 reveals that, after being told that that was what the Divisional Court believed, President Obama’s Secretary of State, who is described as having been “clearly well aware of the case and the associated issues”, is recorded as saying in terms “that the US position had not changed”. </span>

While it is conceivable that the Secretary of State was under a misapprehension, it is hard to find satisfactory grounds for reaching such a conclusion, which, if correct, would also presumably apply to Mr Bradley, who spoke at the meeting for the White House. Further, it appears to me that the court may have overlooked the point that the concern was not about the contents of the redacted paragraphs, it was more a point of principle: as put on behalf of the Foreign Secretary in argument, the redacted paragraphs, while “not themselves intelligence material”, are “unquestionably a summary of intelligence material” provided to the UK “under confidential intelligence-sharing arrangements” (as the court effectively accepted in paragraph 73 of the fifth judgment), and “do not cease to be so because the US has itself chosen to disclose other related material on a related subject.”</span>

In my view, given that the Secretary of State herself, and Mr Bradley, who spoke on behalf of the White House, expressed views at the May 2009 meeting, it is appropriate to assume that the essence of the view expressed at that meeting and the essence of the view contained in the CIA letter are basically the same, or at least very similar. That assumption obviously could be rebutted by the words recorded at the meeting and contained the letter, but, in my view, on a fair reading, they are consistent with each other. There may be a difference of emphasis, but that is wholly unsurprising, but, equally unsurprisingly, the message is to the same effect, and it is reflected in the third certificate. </span>

I do not think that that was an appropriate view to take. As the court itself pointed out, in the first certificate, the Foreign Secretary made it clear that he may well have been prepared to order the release of the 42 documents to Mr Mohamed’s US lawyers, if the threatened charges were brought and the US authorities did not supply them with the documents. However, that point is blunted by the fact that it would have been a very limited publication. More importantly, it does not seem to me realistic to think that either the Foreign Secretary or the Secretary of State can conceivably have believed that there was an absolute rule that shared intelligence could never, in any circumstances, be revealed without the consent of the State which supplied it. As stated in Mr Mohamed’s submissions on this appeal, “the US Government is well aware that independent courts can and will in appropriate cases disclose foreign intelligence material where it is in the public interest … to do so”, and this is demonstrated by a number of cases in the US and other courts. In other words, the court’s view, that the Secretary of State and the Foreign Secretary misunderstood the control principle, is wrong; I believe that the view was based on an over-literalistic interpretation of what the Foreign Secretary said in one or two places in the certificates and what the Secretary of State is recorded as saying on 12th March 2009. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Mr Halperin’s declaration was described by the court as “unchallenged”. But his evidence was answered, albeit in general terms, by the observation in paragraph 24 of the third certificate that, in his reference to the US “taking umbrage”, he had missed the point. The Foreign Secretary’s concern was and is that, although the US would appreciate that the courts in the UK might order the publication of intelligence material provided by the US to the SyS, that does not mean that, if it occurred, it would have no effect on the provision of intelligence material. As Mr Halperin also said, the US would appreciate that there might be unauthorised leaks from personnel in the SyS to the press; however, that obviously does not mean that, if such leaks occurred, it would have no effect on the US’s approach to the supply of information to the SyS. No doubt, if one small leak occurred and its source was identified and shut down, that would be unlikely to have much effect, whereas a series of significant untraced leaks could well have a very serious effect. In the same way, the argument here is that, while an isolated and plainly justifiable disclosure made by the court or the Government (as was contemplated by the Foreign Secretary in paragraph 15 of the first certificate) may well be acceptable to the US Government, what they see as a “gratuitous” disclosure by the court might be taken as an indication that the UK courts set little store by the control principle, which could well cause the US Government to reconsider what information they provide to the SyS. Further, Mr Halperin’s evidence does not touch on intelligence supplied to, or through, the US by other Governments.</span>

On the one hand, at the start of that paragraph, the court said that “[t]here must be some risk …that the Obama Administration would reduce intelligence sharing with the United Kingdom”. On the other hand, at the end of the paragraph, the court said that it “cannot accept looking at the matter objectively on all the evidence … and as a matter of reality, that there is a real risk that the United States would reassess its intelligence relationship or reduce its intelligence sharing”.

The statements in these documents have considerable force, particularly bearing in mind their respective sources, at least if the statements are taken at face value. The certificates are very full, and it is unusual for the court to be provided with supportive documentation for a certificate.  All these documents indicate, at least on the face of it, that, if the redacted paragraphs are  published, there is a risk that the flow of confidential information to the SyS from the intelligence services of the US and of other countries could be reduced, and that this in turn could lead to a reduction in national security. This is no more than a possibility, and therefore may well not happen, but the assessment of the Foreign Secretary, who, at least on the face of it, is much better able to judge such matters than the courts, is that it could well come about. It would require unusual facts before a court could reject such an assessment (especially where the </span>

In paragraph 74 of the fifth judgment and paragraph 13(i) of the sixth judgment, it is made clear that the redacted paragraphs record details of treatment similar to the treatment of detainees described in the US Department of Justice memoranda published on 16th April 2009, and that the treatment was arguably “torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment”. </span>

Accordingly, as was accepted by the Divisional Court and on behalf of Mr Mohamed before us, the control principle would be infringed by the publication of the redacted paragraphs. Accordingly, the Foreign Secretary says, irrespective of the contents of the information communicated, any breach of the control principle could lead to a reduction in the flow of intelligence information to the UK. </span>

As already mentioned, the documents would not thereby have been made public. Furthermore, it can fairly be said that the fact that the Foreign Secretary might have been prepared to override the control principle if Mr Mohamed’s life was at stake shows that he is prepared at least to consider overriding it in appropriate circumstances, which, in turn, can be said to lend some support to the notion that he has grounds for the views expressed in the second and third certificates. </span>

Together with other passages – which do not seem to me to be in point – the passages were referred to in a letter from Mr Mohamed’s solicitors to the Treasury Solicitor and are to be found in paragraphs 10, 12, 29(ii), 29(v)(a), 30(i), 87(iii), and 87(iv) of the first judgment.

If that is right, it is very hard to understand either what difference Mr Mohamed’s circumstances would have made, or why a number of express references in the first judgment to the contents of communications from US intelligence sources to the SyS about Mr Mohamed were thought to be acceptable by the SyS, and subsequently by the US intelligence services. The explanation proffered by the Foreign Secretary is based on the contents of the communications, but that is hard to reconcile with his concession that the actual contents of the redacted paragraphs are of themselves inherently innocuous.</span>

His case is that the UK’s interests would be indirectly affected because the US Government (and other Governments) would object to the breach of the control principle, and this might result in a reduction in the supply of information. It seems to me just about comprehensible that the US Government might not object to the release of generalised information relating to Mr Mohamed, of no security value or which is already in the public domain, supplied to the SyS, while objecting to somewhat more specific information, even if it too has no security value, supplied to the SyS, if it is not clearly in the public domain, as it can still be seen to be “intelligence material”. It is a very narrow point, but the only direct evidence of his mistreatment is Mr Mohamed’s own evidence, and I can see how it can be said that that cannot be regarded as conclusive proof.</span>

Yet, in this case, that does not seem to have been true: as the evidence showed, some Security Services officials appear to have a dubious record relating to actual involvement, and frankness about any such involvement, with the mistreatment of Mr Mohamed when he was held at the behest of US officials. I have in mind in particular witness B, but the evidence in this case suggests that it is likely that there were others. The good faith of the Foreign Secretary is not in question, but he prepared the certificates partly, possibly largely, on the basis of information and advice provided by Security Services personnel. Regrettably, but inevitably, this must raise the question whether any statement in the certificates on an issue concerning the mistreatment of Mr Mohamed can be relied on, especially when the issue is whether contemporaneous communications to the Security Services about such mistreatment should be revealed publicly. Not only is there some reason for distrusting such a statement, given that it is based on Security Services’ advice and information, because of previous, albeit general, assurances in 2005, but also the Security Services have an interest in the suppression of such information.</p>

The normal reasons for deferring to his views on such an issue are diluted by the fact that there is nothing inherently sensitive in the information in those paragraphs, the very narrow and technical nature of the breach, the fact that the US must have appreciated the risk of intelligence material being disclosed pursuant to the law, the fact that other material apparently subject to the control principle has been revealed in the first judgement without objection, </span>and a concern which arises from the apparent involvement of at least one Security Services agent in the mistreatment of Mr Mohamed<span style="color:#000000">.

First, it would have been an indication that the UK courts are prepared to breach the control principle not merely to protect its citizens, but in circumstances which those Governments would, or at least might, regard as gratuitous; secondly, embarrassment or sensitivity because the redacted paragraphs reveal communications about mistreatment of detainees by officials of the US (and other countries). The fact that I may think that there is no force in the first reason, that I may disapprove of the second reason, and that I may not consider either reason ought even to begin to justify any reconsideration of the sharing of intelligence with the UK, are not in point. When considering whether there is a threat to national security, at least where the threat is based on a logically coherent argument, it is the reality, not the morality, that matters - a point made in </span>

Bearing in mind that the UK and the US are each the other’s strongest intelligence partner, that the relationship goes back over 60 years, that the UK Government has done its best to have the redacted paragraphs redacted, that there is no sensitive information in the redacted paragraphs, it is hard to believe that the US intelligence services would really reduce the supply of information. In other words, Mr Halperin’s opinion seems to me to be much more likely to be correct.  But although the ultimate decision is for the courts, any judge must accord very substantial weight to the Foreign Secretary’s view as to the existence and extent of such a risk.</span>

Particularly as officials of some of those countries must have been involved in the mistreatment of detainees, it is easier to believe that the publication of the redacted paragraphs could impinge either directly, or indirectly through the US, on the supply of information to the UK from those countries. Indeed, it is not difficult to deduce from the evidence that the most likely threat to the flow of information from the US may well, in fact, be in relation to information which had originally been provided to the US by other Governments, which may be supplied to the US on terms that it is not supplied to the UK.  I am far from saying that this is a likely possibility, not least because the US courts seem to be just as robust as the UK courts about requiring information about mistreatment of detainees to be put into the public domain. The adverse reaction of other Governments is thus no more than a possibility which can fairly be deduced from the evidence, and it is a possibility about which I must confess to real scepticism. However, this brings me back to the point that it is very difficult, indeed impossible, for a judge to assess the likelihood of such a risk eventuating.</span>

I have summarised those grounds very briefly in paragraphs 85 and 86 above. On behalf of the Foreign Secretary, three initial points were made as to why there was no justification in publishing the redacted paragraphs. First, that the redacted paragraphs were unnecessary to the court’s reasoning as a matter of law; secondly, that any issue in the substantive proceedings was academic as Mr Mohamed was now in this country and not facing any charges, so that releasing the redacted paragraphs would be “gratuitous”; thirdly, that the court should not operate as a sort of general guardian of the public interest: its role is to decide issues as between the parties to the litigation.</span>

This principle is so important not merely because it helps to ensure that judges do not, and do not appear to, abuse their positions, but also because it enables information to become available to the public. What goes on in the courts, like what goes on in Parliament or in local authority meetings or in public inquiries, is inherently of legitimate interest, indeed of real importance, to the public. Of course, many cases, debates, and discussions in those forums are of little general significance or interest, but it is not for the judges or lawyers to pick and choose between what is and what is not of general interest or importance (save where, as in the present instance, it is a factor to be placed in the balance, in a case where it is said that it is in the public interest to have the hearing in private or to redact material from a judgment). </span>

In particular, they were unnecessary for the purpose of establishing Mr Mohamed’s entitlement to the relief he sought as a matter of principle: he did not have to establish knowledge of, or involvement in, his mistreatment, on the part of UK Government officials. To that extent, they were not “necessary”, but the fact remains that the redacted paragraphs were part of the court’s reasoning, and litigants should not be entitled to challenge the appropriateness of the court including a statement in a judgment simply on the ground that it is not a strictly necessary ingredient of the reasoning. Quite apart from this, the findings in the redacted paragraphs  were, as I see it, at least potentially relevant  when the court came to the question of whether to exercise its discretion in favour of Mr Mohamed, once he had established a right in principle to the relief he was seeking.</span>

However, like any other litigant, he is entitled to know what findings the court made in a case in which he was a party. That point is particularly strong in the case of a litigant who credibly claims in proceedings are against the UK Government to have been seriously mistreated, and where the court’s findings concern the UK Government’s knowledge and participation in his mistreatment. An additional factor which is relied on is that Mr Mohamed has issued proceedings for damages against the UK Government and the SyS, who, in their Defence, do not admit his allegations of their contemporary knowledge of his mistreatment by the US authorities. I am disinclined to give that factor much, if any, weight. Even without the redacted paragraphs, the first judgment contains findings that the UK Government, and the SyS in particular, had contemporary knowledge of, and facilitated, Mr Mohamed’s mistreatment; anyway, there would be nothing to prevent Mr Mohamed seeking disclosure in those other proceedings of the documents on which the redacted paragraphs were based, if he needs them. </span>

However, one should not be too purist about that. It has long been the case that the court has responsibilities wider than its duties to the parties – obvious examples include a duty to protect witnesses (e.g. from bullying cross-examination or from self-incrimination), a duty to ensure the criminal law is enforced (e.g. sending papers to the Director of Public Prosecutions, or, indeed, to professional disciplinary bodies in some cases), a power to hand down judgment if in the public interest even where parties have settled and do not want the judgment published (as in </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">The Human Rights Act 1998 has enlarged the court’s role for present purposes. The courts have always been a branch of government (in the wider sense of that expression), and, as such, they now have a duty to comply with the Convention. As the Divisional Court said, article 10 carries with it a right to know, which means that the courts, like any public body, have a concomitant obligation to make information available. Of course, the obligation is not unqualified or absolute, nor does it involve the court arrogating to itself some sort of roving commission. But, where the publication at issue concerns the contents of a judgment of the court, it seems to me that article 10 is plainly engaged: the public’s right to know is a very important feature. And that is not merely a point of principle. The court made findings as to what UK Government officials were told about serious and sustained mistreatment (conceivably amounting to torture) by a foreign government of someone resident in the UK, in circumstances where the court has also found such officials to have been  involved in the mistreatment, when the UK Government had denied any such knowledge. In those circumstances, it seems to me little short of absurd to say that the court cannot take into account the public importance of, and the obviously justified public interest in, such findings, when deciding whether it is, on balance, in the public interest in publishing those findings. Indeed, in the light of the reasons and judicial observations contained in paragraphs 44 to 53 of the fourth judgment, the importance of putting into the public domain the facts relating to what the UK Government was told by the US Government about the wrongful treatment of detainees is clear. </span>

That is, indeed, a well-established principle, but it is concerned with private confidences, not with claims for immunity from publication on the ground of public interest. The principle in a private law claim that the confidentiality of a communication between two persons should be maintained can be at least normally, defeated where there is a public interest in exposing a fraud or other crime is readily understandable and defensible. But in no way can it follow that the public interest in the confidentiality of a communication being maintained should be outweighed by the public interest in exposing a crime or other wrongdoing: the obviously correct course is to weigh the public interests against each other. </span>

Where the judgment is concerned with such a fundamental and topical an issue as the mistreatment of detainees, and where it reveals involvement– or worse – on the part of the UK Government in the mistreatment of a UK resident, there can be no doubt that the public interest is at the very top end of importance.

More broadly, even without the redacted paragraphs, all the essential facts and findings are present in the first judgment (as stated in paragraphs 5 to 47, and discussed in paragraphs 74 to 91, of the first judgment, and as summarised very briefly in paragraphs 66 to 70 above). In particular, the first judgment mentioned Mr Mohamed’s effectively unchallenged evidence as to the nature of his mistreatment by officials of the US and other countries, details of the knowledge, involvement, and assistance in that mistreatment by SyS officials, and the fact that there were written communications about Mr Mohamed and his treatment by US officials to the SyS. Further, as the court made clear, it is those communications which are referred to in the redacted paragraphs, and they reveal material which was already in the public domain. </span>

In my view, in their otherwise carefully reasoned assessment of the risk to national security, the Divisional Court in its fifth judgment gave insufficient weight to the views of the Foreign Secretary, took too dismissive a view of the CIA letter and the notes of the meetings with the US Secretary of State, did not really address the attitude of Governments other than the US, and overestimated the public interest in having the redacted paragraphs published.</span>

However important the issues of principle in this case, and however important the facts revealed in the first judgment, the argument in favour of publication must centre on the subject-matter of the dispute, namely the redacted paragraphs, and, once one analyses their contents, the argument for publication ultimately rests on the principle of open justice and the particular public importance of the first judgment.</span>

However, one must be careful of giving effect to such high general principle, however fundamental, when it has little significant practical content (because almost all the judgment is open, and redacted parts adds little, if anything, of substance), and could conceivably lead to a real risk to national security.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">It is perhaps right to emphasise that I am not suggesting that the argument in favour of redaction should succeed because it is based on some high general principle; far from it. The argument in favour of redaction is clearly, almost brutally, practical: it is purely based on the stark fact that publication of the redacted paragraphs could conceivably result in harm to the UK’s national security, as  a result of it being seen by the US and other Governments to infringe the control principle for no good reason. The fact that the risk of harm results from the concern of the US and other Governments about the control principle, as opposed to the practical consequences of publication, (as well as possibly resulting from a sense of embarrassment, and, conceivably from other concerns) does not mean that my ultimate conclusion is based on that principle, other than indirectly.  </span>

(By contrast, in the Divisional Court, such a finding was unnecessary and was not made in the first, or any subsequent, judgment.) Accordingly, now the Opinion has been published, details of Mr Mohamed’s mistreatment have become established publicly available facts, rather than merely being matters as to which Mr Mohamed had given evidence, as was the basis on which the court proceeded in the fourth, fifth, and sixth judgments. Further, the source of the publication of the facts is a Judge of the US courts, the very country which, according to the Foreign Secretary’s case, should be “able to retain control of [what is in the present case the alleged] intelligence information and, where disclosure is required, to handle this within its own adjudicatory system.” </span>

The notion that information passed by the US intelligence services to the SyS remains intelligence material, even after that information has been placed in the public domain and stated to be factually accurate by a US court in proceedings to which the US Government was a party, seems to me to be inconsistent with the Foreign Secretary’s case as it has been so far advanced, as well as being inconsistent with common sense, and with the concepts of intelligence material, control and confidentiality. </span>

In any event, there is, after all, nothing to “control”, if the information is in the public domain. The case advanced by and on behalf of the Foreign Secretary was consistently based on the proposition that the material revealed in the redacted paragraphs had been supplied by the US and was not in the public domain, in that it was “intelligence material” or “intelligence information”, and should therefore not be placed into the public domain, other than by or with the consent of the US.</span>

The Foreign Secretary also said in the second certificate that “[i]t is not simply confidentiality and the secrecy of intelligence material that is in issue …, but also the issue of the control that one government has over [its] intelligence material”.

Paragraph 20 of the third certificate referred to “any Court order[ing] disclosure of the classified information in issue into the public domain”, and paragraph 24 referred to the “practice within intelligence communities that information passed on intelligence channels cannot be publicly disclosed without the consent of the State disclosing it”. However, the information in the redacted paragraphs has been disclosed “by the State disclosing it”. The CIA letter also said that the material contained in the redacted paragraphs “do not cease to be so because the US has itself chosen to disclose other related material on a related subject”, but now the US has disclosed the material itself by a US Judge stating in public what that material is and that it is true.</span>

On 12th May 2009, the Secretary of State said she was “opposed to the public disclosure of US intelligence information in this case”.

According to that letter, such passages were regarded as acceptable if they were “innocuous” or “reveal[ed] nothing of significance”. Once details of Mr Mohamed’s mistreatment, whether communicated by US intelligence services or not, have been identified and found to have occurred in an open judgment given by a US Judge, those details must similarly be “innocuous” and not “significant”. </span>

There is no certificate from the Foreign Secretary, and no evidence from the US CIA, the White House or the Secretary of State, to support the contention that, once the information contained in the redacted paragraphs was openly held to be factually correct by a US court, the control principle would be infringed, or the flow of information from any source to the SyS would be threatened, if the redacted paragraphs were included in the open version of the first judgment. All that has happened is that the Foreign Secretary has reiterated his case in a letter from the Treasury Solicitor. Further, it appears to me that it is simply unrealistic to think that any Government, US or otherwise, would object or take exception, on the ground that it represented the unauthorised publication of US intelligence information, to the publication of facts in an English judgment when those facts have already been published in a US judgment. </span>

Consideration of this closed material in no way caused me to doubt or reconsider the conclusion I have reached on the basis of the open material. The closed material spells out in a little more detail the Foreign Secretary’s concerns about the attitude of the US Government and intelligence services if the redacted paragraphs are published, and it expands substantially, if pretty generally, on the risk of other Governments and intelligence services reducing the information they provide to the SyS, either directly, or through the US intelligence services, if the redacted paragraphs are published in breach of the control principle. </span>

As I have indicated, the issue being considered in the fourth and fifth judgment was hard to resolve, and I entirely agree with Lord Judge LCJ’s remarks in paragraphs 6 and 51 of his judgment in this connection. I should add that, if a minister thinks it appropriate to attack a judicial decision in robust terms (or indeed at all), then the right place to do so is, as was done in this case, in an appellate court, rather than out of court. The Foreign Secretary’s case on redaction before the Divisional Court was, to put it mildly, not assisted by the remarkably drip-fed way in which the evidence was presented, and I do not think that the arguments advanced below were entirely the same as those addressed to us. </span>

In July 2008, there was correspondence with Mr Mohamed’s lawyers considering whether the material whose disclosure was claimed would be disclosed by the US prosecuting authority in those proceedings.  There was very considerable urgency upon the Divisional Court to conclude its hearing and decide Mr Mohamed’s claim for disclosure, because his lawyers regarded it as essential that, if the </span>

The Divisional Court concluded that disclosure was necessary to Mr Mohamed’s defence, not least because there was scant other independent evidence to support his account of how he had been mistreated.  As to procedures in the United States, the evidence before the Divisional Court was unsatisfactory and incomplete.  But there were a number of features of the process which made it clear that the process might not produce the information or documents at all, and it certainly was unlikely to produce them within a proper time.  The Court concluded that the Foreign Secretary should now provide the information to Mr Mohamed’s lawyers.  They gave extended reasons for this conclusion in paragraph 126 of their first open judgment.  The court then decided that 42 documents and information about and specific to Mr Mohamed’s treatment and rendition, and information concerning the SyS visit to interview him in Pakistan on 17</span>

This was not least in the light of the Special Advocate’s contention that there could be no public interest immunity for information pointing to the commission of serious criminal offences.  The court considered the consequences to Mr Mohamed, who might face the death penalty if the information was not provided; the UK Government’s knowledge as established by the evidence; the importance of the state prohibition on torture and cruel inhuman and degrading treatment; and general issues such as intrusion, time and cost.

	      <span style="color:#000000"> June 2008, Sullivan J had made a case management order in the proceedings, which included provision for the lodging of closed evidence and a closed annex to any public interest immunity certificate.  An annex to this order provided for the functions of the Special Advocate, and for successive public and private hearings with closed material to be referred to only in the course of a private hearing.  The annex further provided that before the court were to serve an open judgment on the claimant and interested party, it must first serve a copy on the defendant and the Special Advocate.  The defendant had permission to show the open judgment to the SyS and SIS, so that the defendant might apply to the court to amend the judgment, if he considered that it contained information which would be contrary to the public interest to disclose.  There was further provision for the special advocate to apply to the court to amend open and closed judgments on the ground that the closed judgment contained material, the disclosure of which would not be contrary to the public interest.  The annex provided for the Special Advocate and the defendant to make representations on these matters.  These procedures in effect enabled one party to the litigation to seek to edit the court’s judgments on public interest grounds and to attempt to redraw at the margins any division the court may have decided to make between its open and closed judgments.  Although the procedure is no doubt important and necessary in public interest cases which concern national security, it has given rise to unfortunate consequences in the present proceedings.  Attempts to edit or resist the editing of the court’s judgment – on one view an intrinsically undesirable process – have taken on lives of their own quite distinct from the real original issues in the case.</span>

The documents would be produced within the Military Commission’s process at the normal discovery phase of the process.  The Foreign Secretary’s public interest immunity certificate concluded that the public interest dictated that disclosure should take place in accordance with US processes and not by UK court order.  The certificate in essence accepted the Divisional Court’s judgment that the material should be made available to Mr Mohamed’s US counsel.

Later disclosure to Mr Mohamed’s US lawyers if the case were referred was said to curtail their ability to make effective submissions to the Convening Authority.  This was the only respect in which the assurances of the US Government fell short of the requirements of Mr Mohamed’s US defence team.  Whether this was a legitimate requirement was a part of the eventual public interest immunity balance.  It was submitted by the Special Advocate that the first public interest immunity certificate failed to address the abhorrence and condemnation accorded to torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.  The Foreign Secretary accepted that this was relevant material.  The Foreign Secretary and his legal adviser, Mr Bethlehem QC, had gone to considerable lengths to help Mr Mohamed.  Justice required that the court should allow the Foreign Secretary time to furnish a further certificate dealing with these matters.

A breach of the control principle would have much wider implications than the facts currently under consideration.  The Foreign Secretary concluded that the balance of public interest lay heavily in favour of disclosure of the documents and the information in the redacted paragraphs through the US system in a manner consistent with the assurances provided by the US Government, and against disclosure by order of the UK court.

The issue was a novel one, which required balancing the public interest in national security with the public interest in open justice, the rule of law and democratic accountability.  The question was whether the information should be withheld permanently.  There were problems generally concerning the increase in the number of hearings in private and closed judgments.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> [1995] AC 274, except that the Special Advocate submitted that public interest immunity could not be invoked to prevent disclosure of serious criminal misconduct by UK officials.  Paragraph 26 of the fourth open judgment sets out a detailed summary of the submission that there is an absolute bar to the claim for public interest immunity in this case.  The redacted paragraphs should be made public.  To do otherwise would be to conceal the gist of the evidence of serious wrongdoing by the US which had been facilitated in part by the UK Government.  The Divisional Court considered that, powerfully and cogently though the submissions were made, there was no such absolute bar.  The court’s reasons are in paragraphs 28 to 33 of their fourth open judgment.  These included that the Special Advocate’s submissions were not supported by authority, and that it must be open to find a way to compel the Executive to act in accordance with the rule of law or to punish its officers for wrongdoing or to hold the Executive democratically accountable, without endangering the wider interests of the state as a whole where those interests may be damaged by disclosure.  The Special Advocate’s submissions, however, had great force in support of the contention that, in balancing the various interests, the balance should come down firmly in favour of making the redacted paragraphs public.</span>

It was accepted both as a matter of common law and of obligation under Articles 6 and 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights that courts must do justice in public unless it can be shown that justice could not otherwise be done or there are other good reasons for privacy.  In addition to the public nature of hearings, there is also a principle that decisions and reasons must be made public.  Under the rubric “Public justice, the rule of law, free speech and democratic accountability” the Divisional Court emphasised that it must be and is the duty of a judge in upholding the rule of law to ensure both that a particular dispute between parties is decided openly, but also that matters that come to the attention of the court which appear to constitute an infringement of the rule of law are dealt with openly.  The court accepted the submission that the media has a vital role in communicating what takes place in court and the decision of the court.  Having considered at length the importance of publishing the redacted paragraphs, the court expressed the clear view that the requirements of open justice, the rule of law and democratic accountability demonstrated the very considerable public interest in making the redacted paragraphs public.

No agent or facility or secret means of intelligence gathering would be revealed.  There was nothing in the paragraphs which could possibly be described as highly sensitive classified US intelligence.  A democracy governed by the rule of law would not expect another democracy to suppress a summary of evidence in reports by its own officials where the evidence was relevant to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.  The court had no reason at the time to anticipate that there would be a threat of the gravity of the kind made by the US Government that it would reconsider its intelligence sharing relationship.  Subsequent matters had lent support to that view.  It would therefore have remained the court’s view, absent the evidence adduced by the Foreign Secretary as to the position taken by the US Government, that there was every reason to put the paragraphs into the public domain.  The suppression of reports of wrongdoing by officials in circumstances which cannot in anyway affect national security would be inimical to the rule of law and the proper functioning of a democracy.</span>

If the value of information is properly to be assessed by the United Kingdom intelligence services, it is also essential the intelligence services know the circumstances and means by which it was obtained.  There is powerful evidence that intelligence is shared on the basis of a reciprocal understanding that the confidence in and control over it will always be retained by the State that provides it.  It is a fundamental part of that trust and confidentiality which lies at the heart of the relationship with foreign intelligence agencies.  This is particularly the case in relation to the United States where shared intelligence has been developed over 60 years.  Without a clear understanding that such confidence will not be breached, intelligence from the United States and other foreign governments so important to national security might not be provided.  The public of the United Kingdom would be put at risk.

Such statements can only have applied to the 42 documents that contained intelligence and not the 7 paragraphs.  Although the further note sent to Mr Bethlehem QC to clarify the principal note stated that the same considerations applied to the 7 paragraphs, it is difficult to understand how that issue can have been properly discussed or analysed by those present at the meeting.

Since then the Divisional Court has been engaged in arduous and prolonged satellite litigation, resulting in numerous hearings and four substantial judgments, concerning the quite short issue whether the court should agree to censor seven short subparagraphs of a judgment which it now considers it ought to publish uncensored.  The requested censorship arises out of a court ordered procedure which enables the Intelligence Services, through the Foreign Secretary, to comb through a draft open judgment before it is published to request redactions which they consider to be required for national security reasons.  Some procedure of this kind may well be necessary, although it is intrinsically unlikely that a judge will inadvertently put seriously sensitive material into a judgment intended to be open.  This is not to diminish the importance of some of the principles at issue in this appeal; only to emphasise the unsatisfactory procedural consequences in this case and to suggest that what appears to be becoming an entrenched procedure may need re-examination.</span>

The first principle is that justice should be open, and that open justice generally requires the court to publish its reasons for a decision.  There may be exceptions to this principle – see the passage from Lord Diplock’s opinion in </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">Attorney General v The Leveller Magazine</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> quoted in paragraph 230 above – but it seems to me that the grounds for making an exception need to be compelling, where the court considers that material considered for redaction is both necessary for the exposition of its reasons and of no relevant intrinsic national security significance.  The second principle is that material should not generally be published, if its publication would give rise to a serious risk of damaging consequences to national security; and that the court should not substitute any view of its own of the existence or seriousness of such a risk for that of the Foreign Secretary (in this instance), unless it is persuaded that there is no proper basis for that view.  In the present case, the Divisional Court took the bold step of rejecting, by a process of close analysis, the position of the Obama Administration as expressed by Secretary of State Clinton when, on one view, that expressed position did sufficiently sustain the Foreign Secretary’s assessment in his third public interest immunity certificate.  I read the Divisional Court’s fifth open judgment as implicitly accepting that, if the US Secretary of State’s recorded statement that “public disclosure in this case would affect intelligence sharing and would cause damage to the national security of both the US and the UK” were to be taken at face value, the court should adhere to the consequence of the balance which they struck in their fourth open judgment.  I note that the substance of the statement as recorded in the third public interest immunity certificate appears in the fourth paragraph of the Note of the meeting of 12</span>

The court does not have to justify what it has included as part of its reasons.  It is sufficient that the court itself regarded the subparagraphs as necessary.  Losing parties are often unhappy with the terms in which judgments against them may be expressed.  They cannot be entitled to pare down adverse judgments by seeking to exclude unwelcome material on the basis that its inclusion is unnecessary to the decision against them.

The Divisional Court regarded these subparagraphs as an integral and necessary part of their reasons for their provisional decision.  The procedure adopted - not, so far as I am aware, objected to at the time - was to promulgate the first open judgment before general public interest immunity matters had been addressed.  In theory at least, public interest immunity considerations might have persuaded the court not to order the production of the 42 documents at all.  The matter of the seven subparagraphs was ancillary.  The possibility of their exclusion was catered for by Sullivan J’s procedure.  It is no part of a litigant’s general privilege to seek to chip away evidence-based parts of a judgment delivered in draft on the ground that they are not necessary to the decision, when the court delivering the judgment considers that they are necessary, and when they may, for instance, be relevant to an appeal against the decision itself.  Ms Rose’s submissions are, in my view, persuasive.  I would therefore reject the first ground of appeal.  I accept that it is of some (but not much) relevance to the general public interest immunity issue that the original proceedings have become academic, and that the reasons for the provisional decision in the first open judgment no longer require scrutiny for the purpose of any outstanding decision.</span>

The Divisional Court reached two opposite conclusions in its fourth and fifth open judgments respectively.  The difference turns on their perception that the US position as to disclosure had changed with the advent of the Obama Administration.  Certainly President Obama made changes of policy relating to Guantanamo Bay, interrogation techniques and the continued detention of Mr Mohamed in particular.  But the US position relating to the control principle has not changed, nor has its insistence that court ordered disclosure of the seven subparagraphs would risk causing serious damage to the national security of both the US and the UK.  US Secretary of State Clinton said as much and there was no proper basis for the Divisional Court to conclude that she did not understand what she was talking about.

It was a question both of the control principle and of practical consequences if disclosure were ordered.  The Divisional Court missed the point in their consideration whether court ordered disclosure was an exception to the control principle or an accepted part of it.  The real question was what the practical consequences would be.  The US are not obliged to pass on to the UK intelligence material which they acquire or receive, and disclosure may in fact result in the US withholding or having to withhold information.  Whether they would be right to do so is irrelevant.  What matters is the US assessment of the risk.</span>

The Divisional Court said that the US Secretary of State did not understand that the control principle was subject to court ordered disclosure, nor that, whereas the 42 documents contained intelligence, the seven subparagraphs did not.  The important point was that they contained information deriving from intelligence which is covered by the control principle.  There was no point in the Divisional Court saying that this was not intelligence, when the US Secretary of State considered that it was.  Although the Divisional Court wrongly concluded that Secretary of State Clinton did not know what she was talking about, they also found that there was no lack of good faith in the Foreign Secretary relying on her statement.  If the Foreign Secretary was entitled to take what she said at face value, that should itself be a proper basis for the Foreign Secretary’s public interest immunity conclusion.</span>

Immediately the fourth open judgment was published, the Foreign Secretary had said publicly that there was no threat, and it appeared that there had been no contact with the Obama Administration.  The court has misunderstood the position when it gave its fourth open judgment.  It became of great importance for the court to have clear, unambiguous evidence.  What “would” happen then appeared to shift to what “could” happen.

To my reading, the redacted letter contains no unqualified statement that the flow of intelligence would be reduced by the US, but there is a statement to the effect that “foreign partners” could take steps to withhold from the United Kingdom sensitive information that could be important to its safety and security.  I note that, if the question includes what steps foreign partners might take, any distinction between “could” and “would” becomes distinctly blurred.  Ms Rose accepted that the CIA letter on its own might be enough to sustain the Foreign Secretary’s public interest immunity judgment.  But it had to be taken in the light of the history both of the radical changes made by the Obama Administration and the manner in which the Foreign Secretary’s eventual position was reached.  In particular the Obama Administration has never been prepared to repeat in clear terms the threat made on behalf of the Bush Administration.

This derives from a procedure ordered by the court to take care that national security is not put at risk by inadvertent inclusion in an open judgment of truly sensitive material.  But the procedure is apt to generate dispute at the margins which in the present case has taken the parties and the court way beyond any issue in the original litigation, thereby generating huge complexity and expense.

That is uncontroversial.  It is for the appropriate departmental minister, not the court, to judge and assert any risk to national security.  It is for the court to judge whether the minister’s judgment and assertion are rational and sufficiently evidence-based.  In so far as the rationality depends on, or the evidence represents, views or asserted intentions of the government of another state, the question is what is likely to happen, not whether this would be sensible or rational.  It is, I believe, most unusual for the court to have material directly from the government of another state, as the court has from the US in the present case.  There is force in Mr Sumption’s submission that the Foreign Secretary is entitled to take the US position as it is stated to be, without subjecting it to undue forensic dialectic, and that the court should do likewise.</span>

It is submitted that it is not remotely credible for the US to assert that they might reduce the flow of intelligence information to the UK, if information which is largely already public is published as part of a UK court judgment; and that the court should read behind the US statement, in the light of the very different attitude of the Obama Administration, to discern the true position that no serious consequences adverse to the UK national security will occur or are now in contemplation.  But the judgment of the Foreign Secretary is otherwise, and I am concerned that the court is being invited to substitute its view for that of the Foreign Secretary.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">The control principle seems to me to have been elevated in this litigation into something that it is not.  I conceive it to be a label for an understanding between intelligence agencies of generally cooperative states that, if one state passes on intelligence information to another state, the receiving state will not use the information, pass it on to a third state or otherwise publish it, without the agreement of the providing state.  It is not, to my mind, particularly helpful to debate whether court ordered disclosure would be a “breach” of the understanding, nor to point out that there is an understood risk that a court in the receiving state may order disclosure in certain circumstances.  A state may nevertheless share intelligence information on the basis that the receiving state will usually succeed in persuading its courts not to order disclosure.  If a court does in fact order disclosure, the providing state may well take a very serious look at its intelligence sharing arrangements, even though it already knew that the possibility of court ordered disclosure existed.  It therefore seems to me entirely rational for the US to state in this case that, if the seven subparagraphs are published, they will have to review their intelligence sharing arrangements. This is not so much because particular information, regarded as sensitive, has been published, but because the UK Foreign Secretary has been unable to persuade the UK court that the understanding should not be overridden.  The UK intelligence operation would be regarded as to that extent potentially insecure, and a review would be necessary.  Until the review is undertaken and concluded, no responsible US Government official is likely to predict its outcome, and I would be surprised if those officials were to communicate a clear predicted answer to the UK Foreign Secretary.  I would not myself place undue emphasis on a distinction between “would” and “could”, although I note that the US Secretary of State is recorded as using the word “would”.  Although I can sympathise with the Divisional Court’s procedural frustration in the early summer of 2009, I am inclined to think that the Divisional Court’s (and Ms Rose’s) search for an unqualified answer to the question whether the flow of intelligence information from the US to the UK </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">It is, I think, over-facile to suppose that the outcome of such a review would necessarily result in an undiminished flow of intelligence from the US to the UK.  Certainly it seems distinctly improbably that the US Government, left to itself, would alone take damaging umbrage because a bare summary of intelligence information about Mr Mohamed’s treatment, all or most of which was regarded as publicly known, was included as being necessary in a UK court judgment.  The fact that it is derived from intelligence sources ceases to be of much significance if the information is publicly known anyway.  But US intelligence information no doubt comes from a variety of sources, including from foreign partners such as are referred to in the redacted CIA letter of 30</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> April 2009.  Such information provided to the US is no doubt received by them on the same understanding as to control.  As the CIA letter states, “these foreign partners could take steps to withhold from the United Kingdom sensitive information that could be important to its safety and security.  Any decreased cooperation from these foreign partners would adversely affect counterterrorism and other endeavours”.  Thus, although the main question which appears to have been debated in the present litigation has been whether it is credible and rational to suppose that the US would reduce the flow of intelligence information, if material most of which is supposedly already public were included in the court’s published judgment, another consideration is whether the flow of intelligence information originating elsewhere could diminish.  The CIA letter asserts that it could, and there is no basis for using the word “would” in that statement.  Nor is it this court’s function to speculate how likely it may be that foreign partners might react to a perception that the UK intelligence operation is potentially insecure.</span>

Nor do I find wholly persuasive the Divisional Court’s rejection of the position stated by the US Secretary of State.  The reasons which I have given which lead to this view are rather different from those which comprised the main debate before the Divisional Court.  But they are to be found in the redacted material which the Divisional Court had, and I, with Lord Neuberger MR, have not relied on or referred to closed material to reach this intermediate position, except that (a) I have looked at the seven subparagraphs themselves and (b) I have satisfied myself in general that, although the potentially relevant closed material enlarges on the Foreign Secretary’s case, it does not, I think, make it intrinsically stronger.  </span>

This was to be taken with Ms Rose’s acceptance that the CIA letter, taken at face value, could justify the Foreign Secretary’s judgment; and the pervading assumption that, if the Foreign Secretary’s judgment was justified, it would without more tip the balance against disclosure.  I suppose that, on one view, if there is a real risk of  serious damage to the UK’s national security, there are no relevant degrees to that risk.  But in principle, a real risk of serious damage to national security, of whatever degree, should not automatically trump a public interest in open justice which may concern a degree of facilitation by UK officials of interrogation by US officials using unlawful techniques which may amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.</span>

On behalf of Mr Mohamed, it is contended that these public findings of fact in the US mean that it cannot be maintained that US or UK national security requires the suppression by the UK courts of short summaries of precisely the same type of fact.  The submission made on behalf of the Foreign Secretary that disclosure of the subparagraphs would risk the US reducing the sharing of intelligence is unsustainable when essentially the same facts are publicly found to be true in a US court.  It is contended that the principal effect of allowing the present appeal would be to suppress findings giving details of the extent of the knowledge of Mr Mohamed’s treatment which the UK authorities had at the time.  That is scarcely a sustainable basis for the US authorities to be concerned about a departure from the control principle, when the sensitive information itself has been made public in the US.</span>

The District Court’s finding of torture was not based on material derived from US intelligence sources.  The sensitivity of the seven subparagraphs arises entirely from the fact that they derived from material supplied from US intelligence sources to the UK agencies and from the US concern about the security of information supplied from such sources, if it is liable to be disclosed in circumstances such as these.  Since the finding of the US District Court was based on material of a quite different nature and origin, it has no implications for any issue in these proceedings.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">In my judgment, the decision of the US District Court shifts the already fine balance in this case against the exclusion of the seven subparagraphs.  I have given in paragraphs 288 to 290 above my understanding and assessment of the narrow persuasive basis supporting the Foreign Secretary’s national security judgment.  In a sense, the content of the seven subparagraphs does not matter to that case; rather, the concern is that, whatever the content, there is a risk that foreign partners may reduce or place constraints on the use which the US may make of intelligence information because the UK intelligence operation has been shown to be insecure.  I can see the superficial logical force of the representation that the findings of fact in the US District Court make no difference to that position, because those findings are based on evidence derived from a different source.  But I fear that angels are now dancing on a pinhead.  The Foreign Secretary’s case now seeks to defend a principle entirely devoid of factual content on which to hang it.  In my view, the finding of the US District Court does make a difference because it changes what was an arguable case of torture into a case of torture which a US court has found to be true in proceedings in which the US Government had the opportunity to make a case that it was not true.  In these circumstances, it would be quite absurd if the US Government itself decided to reduce intelligence sharing because a UK court had decided to publish summary material whose essential content has been publicly found to be true in a US court; and it would be fanciful to suppose that foreign partners would be concerned because the US Government had taken a stance in these proceedings which became untenable.  I am not persuaded that court-ordered disclosure of publicly available material accepted in a US court to be true, one source of which was an intelligence source, could in any real sense properly be regarded as a breach of the control principle.  This is especially so when Ms Rose is able to point to other material in the Divisional Court’s open judgments to which the same arguments might have applied, had the Foreign Secretary chosen to make them.  Relying on a bare principle in relation to material which now has no sensitive content is tantamount to saying that the Foreign Secretary’s judgment should always determine the balance and that the court has no relevant balancing judgment of its own to make.  That is not the law.</span>
