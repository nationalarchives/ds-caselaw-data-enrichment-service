	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This is the judgment of the Court to which all members of the Court have contributed, on an appeal from the judgment of Henderson J dated 27 November 2008. There are cross-appeals from the Judge’s judgment, but in this judgment we refer to an appeal, singular, rather than appeals, plural.  The case is a lead case under a group litigation order.  It raises important legal issues as to the compatibility of United Kingdom corporate taxation with certain principles of Community law derived from the EC Treaty (“the Treaty”) and as to the liabilities of the Revenue to a taxpayer who has overpaid tax on the basis of incompatible United Kingdom legislation. These issues are also important in terms of the amounts at stake in these proceedings, which we are told may be as much as £5bn.  Moreover, the determination of issues in the present proceedings will affect the decision in other pending proceedings.  <span style="color:#000000">However, there have been a number of important legislative changes affecting the taxing provisions in issue in these proceedings since the payments of tax giving rise to these proceedings were made: in particular Advance Corporation Tax (“ACT”) was abolished with effect from 6 April 1999 (section 31 Finance Act 1998), and since 1 July 2009 both foreign-source and domestic-source dividends have been exempt from corporation tax, subject to certain exceptions (Finance Act 2009, sch. 14)</span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#000000">.</span><span style="color:#000000"> </span>This decision may therefore be mostly relevant to working out the consequences of what has been done in the past.</p>

References in this judgment to Member States are to Member States of the European Union or of the European Economic Area (“EEA”).  We are told that, for the purposes of the issues on this appeal, there are no relevant differences between the two groups of Member States.  When we refer to Third Countries, we refer to countries which are neither members of the European Union nor members of the EEA.</p>

The relevant provisions of the Treaty appear in Annex 1 to this judgment, in their form prior to the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty.  Following the coming into force on 1 December 2009 of the Lisbon Treaty the EC Treaty is now known as the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the articles of the EC Treaty with which are concerned have been renumbered.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We shall have to set out the relevant legislation in greater detail below (see paragraph [18] below), but the core rule under challenge in these proceedings is the basic rule of United Kingdom corporation tax that United Kingdom-resident companies are not subject to corporation tax on dividends received from other United Kingdom-resident companies, while dividends received from companies resident outside the United Kingdom are subject to corporation tax but carry the right to a credit equal to the amount of any foreign tax paid.   There were various implications flowing from this dual exemption/credit system. Prior to 6 April 1999 a United Kingdom-resident company had to pay ACT on dividends which it paid to its shareholders (unless the payment was within a group of companies and a group income election had been made).  It could, however, obtain a credit against its liability to ACT by reference to the amount of dividends it received from a United Kingdom-resident company  called “franked investment income” (“FII”).  A United Kingdom-resident company could not use income which it received from a company which was not resident in the United Kingdom in the same way.  Companies receiving dividends from companies not resident in the United Kingdom built up substantial surpluses of unutilised ACT, that is to say, ACT which could not be set against any liability to pay tax.  The FII rules were changed in 1994 and a new regime was introduced which enabled companies to elect that dividends which they received from non-resident companies should be designated as “foreign income dividends” (“FIDs”), in respect of which the ACT could be repaid if not utilised.</p>

This contained details of the history of the group structure, the dividends it had paid or received within the group and the group’s ACT surplus.  It is not necessary for us to set out this information.  In these proceedings the United Kingdom-resident company receiving a dividend directly from a company resident outside the United Kingdom has been referred to as a "United Kingdom water's edge company".  The company resident in another Member State has been referred to on this appeal as the "EC water's edge company".</p>

However, he did not give a judgment setting out his own opinion on the questions referred.  The new Practice Direction supplementing CPR 68 (introduced in 2009 and currently to be found in the second supplement to Civil Procedure 2009) now makes it clear that the schedule to the order for a reference to the ECJ may include the opinion of the referring court.  As we see it, the referring court should, where possible, briefly express its views on the answers to the questions which it is posing, for the assistance of the ECJ.  This may also help to avoid ambiguity and to ensure that all the questions on which a response is required are answered by the ECJ.</p>

To be compatible with the Treaty, residents of Member States and non-residents must be treated in the same way unless the difference in treatment relates to a situation that is not objectively comparable, or can be justified by reasons in the public interest. Thus for example, in C-35/98 <span style="font-style:italic">Staatssecretaris van Financien v</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Verkooijen </span>[2000] ECR 1-7321, the ECJ held that there was an impermissible restriction on freedom of movement of capital where an exemption in Dutch law from Dutch taxation of dividends paid by Dutch resident companies (on which tax had been imposed) was not extended to dividends paid by non-Dutch resident companies.  The Dutch law was treated as a disincentive to investment in non-resident companies. Similarly, in Case C-319/02 <span style="font-style:italic">Proceedings brought by Petri</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Manninen</span> [2004] ECR1-7477, the ECJ held that Finnish tax rules which provided that no tax credit was available to a tax resident of Finland in respect of dividends paid to him by a non-Finnish resident company was incompatible with the Treaty freedoms. Discrimination may be justified in certain circumstances, for example if it is genuinely necessary to prevent tax avoidance (Case C-264/96 <span style="font-style:italic">ICI v Colmer </span>[1998] ECR1-4695) or if and to the extent that it is necessary for the cohesion of the tax system (Case C-204/90 <span style="font-style:italic">Bachmann v Belgium</span> [1992] ECR 1-249).</p>

The Advocate General also considered that the system for imposing ACT and crediting it against mainstream corporation tax (“MCT”) failed to ensure that non-resident companies were treated on an equal footing with resident companies, and accordingly that there was a violation of the Treaty.  In relation to FII, the Advocate General considered that the FID rules described below (see paragraph [18] and Annex 2) were contrary to Articles 43 and 56 of the Treaty to the extent that they required non-resident companies to pay ACT and subsequently reclaim it.  However he considered that Article 57(1) applied and that there were restrictions in force on 1 December 1993.

By foreign-source dividends, we mean dividends paid by companies not resident in the United Kingdom. This is a highly compressed summary of what the ECJ decided and there is a major issue on this appeal as to whether in the first condition the ECJ, when referring to a higher rate of tax, meant effective rates of tax or nominal rates of tax.

The principal issue in relation to Case V is the meaning and effect of the judgment of the ECJ, but there are also other important issues, such as the applicability of Article 56 in relation to dividends from Third Countries and, if applicable, whether the exception from Article 56 created by Article 57(1) applies.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“[2] Prior to setting out the relevant provisions of the UK tax regime at issue, it is important to outline the broader framework for taxation of distributed company profits (dividends) within the EU, which forms the legal and economic backdrop to the case.  In principle, two levels of taxation can arise when taxing the distribution of company profits.  The first is at the company level, in the form of corporation tax on the company’s profits.  The levying of corporation tax at company level is common to all member states.  The second is at the shareholder level which can take the form of either income taxation on the receipt of the dividends by the shareholder (a method used by most member states), and/or withholding tax to be withheld by the company upon distribution.</p>

Economic double taxation, when, for example, the same profits are taxed first in the hands of the company as corporation tax, and second in the hands of the shareholder as income tax. Juridical double taxation, when, for example, a shareholder suffers first withholding tax and then income tax, levied by different States, on the same profits.</p>

States with a classical system of dividend taxation tax have chosen not to relieve economic double taxation: company profits are subjected to corporation tax, and distributed profit is taxed once again at the shareholder level as income tax.  In contrast, schedular, exemption and imputation systems aim at fully or partially relieving economic double taxation.  States with schedular systems (of which various forms exist) choose to subject company profits to corporation tax, but tax dividends as a separate category of income.  Those with exemption systems choose to exempt dividend income from income taxation.  Finally, under imputation systems, corporation tax at company level is fully or partially imputed onto the income tax due on the dividends at shareholder level, such that the corporation tax serves as a pre-payment for (part of) this income tax. Thus, shareholders receive an imputation credit for all or part of the corporation tax attributable to the profits out of which the dividends were paid, which credit can be set against the income tax due on these dividends.</p>

The adoption of a credit system for domestic-source income, however, would mean pointless extra administration costs, while an exemption system, which leads to the same result, is far simpler and less costly to run.  Similarly, the effect of the regime for domestic-source dividends (exemption) and foreign-source dividends (credit) is the same: in each case, economic double taxation is relieved.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">[49] The Test Claimants dispute this conclusion. They argue that a difference exists between the exemption and credit systems in cases where the UK distributing subsidiary has, pursuant to particular UK corporation tax exemptions and benefits (e.g. for investment or Research &amp; Development), in fact paid a lower net rate of corporation tax than the standard UK rate.  Under an exemption system, this is “passed on” to the recipient parent company – i.e. the dividends distributed will ultimately thus have borne a tax rate lower than the standard UK corporation tax rate. Under a credit system applied in a domestic context, however, in a case where a lower effective corporation tax rate had been originally borne by the profits pursuant to exemptions and allowances, this rate would always be “topped up” to the standard UK corporation [tax] rate upon distribution to the parent company.  Similarly, in the case of foreign-source dividends, the effect of a credit system is that the UK in all cases tops up the effective foreign corporation tax paid to the standard UK rate, without taking account of underlying corporation tax allowances granted at subsidiary level.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">[50] It would seem, therefore, that the application of a credit system by the UK for the relief of double economic taxation on foreign-source dividends can in certain cases have less favourable effects than the pure exemption system applied to domestic-source dividends.  While, under an exemption system, the benefits of underlying corporation tax exemptions and allowances may be passed on to the parent company receiving the dividends, under a credit system these benefits cannot be passed on as the tax borne by the dividends is topped up to the standard UK corporation tax rate.  In such cases, the effect of this could be seen as the application by the UK of a different (lower) tax rate to domestic-source dividends than to foreign-source dividends.</p>

While the UK’s arguments certainly show that, as I observed above, in principle the application of a credit system can be perfectly in accordance with Article 43 EC, they do not go towards justification of the possible difference in treatment, discussed above, between foreign-source and domestic-source income as regards the potential ability to pass on the benefit of underlying tax allowances to recipient parent companies.</p>

They may receive R&amp;D credits or capital allowances.  There may be exemptions for gains such as the substantial shareholder exemption.  A foreign subsidiary may make a gain which is exempt locally but taxed in the UK.  They may also receive the surrender of losses or allowances from other companies which reduce their taxable profits.  The list can go on.

In the purely domestic situation, the resident subsidiary is liable to corporation tax on its profits.  Absent the exemption from corporation tax on the dividend in the hands of the Claimant parent company, the same amount of profits would be taxed twice at the same rate.  This is because both parent and subsidiary would be chargeable to the same tax, at the same rate, on the same profits.<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">47</span>  This economic double taxation can be effectively dealt with by a simple exemption of the dividend from corporation tax.

The rate of corporation tax on the profits of a non-resident subsidiary will vary from country to country and in most cases will not coincide with the rate of corporation tax in the UK.  Hence a simple exemption of the dividend from UK corporation tax would not be an appropriate method for relieving economic double taxation, if the UK’s policy (or principle) of “capital export neutrality” is to apply.  In such situations, tax credits are the more appropriate method.  Under UK tax rules, therefore, such cross-border distributions are dealt with by the grant of credit for the foreign tax paid by the non-resident subsidiary in its state of residence.  It follows that the grant of such exemptions and tax credits respectively are necessary and appropriate to achieve the aim of relieving double taxation in the two contrasting situations, whilst ensuring in each case the cohesion of the UK tax system.”</p>

In the case of shareholders receiving those dividends, those systems do not necessarily have the same result.  Thus, under an exemption system, a shareholder who receives a dividend is not, in principle, liable to tax on the dividends received, irrespective of the rate of tax to which the underlying profits are subject to tax in the hands of the company making the distribution and the amount of that tax which that company has in fact paid.  By contrast, under an imputation system, such as the system at issue in the main proceedings, a shareholder may offset tax due on the dividends paid only to the extent of the amount of tax which the company making the distribution has actually had to pay on the underlying profits, and that amount may be offset only up to the limit of the amount of tax for which the shareholder is liable.</p>

The Judge took the view that, had the ECJ correctly understood the submissions to it, it would have agreed with the Advocate General that there was discrimination in the way that foreign-source dividends were taxed.  He took the view that in principle the ECJ agreed with the Advocate General that a difference in effective rates would constitute discrimination.  He used the French text to take him to the conclusion that the precondition stated by the ECJ in paragraph [49] of its judgment could not be satisfied.

There is obviously nothing exceptional about the proposition that companies often pay corporation tax at an effective rate lower than the nominal rate, because the existence and availability of reliefs which reduce the tax base (such as group relief, or the carry forward of trading losses) are commonplaces of UK corporate taxation. The UK government could not rationally have argued that such cases were exceptional.

As I have already explained, the ECJ agreed with the Advocate General in their general approach to the question, and I cannot believe that they would then have dealt so briefly with the argument based on effective rates of tax, which he had accepted as determining the question in the claimants' favour, if they thought it was either irrelevant or mistaken. If they thought either of those things, they would surely have explained why the argument was irrelevant or mistaken, or conceivably they would just have ignored it. Having introduced the argument into their discussion, however, without any adverse comments, I think the ECJ must be taken to have endorsed it, and the conclusion which flowed from it, subject only to the question of fact which they thought (wrongly, in my view) had been put in issue by the UK government.</span>

With regard to question (b), Mr Ewart QC for the Revenue accepts that UK companies frequently pay corporation tax at an effective rate which is lower than the nominal rate of corporation tax because of the availability of reliefs which reduce the tax base. If evidential support for the answer to question (b) is needed, it may be found in the expert report of Mr John Whiting OBE of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.

He submitted that the second question referred back to the national court in paragraph 56 was nothing to do with effective rates of tax as contrasted with nominal rates, but was merely asking whether the existence of small companies relief meant that different nominal levels of taxation occur only in highly exceptional circumstances.

For the Revenue, Mr David Ewart QC submits that the ECJ’s conclusion was clear and categorical: provided foreign dividends are subject to the same (nominal) tax rate as United Kingdom dividends, and full credit is given for all the tax paid by the foreign dividend-paying company, there is no breach of Article 43. That ruling is explicitly and clearly set out in paragraphs [49] and [50] of the judgment, and repeated in paragraph [57]. That this was the ruling of the Court is emphasised or made clear by the repetition of that paragraph in the <span style="font-style:italic">dispositif</span>. The reference in [55] to “different levels of taxation” arises from footnote 47 of the United Kingdom’s written observations, and is to small company relief, which does lead to a different rate of taxation being applied. It follows that in paragraph [56] the Court used the expressions “tax rates” and “levels of taxation” to refer to nominal rates of taxation. It further follows that since, as is common ground, small company relief is only applicable in exceptional cases, none of which apply to the present Claimants, and apart from that there is no difference in the tax rates applied to dividends received from abroad and those that are paid by domestic companies, and full credit for foreign tax is given in respect of the latter, the United Kingdom system complied with the requirements of Article 43.</p>

The point made by the Claimants and the Advocate General was that different effective levels of tax apply to foreign dividends received in the United Kingdom and domestic dividends received here. The ECJ accepted that a difference in effective levels of tax would be discriminatory and in breach of Article 43, and directed the national court to ascertain whether the Claimants’ assertions as to the provisions of United Kingdom law were correct. Hence the reference to nominal rates and to (effective) levels of taxation in paragraph [56]. On the Claimants’ submission any other interpretation of the judgment fails to give effect to the ECJ’s use of both rates of taxation (i.e. nominal rates) and to levels of taxation (i.e. effective levels of taxation) in paragraph [56].</p>

In addition, the judgment of the ECJ on this point does not, with very great respect, make it clear to the Claimants why important parts of their case have been rejected.  In the unusual circumstances of this case, all the members of the Court therefore consider that there should be a reference back to the ECJ to clarify its decision on this important point.  This, in our judgment, is the principled approach and is far preferable to ruling against one party on the hypothesis that the ECJ misunderstood submissions made to it.

That was the approach adopted in <span style="font-style:italic">O'Byrne v Aventis Pasteur SA</span> [2008] UKHL 34, [2008] 4 All ER 881 in which the House of Lords made a further reference to the ECJ in circumstances where the previous judgment of the ECJ was not “so obvious as to leave no scope for any reasonable doubt as to its application” (per Lord Rodger at [23]). We consider for the reasons given that that course is justified in this case.</p>

The basic question which arises is whether the subjection of such dividends to the Case V charge infringes Article 56 EC. There could be no question of infringement of Article 43, because that article protects freedom of establishment in member states alone and has no application to the establishment of subsidiaries in third countries. Article 56, however, prohibits restrictions on the free movement of capital not only between member states, but also between member states and third countries, although in its application to third countries it is subject to an important "standstill" proviso (now contained in Article 57 EC) which preserves the effect of restrictions under national or Community law which existed on 31 December 1993.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The argument for the Revenue is that Article 43 alone, that is to say to the exclusion of Article 56, applies in the following situations.  The first is where the purpose of the legislation is directed solely at establishment, that is to say where a shareholding is such as to enable the shareholder to exercise definite influence over the decisions of the company and to determine its activities.  The second is where the practical effect of the legislation embraces exclusively or primarily such situations.  The third is where the purpose of the legislation and its practical effect are not so limited and embrace movement of capital as well as establishment, but the factual situation under consideration by the Court is one of establishment. The effect of that analysis is that there can have been no infringement of the Community law prohibition on restriction of movement of capital under Article 56 by virtue of the Case V charge on dividends paid to the Claimants from Third Country subsidiaries. The Case V charge is not directed exclusively or primarily to establishment or movement of capital since it applies generally to income from foreign possessions.  The factual situation before the Court, however, does concern establishment since the Third Country subsidiaries of the Claimants are wholly owned by the Claimants.  That situation does not fall within the scope of Article 43 since that Article is concerned only with dividends paid by subsidiaries in Member States.  The result is that, on the Revenue’s approach, neither Article 43 nor Article 56 can apply.</p>

Just as I observed in my Opinion in <span style="font-style:italic">Test Claimants in Class IV of the ACT Group Litigation, </span>it is my view that the UK legislation at issue may in principle fall within the ambit of either Article 43 or 56 EC, depending on the quality of holding that a given parent company possesses in the relevant foreign subsidiary.  The Court has consistently held that a company established in one Member State with a holding in the capital of a company established in another Member State which gives it ‘definite influence over the company’s decisions’ and allows it to ‘determine its activities’ is exercising its right of establishment.  As a result, in the case of UK-resident parent companies whose holdings in non-UK companies satisfy the criterion, therefore, it is the compatibility of the UK legislation with Article 43 EC that should be assessed.  The application of this criterion in a given case is a matter for the national courts after analysis of the circumstances of the claimant company.  </p>

In the case of the test claimants in the present reference, it seems clear from the order for reference that these are UK resident companies (all members of the BAT group) with wholly-owned non-UK resident subsidiaries.  As a result, the test case falls to be considered under Article 43 EC.  As I observed in my Opinion in Test Claimants in Class IV of the ACT Group Litigation, although the exercise of freedom of establishment by these UK-resident companies will also inevitably involve the movement of capital out of the UK in so far as this is necessary to establish a subsidiary, this is a purely indirect consequence of the exercise of freedom of establishment.

Any restriction on capital movements is simply incidental.  It is only in cases where there is no such influence and control that Article 56 is capable of applying, and that is so whether the subsidiary is in a Member State or a Third Country.

On the contrary, the ECJ considered in detail, in paragraphs [22] to [24] of its judgment, the question of whether the legislation was to be considered only in the context of freedom of establishment under Article 43 rather than the free movement of capital under Article 56.

The ECJ went on to say that legislation which makes the receipt of dividends liable to tax, where the rate depends on whether the source of those dividends is national or otherwise, irrespective of the extent of the holding which the shareholder has in the company making the distribution, may fall within the scope of both Article 43 and Article 56.  Having reached that conclusion, the ECJ then stated that, on the facts of the case, neither Article 43 nor Article 56 precluded the application of the Austrian legislation. The ECJ noted that Article 43 does not extend to situations which involve the establishment by a Member State parent of a Third Country subsidiary.  For that reason, Article 43 could have no application in the circumstances under consideration.  The ECJ then stated, in paragraph [30] of its judgment, that the effect of the Austrian legislation was that “such legislation constitutes a restriction on the free movement of capital which is, in principle, prohibited by Article 56(1)”.  That was a clear finding of the ECJ that Article 56(1) was engaged, subject to any exception in Article 57.  It was only after reaching that conclusion that the ECJ went on to hold that the Austrian legislation was to be regarded as having existed on 31 December 1993 for the purposes of Article 57(1). </p>

Paragraphs [37] and [38] of the judgment in that case, on which Mr Ewart placed reliance, were in the context of the ECJ’s answer to question 1 of the Reference.  Question 1, as we have said, was dealing only with the issue of dividends received by a company resident in a Member State from a subsidiary in another Member State.  Only question 4 raised directly the issue of the treatment of distributions received by companies resident in a Member State from companies resident in Third Countries in the context of Articles 43 and 56.  Paragraph [165] of the ECJ’s judgment, on which Mr Ewart relied, was in the context of the ECJ’s answer to question 4, but we do not agree with Mr Ewart’s interpretation of it.  He submitted that the effect in paragraph [165] of the cross reference to paragraph [38] was to confine Article 56 to Third Country involvement, and in addition, that is to say cumulatively, the circumstances were that the company receiving the dividend did not have definite influence over the decisions of its Third Country subsidiary and was not able to determine its activities.  In our view, the better interpretation of paragraph [165] is that it is describing two separate categories: namely, those cases which do not fall within the scope of Article 43 because they concern Third Country subsidiaries, and also those cases, whether or not they involve Third Country subsidiaries, in which the company resident in the Member State does not have control over the decisions and activities of the subsidiary.  Certainly, nothing in the judgment of the ECJ in this case points firmly to a contrary interpretation.  That no such contrary interpretation was intended is supported by the fact Judge Lenaerts was the Juge Rapporteur in both this case and <span style="font-style:italic">Holböck.</span></p>

Article 57(1) exempts from Article 56 restrictions which existed on 31 December 1993 under national or Community law in respect of movement of capital to and from Third Countries involving “direct investment… establishment”.  In paragraphs [32] to [36] of its judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Holböck</span> the ECJ explained the concept of “direct investments” as concerning “investments of any kind undertaken by natural or legal persons and which serve to establish or maintain lasting and direct links between the persons providing the capital and the undertakings to which that capital was made available in order to carry out an economic activity” (paragraph [34]), and that that objective of establishing or maintaining such economic links presupposes that the shares held by the shareholder enable him “to participate effectively in the management of that company or in its control” (paragraph [35]). The exception in Article 57(1), therefore, presupposes that Article 56 is capable of applying to restrictions on establishment.</p>

That case concerned the movement of capital by way of distribution by a parent company established in a Third Country of dividends, in the form of shares in a Third Country subsidiary, to a shareholder residing in a Member State.  As Advocate General Bot said in paragraph [90] of his opinion, such an operation might, in certain circumstances, give the shareholder a holding in the foreign subsidiary of the distributing company of such an extent that it enabled the holder to have a definite influence on that subsidiary’s decisions.  He went on to say that it is clear from the ECJ’s case law that, where the purpose of the legislation of a Member State concerns situations in which a shareholder’s holding enables him to have a definite influence on a company’s decisions and to determine its activities, that legislation must be examined in the light of the articles in the Treaty relating to freedom of establishment and those articles alone.  In such cases, the restrictive effects such legislation might have on the free movement of capital would be the unavoidable consequence of any restriction on freedom of establishment, and would not therefore justify an examination of that legislation in the light of Article 56.  He went on to say the following about national legislation which makes the receipt of dividends liable to tax, where the rate depends on whether the source of those dividends is national or otherwise, irrespective of the extent of the holding which the shareholder has in the distributing company:</p>

The latter provision, as was seen above, provides that the Member States may maintain restrictions existing on 31 December 1993 on the movement of capital to or from third countries where such movement involves ‘establishment’.  It may therefore be deduced from that provision that the movement of capital to or from third countries may involve establishment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The analysis of the ECJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Glaxo</span> was very similar to that of Advocate General Bot.  The ECJ said that, in order to determine whether the national legislation falls within the scope of Article 43 or Article 56, the purpose of the legislation concerned must be taken into consideration.  The ECJ, in principle, examines the measure in dispute in relation to only one of those two freedoms if it appears, in the circumstance of the case, that one of them is entirely secondary in relation to the other.  The ECJ confirmed that movements of capital for the purposes of Article 56 include direct investments in the form of participation in the undertaking through the holding of shares which confers the possibility of participating effectively in its management and control.  It was common ground that the application of the German legislation did not depend on the size of the shareholdings, and was not limited to situations in which the shareholder could exercise definite influence on the decisions of the company concerned and determine its activities.  In addition, having regard to its purpose, the free movement of capital aspect of the legislation prevailed over that of the freedom of establishment.  Consequently, even if the legislation had restrictive effects on the freedom of establishment, they were the unavoidable consequences of the restriction of the free movement of capital, and did not justify independent examination of the legislation under Article 43.  In the course of that analysis, the ECJ referred to, and relied upon, the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Holböck</span> thereby clearly indicating, contrary to Mr Ewart’s submission, that the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Holböck</span> was part of an established and approved chain of case law.</p>

Article 56 will not apply if the purpose of the legislation or its practical effect exclusively or primarily concern establishment. Moreover, in cases where the purpose or practical effect of the legislation is not so restricted, but the factual situation before the Court concerns an establishment situation solely involving companies resident in Member States, there is no practical difference between the principles applicable under Article 43 and Article 56, so the Court is likely for practical reasons only to consider the freedoms in the context of Article 43 (unless the exemption under Article 57(1) is in issue): see, for example, paragraphs [34] and 35 of the Advocate General’s opinion in this case.

The relief extended both to any withholding tax charged when the dividend was paid by the foreign water's edge company and (where, as is usually the case, the relevant double tax treaty so provided, as well as in all relevant cases of unilateral relief under ICTA section 790) to underlying tax on the profits out of which the dividend was paid, whether charged on the water's edge company paying the dividend or on companies further down the chain. The detailed rules were contained in Chapter II of Part XVIII of ICTA, including in particular section 797 (the upper limit) and section 799 (underlying tax). It was a consequence of this system that, in principle, the underlying foreign tax on a dividend from a country with a higher rate of local corporation tax than the UK rate ("a high tax country") would be capped at the UK rate, and any excess tax from one source could not be credited against the UK liability on a dividend from another source, such as a country with a local corporation tax rate lower than the UK rate ("a low tax country"). </p>

A single dividend could then be paid to the UK from the mixer company with an averaged rate of tax, thereby minimising the loss of double tax credit. This process was commonly known as "offshore pooling", and became standard procedure for most UK multi-national groups. Following the merger of the BAT group with Rothmans in the late 1990s, the claimants adopted this structure by arranging to pay dividends to the UK via a Netherlands holding company, namely the seventh claimant, BAT International BV. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">[104] The procedure which the BAT group adopted is described in more detail in the witness statement of Robert Fergus Heaton, who is a chartered accountant and was a senior tax manager reporting to Mr Hardman from 1997 onwards. He was not cross-examined on his written evidence, which I accordingly accept. He explains that prior to the abolition of ACT in 1999 the group held most of its interests in its end market trading subsidiaries directly from the UK, and maximising the use of excess tax credits from subsidiaries in high tax countries was not seen as a major concern, because the group's liability to tax on Case V income was one of the few sources of corporation tax against which ACT could be utilised. However, the abolition of ACT for dividends paid after 4 April 1999, and the shadow ACT regime which replaced it, exposed the group for the first time to liabilities to tax on its Case V income which it would be unable to shelter with surplus ACT. Accordingly, the group was rearranged following the merger with Rothmans in the way which I have described. It was group policy that subsidiaries should, where possible, distribute 100% of their profits, and for the most part these would ultimately be received by BAT International BV. A calculation would then be made on a quarterly basis of the underlying rate of tax on the dividends received – which was by no means a straightforward exercise – and a decision would then be made on the amount of the dividends to be paid from BAT International BV into the UK. Mr Heaton would review the calculations, and also take into account any other reliefs that might be available in the UK (such as group relief) to shelter any liabilities to tax upon receipt of the Case V income which would not be covered by double tax relief. It was always group policy to pay dividends through the group and into the UK as quickly as possible, and Mr Heaton would only raise concerns about the proposals if it looked likely that there would be a significant adverse tax impact. </p>

A period of consultation ensued, in response to which the Revenue announced that amendments would be made to the draft rules and their introduction would be deferred until 31 March 2001. In June 2000, the Revenue then announced that, while the Government was committed to the abolition of offshore mixing, it would introduce a limited form of onshore pooling. Further lobbying continued, which led to further announcements of changes to the proposals in November 2000 and March 2001, and the promulgation of draft regulations concerning the surrender of EUFT at the end of March 2001. The new rules then took effect for dividends paid from the end of that month. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">[106] The EUFT rules are complex in detail, but the broad principles can be stated quite briefly. The advantages of offshore mixing were largely nullified by the introduction of a "mixer cap", which operated to restrict the amount of underlying foreign tax which could be credited against the UK corporation tax liability on foreign dividends. The cap applied not only where a dividend was paid by a non-resident company direct to the UK, but also, and critically, where a cross-border dividend was paid at any earlier stage within the group by one non-resident company to another. The mixer cap limited the creditable underlying tax to the UK corporation tax rate. Any unrelieved foreign tax (EUFT) would then be eligible for onshore pooling, and could be offset against the UK corporation tax payable on certain dividends from low tax countries. However, the dividends against which EUFT could be offset ("qualifying foreign dividends", or "QFDs") excluded certain important categories of dividend, including in particular: </p>

There were, however, also some countervailing advantages, which had not been available under the previous regime. For example, surplus EUFT could be carried back and set off against tax payable on QFDs of the same company in the previous three years, and could also be carried forward indefinitely by the same company or surrendered to another group company.</p>

A complex restructuring operation was therefore undertaken, and given the name "Project Frankenstein". In very broad terms, the purpose of the exercise was to undo the restructuring which had followed the merger with Rothmans, and to ensure that the separate streams of dividends from the end market subsidiaries did not mix before they reached the UK, and then to transfer the residence of BAT International BV from the Netherlands to the UK. Mr Heaton was the manager of the project, and it occupied him full time for six months. A team of external advisers was brought in to assist, and the overall cost of the exercise came to about £5 million.”</p>

That exclusion was in place on 31 December 1993 and has remained in place ever since, so Article 57(1) applies and prevents a recipient of such dividends in a member state from complaining that the exclusion infringes Article 56. The fact that there may have been changes since 1993 in the Case V regime which subjects the dividends to tax in the UK is, on this analysis, irrelevant. Such changes might be relevant to the question whether Article 56 had been infringed, and (if so) to the quantification of the loss suffered by the claimant; but the changes are not relevant to the continued existence of the basic restriction itself, which is simply the inability to take advantage of the exemption in section 208.”</p>

The Judge did so in response to Mr Aaronson’s submission that, if there were a major change in the relief rules applicable to the Case V charge, such as the introduction of EUFT, the relevant restriction would no longer be the same as it was on 31 December 1993 and the standstill in Article 57(1) would be lost.  The Judge’s analysis and conclusion on that approach were set out in paragraph [108] of his judgment as follows:</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“[108]<marker name="tab"/>Against this background, can it be said that the introduction of the EUFT regime changed the legislative approach upon which the Case V charge was based and established new procedures (compare <span style="font-style:italic">Konle</span> at paragraphs 52 and 53, and the judgment of the ECJ in the present case at paragraph 192)? The EUFT system certainly established new procedures for the relief of foreign tax, but I do not consider that it changed the general approach upon which the Case V charge was based. As before, the general philosophy of the system was to grant relief in the UK for foreign withholding and underlying tax attributable to the dividends received, subject to an upper limit fixed by reference to the UK corporation tax rate. All that changed were the detailed rules relating to the utilisation of foreign tax which would otherwise have been unrelieved, and the introduction of a new system of onshore pooling to replace the offshore pooling which no longer carried any fiscal advantages. In some respects the new system was less attractive to UK multi-national groups than the system which it replaced, but the new system also introduced important elements of flexibility which had not previously been available. If one stands back from the small print and the detail, the overall nature of the Case V charge was in my judgment still in substance the same after the introduction of EUFT as it had been before. It is true that the changes would have cost the BAT group a substantial amount in extra tax, if Project Frankenstein had not been undertaken to mitigate the position. But the reorganisation was no greater than that which followed the merger with Rothmans and the abolition of ACT, and the claimants no longer contend that the abolition of ACT itself forfeited the protection of Article 57(1). Moreover, nobody suggests that a mere increase in the nominal rate of UK corporation tax would have been fatal, so the increased tax cost of the changes to a typical UK multi-national could not of itself be determinative. The test is essentially a structural one, and in my view the focus should be on the main features of the structure rather than the fine points of detail. Accordingly, if it were necessary for me to decide the question, I would hold that the introduction of the EUFT system did not cause the protection of Article 57(1) to be lost.”</p>

Mr Aaronson emphasised the large practical implications of the introduction of the EUFT regime.  It transformed, he said, the way relief was given for overseas tax because it had become the practice for groups of companies, like the Claimants, to use Dutch “mixer” companies which received dividends from foreign companies lower down the corporate chain, which had been paid out of profits subjected to different rates of tax.  By utilising a Dutch mixer company it was possible to maximise the tax which could be set off against United Kingdom corporation tax on payment of the dividend from the Dutch mixer company to its United Kingdom parent.  The arrangement was beneficial because the Netherlands applied an exemption system of taxation, so that all the dividends could flow into the Netherlands without any further charge to tax.  The Netherlands did not give relief for overseas tax paid since it did not impose a charge on the dividends.  Accordingly, the overseas tax paid remained in the hands of the Dutch mixer company.  By mixing overseas credit and overseas taxation rates, the Dutch company could pay a dividend to the United Kingdom parent which had borne overseas tax averaged at 30 per cent, which could be offset against United Kingdom corporation tax of 30 per cent on that dividend.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The effect of the EUFT regime was that the mixing had to be done onshore to obtain the most effective tax relief benefit.  One of the problems was that it was not possible to mix onshore dividends paid by CFCs, which paid those dividends for the very purpose of complying with the CFC rules.  The basic principle of the CFC rules was that, if there was a major shareholding in a subsidiary in a low tax territory, the profits of that subsidiary were imputed to the parent company.  They came into the tax base of the parent company unless it was possible to comply with “safe havens”.  For example, if 90 per cent of the profits were paid out in dividends, the profits of the subsidiary were not imputed to the United Kingdom parent.  Those dividends were not, however, eligible for EUFT.  They will have borne lower rates of tax.  It was not possible, therefore, to set off dividends paid out of profits with higher rates of tax against those from CFCs which would have borne lower rates of tax.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The other major problem was that, if a dividend passed from one overseas company to another, it would not be eligible for EUFT.  The result was that, in order to obtain the greatest tax advantage from the EUFT regime, it was necessary to “flatten” the corporate group, so that, instead of having one European holding company owning many subsidiaries, the United Kingdom company had to own many subsidiaries, all sending their dividends into the United Kingdom.  If there was a mixer company anywhere below the level of the water’s edge company overseas, dividends going through that mixer company were not eligible for EUFT.  </p>

On the hypothesis that the ECJ holds in favour of the Claimants on Issue 1, the contravention of Article 56 was the exclusion of Third Country-source dividends from the exemption conferred in respect of domestic-source dividends by ICTA section 208.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is an alternative way of looking at the matter, with the same result. Paragraphs 49 and 50 of the ECJ’s judgment in<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>this case specify the minimum requirements of an exemption/imputation system in order to be compatible with Community law.  First, the foreign-source dividends must not be subject in the Member State to a higher rate of tax than the rate that applies to domestic-source dividends.  Secondly, the Member State must prevent foreign-source dividends from being liable to a series of charges to tax, by offsetting the amount of tax paid by the non-resident company making a distribution against the amount of tax for which the recipient company is liable, up to the limit of the latter amount.  If there was a violation of Article 43 or Article 56 in this case, it was that the effective rate of tax applied to domestic-source dividends could and would normally be lower than the rate on foreign-source dividends.  It is that which falls for consideration under Article 57(1).  That restriction existed on 31 December 1993 and continued unchanged subsequently.  The introduction of the EUFT regime had nothing to do with that restriction, but was directed at the way in which credit was to be calculated and given for the amount of tax paid by the non-resident company making the distribution against the amount of tax for which the recipient company is liable, up to the limit of the latter amount.  It was concerned only with the requirement described in paragraph [50] of the ECJ’s judgment in this case and obligatory under the Parent-Subsidiary Directive.  It is not suggested that such requirement ceased to be satisfied by virtue of the EUFT regime.  The principle remained, as before, that there was double tax relief for all tax paid by the foreign company subsidiaries on the profits distributed, subject to the limit of the United Kingdom corporation tax:  ICTA sections 797(1) and (2), and 800.  </p>

It gave relief for underlying tax down the chain of corporate subsidiaries (ICTA section 801), and it permitted excess relief to be transferred across the corporate structure and to be used to offset other dividends.  In short, the EUFT restrictions altered the way that tax credit was to be calculated, but that had nothing to do with the restriction which, subject to Article 57(1) and on the hypothesis that the Claimants are correct about Issue 1, infringed Article 56.  </p>

The ECJ considered that the payment of ACT was simply an advance payment of MCT.  Accordingly it held by way of answer to question 2 in the order for reference that:</p>

He made the point that double taxation relief would in principle be available in that situation and this was a sufficiently close analogy for him to conclude that ACT should be treated as giving economic relief to the same extent.  However, he took the view that the answer to this question was not so clear that he could provide it himself. Mindful of the fact that over £1bn might turn on his answer, he unsurprisingly considered that he should make a further reference to the ECJ.  This was a provisional conclusion, and he was not inclined to make an order for reference if there was an appeal (judgment, paragraph [450]).

In the light of the governing principle, the situation expressly considered by the ECJ may be seen as a paradigm one, and a similar line of reasoning should in my judgment lead to the conclusion that there is also a breach of Articles 43 and 56 in situations where: <span style="color:#000000">(a) foreign underlying tax has been borne by lower-tier companies resident in a member state; and/or (b) the only reason why the UK company which receives the dividend is not itself liable to account for ACT when it pays the dividend on to its parent is that it makes the distribution under a group income election.</span></p>

It is true that the UK rules for relief of double taxation are more sophisticated than the ACT regime, but the benefit of a payment of ACT can in practice be passed up a group in such a way that ACT is paid once only in respect of the same underlying profits. That provides a close enough analogy, to my mind, to justify a comparison with situations where underlying tax is paid by a lower-tier company and a higher-level company subsequently pays a dividend with the benefit of a credit for that underlying tax, even though it does not pay corporation tax itself.</span>

In my view the ability to make such elections cannot sensibly be segregated from the rest of the ACT regime, because it serves the same basic purpose of ensuring that ACT is paid once only within the group in respect of the same profits. It should not therefore matter, in the present context, whether the company which receives the foreign dividend itself pays ACT, or whether it pays the dividend to its parent under a group income election. Equally, it should not matter whether or not the company which receives the dividend happens to have FII available to it from other sources. The important point is that in all cases the foreign dividend is incapable of generating any relief from ACT in the hands of the recipient company, yet it will inevitably generate a liability to ACT at some point before it ultimately leaves the group. Viewed from a group perspective, therefore, it will give rise at some stage to an unrelieved charge to ACT within the group, in addition to the foreign tax which it has already borne at source. By contrast, UK profits which are paid up through the group are in practice liable to ACT once only, and they are then liable to a reduced charge to MCT because the ACT discharges an equivalent part of the MCT liability at the level at which it is paid. In other words, the former situation involves full economic double taxation, whereas the domestic UK regime does not.”</p>

The question is not simply, as the Claimants suggest, whether an additional burden is borne by foreign-source dividends that is not borne by domestic-source dividends.  A Member State which decides to grant relief against economic double taxation is not required to eliminate all the consequences of it but it must not take any measures which amount to discrimination contrary to Article 43.   As to the points made by the Judge in paragraph [141] of his judgment, we consider that it is for the ECJ to determine whether it would have given the same answer to question 2 where <span class="bold1" style="font-weight:normal;color:#000000">no tax was paid in the Member State of the company making the distribution, but the dividend had been paid out of profits earned in other Member States or indeed outside the European Union altogether.  The answer is not obvious, and the question is one of Community law.  It is also a question of considerable magnitude to the parties.  In those circumstances the appropriate course is that there should be a reference to the ECJ on this Issue. In any event, as we indicated in argument to Mr Ewart we consider that as a matter of Community law there would in this case be difficulties in revoking any decision of the judge to refer a question to the ECJ (Case C-210/06 </span><span class="bold1" style="font-style:italic;font-weight:normal;color:#000000">Cartesio</span><span class="bold1" style="font-weight:normal;color:#000000"> [2008] ECR I-0000 at [93] - [98] and Case C-525/06 </span><span class="bold1" style="font-style:italic;font-weight:normal;color:#000000">De Nationale Loterij NV v Customer Service Agency BVBA</span><span class="bold1" style="font-weight:normal;color:#000000"> [2009] ECR I-0000 at [6] - [7]).

The question is not important for the future administration of ACT because the Finance Act 2009 materially amended section 231.

These interpretations involved removing the qualifying requirement for a tax credit that the company making the distribution should be resident in the United Kingdom.  The Revenue opposed these approaches on the grounds that they gave the company receiving the dividend a right to a tax credit irrespective of the amount of foreign tax paid by it. The Judge rejected the Revenue’s submissions, and held that either of the alternatives advanced by the Claimants would achieve compatibility with Community law.  He held that, as a United Kingdom-resident company was entitled to a credit at the full rate even if it had in fact no liability to tax as a result of the reliefs to which it was entitled, there should similarly be an entitlement to a tax credit for foreign-source dividends, which should be treated as franked investment income in the hands of the recipient.</p>

This is a principle to which we shall refer again in the context of remedies.  For present purposes it is sufficient to state that it applies in particular where Community law requires national law to lay down rules for the repayment of tax levied but not due.  To comply with the principle of effectiveness, the national rules must not render virtually impossible or excessively difficult the exercise of a right to repayment conferred by Community law.  This principle may result in rules of domestic law, whether they are rules of adjectival law (such as the law of evidence) or substantive law (such as rules as to the conditions that must be satisfied before a tax repayment can be made) being set aside in order to ensure that rights conferred by Community law are effective.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We do not consider that the principle of effectiveness affects the interpretation of a statute in circumstances such as arise in the present case. All the Court is entitled and bound to do is to see whether section 231 can be read so that the right to a credit which is conferred extends not only to those expressly mentioned in section 231, namely resident companies, but also takes into account the rights of persons under Community law.  Once that question is answered and the interpretation is given, the task of conforming interpretation is at an end.  There is no further test to be applied about the ease of enforcing the rights thereby conferred or protected because persons entitled to tax credits as a matter of Community law are put on to the same footing under the section as other persons entitled to rely on the section as a matter of domestic law.  True, the conforming interpretation in this case is ascertained with retrospective claims in mind.  But even retrospective claims are not inevitably difficult to enforce, and the interpretation we prefer makes sense without taking account of the difficulties of enforcement that some beneficiaries of the new right will meet.  In those circumstances we do not consider that the Judge’s interpretation can stand even with the arguments made on behalf of  the Claimants.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is a further reason for rejecting the Claimants’ submissions that section 231, as interpreted on the lines set out in the foregoing paragraph, would contravene the Community law principle of effectiveness. Their individual claims have not yet been made, and thus, although the Judge took the view that “it would in practical terms be impossible for any kind of accurate reconstruction to be made of the course that foreign dividends followed through the group over a period of some 25 years” (paragraph [153] of his judgment), we consider that that conclusion cannot properly be drawn at this stage.  Thus the application of the effectiveness principle is best considered when those claims come to be made, and it may need to be considered on a case by case basis rather than as a general issue of principle under a GLO.  If there is a breach of the principle of effectiveness, the court can then consider the appropriate remedy.  The remedy could then be geared to ameliorating the evidential difficulties rather than altering substantive entitlements.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It therefore falls to this Court to determine the appropriate conforming interpretation.  In our judgment, a conforming interpretation can be achieved simply by reading in words that make it clear that it is not just resident companies that can claim a credit under section 231 but also other persons entitled to do so by Community law to the extent that they are so entitled.  The extent of that entitlement can then be investigated when the section falls to be applied, rather than the difficulties more properly arising at the point of application being erected as an objection to conforming interpretation.  It will apply even if the extent of the entitlement is not fully ascertained until after the ECJ has answered any question put to it in a further reference.  </p>

	      <span class="bold1" style="color:#000000"> The starting point is that where a company resident in the UK paid a dividend in cash, it could elect that the dividend should be treated as a FID: sections 246A(1) and (2). An election could not be made unless it was made in respect of all the dividends on the same class of share; and where a company had more than one class of share capital, ignoring any fixed-rate preference shares, it could only elect for a dividend to be a FID if it paid a dividend at the same time, and on the same terms, in respect of each share of each class, and opted for each of those dividends to be a FID: sections 246A(4) to (9). It follows from these provisions that a company could not elect, for example, that a dividend payable on a particular class of shares should be a FID for recipients who were liable to UK income tax, but not a FID for exempt shareholders. An election had to be made on an all or nothing basis. This point is of central importance to the issue of enhancement of FIDs, to which I will come later in this judgment in my discussion of remedies.</span>

The company therefore had to commit itself to the FID regime before the dividend was paid, even though in many cases the company would not yet know for sure whether it had sufficient distributable foreign profit to match with the dividend.</p>

A FID received by an individual shareholder, personal representatives of a deceased individual or trustees of a discretionary trust was, however, treated as income which had borne income tax at the lower rate, although no claim could be made for repayment of any such tax: section 246D. </p>

	      <span class="bold1" style="color:#000000"> Because a FID did not carry a tax credit, it could not generate FII in the hands of a corporate recipient. However, a company had to pay ACT only on the excess of the FIDs which it paid over the FIDs which it received in an accounting period: sections 246F(1) and (2). Furthermore, any excess of FIDs received over FIDs paid could be carried forward to the next accounting period and was then treated as a FID received in that period: section 246F(3). These provisions therefore produced a similar effect, within the FID regime, to the franking of franked payments by FII, and ensured that ACT had to be paid once only on a FID within the group.</span>

'Distributable foreign profit' was defined in sections 246I as, in effect, the amount of the company's foreign source profit after deducting the amount of foreign tax payable in respect of that profit or (if less) the amount of corporation tax payable in respect of the foreign profit before double taxation relief. The matching rules were relatively generous, and enabled a FID to be matched with distributable foreign profit of any subsidiaries in the current or preceding accounting period. An unmatched FID of the parent could also be matched with distributable foreign profit of the subsidiary in a subsequent period.</span>

In particular, the detailed provisions relating to set off meant, again in broad terms, that ACT (whether actual or notional) had to be set off against any MCT for which the company was liable before any repayment could be made.</span>

In particular, it offered companies the opportunity to obtain a repayment of surplus ACT when they paid dividends to their own shareholders.  The ECJ left it to the national court to determine the question whether Article 57(1) applied, with the following observations:</p>

While it is true that, in the national system of which the FID regime forms part, the grant of such a tax credit to a shareholder receiving a distribution is the counterpart of the payment by the company making the distribution of the ACT on that distribution, it cannot be inferred from the description of the national tax legislation provided in the order for reference that the fact that a company which has elected to be taxed under the FID regime is entitled to be reimbursed surplus ACT justifies, under the logic governing the legislation which existed on 31 December 1993, its shareholders not being entitled to any tax credit.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Judge considered that the FID regime created a new restriction because, while it provided a method of reducing ACT surpluses built up by groups in receipt of foreign-source dividends, it did not provide any tax credit.  The ACT released had first to be set against the resident company’s liability for MCT, and would only then be repaid.  The Judge concluded that the FID regime involved a new restriction and that the United Kingdom had forfeited the protection of Article 57(1) by introducing the FID regime, even though that regime was intended to mitigate the ACT consequences of the regime otherwise applicable to foreign dividends (judgment, paragraph [190]).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On this appeal the Revenue challenges the Judge’s conclusion.  Mr Ewart submitted that the question referred to the national court by the ECJ could be answered by reference to the decision in the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Pirelli Cable Holding NV v IRC</span> [2006] UKHL 4, [2006] 2 All ER 81.  On his submission, that decision showed that there was an inextricable link between the payment of ACT and the receipt of a tax credit.  The issue was whether, if it were unlawful for a subsidiary and its non-United Kingdom resident parent company to make a group income election, the tax credits envisaged under the relevant double taxation conventions would not be payable.  Lord Nicholls, Lord Hope and Lord Walker each held that there was a link between the tax credit and the payment of ACT.  Lord Nicholls said that “this unspoken linkage” lay at the heart of the legislative scheme.  Lord Hope also held that the prerequisite for the giving of a tax credit was the making of the qualifying distribution, which was liable to ACT ([39]).  He added that “A group income election extinguished that liability and with it the right to the tax credit that was that the counterpart of the liability” ([39]).  Lord Walker also held that, if the payment of a dividend was not accompanied by a payment of ACT, the dividend would not give rise to a tax credit ([103]).  It followed, on Mr Ewart’s submission, that it was consistent with the legislative scheme for ACT to deny a tax credit where ACT was about to be repaid.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Judge distinguished the passages in <span style="font-style:italic">Pirelli</span> on the basis that the FID regime denied any tax credit to shareholders of the parent company even though it did not provide for the automatic reimbursement of the ACT which was paid, and instead gave priority to the setting off of ACT, which would otherwise be repayable, against any outstanding ability to MCT (judgment, paragraph [190]).  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Ewart submits that the Judge fundamentally misunderstood the purpose of the FID regime, and the reason why companies chose to pay dividends as FIDs rather than as normal dividends.  By using the FID regime, companies could reduce their ACT surplus by allowing the unutilised ACT to be repaid.  Companies could, therefore, pay both FIDs (which they would do if they would otherwise have unutilised ACT) and ordinary dividends in the same year.  A FID did not carry a tax credit, since it was intended and was the case in practice that a FID was used only in cases where the company calculated that the ACT would not be used and would therefore be repaid in full.  If FIDs had always carried a tax credit, the result would have been that all payments of dividends would have been made as FIDs, thus entitling shareholders to tax credits even though most or all of the ACT was subsequently be repaid.  This would break the “unspoken linkage" between the payment of ACT and entitlement to a tax credit.</p>

He submitted that the FID scheme linked the repayment of ACT to distributable profits and that the refusal of a tax credit was not linked to the repayment of ACT.  He further submitted that the FID scheme contained restrictions that meant that, if the effective rate of foreign corporation tax were less than the United Kingdom MCT, there would be ACT which would not be eligible for repayment.  There was no automatic right to payment of ACT where the FID was paid and the tax credit lost.  Mr Thomas David Bilton, who gave evidence on the Claimants’ behalf, stated that:</p>

If we got it wrong and there was insufficient double tax relief to match the foreign sourced income with the FIDs, this would mean that the ACT could not be reclaimed and, to the extent any had been paid, interest (and potentially penalties) would be payable".  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The question that the ECJ required the national court to consider was whether the FID scheme justified the absence of a tax credit for shareholders.  The fact is that a company could fall between two stools.  There was nothing which prevented it from electing to make a FID and then finding that it could not in fact obtain repayment of ACT under the restrictions applying to the foreign tax admitted for FID regime purposes.  No doubt this would not happen to a company that was well advised, and could be avoided with planning.  Nonetheless the circumstances postulated could occur.  The company would have paid ACT and not be able to claim repayment of that ACT, and yet the dividend paid by it would carry no tax credit. That was inconsistent with the logic of the legislation as it did not respect the "unspoken" link between the payment of ACT and the entitlement to a tax credit.  Thus there was a new approach and new restriction in the FID regime, which meant that Article 57(1) did not apply to it.  </p>

The test claimants essentially argue that the UK's discriminatory failure to grant equivalent imputation credits to shareholders of UK companies receiving FIDs caused those companies to enhance their distributions to compensate these shareholders. However, it does not seem to me that such actions on the part of the distributing company to increase the amount of distributions should be considered to be a direct consequence of the UK's unlawful failure to grant an equivalent credit to the shareholders. Rather, the direct consequence of this failure is simply the extra tax levied on those shareholders than would have been the case had the UK complied with its Community law obligations--which loss is suffered by the shareholders, and not the distributing companies. In contrast, any increase by these companies in the amount of dividend distributed to its shareholders does not seem to me to follow inevitably from the denial of tax credit, nor it is possible without more to conclude that the distribution of an increased dividend necessarily qualifies as a loss incurred for the distributing companies.”</p>

In that case the ECJ, having found that it was contrary to Community law that United Kingdom subsidiaries of companies in another Member State were required to pay ACT (in effect an advance payment of MCT) whereas resident subsidiaries of United Kingdom parent companies were able to avoid that requirement, held that the taxpayers were entitled to interest on the tax paid on the date of its premature payment until the date on which MCT fell due.  That was a recognition that Community law requires recovery of more than just unlawful tax and penalties.  Mr Cavender also submitted that the ECJ was fully aware of the different categories of reliefs which were in issue in this case.  They were set out in paragraph [31(6)] of the ECJ’s judgment.

He submitted that “retained” in paragraph [205] must be a reference to retention of reliefs.  He observed that the reference in paragraph [207] to the waiving of relief by the taxpayer “in order to be able to offset in full a tax levied unlawfully, such as ACT, against an amount due in respect of another tax” can only be referring to capital allowances, since the concept of “waiver” cannot apply to ACT, management expenses or group relief, which were all applied by way of set-off.   By contrast, he submitted, it is legitimate to speak of those three reliefs as being transferred to, and retained by, the Revenue within the meaning of paragraph [205] since, once utilised, they were no longer available to the taxpayer to reduce tax in the future.  He said that the Revenue therefore benefited because it would receive more tax in the future than would otherwise have been the case.  Mr Cavender also observed that paragraph [208] of the ECJ’s judgment refers only to “waivers of relief” and increases in FIDs, which supports the Claimants’ restrictive interpretation of paragraph [207], and indicates that, on the Revenue’s interpretation of paragraph [205], there would be a lacuna in paragraphs [205] to [208] in failing to deal with ACT, group relief and management expenses.  He submitted that the true and overriding statement of principle is in paragraph [205], and that paragraph [207] was dealing only with issues of remoteness.  </p>

It seems to me that if the court had disagreed in principle with the clearly stated views of the Advocate General about the potential width of the <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> principle, they would have said so; and they would certainly not have confined their comments to the relatively narrow point whether the claims based on waiver of reliefs, as well as those based on the FID enhancements, fell outside the principle. The reasoning of the court in paragraphs 204 and 205 makes the point that the <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> principle, as applied in <span style="font-style:italic">Hoechst</span>, extends not only to the repayment of tax unduly levied, but also to amounts paid to the State, or retained by it, "which relate directly to that tax". In <span style="font-style:italic">Hoechst</span>, the claim in question was for the time value of the ACT which had been levied prematurely. In my judgment, this passage reflects essentially the same approach as the Advocate General's view that the <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> principle should "extend to all direct consequences of the unlawful levying of tax" (paragraph 132 of his opinion), and so understood it leads on naturally to the discussion which follows. </p>

The difference from <span style="font-style:italic">Hoechst</span> is that in these cases the claim is for recovery of the unlawfully levied tax itself, and is not a direct consequential claim for the time value of ACT which was levied prematurely (because UK domestic law did not allow the making of a group income election) but which the company concerned was subsequently able to set off against its MCT or utilise in some other way. </p>

It will be recalled that these claims, as summarised in Question 6(v), relate to situations where a company disclaimed reliefs to which it would otherwise have been entitled (such as capital allowances) in order to set off surplus ACT against its MCT liability, and as a result of which it had to pay MCT on the relevant slice of its taxable profits at the difference between the MCT and ACT rates.

Instead, they founded their decision on the point that, as with the enhancement of the FIDS, the waivers were "the result of decisions taken by those companies", and were not "an inevitable consequence" of the unlawful ACT regime. In other words, they saw the chain of causation as having been broken at the stage when these separate decisions were made. </p>

The Advocate General used the phrase "direct consequences", and the ECJ used the phrase "an inevitable consequence" (in French, "une conséquence inévitable"). I do not regard these expressions as necessarily conflicting with each other, or as intended to provide an exhaustive definition. They reflect rather the need for a direct and unbroken causal link, and an approach to causation which is considerably more stringent than that applicable to a <span style="font-style:italic">Factortame</span> damages claim (where "it is for the national court to assess whether the loss and damage claimed flows sufficiently directly from the breach of Community law to render the State liable to make it good": see paragraph 218 of the judgment). </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“[271].… In the present context, the ECJ has held that the waiver of reliefs in order to be able to offset a tax levied unlawfully, such as ACT, against an amount due in respect of another tax cannot form the basis of an action under Community law for reimbursement (paragraph 207 of the judgment). I do not find the intended scope of this exception altogether clear, and in particular I am puzzled by the reference to "unlawfully" levied ACT. If the ACT was levied unlawfully, it can be recovered in any event. It seems to me that the further claims under this head are concerned with the use of <span style="font-style:italic">lawful</span> ACT rather than unlawfully levied ACT. That point aside, however, it seems reasonably clear to me that this exception covers all of the claims in the present case which depend on a waiver of reliefs, or some other similar act, on the part of a claimant company. It therefore clearly covers the ACT claims which are based on disclaimed capital allowances; and I note that in the Eighth Amended Particulars of Claim these are in any event pleaded only as claims for compensation. The position with regard to the other ACT claims is less clear, but for the reasons which I have given I do not regard any of them as a direct, and still less as an inevitable, consequence of the unlawful charge to ACT. I therefore do not consider that they fall within the <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> principle. It is important to note in this connection that, although the Advocate General said that all of the types of claim set out in Question 6 (apart from the FID enhancements) were potentially <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> claims, he also said (at the end of paragraph 132 of his opinion) that in each case it would be for the national court to satisfy itself that the relief claimed "was a direct consequence of the unlawful levy charged". I do not understand the ECJ to have dissented in any way from that proposition, and their use of the word "inevitable" in paragraph 207 suggests, if anything, an even more stringent test.”</p>

The expression “reliefs waived by a taxpayer in order to be able to offset in full the tax levied lawfully” is accepted by the Claimants as intended to apply to the disclaimer of capital allowances, but is not a technically accurate description of what was being done.  The ECJ is plainly referring to “waiver” of reliefs in the opening lines of paragraph [207] in a non-technical descriptive sense.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“[245] It is common ground that two types of restitutionary claim in English law are relevant in the present case. The first is a claim for restitution of tax unlawfully demanded under the principle established by the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich Equitable Building Society v IRC</span> [1993] AC 70 ("<span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span>"). The second, established by the decision of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">DMG</span>, is a restitutionary claim for tax wrongly paid under a mistake of law. The two types of claim are, at any rate as the law now stands, conceptually distinct and subject to differing requirements. As Lord Hoffmann pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic">DMG </span>at paragraph 21, English law as yet "has no general principle that to retain money paid without any legal basis (such as debt, gift, compromise, etc.) is unjust enrichment". Accordingly, a claimant in England "has to prove that the circumstances in which the payment was made come within one of the categories which the law recognises as sufficient to make retention by the recipient unjust" (ibid). So, for example, mistake is not a necessary ingredient of the <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> cause of action, whereas it is obviously a crucial ingredient of the second type of claim. Conversely, a <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> claim must involve, at least in some sense, the making of a demand by the Revenue, whereas there is no need for a demand in cases of the second type.”</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“[260] In the first place, I am unable to accept Mr Ewart's submission that the <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> principle alone provides a sufficient UK remedy for claims which as a matter of Community law fall under the <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> principle. As I have already explained, it seems to me that the Court of Justice has adopted a relatively wide view of the <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> principle in the present case, whereas the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">NEC Semi-Conductors </span>has strictly confined the ambit of the <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> cause of action to cases where the tax in question was itself unlawfully demanded. It has given no encouragement to attempts to broaden the concept of a "demand", or to permit recovery of losses which go beyond the unlawfully demanded tax and interest. I therefore agree with Mr Cavender that the UK cause of action in mistake-based restitution is also needed in order to provide an effective UK remedy for many <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> claims. I also agree with him that, since the decision of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">DMG</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> cause of action is likely to play a subsidiary role in cases such as the present one. <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> was decided in 1992, several years before the House of Lords overturned the "mistake of law" rule in <span style="font-style:italic">Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Lincoln City Council</span> [1999] 2 AC 349 ("<span style="font-style:italic">Kleinwort Benson</span>"), and before the House of Lords held in <span style="font-style:italic">DMG</span> that the <span style="font-style:italic">Kleinwort Benson</span> principle extended to wrongly paid tax. Mistake is not a necessary ingredient of the <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> cause of action. As Lord Hoffmann said in <span style="font-style:italic">DMG</span> at paragraph 13, it is indifferent as to whether the taxpayer paid the tax because he was mistaken, or for some other reason. Where mistake is present, however, a restitutionary claim based on the mistake is likely to cover all the ground that a <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> claim could cover, but also has the potential to extend considerably further.”</p>

This is because ACT was a self-assessed tax.  It was not paid pursuant to a demand in the nature of an assessment raised by the Revenue.  If, however, payment was not made on time, an assessment could have been raised and penalties could have been imposed.  </p>

Under that approach, there is a single ground of restitution, namely that there is no explanatory basis for the enrichment of the defendant.  It is to be contrasted with the existing jurisprudence, under which a specific ground of restitution must be identified and alleged, such as duress or, in the present case, mistake. </p>

The underlying principle is that the Revenue should repay tax that has been exacted without legal justification. We can see no reason why the cause of action should be confined to those taxes that are payable on demand as against those, such as VAT, that are payable without a demand. Moreover, it is impossible to see why the citizen who duly accounts for and pays, by way of example, VAT, without waiting for a demand, on the assumption that the applicable legislation is valid, should be disadvantaged as against the taxpayer who refuses to account or to pay until a peremptory demand is received.</p>

Citizens are expected to be law-abiding.  They are expected to pay their taxes.  Pay first and object later is the general rule.  The payments are made pursuant to a perceived obligation to pay which results from the combined presumption of constitutional validity of duly enacted legislation and the holding out of such validity by the legislature.  In such circumstances I consider it quite unrealistic to expect the tax payer to make its payments ‘under protest’.  Any taxpayer paying taxes eligible under a statute which it has no reason to believe or suspect is other than valid should be viewed as having paid pursuant to the statutory obligation to do so.</p>

He considered that there were two streams of authority “relating to moneys wrongly extracted by way of impost” (page 197E). He said that one stream is founded on the concept that money paid under an <span style="font-style:italic">ultra vires</span> demand for a tax or other impost has been paid without consideration; and the other is based on the notion that such payment has been made under compulsion, the relative positions and the powers of the two parties being unequal (page 197E/F).  The latter does not, in our judgment, rest on the making of a formal demand, for the element of compulsion can be the fact that failure voluntarily to pay will ultimately result in some sanction.  This is inevitably the case with self-assessment under the United Kingdom’s tax laws.</p>

Furthermore, Mummery LJ’s statement, at paragraph [162], that “the claims in respect of overpaid or prematurely paid ACT can only succeed on the basis of <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich </span>by establishing an unlawful demand for payment of ACT” elides two issues:  whether the payment of ACT was lawfully due and whether it was demanded.

In my judgment the "but for" test of causation has no role to play in this context, except as a minimum requirement for linking the mistake made by the claimant with the types of recovery that, as a matter of general principle, a restitutionary claim can properly encompass. In other words, it cannot itself be used as a test to define the types of loss which are recoverable, and thus to bring within the scope of the law of restitution the same types of consequential loss as a claimant suing in contract or tort (or, I would add, for breach of statutory duty) might hope to recover.”</p>

So, for example, if lawfully paid ACT was used to offset an unlawful liability to Case V corporation tax, the result was that the company concerned did <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> pay corporation tax which, if it had done so, it would admittedly now be able to recover. If the Revenue was enriched at all, it was certainly not by the receipt of unlawfully levied corporation tax, but rather as a result of the group then having less ACT available to use for other purposes. An enquiry into whether (and if so how) such ACT would otherwise have been used within the group can in my judgment only form part of a claim for consequential loss. I do not see how it could be said that the Revenue was immediately and directly enriched at the group's expense by an amount equal to the ACT so used.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Looking at the Claimants’ first construct, the effect of the reliefs in the present case was that the payment of less tax to the Revenue in year 1 than would otherwise have been the case.  Plainly that was not a benefit to the Revenue in that year.  Indeed, Mr Cavender was compelled to accept that, even on the Claimants’ case, there could have been no completed cause of action for unjust enrichment in year 1 because it would have been impossible to say at that point of time if, when and how much more tax would be paid in future years, if the reliefs had not been applied in year 1.  That would depend on a number of variables, including what profits were made, when they were made and by which companies and how the Claimants would then be likely to apply reliefs in their tax planning arrangements and commercial objectives. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the second construct, the enrichment is said to have been the greater amount of lawful tax paid in year 2 or subsequent years than would have been paid but for the mistake in thinking that the Case V charge in year 1 was valid and the use of reliefs in year 1 for that reason.  This cannot, in our judgment, found a claim in restitution.  The short answer to the claim is that the tax paid in year 2 or subsequent years was lawfully due and so cannot be the subject of recovery under <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich </span>or as a payment under a mistake:  see <span style="font-style:italic">Kleinwort Benson v Lincoln City Council</span> [1998] UKHL 38,<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>[1999] 2 AC 349 at 408B (Lord Hope).  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Furthermore, the unjust enrichment alleged under this construct is too remote from the operative mistake.  That was the mistake in year 1 that the Case V charge was valid and the reliefs were required to off-set that tax.  The test of causation for unjust enrichment is the “but for” test: <span style="font-style:italic">Kleinwort Benson</span> at page 399D (Lord Hoffmann); <span style="font-style:italic">DMG </span>at paragraph [143] (Lord Walker).  In applying the “but for” test, it is important to identify the operative mistake and to limit recoverable loss to what is directly caused by it.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Dextra Bank &amp; Trust Co Ltd v The Bank of Jamaica</span> [2001] UKPC 50, [2002] All ER (Comm) 193 at [30], the Privy Council recognised that the mistake was causative according to the “but for” test of causation, but considered that it was too remote from the relevant payment of the money to the defendants.  The need for a close connection between the mistake and the enrichment is appropriate in the case of restitutionary relief for unjust enrichment since the cause of action is concerned with the restitution of an identified gain and not compensation for a fault-based tort.  In relation to the Claimants’ second construct, there was no mistake by the Claimants about the lawfulness of the tax paid in year 2.  It was lawfully due.  The mistake was in year 1 in relation to the tax due in that year and the need for the set off of reliefs to reduce it.  The connection between the payment of tax lawfully due in year 2 and the mistake in year 1 is not sufficiently direct to satisfy the requirements of causation in restitution.  The loss is too remote.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Similar reasoning precludes recovery under the Claimants’ third construct.  That construct differs in form from the second construct because the allegation is that the Claimants were mistaken in year 2 that reliefs had been validly used in year 1 when in fact, due to the unlawfulness of the Case V charge, the purported use of such reliefs was a nullity. <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich </span> does not apply because the tax was lawfully due; and for the same reason the alleged over-payments are not recoverable as payments under a mistake.  In any event, as Mr Ewart observed, it is unclear whether the reliefs purportedly utilised in year 1 remained available in year 2.  That is a matter to be ascertained in the light of all the factual circumstances and the provisions of the tax legislation.  Furthermore, although presented as a mistake in year 2 as to the continued availability of reliefs, the truly operative mistake was actually in year 1, as we have described above.  The mistake as to the availability of the reliefs in year 2 was merely consequential upon and reflective of that earlier mistake.  For that reason, the alleged enrichment, that is to say the loss, is too remote.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the Claimants’ fourth construct, the claim is not restitutionary, but rather for a declaration that the use of the reliefs in year 1 was a nullity and the reliefs are still available for use or to be carried forward.  In our judgment, the question whether or not reliefs are still available for use falls properly within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal (which has taken over the former jurisdiction of the Special Commissioners):  <span style="font-style:italic">Autologic Holdings plc v Inland Revenue Commissioners</span> [2005] UKHL 54, [2006] 1 AC 118.  The availability of reliefs depends on the precise facts at the time they are sought to be utilised and the general provisions of tax legislation.  The current availability of the reliefs is to be distinguished from what were described in <span style="font-style:italic">Autologic</span> as “satellite claims”, such as whether any remedy is available to the Claimants if the reliefs are not still available.</p>

Advocate General Fennelly, who as I have noted was of the opinion that the plaintiffs remedy in that case was restitutionary in nature, none the less made some comments in the alternative on the question of whether the <span style="font-style:italic">Brasserie du Pêcheur</span> conditions were satisfied. He remarked that, ‘The issue is whether the clarity and precision of Article 43 of the EC Treaty were such that the breach may be regarded as sufficiently serious. This has to be viewed in the light of the widespread use of residence as a criterion for direct taxation purposes coupled with the state of development of the relevant case-law at the material time. This will concern the limits which affect the use by member states of that criterion where it is detrimental to the interests of residents from other member states. In short, was the refusal to allow the group income election, viewed objectively, excusable or inexcusable?’ He went on to opine that, as what was in issue was indirect discrimination, this, ‘should, in general, be considered sufficiently serious … To classify a breach of Article 52 of the Treaty such as that involved in the present case as excusable, the national court must be satisfied not only that the UK authorities genuinely believed that refusing to extend the benefit of the group exemption in question to groups whose parent company was non-resident was strictly necessary, but also, viewed objectively in the light of <span style="font-style:italic">Bachmann</span> and the principle of strict interpretation of exceptions to fundamental Treaty rules like the freedom of establishment, that this belief was reasonable.’</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">[138] I agree with Advocate General Fennelly that the crucial question in deciding whether a breach such as the UK’s in that case is sufficiently serious is the question whether the error of law was, viewed objectively, excusable or inexcusable. I would also agree that, in most areas of Community law, indirect discrimination is likely to satisfy this test. However, as I have observed in my Opinion in <span style="font-style:italic">Test Claimants in the ACT Group Litigation</span>, certain of the Court’s case-law setting out the boundaries of the application of the Treaty free movement provisions in the field of direct taxation is extremely complex and, in parts, in the process of development. For example, it was not in my opinion wholly clear until the recent <span style="font-style:italic">Verkooijen</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Manninen </span>judgments that member states acting in a home State capacity are obliged by Articles 43 and 56 EC to grant equivalent relief from double economic taxation to resident shareholders receiving foreign-source income as for resident shareholders receiving domestic-source income. Such areas may be contrasted, however, with obligations that clearly follow from secondary legislation such as the Parent-Subsidiary Directive, or that follow clearly from jurisprudence of the Court which existed at the time that the relevant measures were in force. In sum, it follows in my view that breaches occurring at what were at that time the boundaries of the development of the Court’s case-law in this field should not be considered as a manifest and grave disregard of the limits or a member state’s discretion within the meaning of the Court’s case-law. It is for the national court to make the final assessment of this issue on the facts of the present case.</p>

It is perhaps significant that before us Mr Aaronson was unable to specify when the United Kingdom’s breach became sufficiently serious breach other than to say that it was “in the mid-90s” after the decision in Case C-1/93 <span style="font-style:italic">Halliburton Services BV v Staatssecretaris van Financiën</span> [1994] ECR I-1137<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>in 1994. This is in contrast with the Claimants’ first skeleton argument, which at paragraph [242] contends that “even if the sufficiently serious breach requirement was not met prior to the ECJ Judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Verkooijen</span>, it was surely met from the date of that judgment, namely 6 June 2000”. It was not until 2002 that a claim was first made to the Revenue that the corporation tax and ACT rules were incompatible with the Treaty. It is significant that there was no warning from the Commission, at any time, that the United Kingdom corporation and ACT rules were unlawful. To the contrary, and this is significant, the position of the Commission on the reference in the present case was, initially, that the United Kingdom’s dual system of exemption and credit complied with Community rules: see paragraph [48] of the Advocate General’s opinion. Lastly, the Claimants’ claim for repayment of tax paid under a mistake as to the compatibility of United Kingdom corporation tax and ACT rules with Community law implies that a large international corporation, with access to the very best legal advice, did not question their compatibility. It may be that the plea of sufficiently serious breach implies that the Revenue had access to more prescient legal advice than the Claimants. We do not find that self-evident.</p>

He stated that the decision of the Court “evidently provides support for the current claims that the group and consortium relief provisions are discriminatory”. But he ended “on a slightly more optimistic note”, stating that “where the transaction is a cross-border transaction it may still be possible to argue that the different treatment is justified by the need to ensure the cohesion of the United Kingdom tax system”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Soon afterwards, on 26 July 1994, Mr Michael of the International Division circulated a minute on policy. Its recipients included the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The advice warned of “problems ahead with the ECJ applying the principles of the Treaty to national tax provisions”. The action recommended was to note that “we are experiencing difficulty in an increasing number of instances in fending off arguments of Community law in the direct tax field (including in some of the more sensitive parts of the system)”, and to await further advice on the prospects of amending the Treaty of Rome and on domestic legislative changes in the meantime. The advice stated that there was “a growing risk of a major setback in Exchequer and political terms”. Much depended on future developments, including the expected judgment in Case C-279/93 <span style="font-style:italic">Finanzamt Köln-Altstadt v. Schumacker </span>[1995] ECR I-225. <span style="font-style:italic">Schumacker</span> was a case about personal, not corporate, taxation that was held to be discriminatory. It was not universally regarded as having clarified Community law, in view of the different result in Case C-336/96 <span style="font-style:italic">Gilly and another v. Directeur des Services Fiscaux du Bas-Rhin</span> [1998] ECR I-2793: see [1999] BTR 11. The concerns expressed in the advice were said to be shared by senior officials in France and Germany, and they had agreed to meet to discuss the issues. The advice recommended that the United Kingdom should make full use of its right to make observations to the Court in individual cases, and should encourage other Member States to do likewise. This recommendation was, of course, inconsistent with the view that the ECJ would undoubtedly hold that the United Kingdom tax system was incompatible with the Treaty. In addition, it recommended the United Kingdom should ensure that new provisions did not have obvious vulnerabilities and should use legislative opportunities to revisit existing legislation. The author stated that “we anticipate, and have been told to expect, further challenges elsewhere: we have no shortage of vulnerabilities”. </p>

We were told that the list has not been found. This minute was concerned with anti-avoidance legislation, which is not relevant to the present case unless it be suggested that it demonstrates that the Government was concerned to flout all Community rules. It does not: to the contrary, it evinces the view that there is plenty of scope for argument. The minute of 19 October 1994 advised a low-key presentation of thin-cap and other vulnerabilities at Budget time and afterwards.</p>

As a result the United Kingdom, and the rest of the EU, were facing widespread forced tax changes which threatened to undermine fundamental features of the direct tax system. While stating that "Virtually no part of the United Kingdom direct tax system is immune from challenge", it asserted that "in some areas, the risk is more theoretical than real, and not all of our vulnerabilities may be challenged". It advised that the only long-term solution was Treaty revision, which was already being discussed with the Germans and the French. It recommended that the seriousness of the issue should be played down, that cases in the courts should be strongly resisted, and that where necessary "Europroofing legislation" should be introduced to remove discrepancies between residents and non-residents.</p>

The use of the word “vulnerability” in these documents does not indicate an intention to breach Community law, but rather a concern as to the possibility that thin-cap and other unspecified United Kingdom tax rules might be held to be in breach. The advice that the Government should not highlight its concerns again does not demonstrate an intention to flout Community rules, but rather a desire not to provoke challenges that might be avoidable. In our judgment, they do not justify re-consideration of the Judge’s finding on sufficiently serious breach. </p>

The cause of action for repayment of monies paid under a mistake is a domestic remedy of wide application, which Community law does not require the Member States to provide, attended by a limitation period (i.e. section 32(1)(e) of the Limitation Act 1980) that goes beyond the requirements of Community law: see <span style="font-style:italic">Marks &amp; Spencer </span>at paragraph [35], in which the Court considered a 3-year limitation period to be reasonable.

On this basis, they contend that the limitation period applicable to their claim for damages is extended by that paragraph in the same way as is their claim for restitution of monies paid under a mistake. The Revenue submits that section 32(1)(c) is limited to claims of which mistake is an essential ingredient, in the case of common  law claims to claims for restitution for monies paid (or other assets transferred) under a mistake.</p>

It is right in construing this provision, of course, to consider the pre-existing law, and a number of previously decided cases were referred to,  ….

The Act is not a mere consolidating Act, but (as appears from its title) "an Act to consolidate with amendments certain enactments relating to the limitation of actions and arbitrations." Section 26 (<span class="Emphasis" style="font-style:normal;color:#000000">c</span>), which is the material provision, effects at least one amendment, because it overrides the decision in <span class="Emphasis" style="color:#000000">Baker v.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">In construing the section it is to be observed that fraud and mistake are dealt with quite differently. [His Lordship read section 26 and continued:] In regard to fraud, there is provision (a) where the action is based upon fraud - for instance, if an action is to recover damages for fraudulent misrepresentation - or (b), that very wide provision, where the right of action (which may be wholly independent of fraud) is concealed by the fraud of "any such person as aforesaid," that is to say, the defendant or a person claiming through him; but there is not in respect of mistake any provision similar to (b). The section does not apply to the case of a right of action which is concealed from the plaintiff by a mistake. What, then, is the meaning of provision (c)? The right of action is for relief from the consequences of a mistake. It seems to me that this wording is carefully chosen to indicate a class of actions where a mistake has been made which has had certain consequences and the plaintiff seeks to be relieved from those consequences. Familiar examples are, first, money paid in consequence of a mistake: in such a case the mistake is made, in consequence of the mistake the money is paid, and the action is to recover that money back. Secondly, there may be a contract entered into in consequence of a mistake, and the action is to obtain the rescission or, in some cases, the rectification of such a contract. thirdly, there may be an account settled in consequence of mistakes; if the mistakes are sufficiently serious there can be a reopening of the account.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">In my opinion, the mere operation of the Limitation Act unless excluded by this section is not a relevant consequence for the purpose of the section. If it were, then any concealment of a right of action from the plaintiff by a mistake would be intended to be covered by this section and the provision (b) in respect of fraud should have been applied to mistake also. Moreover, I think that it is right to say that if there would be no consequence except the operation of the Limitation Act, and the operation of the Limitation Act is excluded, then there is no consequence at all. In this case the mistake, in my judgment, has had no relevant consequence for the purposes of this section. As the statement of claim shows, the plaintiff's claim is to recover moneys due to her under a contract, and the cause of action is the same as if she had sued for each unpaid balance on its due date. By reason of the mistake she failed to realize that the balance was due to her and by that mistake the right of action was concealed from her. But that is not sufficient. Probably provision (c) applies only where the mistake is an essential ingredient of the cause of action, so that the statement of claim sets out, or should set out, the mistake and its consequences and pray for relief from those consequences. In this case the statement of claim sets out that sums became due and that only a smaller amount of £x has been paid, and the prayer is for an account to ascertain the sums still due and for payment of them when so ascertained. This action is not for relief from the consequences of a mistake within the meaning of section 26.</p>

As Mr. Wilson pointed out, it is odd that a person who has by mistake paid too much can take advantage of the section whereas a person who has by mistake received too little and made no protest cannot take advantage of the section. There may be other anomalies also. But, in my judgment, the carefully chosen wording of the provision (c) must have its proper effect notwithstanding any resulting anomalies. No doubt it was intended to be a narrow provision, because any wider provision would have opened too wide a door of escape from the general principle of limitation by six years' lapse of time, which is, of course, a reasonable and normally salutary principle, as Mr. Platts-Mills demonstrated by reference to this case, where the parties' memories have grown dim as to long past events and possibly some documents which might have been material have in the course of time perished.”</p>

In my view he was right not to do so. This is an action for breach of statutory duty. No doubt the failure to take proceedings in time was a result of the mistake by Mr and Mrs Malkin or someone acting on their behalf. That happens in nearly every case where there is a failure to take proceedings in the statutory period laid down in the Limitation Act. Section 32 of the Act is concerned with cases where the plaintiff can establish that the mistake was part of or an element of the cause of action. That does not arise in this case.

Moreover, we have not been shown any return actually filed by the Claimants.  We must therefore make an assumption that the assessments on them were excessive because among the information provided there was a mistake in the return.  This might occur for instance because the taxpaying companies had claimed credit only for foreign tax paid on foreign-source income, rather than an exemption for it.  Neither party has suggested that the assessment was not excessive “by reason of some mistake in the return”, but we have not been informed whether this is in fact what happened. We must also assume that we are concerned with claims where the Board and the Special Commissioners (now in general the Tax Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal) have statutory power to grant the relief sought.

The Judge implicitly addressed two of the questions that arise on section 33:  (1) whether it applies, and (2) if it applies, whether any provision of section 33 is incompatible with Community law. We are not invited to differ from either of his reasons:  reason (a) is concerned with the damages claims with which we are not concerned, and reason (b) is now conceded. However, there is a third question which the Judge did not address:  (3) whether any provision which is incompatible with Community law can be interpreted so as to be compatible with Community law.   The submissions at the hearing of the appeal were mainly directed to this question.  As we see it, the applicability of section 33 has to be resolved following this structured approach, and, if it is decided that section 33(1) applies, the court must consider question (3) as to fail to do so would be to fail to give effect to the will of Parliament as manifested by section 33(1).</p>

In our view it can, on the basis that there is a presumption that the United Kingdom intended to comply with its obligations under the EC Treaty and that on that basis subsection (2A)(a) is to be read as subject to the limitation that it applies only if and to the extent that the United Kingdom can consistently with its Treaty obligations impose such a restriction.

The effect of our interpretation of section 33 is consistent with this result since it means that claims for repayment on the grounds of mistake must also be brought in accordance with the statutory scheme for determining disputes with respect to other claims for the repayments of tax.

Under the partial imputation system a UK-resident company paid corporation tax on its profits but part of the corporation tax was imputed to non-corporate shareholders in the event of the profits being distributed to them. A UK-resident company was in principle obliged to pay ACT when it made a distribution (typically, by paying a dividend) to its shareholders, even if it had no corporation tax liability, and its UK-resident non-corporate shareholders (and certain entities such as pension funds) received a tax credit which could be set against their tax liability on the dividend or paid to them in cash if the credit exceeded their liability.</p>

A UK-resident company receiving a dividend from non-resident companies was subject to corporation tax on the dividend, subject to relief for foreign taxes paid.  The company did not receive a tax credit on such dividends which could be used to eliminate or reduce the ACT payable on distributions made to its shareholders.  The company’s ACT liability on such dividends could in principle be set against its liability to UK corporation tax.

The UK-resident company was in a position to pay its shareholders a larger dividend than would otherwise be the case because it was now entitled, under those arrangements, to reclaim the ACT it had to pay on that dividend.  Save for the delay between the payment of ACT and its reclaim, in this respect the UK-resident company was placed in a similar position to a company making a distribution to its shareholders out of dividends received from other UK-resident companies. However, shareholders of a company benefiting from these arrangements were not entitled to claim payment in respect of a tax credit. Those shareholders would have been able to claim payment in respect of a tax credit on dividends paid by UK-resident companies to which these arrangements did not relate.</p>

Where the UK-resident company either directly or indirectly controlled, or was a subsidiary of a company which directly or indirectly controlled, not less than 10% of the voting power of the company paying the dividend, the relief extended to the underlying foreign corporation tax on the profits out of which the dividends were paid, including underlying tax incurred by lower-tier companies (s 801). The foreign tax was creditable only up to the amount of the UK corporation tax liability on the particular income.

The total of the distribution and the tax credit was called franked investment income ('FII'): s 238(1). A UK-resident company receiving a distribution from a non-resident company was not entitled to a tax credit, and the income did not qualify as FII. Where a UK-resident company received FII, it was liable to pay ACT in relation to its own dividends only to the extent that those dividends and the ACT referable to them (i.e. its franked payments) exceeded the FII: s 241. Special arrangements applied under s 247 to dividends paid between UK-resident members of groups of companies. Provided that they satisfied certain minimum holding requirements—broadly speaking, the requirement was that more than 50% of the shares of the company paying the dividend had to be held by the parent—the UK-resident subsidiary and its UK-resident parent could make an election (called a group income election) under which dividends could be paid to the parent by the subsidiary without its having to account for ACT. Where a group income election was in force, the payment of dividends under it did not entitle the parent company to a tax credit, and the dividends were not included within its FII. The effect of a group income election was to postpone the payment of ACT until a distribution was made by the parent company. </p>

Since the UK operated a partial imputation system, so that the UK corporation tax rate exceeded the ACT set-off rate, the company always faced a marginal corporation tax liability on its profits. Moreover, where a company received credit for foreign tax, this reduced the amount of the corporation tax liability available for set-off of ACT: s 797(4). Unrelieved ACT, known as 'surplus ACT', could be carried back or forward for set-off against MCT of other periods: s 239.</span>

The Claimants have not made it clear on this appeal how, on the basis of their interpretation of the judgment of the ECJ in this case, there could be a mixed system if effective levels of tax had to be taken into account in the way the Claimants suggest and noticeably in his oral submissions Mr Farmer did not wish the ECJ to reach a view on whether Article 43 precluded mixed systems.   The Revenue takes the view that it would be necessary to move to an exemption system for a foreign-source dividend if effective levels have to be taken into account.  That indeed is the approach taken in the recent legislative changes.  If a mixed system cannot exist if account has to be taken of effective levels of tax, that is a good reason for reaching the conclusion that that is not what the ECJ held was required. </p>

The ECJ accepted that it could be so limited in certain circumstances, for example to prevent the same losses being utilised twice.

In paragraph [50] of its judgment, the ECJ set out the other requirement on which compliance with Community law depends, namely that the Member State must offset the amount of tax paid by the non-resident company making the distribution against the amount of tax for which the recipient company is liable, up to the limit of the latter amount.

The ECJ had already held that it was within the competence of the Member State to define the tax base (judgment, paragraph [47]), that is, the amount which is to be taxed.

The second half of paragraph [54] of the judgment draws attention to the fact that the company paying the dividend (“the paying company”) may be exempt from tax on the distribution not only in circumstances where it is otherwise liable to tax at the full rate but also in circumstances in which it is not liable to tax because there are reliefs available to it and it has no liability to tax, and in circumstances in which it pays tax at a rate (in the French text “<span style="font-style:italic">taux d’imposition</span>”) lower than that which in normally applies in United Kingdom.

The Claimants contend that this passage is a reference to the effective levels of taxation because that reflected their submissions to the Court.  However the critical words are those which follow the words “that is to say” so it may be that the Court was placing its interpretation on what the Claimants had said rather than intending to set out what the Claimants themselves had said.  The words “or pays corporation tax at a rate lower that that which normally applies in the United Kingdom” are capable of being a reference to the situation where some different nominal rate of tax applies.  There is then a direct link between paragraph [54] and paragraph [55], which discusses small companies relief, which is the only situation in which there are different rates of corporation tax under United Kingdom law.  Also it seems more likely that the ECJ would compare one nominal rate with another nominal rate than it would compare the actual tax burden on a taxpayer with a nominal rate.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">If this is right, it would follow (i) that there is no reference at all to effective rates of tax in paragraphs [49] to [57] of the judgment of the ECJ, other than the statement of the Claimants’ argument in paragraph [54], and (ii) that the only situations that the ECJ expressly contemplates as a result of reliefs is that there will be either no liability to tax or a different nominal rate. This is of course a point that favours the Claimants.  It means that their argument has not been specifically addressed.  It is not suggested that the expression “<span style="font-style:italic">niveaux d’imposition</span>” (used, as the Judge noted, in the French text of paragraph [56]) is a term of art, or that it has an accepted meaning of “effective rates”.  Arden and Stanley Burnton LJJ consider that, in its context, it refers to different nominal tax rates or different tax burdens as a result of differences in the tax base, not to the fact that the effective rates are different from the nominal rate as a result of the specific circumstances of a particular taxpayer.  </p>

In the latter, it means the difference in the nominal rates.  In the former it means the difference between the nil rate in effect applied by virtue of the exemption given to resident taxpayers and effective rate which the non-resident taxpayer pays tax in his country of residence.  </p>

Arden and Stanley Burnton LJJ consider that there is no warrant for this.  As a matter of logic, the second matter only arises if and to the extent that the national courts find that the tax rates are not the same. The different levels of taxation here referred to are different nominal rates of tax applying to United Kingdom-resident taxpayers.</p>

The Revenue’s contention that the only requirements are those specified in paragraphs [49] and [50], and that, by necessary implication, the ECJ at one and the same time in those paragraphs disposed of and decided against the Claimants’ “effective rate” argument is wrong.  Paragraphs [51] and [52] are purely illustrative.  Paragraph [53] does not add to the analysis, for present purposes.  At paragraph [54], however, the ECJ is plainly moving to a new point raised by the Claimants:  this is clear from the words “none the less” at the beginning of the paragraph.  This paragraph is addressing for the first time, and directly, the “effective rate” argument, which was central to the Claimants’ case and was addressed and decided in their favour by the Advocate General.  It is expressly addressing the situation where, by virtue of reliefs available to the distributing company, the latter has no liability to tax or pays corporation tax at a rate lower than the nominal rate of tax.  Both the French text (“taux nominal”) and the general sense of the paragraph confirm that view.  It also reflects remarkably closely the language and sense of paragraph [8] of the Claimants’ written observations.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The critical question, then, is to find the ECJ’s answer to that argument of the Claimants.  It can only be found in paragraphs [55] and [56] of the ECJ’s judgment.  The natural sense of those paragraphs is that (1) the United Kingdom government does not contest the contention of the Claimants’ set out in paragraph [54] of the ECJ’s judgment, but (2) the United Kingdom government argues that the difference between the effective rates applicable to a paying company and to the receiving company, or, to the same effect, the difference between nominal and effective rates, occurs only in exceptional circumstances, which do not arise in the main proceedings.  This interpretation is borne out particularly by the following factors.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First, the verification (“verifier” in the French version) by the national court which is required under paragraph [56] concerns the effect on the levels of taxation of “a change to the tax base as a result of certain exceptional reliefs”.  The natural sense of those words is that what is being referred to is a change in the effective rate of tax as a result of the application of reliefs to the company’s profits, gains or income for tax purposes.  The words “reliefs” there must bear the same meaning as “reliefs” in paragraph [54], since paragraphs [55] and [56] are addressing the Claimants’ point articulated in paragraph [54].</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, the final part of paragraph [55], which is introduced with the words “which argues, however that”, is a qualification of the first part of the paragraph.  The first part records, correctly, that the United Kingdom government did not dispute that, as a result of reliefs, the effective rate of tax might be less than the nominal rate of tax.  The second part of paragraph [55] records, incorrectly, that such a situation would only arise in exceptional circumstances which did not arise in the main proceedings.  The wording mirrors closely, and appears to have been derived from, footnote 47 to paragraph [46] in the United Kingdom government’s written observations.  If that is correct, it shows that the ECJ misunderstood the nature of “small companies” relief mentioned in that footnote.  That is perfectly feasible in view of the rather ambiguous wording of paragraph [46] in the United Kingdom government’s written observations which could equally well be referring to either nominal or effective rates of tax. </p>

Paragraph [47] shows that the ECJ had in mind a distinction between the “tax base” (“l’assiette imposable” in the French version) and the “tax rate”, and that the tax base is that to which the tax rate applies.  Small companies relief has nothing whatever to do with the tax base.  It is merely a different nominal rate of tax.</p>

In any event, the point carries little weight in the light of two factors.  First, on any footing, that is to say even on the Revenue’s case, paragraphs [55] and [56] operate as a further (but unexpressed) proviso to the first part of paragraph [57].

The mistake was limited to what the ECJ wrongly understood to be the factual contention of the United Kingdom government that nominal and effective rates of United Kingdom corporation tax differ only in highly exceptional circumstances which do not arise in the main proceedings.  That mistake was the reason for the reservation to the national court of a decision on that question of fact in paragraph [56] of the ECJ’s judgment, but it did not affect the decision of the ECJ on the point of principle. </p>
