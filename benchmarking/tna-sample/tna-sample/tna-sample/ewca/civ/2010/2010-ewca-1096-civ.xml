	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mesothelioma is a tragic and fatal disease, so far as is known (but the unknown is never far away in this context) always caused by exposure to asbestos. It manifests itself as a cancer of the mesothelium, a protective lining that covers most of the body’s internal organs, but most commonly as a cancer of the pleura, that is to say the linings of the lung. It is unusual in having an extremely long period of gestation, which can be in excess of forty years between exposure to asbestos and manifestation. By the time it has become symptomatic, generally through shortness of breath, the patient does not have long to live, an average of some fourteen months.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This appeal concerns the liability, under contract, of insurers who have promised to indemnify employers against their liability to their employees. The specific context is the employer’s liability for mesothelioma. In other words this appeal is about the nature and extent of the cover granted by employers’ liability insurance so far as the employer insured is responsible for his employee’s mesothelioma. In particular, this appeal asks the question as to what has to happen in any particular policy year to make the insurer on risk during that year liable to respond and so to indemnify the employer insured. Is it the tortious exposure to asbestos which has caused the mesothelioma that must occur in that policy year? Or is it the onset of mesothelioma itself which must occur in that policy year? Thus this appeal is principally about issues of construction of insurance policies, but, as will be seen, it requires an understanding of the employer’s liability in tort for injury caused to his employee.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is important to emphasise that on the current understanding of the disease, it is not present during most of that period of up to four decades. The body’s defence mechanisms are extremely efficient in protecting us, and even those who have been most exposed by reason of their occupations, from the potentially harmful effects of the inhalation of asbestos fibres. Only when all those defences have failed may a mutated cell become and remain cancerous and then proceed by exponential growth into the disease called mesothelioma. Even a cancerous mutation may remain dormant for years before it develops into the disease. Or the mutation may actually be reversed by the body’s defences, so that the disease never develops. Only a few years ago, the court’s view of the expert medical evidence about the onset of mesothelioma was that the disease probably did not occur until approximately ten years before diagnosability (no practical distinction being drawn between diagnosability and manifestation): see <span style="font-style:italic">Bolton Metropolitan Borough Council v. Municipal Mutual Insurance Ltd </span>[2006] EWCA Civ 50, [2006] 1 WLR 1492 (“<span style="font-style:italic">Bolton</span>”). In the present case, the judge’s view of the more developed expert evidence before him was that that period was closer to only five years before diagnosability. If that is right, then a person exposed to asbestos may live for thirty-five years or thereabouts without passing to a stage at which the court would say that mesothelioma had begun.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Moreover, despite a clear causal connection between the occupational exposure to asbestos and the onset of mesothelioma, it is not possible to say that all those who have been so exposed to asbestos will develop mesothelioma. The overall figure is that only some 3% of such people will go on to develop the disease. That is the figure which the judge below repeatedly cited. To some extent it may mask higher percentages among those most seriously exposed, and it may also fail to take into account the fact that among the cohort of such workers who have been occupationally exposed to asbestos, many who might have gone on to develop mesothelioma died at an earlier time from the effects of the more common disease of asbestosis, that is a fibrosis of the lungs. Nevertheless, it remains the fact that only a small percentage of exposed workmen go on to suffer from mesothelioma. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Unlike asbestosis, mesothelioma is not a dose-related disease. Increased exposure to asbestos does not make the disease worse, it only increases the risk of developing it. However, asbestosis shares with mesothelioma a latency period during which the disease’s onset is delayed, and thereafter remains latent. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The danger of inhaling dust at work has been known about for a considerable time. The classic work on asbestosis in this country lies in the 1930 <span style="font-style:italic">Report on Effects of Asbestos Dust on the Lungs</span> by <span style="font-style:italic">Merewether and Price</span>, respectively a medical and engineering inspector of factories. The almost immediate results were the <span style="font-style:italic">Workmen’s Compensation (Silicosis and Asbestosis) Act 1930 </span>and the <span style="font-style:italic">Asbestos Industry (Asbestosis) Scheme 1931</span>. Mesothelioma was not then known about, but in 1965 came the leading publication by <span style="font-style:italic">Newhouse and Thompson </span>entitled <span style="font-style:italic">Mesothelioma of pleura and peritoneum following exposure to asbestos in the London area</span>, shortly followed by an exposé in the Sunday Times entitled “<span style="font-style:italic">Scientists track down killer dust disease</span>”. In the following year, 1966, mesothelioma became a prescribed disease (see the <span style="font-style:italic">National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) (Prescribed Diseases) Amendment Regulations 1966)</span>. However, cases of mesothelioma were then exceptional. The earliest claim known about made on any insurer before the court was in 1967 (that was in respect of a man who had died of mesothelioma in 1966 after working for the insured employer from 1936 to 1962). On the whole, however, claims under employers’ liability policies were not reaching insurers in any quantity until the 1980s. By the late 1990s, however, it had become impossible to obtain employee insurance for historical liability for mesothelioma. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Over the course of the twentieth century successive enactments regulating the conduct of industry in general and the asbestos manufacturing or using industries in particular had gone far to making employment in an environment where exposure to asbestos took place much safer than it had previously been. Thus the historical timeline during which employers may have acted negligently in causing their employees to suffer asbestos exposure which has led or may yet still lead on to mesothelioma is generally in the past, and perhaps many decades in the past. However, because of the long time-lag between exposure and the onset of the disease, the incidence of mesothelioma is still increasing and is expected to go on increasing for a few years yet, before reaching its peak and then declining. If therefore an employer has obtained insurance which covers his historical liability for causing mesothelioma, then, subject to the solvency of his insurer, he is covered for claims yet to be made. If, however, his cover has been not on a causation basis, but only on a disease occurring basis, then, even if the employer is still in business, which in many cases he is not, he would be unable, and for some years past has been unable, to obtain current insurance on a disease occurring basis to cover him now for his historical negligence.     </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Moreover, the health difficulties which working with asbestos has caused and the huge liabilities which asbestos-using industry has over the last half century or so incurred have meant that many firms, even once great companies, are no longer in business, or survive only in a state of insolvency. This has meant that there are, unfortunately, mesothelioma claimants and their dependants who are unable to obtain compensation for injury and damage which their employment has brought upon them. In such circumstances, the existence of employers’ liability insurance may be of great importance, since, unless the insurer has also gone out of business or become insolvent, it may provide security for a claim against the defunct or bankrupt employer. Indeed, it has been compulsory for employers to insure against their liability for personal injury to their employees since 1 January 1972, pursuant to the <span style="font-style:italic">Employers’ Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969</span>. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the general disaster which asbestos related disease has brought for all involved, and of course most of all for those who suffer from that disease and their families, an additional misfortune has arisen out of the possibility that the security which employers’ liability insurance was thought to provide might not respond on its own wording if, as the appellant insurers involved in these proceedings submit, they are only responsible to indemnify their employer insureds where mesothelioma has been sustained (in the sense of occurring or being suffered in fact) during the policy years in question. Since those policy years end, so far as concerns any of those insurers, at the latest in 1992, all those mesothelioma sufferers the onset of whose disease has occurred after 1992, or may still lie in the future, and whose employers have been insured with one or other of the appellant insurers who dispute liability in these proceedings, may, if those insurers are correct in their submissions, find that they (or their dependants) lack the security of their employers’ insurance. The judge described this as a “black hole”. It arises if (1) the employer is or would be liable to compensate the mesothelioma victim or his or her family; (2) the employer no longer exists or is no longer solvent; and (3) there is no historic employers’ liability insurance which would respond to indemnify the employer in question.</p>

Those policies are not all in the same wording, and ultimately each will have to be considered separately. However they all share, at any rate arguably, a similar feature in that they are expressed to operate only where injury or disease is “sustained” (and sometimes the policies speak separately of “injury sustained” and “disease contracted”) during the policy year in question. Such policy wording can be contrasted with a commoner form of wording (the so-called “tariff” wording) which plainly makes the <span style="font-style:italic">causation</span> of the injury or disease, rather than its <span style="font-style:italic">occurrence</span>, the matter which, if it falls within the policy period, triggers, where an employer is legally liable to the employee for the injury or disease in question, a response under the policy. The tariff wording can be described as a <span style="font-style:italic">causation</span> wording, while the policy wording in issue in the present litigation can be described as a <span style="font-style:italic">sustained</span> wording. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus, to put the matter in terms of mesothelioma, the essential question which arises on this appeal is whether it is the time or occurrence of the <span style="font-style:italic">cause</span> of that disease, in the form of the inhalation of asbestos dust, which serves to identify a particular policy year and thus the policy in question; or whether it is the time or occurrence of the <span style="font-style:italic">onset</span> of the disease, which performs that function. The appellant insurers say that to speak of <span style="font-style:italic">sustaining </span>or <span style="font-style:italic">contracting </span>a disease is to refer to the time of its onset or occurrence, when the employee suffers it or an injury inherent in it. The respondents say, on the contrary, that to speak of the time of sustaining or contracting a disease is to refer to the time of its cause. The judge, Burton J, agreed with the latter submission, and gave judgment in favour of the respondents. The judge usefully described the competing views as to the time of the relevant event as an argument between <span style="font-style:italic">date of inhalation </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">date of tumour</span>. On his understanding of the sustained wording, however, it had the same effect as the causation wording, and equally looked to the date of inhalation. Since the issue in the case is whether the sustained wording has the same effect as the causation wording, it is helpful to have a means of describing the sustained wording by a phrase which clarifies rather than obscures the issue: and so I will also adopt the expedient of describing a policy wording which has the effect which the insurers would give to the sustained wording as wording on a date of tumour basis, even if that over-emphasises the present context of mesothelioma.  </p>

On the appellant insurers’ construction of their wording, the policy, if any, which would answer to indemnify E against his liability to W or his dependants would be the 1990 policy.

So, where E employs W throughout W’s working life, and was employing him in 1950 and still in 1990, and was insured throughout with one insurer and the same wording, it would not matter which policy was the effective one. If, however, E had ceased business, whether through insolvency or otherwise, and therefore no longer had a policy in 1990, or had changed insurers and thus insurance wording between 1950 and 1990, or even if E had stayed with the same insurer but the policy language had changed from a causation wording to a sustained wording, then there would be room for a gap in cover on the appellant insurers’ construction, albeit not on the respondents’ construction. Moreover, where the insurers had changed even if the wording had not, there would still be a need to identify the relevant policy year and thus the relevant insurer, and there could be room for dispute. </p>

Since he can only be liable on a causation basis, so, whenever his negligence or breach of statutory duty in year 1 has given rise to loss or damage so as to complete a valid cause of action against him by an employee, he can obtain indemnity from his EL insurer under the policy of the year when his activities put in train the liability in issue. Nothing (except the failure of the insurer itself) can take that security away from him (or his employees). If, however, the year 1 policy is taken out on a basis that only indemnifies an employer if there is an onset of disease in that year, he and if his business fails his employees are prejudiced in the context of a disease with a long period of latency unless in every succeeding year he continues to insure, if he can, on the same basis. The passing of the years has shown that it is no longer possible to insure on a sustained wording basis.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The insurers however submit that the virtue of any particular wording depends on the circumstances. Causation wording in a current policy will not cover an employer for his historic negligence, whereas wording on a date of tumour basis will. If therefore in my example the 1950 policy was not a year 1 policy but, say, a year 40 policy (where E was in his fortieth year in business), then a 1950 policy on a causation basis would not cover him for a workman who had inhaled asbestos in 1911 and had developed a tumour in 1950, but a 1950 policy on a date of tumour basis (which the insurers say is provided by the sustained wording) would. To bring the point up to date: a causation wording in the policy year 2000, by which date such are the precautions now taken in working with asbestos that liability for causing injury by way of asbestos disease in breach of duty is comparatively rare, will not give an employer nearly as much protection as 2000 year wording on a date of tumour basis. The counter-observation might be made, however, that in 2000 the causation wording retains all of its essential virtue so far as breach of duty in the employer’s current operations are concerned, while insurance on a date of tumour basis is unobtainable. No doubt, depending on the particular state either of knowledge of the dangers of mesothelioma, or of the EL insurance market, at any one time, some variation of these submissions could be made.  </p>

For five years, between 1993 and 1998, its policies continued with the sustained wording which MMI had used. Thereafter it adopted causation wording. Zurich is anxious in these proceedings to establish that for the five policy years 1993-1998 in which it issued policies with sustained wording, those policies should be given the same effect as policies with causation wording. The driving force of that submission is the fact that as of that late date Zurich’s potential liability as an insurer on a causation wording basis would be far less than its potential liability as an insurer on a date of tumour basis. In 1993-1998 the incidence of mesothelioma was starting to build towards its present peak years, but arising out of exposure and inhalation many decades before, when Zurich was not involved in the issue of such policies. Correspondingly, in 1993-1998 the negligent exposure of employees to asbestos dust in breach of duty is likely to have been far less than in earlier years. Hence Zurich’s interest in joining force with the ranks of the claimants in these proceedings rather than with the ranks of the defendant and now appellant insurers.</p>

That expression is satisfactory enough as a synonym for the mesothelioma tumour, but is dangerous if used by itself to answer the question whether there can be any injury at a time before the growth of the tumour. “Trigger” itself is a somewhat unsatisfactory word, because, as the judge observed, the primary trigger of EL insurance is the employer’s liability. What is being referred to as a trigger is therefore that element (within the total history of events which must take place in order to render an employer ultimately liable) which has to occur in a policy year in order to trigger the insurer’s potential liability to indemnify its insured <span style="font-style:italic">of that year</span>.

The six actions embrace a consideration of nine specimen policy wordings emerging from four insurers over a period from the late 1940s to 1992. Those specimen wordings were collected by the judge in an Annex to his judgment, which I gratefully reproduce as part of Annex I to this judgment, although I have somewhat reset the order in which I present those wordings. It will also be convenient to set out the terms of the relevant policies in the body of this judgment. </p>

I have already briefly introduced Excess and MMI in the previous section. The judge defined these four insurers as the “defendants” on the basis that they were united in resisting claims made against them by mesothelioma claimants and their employers, and in asserting the date of tumour as the relevant trigger date. In fact one of them, MMI, was formally the claimant in its action (“Lead Case 6”) whereby it sought relief by way of declarations against both Zurich and ten representative insureds, all local authorities. I will refer to the four appellant insurers collectively as the “appellant insurers” or the “insurers”. </p>

By the late 1980s it provided all the EL and public liability (PL) insurance of 86% of local authorities. In 1992, however, it ceased to underwrite new insurance business or to renew business already written (as from 30 September 1992) and by an agreement dated 9 March 1993 transferred its assets and ongoing business, but not its existing liabilities, to Zurich for a sum which included a commission on business renewed by Zurich up to a maximum of £60 million. MMI and Zurich also agreed that Zurich would manage the run-off of MMI’s existing business for a fee of £16 million (netted against the £60 million). Zurich thus inherited the goodwill of MMI’s erstwhile business, but not its existing liabilities. The great majority of MMI’s previous insureds transferred their future insurance business to Zurich, which, as I have mentioned above, retained for itself MMI’s current 1992 sustained wording until 1998, when it adopted causation wording. In January 1994 MMI entered a scheme of arrangement. In May 2005 at trial and in February 2006 in this court MMI lost the PL insurance case of <span style="font-style:italic">Bolton</span>.

In September 2006 judgment was entered against Bates in favour of an ex-employee, Mr Dahele, in the sum of £543,900.50, which has been satisfied by Bates in full. Mr Dahele was employed by Bates and exposed to asbestos between 1975 and 1977, was diagnosed with mesothelioma in November 2005 and died in about May 2007, following judgment.

Following chest symptoms in 1990, the worker was diagnosed with mesothelioma in January 1991, and died in November 1991. The council settled with the worker’s widow for £80,000 and sought to recover an indemnity from MMI. On the medical evidence, the first malignant cell had developed, as a result of the presence of asbestos fibre in the lungs, in 1980 (applying a ten-year rule for the development of the mesothelioma from its first malignancy to diagnosability). From 1980 MMI had insured the council on the basis of <span style="font-style:italic">injury or illness occurring</span> wording (“accidental bodily injury or illness…when such injury illness loss or damage occurs during the currency of the policy”).

Their fibres have different bio-persistence: 20 years after exposure to fibres about half the inhaled amosite fibres remain in the body, a smaller proportion of the crocidolite fibres remains and, relatively, few chrysotile fibres remain. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">8 The human body is composed of cells of various types. Of the fibres which reach the lungs many are engulfed by macrophages (scavenger cells). The macrophages may then be expelled by the mucosiliary process or may die within the lungs. All cells can and do die for various reasons, but cells are in communication with each other and the death of one can cause another to divide so, with some exceptions such as men losing their hair with age, the number of cells remains approximately the same throughout a person's life. When macrophages die in the lungs they release various chemicals, some of which attract neutrophils, another type of cell, which can engulf fibres. A different mechanism which destroys fibres in the lungs is that they are dissolved in tissue fluids. Another mechanism, by which the body protects itself, is that some fibres become coated by proteinaceous material containing iron which, it is believed, renders them less likely to produce fibrosis.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">9 The division of cells in human tissue is important for understanding how mesothelioma occurs. Each cell in the body contains all the genetic information necessary for the construction and functioning of the entire body. This information is contained in the form of DNA, a molecule consisting of two intertwining strands. The different structure and function of the various types of cell in the body occurs because in each cell only some of the genes contained in the DNA are active and in different cells different genes are active. The coded information in a DNA molecule is in the form of about 3,000,000,000 “base pairs”. Each pair consists of two collections of atoms called nucleotides. There is one half of each pair in each of the two intertwining strands. When cell division occurs the strands unravel and two “daughter” double helices are created. Normally the daughters are identical with each other but sometimes they are not. Dr Rudd uses the word “mutation” for an imperfect copy. This word “mutation” thus means a thing - a cell - and not a process, and is not a synonym of “change”; for change Dr Rudd uses the term “generic alteration”. I shall adopt this usage. The word “mutation” does not have any derogatory connotations. A mutation is different from, but not necessarily worse than, the cell from which it is derived or otherwise undesirable. The body contains what can be described as a “repair mechanism” which sometimes corrects the discrepancy between a daughter and its parent. This repair mechanism is vital to normal health, and people whose repair system lacks some components (a very rare condition) will die early, often of cancer. Sometimes, however, a perfectly normal repair and correction mechanism fails to correct a mutation. Such failure can lead to any of three possibilities. First, the mutation may be unable to survive and die. Secondly it may be better fitted for its purpose than the cell from which it is derived, and this is the cause of evolution. As Dr Moore-Gillon put it “Without the normal process of imperfect copying, mankind (and indeed all other species) would not have emerged”.</p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">10 It is the third possibility with which this case is concerned. A mutation which does not die, which is not repaired and which does not perform its purpose better than the cell from which it was derived may itself divide, and the “daughter” cells or (to continue the parental analogy) the grand-daughter or more distant descendants may in turn die, be repaired or be mutations from the cell from which they are derived. Eventually there may be a mutation which is malignant, i e a cell which divides in an uncontrolled manner, as opposed to maintaining the normal balance between cells dying and cells dividing. It normally takes a “heredity” of six or seven genetic alterations before a malignant cell occurs. The body has “natural killer” cells which, as their name indicates, can target and destroy mutations, possibly even after they have become malignant. A tumour is a growth consisting of a number of cells dividing in that uncontrolled manner. Mesothelioma is a tumour in the pleura. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">11 Asbestos fibres in the pleura increase the likelihood of genetic mutation. It is now thought likely that, if there is a series of genetic alterations which ends with a malignant cell in the pleura, fibres will have acted in causing several of those genetic alterations, rather than just one genetic alteration. However the final genetic alteration which results in a malignant cell is not necessarily caused by fibres directly. Fibres may also inhibit the activity of natural killer cells. Pre-cancerous genetic alterations in cells do not give rise to any symptoms or signs. They cannot be detected by any routine clinical or radiological examination. It would be possible to detect them by examining in a laboratory tissue taken from a part of the body containing cells which have become genetically modified, but the exercise would be pointless because pre-cancerous genetic alterations do not necessarily or even usually lead to mesothelioma.</p>

In the present case it is thought that malignancy did not occur until 1980 and a further ten years elapsed before Mr Green became symptomatic. Since MMI were on cover after 1979, there is no distinction for the purposes of this appeal between the onset of malignancy and the onset of symptoms or, indeed, between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis of the disease.”</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">“ 14 MMI's second argument focused on the words “accidental injury”; Mr Palmer submitted, in reliance on the judge's findings in relation to the aetiology of mesothelioma, that accidental injury occurred either on inhalation of asbestos fibres or, perhaps, on the first bodily reaction to such inhalation, not at the unascertainable moment when a malignant tumour first appeared, still less when Mr Green first felt symptoms of breathlessness and chest pain and less still when mesothelioma was itself diagnosed. Mr Palmer categorised “accidental injury”, for the purposes of the policy, as the “insult” to a person's bodily integrity which occurred, effectively on first being exposed to asbestos fibres. In the course of oral submissions Mr Palmer made clear that, although he presented theoretically separate arguments as to exposure itself and early bodily reactions, he did not draw any substantial chronological difference between them. He relied on the miniscule changes which, as described above, preceded the genetic changes which gave rise, at a later date, to the existence of cancerous cells; in other words injury occurred at the point when the body's natural defence mechanisms were operating to destroy or neutralise the fibres as soon as they were inhaled. This was the time when, according to MMI, accidental injury occurred.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">15 This argument is, in my judgment, inconsistent both with principle and authority. It is inconsistent with principle because the contract between the parties is an agreement to indemnify against liability. It cannot be right that, at the stage of initial exposure or initial bodily reaction to such exposure, there could be a liability on the part of Bolton in respect of which they could require to be indemnified under any public liability insurance policy. Mr Green could not have sued for personal injury at that stage because he had suffered no injury at that stage. The indemnity which Bolton are seeking is an indemnity against their liability for their share in the sum of £160,000 which was ultimately paid to Mrs Green. Mr Green could not conceivably have recovered £160,000 (or £80,000 as Bolton's portion was ultimately agreed to be) in the early 1960s when he was first exposed to asbestos and his body was, at that time, successfully dealing with the fibres which he was inhaling. He was at that stage a well man, not suffering from any injury at all.</p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Keenen v Miller Insulation and Engineering Ltd </span>(unreported) 8 December 1987 Mr Piers Ashworth QC, sitting as a deputy judge of the High Court, held that a claimant's cause of action for lung fibrosis did not arise at the time he was exposed to asbestos between August 1952 and May 1953 because at that stage he had not suffered physical injury by May 1953. Basing himself on the evidence of Dr Rudd he held that for a long time after exposure the defence mechanisms of the body held their own and only became exhausted after a period of equilibrium which lasted well after 4 June 1954, the relevant date for limitation. Likewise McCullough J in <span style="font-style:italic">Guidera v NEI Projects (India) Ltd </span>(unreported) 17 November 1988 held that a claimant who was exposed to asbestos in 1952 and 1953 and was later diagnosed with asbestosis had suffered no injury by 4 June 1954 because physical injury would not occur for at least five (and more likely 10 to 20) years after exposure. He said that destruction of cells by macrophages or neurophils was not damage or injury for the purpose of creating a cause of action since destruction of cells in this way was a natural incident of daily life. He held that this was so even on the basis that the claimant would, inevitably, suffer from asbestosis once exposure had begun. Similarly McNeill J held in <span style="font-style:italic">McCaul v Elias Wild</span> (unreported) 14 September 1989 that a claimant who suffered pleural thickening from inhalation of asbestos fibres in 1943–1950 suffered no actionable injury until about 1985, when he first experienced breathlessness. He expressly followed Keenen's case, acknowledging the wide and well-recognised experience of the deputy judge in that case in the field of industrial disease. </p>

CEGB had provided a contractual indemnity in respect of damage or injury occurring before building works were taken over by a client in 1960. The question was whether a workman who died from mesothelioma well after 1960 but was exposed during the building work before 1960 had suffered damage or injury before 1960. Sir Haydn Tudor Evans held that the evidence did not establish even that minimal microscopic changes had occurred before 1960 and that the damage or injury occurred many years after the deceased had finished working. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">18 Although it can be said that all these cases depended on the medical evidence given to the court, the evidence (often given by Dr Rudd) was to much the same effect as that summarised in this judgment. These cases have established a pattern at first instance to the effect that actionable injury does not occur on exposure or on initial bodily changes happening at that time but only at a much later date; whether that is when a malignant tumour is first created or when identifiable symptoms first occur does not matter for the purposes of this case. I would hold that these earlier cases were correctly decided and that injury cannot be equated to the “insult” received by the body when exposure first occurs.</p>

But the proximity of the word “accidental” to “bodily injury” does not mean that both the accident and the injury have to be within the currency of the policy. It is enough if the injury (properly understood) occurs within the currency of the policy and that it be caused accidentally, as, from the point of view of both Mr Green and Bolton, it undoubtedly was”.</p>

This was recognised already in <span style="font-style:italic">Fairchild </span>(see Lord Bingham at para 7; and Lord Rodger at para 122, where the latter observed: “the greater the number of asbestos fibres taken into the body, the greater are the chances that one of them will trigger a malignant transformation”). The second matter is that once the mesothelioma tumour is present and assured of growth (ie has passed the stage where a malignant mutation may die off), further asbestos exposure and indeed further asbestos fibres in the body can make no difference and are not causative. </p>

Subject to that caution, the judge made the following findings about the disease. He described asbestos fibre as a “complete carcinogen”, ie no other agent or co-agent is required to cause the ultimate malignancy (at para 130). Unlike a normal cancer of spherical or similar shape which sooner or later can be seen on a scan or x-ray, the mesothelioma tumour grows along the surface of the lungs rather like a fungus and is thus practically undetectable, and only becomes diagnosable when the symptoms of impaired breathing bring it to the patient’s and his doctor’s attention. As the details of actions 1-3 illustrate, that is only shortly before death. The average time between manifestation/diagnosis and death is some fourteen months.</p>

Cell division, or mitosis, by which the cell divides, duplicates its chromosomes and passes on a complete set to each of its “daughters”, is the norm; but there can be mutations – again Dr Rudd told us that incorrect copying can take place in one in a million cell divisions and thus possibly 5,000 times per day in the human body, or every 17 seconds. The body’s repair mechanisms are quick to correct and abort the mutations, but even if there are mutations there are four possible consequences. The incorrect copy may be unable to survive, and die; the mutation can make no difference; the mutation can positively improve the cell – hence evolution; or the mutated cell can survive and can itself divide, passing on the genetic alterations, eventually after many generations and with further mutations creating a malignant cell.”</p>

The characteristics of a malignant cell are (i) self sufficiency of growth signals (ii) insensitivity to growth-inhibitory signals (iii) evasion of programmed cell death (apoptosis) (iv) limitless replicative potential (v) the ability to invade tissues and to metastasise ie to transfer to other parts of the body (vi) the availability of its own blood supply – obtained by a process which is called <span style="font-style:italic">angiogenesis</span>…</p>

It appears to be common ground, at any rate so far as the biochemists are concerned, that such cell or cells at this stage are still at risk from natural killer cells, although they apparently develop a method of switching off the signals which summon the natural killer cells or put them on notice. There is also, despite the characteristic of limitless replication, the possibility or probability, of periods of dormancy. Professor Phillips points out that the norm of forty years from exposure to diagnosability suggests either that the mutation period lasts a long time or that there are periods of tumour dormancy (or both).”</p>

Nevertheless, at section XIX of his judgment (paras 244ff) he offered his opinion that a date five years before diagnosability should be adopted as a prima facie rule. His reasons were that (i) <span style="font-style:italic">Bolton’s </span>ten year rule took matters back to the first malignant cell (the “full house plus”), but there was no injury or disease at that stage, for there was still the possibility of dormancy and reversal; (ii) the additional evidence of the biochemists emphasised the importance of angiogenesis, and it was this which made the continued growth of the tumour, and death, inevitable; (iii) although the incidence of angiogenesis was somewhat speculative, and could occur variously at times ranging between tumour sizes of 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">6</span> and 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">9</span> cells, nevertheless a date of injury/disease of five years before diagnosability should be adopted because by then the tumour would be of a size (of 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">6</span> cells) which would no longer be at risk (as long as angiogenesis occurred) of being reversed, and angiogenesis itself would be likely to occur at about the same time.

This is because the subject matter of EL insurance is the promise of an indemnity for the employer’s liability to his employees in the matter of personal injury. In earlier years, possibly because of the inadequacies of the common law (eg because of now defunct rules relating to common employment or contributory negligence), the dominant regime in the context of employer’s liability was one of no-fault compensation to be found in the Workmen’s Compensation Acts (the “WCA”, as to which, see below). It is worth remembering that <span style="font-style:italic">Donoghue v. Stevenson </span>[1932] AC 562 was decided less than 80 years ago. In 1948, however, the WCA regime was swept away in favour of reliance on a combination of common law (and statutory duty) and of national insurance (see the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act 1946). Moreover, the defences of common employment and contributory negligence were abolished by the <span style="font-style:italic">Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945 </span>and by the <span style="font-style:italic">Law Reform (Personal Injuries) Act 1948 </span>respectively.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Essential features of the common law are that it requires not only (i) negligence on the part of a defendant, for present purposes an employer, but also (ii) damage suffered on the part of a claimant, for present purposes an employee, and (iii) the nexus of causation between negligence and damage. The negligence has to cause the damage. In most cases of employers’ liability the negligence, which is the cause, and the damage, which is the effect, occur at almost the same time, in the form of personal injury arising out of what is commonly called an “accident”. The employee suffers injury there and then. There was (some, albeit off-the cuff) evidence at trial that 99.9% of employer liability cases are of this kind. For these purposes a question might arise as to what amounts to “injury” causing compensable or actionable damage, but the problems are unlikely to be particularly difficult, at any rate where physical injury in a typical case of accident is concerned. The matter was considered in <span style="font-style:italic">Cartledge v. E Jopling &amp; Sons Ltd </span>[1963] AC 758, where the House of Lords held that a physical condition caused by a negligent act or omission had to reach a certain threshold “beyond the minimal” in order for it to constitute an injury for which damages in tort could be claimed. Lord Reid spoke of “personal injury beyond what can be regarded as negligible” (at 772), Lord Evershed spoke of “real damage as distinct from purely minimal damage” (at 774), and Lord Pearce (with whom the other members of the House agreed) referred to “material damage by any physical changes in his body” and said that “in borderline cases it is a question of degree” (at 779). Thus a trifling scratch, without any untoward consequences, will not be actionable.     </p>

There was no doubt that the plaintiff suffered from pneumoconiosis, but the question was whether any breach of statutory duty by his employer had caused his disease. He worked at two stations in his employment, both of which produced the noxious dust but at only one of which was his employer in breach. Had that breach of duty, ie the dust inhalation which it had given rise to, caused his injury or disease? The House of Lords, making its own assessment of the facts, concluded that it had, because it had made a material contribution to the disease’s development. Lord Reid said (at 621):</p>

By that time the plaintiffs were already suffering from the disease, although they did not then know it. The House of Lords held that the plaintiffs were nevertheless time barred, even though the insidious onset of the disease, in the form of some material, ie more than negligible, damage was unknown and probably unknowable.

So we have the absurd result that, even if the workman is able to have X-ray photographs taken at regular intervals, a large part, or it might be the whole, of the three-year period of limitation would have elapsed before he could, even with the best possible advice, instruct the raising of an action. And if he were lucky enough to be able to raise an action at all it would be quite impossible at that stage to make any accurate assessment of the probable development of the disease.”  </p>

Thus the Limitation Act 1963 first introduced the possibility of postponing the running of time in cases of breach of duty involving personal injuries until after the claimant had or ought to have had knowledge of the facts which gave him his cause of action. When first introduced, this provision allowed the claimant one year from the date of knowledge. The current three-year rule was introduced by the Limitation Act 1975. The developed form of this change to the law is now to be found in sections 11 and 33 of the Limitation Act 1980. It was the relaxation of the law of limitation which opened the door to the prosecution of claims arising out of diseases with a long latency period.</p>

A dose-related disease is one to which each dose makes its contribution, even if, in the case of some such diseases, no harmful effect may be experienced until the dose has reached a certain level. The formal answer appears to be, it is when some more than negligible injury occurs. But when is this? The parties to this appeal, perhaps because they have had enough on their plate, have not investigated such matters; and it has not been made clear to us. The respondents have expressed concern that, if the insurance contracts in this appeal do not respond to the years of exposure, then similar reasoning would prevent coverage for other diseases, such as asbestosis, which, although dose-related, has its own latency period, as described above. The insurers have kept their cards close to their chests about such matters.  </p>

Thus where scientific knowledge has demonstrated that the condition complained of results from the cumulative effect of exposure, injury is said to be divisible, so that there may now be apportionment between the extent of injury caused by individual defendant employers, or between negligent and non-negligent exposure. This has been done in the case of loss of hearing in <span style="font-style:italic">Thompson v. Smiths Shiprepairers (North Shields) Ltd </span>[1984] QB 405 (Mustill J).</p>

Moreover, it is of the nature of such cancers that they have a long latency period, even if mesothelioma in this respect appears to be exceptional in the length of its latency. An early industrial cancer of such a kind was scrotal cancer, which was caused by dye-stuffs in the textile industry. In such cases, each dose of exposure does not make a contribution to the development of the disease, but rather contributes to the risk of such disease occurring. It is therefore a factor in its causation. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The leading case in this respect is <span style="font-style:italic">McGhee v. National Coal Board </span>[1973] 1 WLR 1 (HL). This concerned a single defendant who had exposed his employee to brick dust. Some of the exposure was in breach of duty, but some of it was not. The pursuer there complained about dermatitis, which had been caused by his exposure to brick dust. The brick dust originated at his place of work, but that exposure was not due to his employer’s negligence. However, he had to cycle home with the dust still on him, and that was the fault of his employer. The aetiology of dermatitis was obscure, and the experts were unable to say whether the extended contact had materially contributed to the development of the disease. The pursuer’s dermatitis could have begun with a single abrasion, which might either have happened when the plaintiff was working in the brick kiln or could equally well have occurred during the bicycle ride home (see Lord Reid at 4).  The experts could say, however, that the extra exposure had increased the risk of the workman getting dermatitis. The House of Lords held that that was enough to meet the test of causation. A material increase in risk was the same as or a proxy for a material contribution to the disease itself. Proof of causation had therefore been satisfied. A gap in the evidence (which the experts had not been able to bridge) was closed by adapting the test for causation as a matter of law (what Lord Reid at 4 described as taking “a broader view of causation”). That was the explanation provided in <span style="font-style:italic">Fairchild v. Glenhaven</span>, where <span style="font-style:italic">McGhee </span>was carefully and fully considered, see for instance in the speech of Lord Bingham of Cornhill at paras 17/22. The ratio of <span style="font-style:italic">McGhee </span>was there accepted to be that in the circumstances no distinction was to be drawn between making a material contribution to causing the disease and materially increasing the risk of the pursuer contracting it (<span style="font-style:italic">per </span>Lord Bingham at 21). Or as Lord Hoffmann put it: a breach of duty which materially increased the risk should be treated <span style="font-style:italic">as if </span>it had materially contributed to the disease (at para 65). The adaptation in the law was fuelled in part by considerations of policy.

If a plaintiff has been exposed to asbestos dust by several different employers, how is he able to show that any one or more of them has caused him his mesothelioma, when it is impossible to say which one or more fibres has caused his tumour? Mesothelioma is not a dose-related or progressive disease, as in <span style="font-style:italic">Bonnington</span>, although the greater the exposure, the greater the risk of developing it. Moreover, the condition once caused, is not aggravated by further exposure. The answer given, building on <span style="font-style:italic">McGhee</span>, was to say that in the current state of medical knowledge, proof that any defendant’s breach of duty had materially increased the risk of contracting the disease was sufficient proof of causation. No argument on apportionment was addressed. The modified approach to proof of causation was hedged about by conditions: see Lord Bingham’s six factors (at paras 2 and 21) or Lord Hoffmann’s five (at paras 61 and 73). The modified rule was adopted after consideration of international jurisprudence, and with policy contributing to the resolution of what could be said to be a clash of principle. Thus Lord Bingham said (at para 33):</p>

I am of opinion that such injustice as may be involved in imposing liability on a duty-breaking employer in such circumstances is heavily outweighed by the injustice of denying redress to a victim.”</p>

It was accepted by all that mesothelioma is an indivisible injury, creating indivisible damage.

Consistency of approach would suggest that if the basis of liability is the wrongful creation of a risk or chance of causing the disease, the damage which the defendant should be regarded as having caused is the creation of such a risk or chance.

Although the <span style="font-style:italic">Fairchild </span>exception treats the risk of contracting mesothelioma as the damage, it applies only when the disease has actually been contracted. Mr Stuart-Smith, who appeared for Corus, was reluctant to characterise the claim as being for causing a risk of the disease because he did not want to suggest that someone could sue for being exposed to a risk which had not materialised. But in cases which fall within the <span style="font-style:italic">Fairchild </span>exception, that possibility is precluded by the terms of the exception. It applies only when the claimant has contracted the disease against which he should have been protected. And in cases outside the exception, as in <span style="font-style:italic">Gregg v Scott </span>[2005] 2 AC 176, a risk of damage or loss of a chance is not damage upon which an action can be founded. But when the damage is apportioned among the persons responsible for the exposures to asbestos which created the risk, it is known that those exposures were together sufficient to cause the disease. The damages which would have been awarded against a defendant who had actually caused the disease must be apportioned to the defendants according to their contributions to the risk…”</p>

Such plaques are caused by exposure to and thus the inhalation of asbestos dust, but are entirely benign. They are evidence of such exposure, and therefore their presence may be an indicator that the employee concerned may come to suffer from some serious asbestos-related disease, such as asbestosis or mesothelioma. However, an employee who has developed pleural plaques may well not go on to suffer from those diseases. The claimants in question had not done so, but they complained that they should be compensated for the negligent exposure by their employers to asbestos dust, not because the pleural plaques constituted actionable damage in themselves, but because the diagnosis of them had already led in one case to a depressive illness and, more generally, demonstrated to the claimants the risk of falling victim to fatal asbestos-related disease and caused them anxiety associated with knowledge of that risk.

Lord Hoffmann gave the leading speech. He stressed that damage in the sense of something without proof of which a claim in tort for negligence is incomplete is an “abstract concept of being worse off, physically or economically, so that compensation is an appropriate remedy” (at para 7). Thus an action for compensation “should not be set in motion on account of a trivial injury” (at para 8). He referred to <span style="font-style:italic">Cartledge v. Jopling</span>.

Those cases<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>argue, albeit for the exceptional purpose of bridging a problem of causation and then applying to that problem a fair doctrine of appropriation, that, <span style="font-style:italic">where mesothelioma has actually occurred</span>, the damage may be regarded as being identified with the increased risk of suffering mesothelioma. As Lord Hoffmann said (<span style="font-style:italic">Barker </span>at para 48, cited above), “the <span style="font-style:italic">Fairchild </span>exception treats the risk of contracting mesothelioma as the damage”. On that basis, the damage and injury might possibly be said to have commenced with the risk; and the claimants here so submit. Such cases, the argument goes, stand outside the rule in <span style="font-style:italic">Gregg v.

For this purpose, it should be irrelevant whether the other exposure was tortious or non-tortious, by natural causes or human agency or by the claimant himself.

Greif (UK) Ltd </span>[2009] EWCA Civ 1159, [2010] QB 370. Mrs Costello had worked for the defendant from 1966 to 1984 and died of mesothelioma in 2006. Her occupational exposure to asbestos during her employment had been only modest, and the employer argued that the claimant could not show on the balance of probabilities that it, rather than the low level of environmental exposure unavoidably faced by a resident of Ellesmere Port, was the cause of her illness. To do so, argued the employer, the claimant would have to show that the occupational exposure had at least doubled the risk of contracting mesothelioma which Mrs Costello faced as a mere resident. This court, however, held that there was no such requirement under the common law, provided that the occupational exposure had materially increased the risk. It regarded the <span style="font-style:italic">Fairchild/Barker </span>cases as having recognised a new tort, that of negligently increasing the risk of injury (para 27, <span style="font-style:italic">per </span>Lady Justice Smith, and para 55 <span style="font-style:italic">per </span>Lord Clarke of Stone-cum-Ebony). It held that section 3(1)(d) of the Compensation Act 2006 was not intended to widen the circumstances in which a defendant might be found liable in tort, but to reflect the common law (at paras 33/34). </p>

This is for two reasons. The first is that it seems reasonably clear that some at least of the language of the insurance wordings in issue goes back to the era of the WCA. Indeed, it would seem that EL insurance is in large part a response to those Acts. It is submitted on behalf of the insurers (or at any rate some of them) that the factual matrix and commercial purpose of their wording can be understood only in terms of the WCA and the cases decided under them. Secondly, there is an issue between those insurers who rely on the WCA and the claimants as to what the WCA and the decisions under them teach about the essence of EL insurance. The insurers submit that the WCA regime did not depend in any way upon the doctrine of causation, but was a no-fault compensation scheme based upon manifestation (of injury) and disability or death: it would therefore be a fundamental mistake to interpret insurance wording which originates from the era of that regime as responding to exposure as a cause of injury, rather than to the injury itself. The claimants, however, or some of them, submit that support for their submissions as to the construction of the wordings (as being given a causation meaning) can be derived from the period of the WCA, even though, as they accept, the WCA decisions do not decisively cover the issue in the present appeals. </p>

Compensation under the ELA 1880 was limited to three years’ wages (section 3), and notice “that injury has been sustained” had to be given within six weeks, and an action commenced within six months, “of the accident causing the injury” or, in the case of death, within twelve months of death (section 4). The notice had to state in ordinary language “the cause of the injury and the date at which it was sustained” (section 7). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The <span style="font-style:italic">Workmen’s Compensation Act 1897 </span>(the “WCA 1897”) introduced a novel compensation scheme “for accidental Injuries suffered in the course of their Employment”, as the Act’s title put it. This did not depend on negligence, but was a statutory scheme covering “personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment…caused to a workman” (section 1(1)). The scheme was in addition to the common law upon which a workman could rely by commencing an action, but the workman could not proceed under both the scheme and by way of action, but had to choose between them “at his option” (section 1(2)(b)). The scale and conditions of compensation were contained in the First Schedule to the Act. Death as well as injury was encompassed by the scheme, but, subject to the case of death where provision was made for the claim to be in the hands of legal representatives or dependants, a “Workman” was defined as including “any person who is engaged in an employment to which this Act applies” (section 7(2)). Death apart, the scheme covered the situation only “where total or partial incapacity for work results from the injury”, in which case the scheme awarded up to 50% of weekly earnings for the period of incapacity after an initial period of two weeks of incapacity (para (1)(b) of the First Schedule). Notice “of the accident” had to be given as soon as practicable after its happening and in any event “before the workman has voluntarily left the employment”, and the claim for compensation under the scheme had to be made within six months of the occurrence of the accident, or, in the case of death, within six months of that (section 2(1)). The notice had to state “the cause of the injury and the date at which it was sustained”. The employer liable was the employer in whose employment the worker was working at the date of the injury or accident. Any dispute which could not be settled by agreement went to arbitration under the Act. </p>

As in the case of the ELA 1880, the phrase “injury sustained” was found, but not in section 1, only in the notice clause. There was no separate provision for disease. </p>

The diseases scheduled in the Third Schedule were limited in number and range, and did not include any asbestos-related disease. The only disease based on a mining process was ankylostomiasis (or hookworm). Anthrax was also scheduled, but in the main the diseases listed were poisoning diseases, such as lead or mercury poisoning. The scheme depended on either (1) certification of disability, or (2) suspension from work pursuant to rules or regulations made under the Factory and Workshop Act 1901, or (3) death (section 8(1)(i), (ii) and (iii)). Therefore, in one way or another, the disease had to have become manifest before the scheme would avail the workman; but there also had to be the necessary certification or suspension (or death). </p>

Jurisprudence was to show that the section 8(1) language was not a strict requirement of causation: rather that it was necessary to prove only that the nature of the employment within the last twelve months was of the same nature as the work to which the disease was due, ie could have caused the disease in theory: see <span style="font-style:italic">Blatchford v.

In section 8(1)(c)(i) the “last employer” may, if the workman fails to provide the required information about his previous employers, seek to prove that “the disease was not contracted whilst the workman was in his employment”. In section 8(1)(c)(ii), the “last employer” may seek to prove that “the disease was in fact contracted whilst the workman was in the employment of some other employer, and not whilst in his employment”. And in section 8(1)(c)(iii) there is reference to a disease being “of such a nature as to be contracted by a gradual process”. In the second and third cases, the concept would appear to be linked to a question of causation. In the fourth case, the concept would appear to be linked to a question of multiple exposures.

In 1930 section 47 of the WCA 1925 was amended to extend its empowering provisions to industries and processes “involving exposure to asbestos dust”: see the <span style="font-style:italic">Workmen’s Compensation (Silicosis and Asbestosis) Act 1930</span> (the “WC(SA)A 1930”). </p>

However, the asbestos scheme brought asbestosis within the provisions of the WCA 1925 by use of the (originally section 8) fiction that where asbestosis was due to employment in the scheme processes, the workman or his dependants should be entitled to claim compensation “as if the disease as aforesaid were a personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of employment”, but subject to the scheme’s own modifications. Thus the medical board could certify that asbestosis “cannot have been contracted in the processes owing to the shortness of the time during which the workman has been employed therein”. (Moreover, no compensation was payable where the workman had not been employed within the three years previous to the date of injury.) In the absence of such a certificate, however, where the workman had been employed in the processes for an accumulated period of less than five years, the disease was deemed to be due to employment in the processes but (see the language “unless the employer proves the contrary”) the employer had the opportunity of seeking to prove that it was not.

The issue was whether there had been “injury by accident” within the meaning of the WCA 1897. The employer’s argument was that the workman had suffered from disease, not injury, and that disease was not an accident. The House of Lords held that there had been both an accident and an injury. It is not entirely clear whether the development of the disease was the injury, or whether the injury occurred prior to the disease and at the same time as the accidental infection.

The workman was disabled by lead poisoning, and his disablement under the WCA 1906 dated from the date of certification, in July 1925. (“The certifying surgeon, not being able to certify a date on which the disablement commenced, duly deleted the words in the form of certificate which fix the date of commencement, and under the Act the commencement is deemed to have been the date of the certificate…” <span style="font-style:italic">per </span>Viscount Sumner at 465/6.) His last employment within the relevant twelve months of that date had been from October to December 1924, with the respondent employer. The arbitrator to whom the dispute was referred found that the workman’s disease was not caused or contributed to by his employment with that employer, but had originated and been contracted back in 1918, when he was employed in the navy (see at 465, 479). The question was whether in these circumstances the respondent employer was liable, and the arbitrator found that he was not, and the county court and in turn the court of appeal had upheld that decision. The House of Lords reversed, and found the employer liable. The essence of its decision was simply that section 8 of the WCA 1906 made “the last employer” within the previous twelve months (as I have defined him) liable, “as if the disease…were a personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of that employment”. In the course of their speeches, however, their Lordships made some relevant observations on the nature of the legislation: to the effect that section 8 was unlike section 1 (<span style="font-style:italic">per </span>Lord Blanesburgh at 481), and driven by statutory fictions (<span style="font-style:italic">per </span>Lord Wrenbury at 477).

The policy provided an indemnity “if at any time during the said period [viz 8 to 18 March 1929] any employee in the employers’ immediate service shall sustain any personal injury by accident or disease…while engaged in the service of the employer…” The insurer submitted (i) that the workmen had not sustained injury during the policy period, but before it commenced; and (ii) that the workmen were not engaged in the employer’s service at either the time they had sustained injury or even at the time of their certified disablement, because they were not then earning wages.

Eagle, Star &amp; British Dominions Insurance Company Ltd </span>(1934) 48 Ll Law Rep 67 (CA) was another case between employer and insurer. The policy covered the period between 30 June 1927 and 17 June 1930, and promised an indemnity against liability for “any personal injury or disease…which, at any time or times during the continuance of this policy, shall be sustained or contracted by any workman”. The employer compensated a workman whom it had employed as a file cutter between 31 March 1928 and 16 June 1930, during the period of cover. The compensation was for the scheme disease of silicosis. The workman was put on other work until he left the employer’s employment on 31 October 1931. The WCA certificate was not issued until December 1932 and dated the disablement (by silicosis) to 18 July 1932. The arbitrator, presumably following <span style="font-style:italic">Ellerbeck</span>, declined recovery by the employer from the insurer on the ground that the certified date of disablement was outside the period of the cover. This court however upheld Roche J in granting an indemnity. Scrutton LJ first of all decided the appeal on the limited point that, under an extension to the policy, the insurer had promised to cover “any liability which may rest upon you, in connection with any claim made by your employees in respect of silicosis”. Scrutton LJ clearly considered that the workman’s claim fell within the words of that extension (at 69). He gives no reason, but it may simply be because under the silicosis scheme, liability fell on the employer by reason of his employment of the workman in the silicosis scheme processes during the period of the cover (see Slesser LJ at 72 and Maugham LJ  at 73). That was the basis of the court’s decision. </p>

At most Scrutton LJ seems to be suggesting that the words “disease contracted” are not necessarily in pari materia with “injury sustained”; that a disease may possibly be said to be contracted both when “first contracted” and, in the case of a disease which develops gradually, when influenced or increased; and that such policy language might respond during a period of cover when the workman is working in processes which are likely to exacerbate his disease, even if it originated in times past, and even though his final disability is only certified at a time after cover has come to an end. At the same time, it has to be remembered that silicosis is a scheme disease, not a scheduled disease, so that certification operates so as to render liable the last employer for whom the workman had worked in the relevant processes over the previous five years. It does so, as under sections 8 and 43, by reference to a fictional “injury by accident”. It appears that Scrutton LJ was willing to ascribe to the alternative basis of the insurer’s liability to indemnify (“or disease…contracted”) a wider scope than under the fictional workings of the WCA. At any rate, I believe that it is possible to see here, not for the first time, the benevolence with which the courts were prepared to safeguard the interests of both the workman and the insured employer who was rendered liable to the workman.  </p>

Could the employer recover an indemnity for its liability? This court said it could. The worker was employed by the employer from 1929 until November 1936 and for much of that time he was employed in processes relevant to lead poisoning. He was already ill when he commenced that employment, but his disease was aggravated during it.

Secondly, that where there was a finding that the disease had been aggravated during the employment and the currency of the policy, the court was no longer concerned with the fictions of the WCA which were designed to make an employer who was in truth not responsible for causing injury or disease nevertheless liable to pay compensation for them: it could simply go directly to the injury by disease found to have been both caused, in the sense of aggravated, and for the same reason sustained, while working for the employer. It may be that in this respect the court was assisted by the fact that section 43 did not appear on its face to date the deemed “injury by accident” to the time of a certificate or a date of disability stated in a certificate or to a suspension: for there was no certificate or suspension. In this respect there was simply a void in section 43 as to “the happening of the accident”, other than the provision that it was to be treated as one arising out of and in the course of the employment.  </p>

Young </span>[1940] AC 479 the House of Lords reviewed the meaning of “injury by accident” under section 1 of the WCA. It was held to apply in that case to a mineworker who developed a muscle paralysis which prevented him using his foot. The condition was brought on by having to crouch in his work. The test applied was that of sustaining a physiological injury as a result of the work engaged in (Lord M’Laren’s test from <span style="font-style:italic">Stewart v. Wilsons and Clyde Coal Co Ltd </span>(1902) 5 F 120, cited by Viscount Caldecote LC at 483). As such, the test in practice collapsed the meaning of accident into that of injury. The word “accident” had however caused difficulties in the case of progressive diseases where it was impossible to show a definite physiological change at a particular time. It was this difficulty which had led to the introduction of first scheduled and then scheme diseases into the legislation. However, even before that the accidental injury caused by infection had been solved by the anthrax case in <span style="font-style:italic">Brintons</span>. In this context, Lord Atkin made observations about the difference between accident and injury. He pointed out that in the case of what he called an “internal accident” (such as a rupture), it is hardly possible to distinguish the time between accident and injury. But in principle the distinction between them must be observed. Thus –</p>

In such cases the accident has caused the wound or scratch which is the injury. Without the bacillus the injury is trifling, with the bacillus the injury becomes so aggravated that it causes incapacity or death.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally, what does one obtain from this consideration of the statutes and policies and jurisprudence of this era as a whole? In my judgment, not a lot. First, I accept that a certain amount of policy language derives from this period, for instance the phrase “personal injury by accident or disease”; also talk of “injury sustained” (the 1880 Act) and “disease contracted” (the 1906 Act) There is a natural contrast between the cause and the incidence (sustaining) of injury in section 2(1) of the 1897 Act (see para 129 above). However, statutory talk of “injury sustained” has gone by 1906 (see para 132 above). In this connection I acknowledge, and it is in any event common ground, that the phrase “personal injury by accident or disease” refers to injury by accident and to injury by disease. However, ultimately these are all ordinary words and expressions, which come readily to hand to describe the suffering of the incidence of injury or disease. There is no definitive treatment, however, of the phrase “injury sustained”. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, the complex schemes of the WCA in the case of disease and the tortured jurisprudence to which those statutes gave rise are of no particular relevance to the post WCA era of the common law of negligence or breach of statutory duty. The WCA regime depended in large part on fictions or presumptions based on manifestation of injury (by way of disablement, certification, suspension or death), whereas in the modern era there can be no liability without causation of injury or damage to the employee on the part of the employer. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, I accept neither the submission of the insurers, that causation was irrelevant to the WCA, nor the submission of the claimants, that it was all-important. Questions of causation could arise, particularly under section 1 of the Acts, but in essence the WCA format provided for no fault compensation, not damages for breach of duty; and, in the case of disease, questions of causation only arose at the margins, for instance where a “last employer” was seeking to pass on liability to another (albeit it is to be noted that this is the context for finding the concept of a disease being “contracted” (see para 140 above); or where, as in <span style="font-style:italic">Mayer</span>, a question might arise as to whether an injury or disease sustained or contracted during a policy period had only subsequently to the expiry of the policy given rise to WCA compensation liability in a case where the employer had died without earlier certification or suspension. Moreover, in the case of section 1’s “injury by accident”, there only had to be a loose causal connection between the accident/injury and the employment in which the workman was engaged. The cases I have been asked to consider demonstrate, to my mind, how rarely any question of causation arose. As the parties accept, none of the jurisprudence directly answers the essential issue of construction which arises on these appeals. In its essence, WCA compensation was not causation based, but manifestation based.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Fourthly, however, there are observations in the jurisprudence which suggest that the phrase “disease contracted” may be capable of reflecting a number of different situations. It may refer to diseases in their origins as when they begin in something like an infection, or it may possibly refer to the development of a dose-related disease where successive exposures aggravate the workman’s condition. A question which then arises in these appeals is whether the phrase refers to the disease of mesothelioma only at the end of the process, when the disease has emerged in an injury in fact (or perhaps one should say, when the injury in fact has become a disease), or whether it can also refer to the origins of the disease, at the start of the lengthy process which can, but need not, lead but has in fact led to the growth of a cancerous tumour. And fifthly, there are indications, for instance in the observations of the Earl of Halsbury in <span style="font-style:italic">Brintons v. Turvey </span>or of Lord Atkin in <span style="font-style:italic">Fife Coal</span>, that an accidental injury in the course of employment which provides the hook on which liability depends may be trivial in itself, but may lead because of infection to incapacity and thus liability. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The claimants submit that only causation wording in an EL policy adequately protects both employer and employee. Once wording covers a liability arising out of the activities of an employer in any year, then the employer always remains protected, however far distant in the future his negligence or breach of duty may ultimately result in a liability brought home to him for which he needs the protection of his EL insurance. The employer’s protection is also the employee’s protection: for ever since the <span style="font-style:italic">Third Parties (Rights Against Insurers) Act 1930</span> (the “TPRAIA 1930”) the employee or his dependant can sue the insurer of an insolvent employer directly. Thus the employer’s EL insurance is a form of security for the employee. Only the failure of the insurer destroys that security. Policy wording on a sustained injury basis however does not provide the same protection, unless the employer both remains in existence and retains insurance long into the future. For these purposes, the insurers’ submission that causation wording in modern times is less useful, where mesothelioma is concerned, than sustained wording, on the ground that the former does not pick up liability which goes back into earlier times in the way that the latter does, misses the point: which is that, looking forward, only causation wording in any given year provides complete protection for the liability which emerges out of that year. Sustained wording only provides that same protection as long as it is renewed each year. History has shown that such renewals may not happen, and indeed, the insurance market has dictated that they are no longer available, at any rate to cover mesothelioma. </p>

Thus MMI was not required in the era of ELCIA 1969 to provide its local authority clients with EL insurance which covered asbestosis or mesothelioma; but it nevertheless did. ELCIA 1969 sanctioned a failure by an employer who was required to insure but failed to do so by providing that such failure was a criminal offence carrying a fine upon summary conviction of up to £200; and a director, manager, secretary or other officer of a company which had been guilty of an offence who connived at or facilitated such offence would also be guilty of that offence (section 5).

Nevertheless, as the appellant insurers point out, the regulatory machinery is by no means extensive (cf the regime of the Road Traffic Act 1988). Thus it does nothing to prevent an insurer’s reliance on an employer’s misrepresentation or non-disclosure or breach of warranty. This is despite the fact that the immediate historical impetus for the passing of the Act was a disastrous fire at a small employer whose insurance was avoided by its insurer and who failed as a result, leaving the families of the victims of the fire without remedy for the employer’s negligence or breach of statutory duty.

It could be said that if Parliament had wanted to insist that its requirement of compulsory insurance had to be taken out on the causation wording which lay readily to hand in the tariff wording which had been widely in use since 1948, it could readily have so insisted. As it is, Parliament could be said to have left it to employers to choose what wording to adopt, as long as they maintained their insurance. Thus although section 1(1) and (3)(a) limited insurance to “approved policies”, the only steps taken by the statute or regulations under it to limit what that meant were concerned with outlawing certain exemptions.  </p>

Thus an employer who ceases all business, or who carries on business but only outside Great Britain, is under no obligation to insure or to maintain any EL insurance. Therefore an employer who insured on sustained wording, then ceased business, might appear to have no continuing duty to insure. It might be said that these considerations support the thesis that only causation wording could fulfil the statutory purpose, which is clearly to protect current employees who are injured by their employer’s negligence or breach of statutory duty. </p>

It will be recalled that mesothelioma had become a prescribed disease already in 1966, even if instances of it were at that time rare. On the basis of the rulings in <span style="font-style:italic">Bolton</span>, the injury or disease of mesothelioma is only suffered as an injury or disease in fact long after the time of exposure. Thus the exception would leave employees who retire abroad (or even employees who move abroad to work, possibly for the same employer who had exposed them to asbestos), and who develop mesothelioma outside Great Britain, unprotected by the statute. The same might be true of other diseases, such as other industrial cancers or even asbestosis. The case was put of infections such as malaria, which might take six months to develop. The claimants submitted that surely such cases are intended to be dealt with, and covered by insurance, depending on the place where the employee was negligently exposed to the cause of infection, and not where the disease developed. It was submitted that only causation wording, which looks to the circumstances of the employment and its activities and to the risks to which employees are in each year currently exposed by their employer, can properly deal with such cases. That is why, it was submitted, the regulations required the displaying of each year’s certificate of insurance to current employees.</p>

It may be supposed that the statute is not retrospective, so that there appears to have been no requirement to insure employees in previous years. If, however, an employer insured on sustained wording, his insurance would protect employees who had been exposed to asbestos in previous years, at any rate on the insurers’ construction (although not on the claimants’ or the judge’s construction). As for the future, insurance on the basis of either construction would protect employees, but, on the insurers’ construction of sustained wording would only do so if continued from year to year. Moreover, if at some time after the statute took effect an employer changed from sustained wording to causation wording, he would, on the insurers’ construction, appear to be in breach of ELCIA 1969 and guilty of a criminal offence unless he also maintained run-off insurance for employees whose injuries or diseases might only come to be sustained in future years, albeit they had been caused by activities in earlier years within ELCIA 1969. There was no evidence as to whether such run-off insurance was in general obtainable or in fact obtained on the hypothesis in question. It would not be obtainable now. If there was no obligation on that hypothesis to maintain run-off insurance, then the insurance cover of previous years under the sustained wording would not have been maintained. </p>

Mr Ellis and his proposed amendment were concerned with a different point entirely. His comment about the government’s language seeming to achieve the same object is very obscure: it is not at all clear what precise object he had in mind when making that comment. In any event, his language is not that form of deliberate statement from a government minister proposing legislation, as to its intended effect, which is the legitimate subject matter of the admissibility of <span style="font-style:italic">travaux préparatoires</span>.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the final analysis, the dispute over the requirements of section 1 of ELCIA 1969 can probably only be resolved, if at all,  by asking a question which no one posed at these appeals, and which is: to what extent, if any, the requirement of compulsory insurance was intended to (or permitted to) respond retrospectively. Thus: (i) if the requirement of compulsory insurance was above all to ensure that the employer had the means, by way of an <span style="font-style:italic">indemnity</span> from an insurer, to meet any liability for bodily injury caused to an employee, then the insurance might have to operate to provide an indemnity as of any moment (after ELCIA 1969 took effect) when an indemnity might be required. That moment however operates at a late stage (<span style="font-style:italic">Post Office v. Norwich Union Fire Insurance Society Ltd </span>[1967] 2 QB 363 (CA)). That would certainly answer one aspect of the purpose of the statute. In that case, however, there would be a large element of retrospectivity involved: for negligence and injury and even claim might all be well in the past. And it may be thought difficult to obtain insurance for a claim which had already been made. (ii) Alternatively, the statute might be concerned to ensure that any future <span style="font-style:italic">injury </span>sustained by an employee was covered by insurance: in such a case the negligence might be in the past, although in the great majority of cases injury and negligence would probably be essentially contemporaneous. This alternative would operate retrospectively to some extent, but not as much as under alternative (i). (iii) Alternatively, the statute might only be concerned to provide insurance for future <span style="font-style:italic">negligence </span>(and breach of statutory duty): in which case the obvious way to do that would be to provide insurance to cover the future activities of the employer. Such a requirement would not involve any aspect of retrospectivity.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The language of the statute focuses on “bodily injury or disease sustained”, which could be thought of as fitting best with alternative (ii). On the other hand, the purpose of the statute in its purest form fits best with alternative (i), although there is not much about the language of section 1 to favour this alternative. However it is alternative (iii) which involves the least retrospectivity, indeed no retrospectivity at all, and that, in a criminal statute albeit one principally driven by social welfare policy, may be of particular importance. Moreover, the statute is ultimately concerned with insuring against “<span style="font-style:italic">liability</span> for bodily injury…” and not simply with obtaining cover for an employee’s “bodily injury or disease sustained”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For these reasons, as well as the other considerations invoked by Mr Wynter, if I had to decide the issue posed as to the form of policy required by ELCIA 1969, I would be inclined to say that it was a policy with causation wording. That is not to say that a policy on sustained wording might not in the great majority of cases suffice, as long as it was maintained. If, however, an employer <span style="font-style:italic">ceased</span> business in Great Britain and therefore stopped insuring, as it seems to me it would be permitted by the statute to do, could it defend itself against a failure to insure against its liability for mesothelioma (or other diseases with a long-tail gestation period) caused by exposure or other activities for which it was responsible in years beginning in and following 1972 during which it <span style="font-style:italic">was</span> in business within Great Britain, if it turned out that it was not insured against its liability to its former 1972 and post-1972 employees because, during the years in which it had been in business, it had chosen sustained and not causation wording? It seems to me that in theory it could not. It is not clear to me, however, how the issue would arise. Although there is in general no statute of limitation against criminal liability, there is a six months limitation “from the time the offence was committed” in the case of summary offences (<span style="font-style:italic">Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980, section 127</span>). Therefore the issue is unlikely to arise as between the prosecution and employer. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The truth of the matter no doubt is that no one anticipated such questions. In 1969 mesothelioma, although known about, was not perceived as a particular problem or at any rate as a problem which gave rise to unusual questions. To the extent that it was in anyone’s mind, it was treated, like asbestosis and other similar diseases with a latency period, as causing injury which originated with exposure. It was, as the judge found, the universal practice of insurers to treat causation and sustained wording as all one: either because they were all considered as taking effect as causation wording, or because in any event the insurers considered that injury or disease was sustained at the time of exposure. Moreover, as I have already observed, the immediate impetus of ELCIA 1969 was a disastrous fire; and it is common ground that (as it were) 99.9% of employer liability cases have at all times involved injuries of the kind where negligence or breach of duty, accident and injury all come together at (more or less) one and the same time. The issue has never been decided, nor, it seems, needed to be decided (until this litigation).    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the circumstances, it seems to me that, for the purpose of construing those wordings which post-date the enactment of ELCIA 1969, it is necessary at the very least to bear in mind that the statute expresses a general policy in favour of insurance to provide security for an employee for whose injury or disease an employer is liable, and that it is common ground that such a policy is best met by causation wording. The evidence is, moreover, that at the time of the enactment of ELCIA 1969 all insurers treated causation and sustained wording as effectively the same; and that since then the respondent insurers (and Zurich) have, to the extent that they have stayed in business, gradually moved from their sustained wording to causation wording. Ultimately, therefore, I do not think I would be defeating any expectations if I were to hold, as I do, that the statute requires employers carrying on business in Great Britain to insure on a causation basis. (That is not to say that those employers who have insured and maintained insurance on a sustained basis would, even on the insurers’ construction of that wording, necessarily have been in breach of their statutory obligations.) It follows that under the deeming provisions of policies in the ELCIA 1969 era, those policies should be treated as providing cover on a causation basis, although as between any employer insured and its insurer, the employer would be liable to repay to the insurer any liability of the latter which goes beyond the cover of the policy. </p>

But he also stated that the medical evidence that he had personally heard supported or was consistent with that conclusion. He rejected what he described as the “attractive submissions” to the effect that at any rate those, even if only 3%, who are exposed to asbestos and go on to suffer and die from mesothelioma, were appreciably worse off from the moment of exposure. The evidence was that whereas nearly everyone has some millions of asbestos fibres in their lungs (say 40 millions mainly of the less dangerous white fibres), those who are occupationally exposed to asbestos have hundreds of times as many fibres in their lungs, as well as vastly more numbers of the much more dangerous brown and blue fibres.

Even if a risk does eventuate in a subsequent injury, that does not somehow backdate the injury to the date of risk. As for disease, even if there was a continuum from inhalation to manifestation of tumour and death, that did not mean that there was any disease present at the time of inhalation, let alone the disease of mesothelioma. </p>

He considered that this problem rendered the wordings ambiguous. The policy wordings appeared to apply only to employees in the course of their employment (eg Excess’s first wording: “If…any employee in the Employer’s immediate service shall sustain any personal injury…while engaged in the service of the Employer”). On the insurers’ construction, therefore, the sustained wording gave the employer a limited cover only: for it applied only to employees who sustained injury or disease during their employment, and did not apply to ex-employees whose injury or disease became “injury in fact” for the first time after they had left their employment. Therefore it was very unlikely indeed to cover an employer’s liability for mesothelioma. On the claimants’ construction, however, the injury or disease was sustained in the sense of caused to the employee at the time of inhalation or exposure at a time when the employee was in his employer’s service: and the cover therefore always sufficed to meet the employer’s liability. </p>

That principle reflected the factual matrix of such insurance going back to the days of the WCA regime and also the commercial purpose of EL insurance as a means of protecting current employees from the consequences of the activities of their employers. In this way he sought to synthesise factual matrix, the history of EL insurance, its commercial purpose, the public policy expressed by ELCIA 1969, and the claims’ practice of the industry with his construction of the policy wordings itself. </p>

On that basis, there was no reason to construe the sustained wording found in the policies in issue in this case differently from the occurring wording found in <span style="font-style:italic">Bolton</span>. However, the judge had erred in thinking that the ex-employee problem required the reformulation with which he had concluded. He had produced an ambiguity where there was none. The references in the wordings to employees and employment were merely there to stress that the injury had to be suffered by someone who had the status of an employee and had to have arisen in the context of his employment. It was no part of the insurers’ case to suggest that a mesothelioma claimant had still to be in his employer’s employment at the time he sustained his injury or contracted his disease. Thus all references to employees covered ex-employees as well. If, however, the wording could not be construed in this way, and only covered injuries and diseases sustained while employees were still in their employment, then so be it. The ex-employee problem was no reason, however, to misconstrue injury “sustained” as meaning injury “caused”, as the judge had done. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In any event, the judge’s gloss did not work, or rather he had not even produced a gloss of the contractual wording. He had said (at para 243): “injury is <span style="font-style:italic">sustained </span>when it is <span style="font-style:italic">caused </span>and disease is <span style="font-style:italic">contracted </span>when it is <span style="font-style:italic">caused</span>, and the policies fall to be so construed”. However, the judge had not explained how this construction was to be reflected in the policy wordings. Even in his orders he had merely declared the wordings’ effect, rather than to restate its meaning. Thus, in his order in action 6 between MMI and Zurich and the ten local authorities, he had merely declared that MMI “is obliged to its insureds to indemnify them…in respect of any liability for injury or disease resulting from exposure to asbestos to an employee of those insureds during the period of insurance for which [MMI] was on risk”. However, if, as the respondents suggested, the judge was saying that “sustained” and “caused” could simply be substituted, that would achieve nothing. Thus, for example, in the case of Excess’s first wording: “If at any time during the said period, any employee…shall sustain any personal injury…” might be reproduced as “If at any time during the said period, any employee…shall be caused any personal injury…”. However, that would still leave the injury having to occur, be sustained or caused during the policy period, rather than the cause of the injury having to occur in that period. </p>

The wordings were clearly intended to operate while the victim was still in employment: while that might work for common and garden accidents, it could not work, on the appellant insurers’ construction, in the case of latent disease and particularly death. If, however, the wordings were construed to operate on exposure, then, of course, the employee would be in employment. Only a construction which looked to the time of exposure, of causation, could justify the matrix and commercial purpose of such insurance, and, when it came, the ELCIA.         </p>

There was much to be said for the proposition that the parties intended both insurance and reinsurance contracts to cover the same risks. But the two contracts were governed by different laws in circumstances where the particular system of law under which the insurance contract fell to be construed could not be predicted. In those circumstances the House of Lords held that the reinsurance contract’s period of cover should be given its ordinary meaning in the London market. Lord Collins of Mapesbury said:</p>

I would also accept that it would almost invariably be the case that losses for which the insurer has indemnified the original insured would be within the reinsurance even if the losses are payable under a foreign law or a foreign judicial decision which takes a view different from English law of what losses are recoverable. The presumption that the liability under a proportional facultative reinsurance is co-extensive with the insurance should be a strong one because (as I have said) the essence of the bargain is that the reinsurer takes a proportion of the premium in return for a share of the risk. But this is an unusual case in which the express (and entirely usual) terms of the reinsurance are clear. This is not a case where the reinsurers are relying on a technicality to avoid payment. At the beginning and end of these appeals remains the question whether the provision for the policy period in the reinsurance is to be given the effect it has under English law, or whether the parties must be taken to have meant that the reinsurance was to respond to all claims irrespective of the period to which the losses related.

It follows, in general, from the considerations which I have discussed above in the context of ELCIA 1969. It follows from the origin of EL insurance in language which talks of injury by accident or disease, or of contracting disease. In practice, some 99% of incidents of such liability have historically arisen from accidents which immediately there and then create the injury and liability for which the insurer wishes to be insured.  As industrial disease became a more important element in such liability, the general understanding of such diseases was that, even where there was a latency period to be experienced or the disease was not diagnosed until much later, the disease was contracted and the relevant injury was, at any rate in its origins, suffered in the period of the activity from which the disease arose. As the terms of insurance which I have set out above reveal, the premium was calculated by reference to the numbers of employees working in relevant areas of employment. There is no evidence that premium was calculated by reference to the past history of employment, a basis on which an employer who had ceased to work in malign industrial processes would have been charged heavily even though his current employment was, in terms of employer liability, relatively benign. On the contrary, the logic of the uniform evidence that sustained wording was regarded for all settlement purposes pre <span style="font-style:italic">Bolton </span>as providing the same cover as causation wording must have produced premium ratings which depended upon the activities of each policy year. There could hardly have been a gross disjunction between premium rating and claims settlement. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The evidence heard by the judge at the trial below was strongly in favour of this general purpose extending to sustained wording as well as causation wording. Thus Dr Frank Eaglestone, the deputy general manager of Federated (which became Independent), who retired in 1976 and gave evidence with remarkable esprit in his 90s, the doyen of the respondent insurers’ witnesses, who impressed the judge with his evidence, said that there was never any doubt that the purpose of EL insurance, whether on the sustained or the causation wording, was to provide the insured with cover for liability as a result of activities of the insured during the period the policy. He had not dealt with mesothelioma claims, but he had dealt with asbestosis. His view was that “the seed was sown…when the noxious [dust] was inhaled…therefore we should pay”. He said it would be “wrong, would it not?” for the insured not to get cover for the mistakes he made during the policy year. Mr Jason Summers (a witness on behalf of Independent) said that he agreed with Dr Eaglestone’s evidence. Mr Peter Moore (formerly of BAI) agreed that the policy responded to the insured’s activities in a particular policy year. Mr David Herriott (also formerly of BAI) said the same, agreeing that that was what BAI understood it was offering and what the employers understood they were getting. He agreed with Dr Eaglestone’s metaphor about the sowing of the seed. Mr John Goodwin (also of BAI) gave evidence to similar effect: what mattered was the negligence in the policy year; that was the cover that BAI was selling and employers were buying. Witnesses for Excess (Mr Stewart Gunn, Mr Neville Dare and Mr Alan Chipperfield) said much the same. Mr Chipperfield said that it was common knowledge that there could be a long gap between exposure and the onset of the disease which caused the disability, but maintained that it was the object of EL insurance to cover the liability arising out of the employer insured’s activities in any policy year. MMI was represented as witnesses by Mr John Payne, and Zurich by Mr Alan Woof and Mr John Murray, who also agreed. Mr Woof said: “I think it is not so much about the belief of a particular disease…but you are trying to cover all eventualities arising out of that particular period’s activities. That is the principle…” Evidence was also given on behalf of Zurich by Ms Isobel Woods, and on behalf of the local authorities by Mr Robert Chamberlin and Mr Nigel Mills, to similar effect. Mr Chamberlin said: “The primary concern was to cover the liabilities of the employer. Asbestos was one of the risks which could give rise to liabilities.”</p>

English law has set itself against such considerations, just as it has set its face against admitting evidence of pre-contractual negotiations. However, the existence in this litigation of issues of estoppel by convention and of binding usage or custom has led to an almost limitless array of evidence. Much of such evidence has also been relied on for the purposes of factual matrix and commercial purpose. I have a sceptical view of the usefulness, whatever the admissibility, of much of such evidence. It might be questioned, however, whether, in the case of a contract such as the annual policy of EL insurance, the constant round of negotiation of premium and settlement of claims could have an influence upon the mutual understanding of the function of such policies. I do not know whether this aspect of the matter has ever been considered. There is therefore room of course for estoppels of various kinds to arise, but all such claims have here failed and are not appealed. In general I am disposed to believe that the same language repeated from year to year will not change its meaning, even though the parties may have dealt with one another on a certain basis which, as in this case, has ceased following the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Bolton</span>, and even though there is room for the creation of an estoppel.

The historical reasons for this are explored by the judge at paras 87 ff of his judgment. On one view, sustained wording is identical to occurring wording. On the other view, there is a fundamental distinction. In <span style="font-style:italic">Bolton </span>Longmore LJ was cautious about the possibility that EL and PL insurance were to be regarded as close analogies. At para 3 of his judgment, he referred to the information that he had been given to the effect that EL insurance was usually offered on a causation basis. Counsel for the Commercial Union in that case therefore submitted that the position may be different in EL insurance, but the point was put as a matter solely of wording, not of any fundamental considerations about the commercial purpose of the insurance in question. The evidence in this case confirms that information: EL insurance usually is conducted on causation wording, which was always the tariff wording, and the trend has accelerated, but the evidence in this case goes well beyond that to which this court was treated in <span style="font-style:italic">Bolton</span>. At para 24, moreover, Longmore LJ appears to have accepted the possibility that a different approach may be “appropriate for employers’ liability policies in general, depending on the precise words used”. </p>

I see that the connection between an employer and his work force is closer than between an undertaking and the public at large. Statutory duties are also likely to operate on a greater scale as between employer and employee than with respect to the public: however, that might depend on the undertaking involved, for instance a local authority in particular may have all kinds of public responsibilities. However, I have little if any insight as to how PL insurance is rated.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, the concept of sustaining injury in its normal sense refers to the suffering of injury. Injury is sustained when it is suffered, or is incurred, or when it occurs, or is inflicted upon one. The relevant Oxford English Dictionary entry is: “To undergo, experience, have to submit to (evil, hardship, or damage; now chiefly with <span style="font-style:italic">injury</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">loss </span>as obj, formerly also <span style="font-style:italic">sorrow</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">death</span>); to have inflicted upon one, suffer the infliction of”. The concept also carries with it an element of suffering the consequences of injury over time. It may be that with a chronic, as distinct from an acute injury, or with a disease, it could be said that the person who suffers it, sustains it over a period. In general, however, if the question is asked, “<span style="font-style:italic">When </span>was an injury sustained?”, I think the answer that would be expected would be: at that time when it was first suffered or inflicted. In that context it is sustained when it occurs. This was the view of the judge when he was considering mesothelioma as an injury or disease in the light of the teaching of <span style="font-style:italic">Bolton </span>and in the light of the evidence that he himself heard at trial. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The judge felt driven to his ultimate conclusion that “sustained” meant “caused” only because of what he described as the ex-employee problem. He appears to have considered that this created an ambiguity which allowed him to reach the result that the parties had made a mistake about language. He was comforted that such a result accorded with factual matrix and commercial purpose. There is, however, an ambiguity about his substitution of the word “caused” for “sustained”. Is one looking at what the actor (the employer) is doing or causing to be done, or is one looking at what the passive party, the sufferer (the employee), is experiencing? The former may cause injury to the latter, but when the latter suffers or sustains injury, he may also be said to be caused injury. If the focus is on the cause and causation of the injury, that is one thing; but if the focus is on the experience of the injury, that is another. Thus, take BAI’s first wording which speaks of “any claim for injury sustained or disease contracted by such Employee” within the policy period. If, in accordance with the judge’s teaching, one reads that language as the equivalent of  “any claim for injury caused to…such Employee” during the policy period, one would still have to ask whether the trigger or time hook for the application of the policy cover depended on the occurrence of what caused the injury (exposure, inhalation) or on the occurrence of the injury that had been caused to the employee. I will consider below what impact on that question might be afforded by the concept of “disease contracted”. </p>

It is to be noted again that such causation wording is achieved in the tariff wording by starting with the concept of sustaining injury and then continuing by making it clear that what has to occur in the policy year is not so much the injury itself, but the cause of that injury: “if any person under a contract of service…shall sustain bodily injury or disease caused during the period of insurance” (see paras 11/12 above). </p>

That is undoubtedly a powerful consideration. Nevertheless, it is not an absurd or meaningless or irrational interpretation. It can operate entirely successfully in some 99% of cases. It accords with this court’s construction of similar “injury occurring” wording in PL insurance. Historically, it is only mesothelioma, with its extraordinary circumstances, a disease which was unknown when these wordings were first brought into being, which has tested the rule (albeit I bear fully in mind that it is possible that other cancers, and asbestosis, may hereafter equally test the rule).  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">What does the phrase mean in the present context? There is a pull in two directions. The combination of the phrase with “injury sustained” would suggest that it is concerned with the onset of disease, not with its origins. That of course assumes a certain meaning for “injury”, namely injury in the <span style="font-style:italic">Bolton </span>sense, but that is my present assumption. On the other hand, the commercial purpose of the EL insurance contract pulls in another direction, towards the causal origins of disease in the employee’s exposure to the noxious activities of his employment. This is a difficult choice, but in the end, after something of a struggle, I have concluded that the commercial purpose should prevail. Authority strongly suggests that where language permits the vindication of the contract’s commercial purpose, that is the better choice. We are at this point primarily concerned with disease, in a contract wording which distinguishes between disease and injury (of course other wordings make “injury” do service for disease as well, or else, while distinguishing between injury and disease, speak of both in terms of the verb “sustain”). In such a contract, the injury which is sustained, since it is not concerned with disease, will almost invariably be of the kind where cause and effect is practically instantaneous. In such circumstances, the pull of the phrase “injury sustained” is much weakened. If an insurer provides cover in potentially ambiguous terms, then he cannot complain that his cover is construed more widely against him, rather than more narrowly in his favour, particularly where such wider construction better achieves the commercial purpose of the contract. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">To recapitulate, the argument on the claimants’ side is that the insurance wordings only operate where the employee is an employee in service at the relevant time of the policy’s application. Therefore, that points towards a construction of the wordings which gives effect to them as covering the time of the current exposure of the employee to the employer’s activities, rather than some later time of “injury in fact” (if the two times diverge) when the employee of yesteryear may no longer be an employee, whether he has moved to some fresh employment, or has retired, or is disabled, or is dying. The argument on the insurers’ side is that the wordings do not confine cover to the time of employment and exposure, but refer to the employee and to his employment as a matter of status and circumstance, even if that conclusion requires a certain amount of linguistic manipulation. The claimants’ response is to refer mordantly to the biter bit. The insurers’ response is to shrug and say that if linguistic manipulation does not appeal, so be it: the cover is then even narrower than they contend for. The claimants’ riposte is that in that case the insurance is so narrow as to require the judge’s solution in order to prevent an unreasonable and absurd result.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is no definition of the term “Employee” in the policy. Condition 1 (see para 59 above) speaks of the premium being fixed with reference to the salaries, wages or earnings paid by the insured “to his Employees during the period covered by this Policy”. Those are plainly current employees. There is a symmetry between the “injury sustained or disease contracted by such Employee” during the policy period and the wages paid to employees during the same period. It is possible, nevertheless, to see that there is a certain force in the submission that in this wording the term “Employee” includes an ex-employee, if only because the liability to pay may well be confirmed by agreement or adjudication at a time when the employee has ceased to be in the employer’s employment. However, it is not submitted that the phrase “any dependant of such Employee” should be construed to mean “any dependant of such<span style="font-style:italic"> person</span>”, nor that the phrase “injury sustained or disease contracted by such Employee” should be construed to mean “injury sustained or disease contracted by such <span style="font-style:italic">person</span>”. Whether or not that is merely an oversight, nevertheless, given the construction which I would prima facie give to the expressions “injury sustained” and “disease contracted”, it is very hard to escape the conclusion, not only of course that the injury must be sustained and the disease contracted during the period of the policy (which is common ground), but that the injury or disease in question must be sustained or contracted at that time by an employee. That is what the contract says. Nor do I see why the interpolation should be “at the time of the breach of duty”, as distinct from “at the time of the injury or disease”, since it is the timing of the injury or disease which is the focus of the wording. I would therefore conclude that on this wording the injury or disease must be sustained or contracted by an employee and any gloss is unnecessary. Liability to the employee, injury or the contraction (but not necessarily the onset) of disease will all occur at the same time, when the employee is an employee. Liability for injury sustained by an ex-employee is not within the cover just because the ex-employee had been an employee at the time of breach of duty.</p>

It is hard to see how it is permissible simply to delete the word “being”. The effect of the wording is to require the employee to be a current employee during the policy period and to sustain his injury or contract his disease during that period. Again, the interpolation of “at the time of the breach of duty” seems an intrusion, especially coming at the crucial place immediately before the word “between”, albeit the whole phrase “by a person…at the time of breach of duty” is now to be closed off by a pair of commas. </p>

That is to say that the personal injury by accident or disease must be sustained within that period, by a person then “under a contract of service with the Insured”, and that injury must not only arise out of the employee’s employment in the insured’s activities described in the schedule but be sustained in the course of that employment. That course of employment must be contemporaneous with the sustaining of injury. The activities concerned are scheduled, together with the applicable remuneration. It cannot make sense that those activities and remuneration could apply to a previous period of employment rather than to the period of the policy year in question. Mr Palmer’s solution, by a transposition of the words “under a contract of service with the Insured”, is merely an attempt to lose the temporal emphasis of that phrase in among the later wording which it is submitted relates only to the status of the injured person’s employment. However, in my judgment, neither part of that attempt works. “Any person under a contract of service with the Insured” cannot become simply “any person” whether under a contract with the insured or not; and the following language, with its reference to the course of employment in the insured’s scheduled activities, cannot be divorced from the policy year in question.   </p>

In my judgment, the answer I give to that is the same as before with respect to the other wordings. The language “who is under a contract of employment” is a strong pointer to cover existing only for current employees. So is the reference to the “course of his employment” and to contracts specified or work described in the policy schedule.

However, cover for mesothelioma would be non-existent. The insurers, nevertheless, concede, I think, cover for mesothelioma as it occurs, if an insured is insured by a policy with sustained wording in a year in which an employee or ex-employee – it would nearly always be an ex-employee – suffers the onset of that disease in terms of “injury in fact”. But they would do so on what, as it seems to me, would be an unprincipled, basis: on a basis which nevertheless continues, even into this era of post <span style="font-style:italic">Bolton </span>litigation, the insurers’ instinctive feeling, which perhaps should even so be called principled, that their wording was not intended to render them immune from liability for this disease.</p>

In many cases of disease, where it could be said that the disease’s onset took place in that same year, there would be cover for disease too. Where the policy wording referred to “disease contracted”, cover would, for the reasons I have sought to explain above, extend to disease which could trace its origins to the year in question, even if not its onset. </p>

Indeed, on my understanding of these policies, the gap would be larger than the insurers themselves would really seek to allow, given the need for the injury to be sustained by an employee. Given the importance of industrial diseases for what is now the best part of a century, this would indeed, as it seems to me, be an unfortunate conclusion at which to arrive.   </p>

Where, however, it does develop, it proceeds from the noxious fibres which have been inhaled, and no one can say from which fibre or fibres, or from which day of inhalation, it proceeds. It may be true that until mesothelioma develops, the patient does not suffer from it. But has he not sustained an injury in the form of the assault of the fibres which he has inhaled, when mesothelioma has developed from that assault? He is worse off because of his exposure to the most noxious forms of asbestos, and his lungs contain hugely more numerous fibres, and of the more dangerous kinds, than the lungs of ordinary people.

That, it seems to me, is the overall learning of those cases. Where there is exposure, but as yet no onset of disease, there is at most trivial injury or damage but nothing that could at that stage create actionable liability. Where, however, mesothelioma develops, as in all our cases, it is the risk of mesothelioma created by the exposure which is the damage (see the citations of <span style="font-style:italic">Barker </span>at para 109 above). Lord Hope considered (in <span style="font-style:italic">Rothwell</span>, see para 113 above) that even in the absence of mesothelioma or some other disease, there was damage or injury at the time of exposure, but merely minimal damage or injury, such as did not create actionable liability. Where, however, mesothelioma does develop, it is the exposure, and the risk of mesothelioma, that is the damage. It is that for which the employer is liable. In other words, as it seems to me, the trivial injury or damage which is caused by each exposure in breach of duty, is likened to the scratch or bite or other trivial injury which, however, as time goes by, leads on to serious, or at any rate more than trivial, consequences.

It would also escape the essentially unknowable and serendipitous mystery of when mesothelioma actually onsets, which in certain circumstances would make it impossible to say whether the EL liability fell on one insurer rather than another, or fell within one wording or another, or was not covered at all. A legal understanding of the concept of “injury” which would compel such a profitless and ultimately unfathomable investigation is essentially anomalous. The anomaly increases when one considers that for all one knows (or could ever know) the inhalation of particular fibres in year x is the very thing which sets the disease in train.

It is even possible that this wording, which it will be recalled falls within the era of ELCIA 1969, and appears to have been recast with at least that in mind, albeit a few years after its entry into effect, goes further. At any rate linguistically, there is a reasonable case for saying that the words which apply to the phrase connoting the policy period are the words “engaged in and upon the service of the Insured and being in the Insured’s direct employment” etc, and do not include the phrase “injury sustained or disease contracted”. The difficulty with that interpretation is that it would lack a critical component for the trigger or time hook, other than the mere fact of employment within the relevant period. That, and the existence of a claim for injury or disease, would provide an enormously wide cover, beyond reasonable expectations. On that basis, it would be necessary to find an additional link, which could be either the sustaining of injury or contracting of disease, or could be the happening of the event which led to the liability for injury sustained or disease contracted. There is no express reference at all in the wording to the concept of causation, but it is inherent in the requirement of the employer’s liability. The point is a nice one. Commercial purpose supports the causative approach. So, for the reasons I have expressed above, does ELCIA 1969. In 1984 BAI expressly adopted causation wording (“in respect of Bodily Injury caused during the Period of Insurance to an Employee”). This wording was not in play on either action 1 (the Durham/Fern action) or on action 4 (the Bates action). However, an analogous issue arose on Independent’s wording, where it was called the “timelessness” point. In the circumstances, given my construction of “disease contracted”, the issue does not matter. On balance, however, I prefer the view that the injury or disease must have been sustained or contracted during the policy period. However, it is my opinion that in any event ELCIA 1969 required causation wording, and therefore, although that would not in itself assist the insured employer, it would give cover to a claimant seeking direct enforcement, by reason of the standard clause that “The indemnity granted by this Policy is deemed to be in accordance with the provisions of any law relating to compulsory insurance of liability to employees in Great Britain…” (see at para 61 above).        </p>

Injury must therefore be sustained, whether by accident or by disease, within the policy period. Despite the pressure produced by the policy’s commercial purpose, I do not feel able to say that something has gone wrong with the wording, so as to gloss the contractual language. I would have preferred to solve the problem by reference to the concept of “injury”, as above, but I am unable to do so. As it is, this example of wording is rather like <span style="font-style:italic">Wasa International v. Lexington </span>(see para 214 above). There, in the context of insurance and reinsurance contracts there was a presumption, born of the commercial purpose of the reinsurance contract in its context, that the terms and period of the insurance and reinsurance should be back to back. However, the language of the period term of the reinsurance contract was too strong to permit the presumption to take effect. Similarly here, the language of sustaining injury is in my judgment too strong to be able to give effect to the underlying commercial purpose. That is consistent with Excess’s exclusion in terms of “accidents occurring” outside Great Britain etc.  </p>

I grant that, and where no actionable injury at all has been suffered during the policy period (<span style="font-style:italic">Bolton</span>), there can be no indemnity. However, I would add the comment that, if it had been otherwise, and if, as I would prefer in the absence of <span style="font-style:italic">Bolton</span> to say, an incipient injury, however insignificant at that time, amounted to actionable injury in the light of the later onset of mesothelioma, the indemnity would, I consider, cover in the ordinary way all the damages flowing therefrom. </p>

Despite the still greater pressure produced by the purposes of that statute, I do not consider that I can produce a different construction from that of the materially identical previous wordings. Therefore, the insured will be required to repay to the insurer whatever the insurer pays to any employee claimant. However, the employee claimant would be entitled to recover under the special deeming clause of the policies of this era. It was not many years, however, until in 1976 Excess changed to causation wording. As it is, lead actions 3 and 5 which involve Excess in these proceedings concern policies which precede the coming into force of ELCIA 1969.</p>

This wording, like that of Excess, also contains a reference to the indemnity being for the insured’s liability to pay damages “for such injury”. There is, however, an exclusion of “liability in respect of injury or disease <span style="font-style:italic">caused elsewhere </span>than in Great Britain” etc (emphasis added). That exclusion, it seems to me cuts both ways. The reference to causation raises the question whether the underlying concept is that of causation. On the other hand, the adoption of the different expression “caused” is to be contrasted with the previous “sustain”. The contrast is again maintained in the exclusion for “injury or disease <span style="font-style:italic">sustained </span>by contractors to the Insured or such contractors’ employees” (emphasis added). Moreover, there is of course an inherent element of causation in the whole concept of EL insurance: to be liable, and to be entitled to an indemnity for such liability, the employer has to have caused the injury. In <span style="font-style:italic">Bolton </span>Longmore LJ did not consider that a similar point on an exclusion there assisted to introduce the concept of causation to the insuring clause (at para 21).

Thus liability to an employee who contracts mesothelioma at the time of his exposure to asbestos as an employee will be within the cover. I regard the expression earlier in the wording “injury or disease… suffered” as a gloss for “injury sustained or disease contracted”. My conclusions in this case therefore mirror those with respect to BAI’s similar wording. “Such” disease contracted during the currency of the policy is a fair reference to mesothelioma.  </p>

I do not think that the cover is therefore timeless, but a choice has to be made out of the wording of the clause as to the so-called trigger of Independent’s liability to indemnify. An obvious such candidate is the sustaining of injury or disease: “If any person who is under a contract of service…shall sustain bodily injury or disease”. However, this is the period of ELCIA 1969, and it is quite likely that it was for this reason that the matter was left deliberately vague. The EL insuring clause is to be contrasted with the PL insurance clause in Independent’s “Contractors’ Combined Policy”. The PL insurance clause states plainly that the trigger is “where such injury…happens <span style="font-style:italic">or</span> is caused…during the period of insurance” (emphasis added). That wording strongly suggests that the ambiguous wording of the EL insuring clause is not simply a matter of oversight. On balance, and in the light of the PL insuring clause, and the commercial purpose of EL insurance, and the purpose of ELCIA 1969, I consider that the trigger is better expressed in the following formula, viz: </p>

But I would have preferred, had precedent allowed me, to respect the commercial purpose of EL insurance, a fortiori during the ELCIA 1969 era, and to vindicate the industry’s attitude to such insurance over so many decades, up to <span style="font-style:italic">Bolton</span>, by acknowledging that, when mesothelioma develops, the “injury” of mesothelioma is sustained, in its origins, at the time when the insult of exposure, which materially increases the risk of developing mesothelioma, occurs.</p>

She accepts that nowadays, with the advance of modern medical knowledge, the position would be different. In my respectful judgment, however, subject to estoppel or binding custom, which does not arise, the evidence to which she refers does not support her conclusion. There was no reasonable understanding that sustained meant caused, or that sustained wording had the same effect as caused wording. It was rather that, in a period when the case of mesothelioma was less well known, and in the light of the fact that some 99% of injuries were caused and sustained at the same time, there was a mixture of reasons which led the parties to conclude that the effect of one wording gave the same result as the other. The fact that policies with different wordings were treated the same, does not I fear mean that they had the same meaning.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, it is difficult to give to “employees” a meaning which includes “ex-employees”. If that meaning was adopted, then the compulsory insurance would necessarily be retrospective in a most serious way, for if in 1972 an ex-employee who had not been employed by an employer for decades were to “sustain” mesothelioma, the employer’s liability to him would need to be covered: if it were not, the employer would be in breach of his obligations. It seems odd to think that the statute requires an employer to insure against liability for a breach of duty which had taken place decades ago. Moreover, none of the wordings considered in this appeal would extend to ex-employees, so that such an interpretation would, it seems, be foreign to the industry practice. This retrospective element would be removed if the statute only applied to “employees” within the period of the statute’s application, whom I might describe as “current employees”: and who it might be supposed, on Lord Justice  Burnton’s view, ought to remain covered (that is to say the employer’s liability to them ought to remain covered) after they had ceased to be employed (in or after 1972). However, it is just as or even more difficult to get this half-way house extension of the word “employees” to cover ex-employees. The injuries or disease of some ex-employees’ injuries or disease would be within the scope of the cover, but those of other ex-employees would not be. Again, this would be against the background of an industry whose wordings, on the evidence in this case and their construction on the ex-employee point, did not grant cover against liability to ex-employees. And yet the construction to cover ex-employees would need to be derived implicitly, rather than from the express language of the statute. I think this is too difficult, and I respectfully prefer to regard the statute as requiring causation wording, for the reasons which I have expressed above.</p>

Although our reasoning may differ, it seems to me that for one reason or another, the claimants have retained much, but not all, of their initial success. Where they have succeeded in terms of my judgment, they have succeeded in this court, because Lady Justice Smith would dismiss the appeal and uphold the judge in total. Where, however, they have failed in terms of my judgment, and on the other hand the insurers have succeeded, they have failed in this court and the insurers have succeeded, because Lord Justice Burnton’s judgment goes at least as far as I do (and in fact further) in allowing the insurers’ appeals.        </p>

Most of the contracts of insurance with which we are concerned were entered into between the late 1940s and 1983, although the MMI contracts continued until 1992 and the Zurich First Select contracts until about 1998. All the contracts of insurance provided cover against the employers’ liability to meet employees’ claims ranging over a wide variety of injuries and diseases but the particular context in which they must be construed is that relating to claims for mesothelioma.  </p>

This, say the appellant insurers, is materially different from the meaning of wording which provided an indemnity in respect of injuries caused during the policy period.  The appellant insurers contend that ‘causation wording’ provides an indemnity in respect of liability arising from exposure to asbestos during the policy period whereas ‘sustained wording’ provides cover in respect of an injury which actually materialises during the policy period.  The respondents to the appeal, (mainly claimants in the actions) contend that, at the time when the contracts were entered into, the sustained and causation wordings were understood to mean the same thing. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Because of the appellants’ contention, the focus of much of the evidence below was to establish when mesothelioma actually materialises.  The disease has been fully described by Rix LJ and Burton J as well as by Longmore LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Bolton Metropolitan Borough Council v Municipal Mutual Insurance Ltd</span> [2006] EWCA Civ 50 (<span style="font-style:italic">Bolton</span>).  This disease was not recognised medically until about the mid-1950s.  From that time it was known to be causally associated with exposure to asbestos.   It was also known that it did not usually manifest itself for many years after the exposure, often many years after all asbestos exposure had ceased.  The disease was more generally recognised as the result of publications in 1965.  But at that time, very little was known about the aetiology and pathogenesis of the disease and in particular about the physical changes which occurred between the inhalation of the asbestos and the manifestation of the disease.  In the years between 1965 and 2008 when Burton J heard medical evidence, a great deal of research has been done into the aetiology of mesothelioma. Medical knowledge and understanding have advanced.   The medical evidence put before Burton J (and indeed the slightly different evidence which was put before the court in <span style="font-style:italic">Bolton</span>) was based upon the medical knowledge and understanding of the late 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> century.  The disease is still not completely understood but much more is known than was known, say, fifty years ago. It is now known that the disease does not occur until many years after exposure.  For many years after exposure the exposed person’s bodily defence mechanisms either expel or at least cope with the asbestos fibres.  In many cases, the defence mechanisms will cope for the whole of the exposed persons’ lives and the disease will not occur.  But for the unfortunate few, the time comes when the defence mechanisms fail and the asbestos in the body triggers the onset of the disease.  Burton J estimated that, in most cases, that occurs about five years before the disease manifests itself in symptoms, usually of breathlessness and, later, pain. In <span style="font-style:italic">Bolton</span> Longmore LJ estimated period at about ten years.</p>

I would accept that, if a policy with sustained wording was entered into in the 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> century, it would be construed so as to cover liability for disease which manifested itself about 5 years after the policy period.

Burton J discussed the authorities at some length in his paragraphs 202 to 204, an analysis with which I respectfully agree and adopt.  The authorities show that the meaning to be given to contractual words is that which the parties to the contract must be taken to have intended them to have.  That meaning is to be ascertained objectively from consideration of the meaning of the words themselves, in the context of the contract and set in the factual matrix which must be taken to have been available to the parties. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It seems to me that the test required the judge (and now requires this court) to construe each policy in the light of the factual matrix as it existed at the time the contract was entered into. If that is different from a factual matrix which came into being at a later date, the meaning of the same policy wording may well be different as between those two dates. Thus, as I have said, if the sustained wording was used in a policy taken out in the 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> century, the current medical understanding of the aetiology of mesothelioma would be a relevant and important part of the factual matrix of the contract.  Because the factual matrix would have included an understanding that the injury of mesothelioma (and possibly many other occupational cancers) does not occur (or is not suffered or sustained) until many years after exposure, the use of the sustained wording would indicate that the parties intended that cover should be provided in respect of the policy year in which the injury actually developed which might be many years after exposure.   But if the policy was taken out in the middle years of the 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> century, that modern medical understanding is irrelevant.  None of the businessmen, whether insurers or employers who used asbestos products, could possibly be taken to have had in mind the kind of knowledge which the medical experts provided in this case and in <span style="font-style:italic">Bolton</span>. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">What knowledge and information was current in the insurance and industrial worlds at the various material dates when these policies were taken out?  Much evidence was given of this. Some of it was treated as being given more in support of an attempt to establish a universal custom or usage than as evidence of the factual matrix against which the various policies were entered into. However, much of the evidence is relevant to both issues.  Burton J discussed this evidence at his paragraphs 180 to 201.  Rix LJ summarises the evidence starting at his paragraph 192.   I do not intend to repeat all this evidence.  It included evidence of the practice by which insurers paid out for mesothelioma claims.  The evidence was that, whether the policy wording was ‘injury sustained’ or ‘injury caused’, insurers paid out on policies which were in force at the time of exposure.  However, there were hardly any claims at all until the early 1980s and even then there was only a trickle. Accordingly, I do not think it could be said that the practice of paying out by reference to time of exposure could be said to be part of the factual matrix for policies which were taken out before about 1990 and we are concerned mainly with a period well before that.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, I do consider that there is relevance in the evidence recorded in Rix LJ’s paragraph 193 quoting part of Burton J’s paragraph 186, which describes the universal understanding on both sides of the contractual divide that all EL policies were regarded in the same way regardless of whether the policy wording used ‘injury sustained’ or ‘injury caused’.  This universal understanding did not relate specifically to cases of mesothelioma, of which there were very few if any in the early days; it related to disease cases generally.    </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Burton J recorded that there were many differing reasons or understandings for this universal understanding.  But whatever the varied reasoning, the position taken was common to all.  That position was that the differences of wording did not matter.  As Dr Frank Eaglestone, the retired deputy general manager of Federated (later Independent) whose evidence the judge accepted, explained, there was never any doubt that the purpose of EL insurance was to provide the insured with cover for the liability it incurred as the result of its activities during the period of the policy.  So far as dust diseases were concerned, he said that the understanding was that the seed of the disease was sown when the noxious dust was inhaled.  Therefore there was liability under the EL policy in force at the time of inhalation, whichever wording was used. It would be wrong, he said, for the insured not be covered for the mistakes he made during the period of cover.  Several other insurance witnesses gave evidence to similar effect. Other witnesses stressed that this understanding did not relate to any particular disease; what mattered was that the policy should cover all eventualities arising out of the activities in the policy period.   This understanding was not limited to the insurers’ side of the contractual divide.  Witnesses called by the claimants reported a similar understanding.  The evidence also showed that it was well recognised that cover was to be provided for torts committed during the policy period even though the disease might not manifest itself for years after the exposure had ceased.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The judge held that the payment practices of the various insurers did not amount to a legally binding usage and that is now accepted on both sides.  However, the fact that the practice was not a legally binding usage does not mean that the attitudes and common understanding which underlay the practice were not part of the factual matrix against which the contracts were entered into.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It seems to me not surprising that this common understanding existed.  Medical understanding about the aetiology of occupational diseases was limited and there seems to have been very little if any discussion or argument in the world of insurers and their EL customers about when particular forms of industrial disease occurred or were sustained.  In the context of limitation, there was some discussion about when actionable injury occurred in disease cases (<span style="font-style:italic">Cartledge v Jopling </span>[1963] AC 758) and it was recognised that, in the stone dust pneumoconiosis under consideration in that case (the aetiology of which does not seem to have been well understood at the time) actionable injury was suffered at some indeterminable date between the date of exposure and the date at which symptoms manifested themselves.  All the court could say in that case was that the more than minimal damage required for actionable injury had occurred more than three years before issue of the writ.  It was not until <span style="font-style:italic">Bryce v Swan Hunter</span> [1987] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 426 that people in the industry began to think about what exposure was potentially causative of the disease of mesothelioma. It was not until <span style="font-style:italic">Jameson </span>in the 1990s that people began to think about when injury was suffered or sustained in a mesothelioma case and no authoritative decision was promulgated until the <span style="font-style:italic">Bolton</span> case was begun at about the turn of the century. In short, in the years with which we are concerned in this case, there was nothing to disturb the assumption or understanding held by many people on both sides of the EL insurance industry that lung diseases were suffered or sustained at the time of exposure, at least in the sense that, although the disease was not yet actionable, the seed had been sown and its development had become inevitable. The fact that that understanding was not universally held does not matter. It was commonly held and can therefore be taken as part of the factual matrix of the time.     </p>

Looked at through the eyes of an objective and contemporaneous observer of the contractual arrangements made between the 1940s and, say, the mid-1990s, the meaning of a policy using the ‘sustained’ wording would be understood to be the same as a policy using ‘causation’ wording.    </p>

It is possible that the common understanding which formed part of the factual matrix during the previous fifty years was beginning to change towards the end of this period. There was before the court no evidence, so far as I can discern, from which one could determine exactly when the two sides of the insurance industry should be considered to have appreciated that some diseases, including mesothelioma, do not occur until many years after exposure to the causative agent. When that was appreciated, parties signing an insurance contract using the sustained wording must have been taken to have intended that cover should be provided for those liabilities arising as the result of injuries actually occurring during the policy period. My inclination would be to hold that that change did not occur until the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Bolton </span>after the turn of the century.

We are concerned with the interpretation and effect of relatively straightforward contracts of insurance in a number of standard forms. The difficulties of application arise because these forms were in general designed to address what has always been the most common cause of employee claims against employers, namely accidents causing immediate injury. The difficulties have been increased by changes in the understanding of the aetiology of disease and to some extent by developments in the law of tort made by the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Fairchild</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Barker v. Corus </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Rothwell</span>. However, I think that in <span style="font-style:italic">Fairchild </span>the House of Lords did no more than apply the common law as explained in <span style="font-style:italic">Bonningtons </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">McGhee. </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Court was treated to a fascinating but I think essentially irrelevant study of the WCA and the numerous authorities wrestling with their application. While it is theoretically possible for the provisions of repealed legislation to affect the meaning of a contract of insurance entered into some time after its repeal, the possibility is remote. It would require a course of dealing between insurer and insured reaching back to the currency of those enactments giving rise to an estoppel by convention. There was no trace of anything like this in the pleadings or in the evidence. In my judgment, there was nothing in the material before the Court to suggest that the meaning of any of the policies in question as between the particular insurers and insureds in question differed in any way whatsoever from their meaning as between those insurers and other insureds. I protested during the hearing, and I protest now, at the suggestion, implicit in the submissions referring to and relying upon the terms of the WCA and the citation of authorities on the application of that legislation, that Bob the Builder, when he took out an EL policy years after the repeal of the Acts, either knew or could or should be taken to have known of the history of that legislation and the numerous authorities relating to it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Furthermore, and in this I reluctantly differ from Rix LJ, in my judgment little if any assistance is to be gained by reference to the commercial purpose of EL insurance. The commercial purpose was to provide the cover defined in the policy. The cover provided by every policy was defined by the terms of the policy. The policies included express conditions and exclusions and in some cases extensions that make it impossible to maintain that the insurers gave, or that the employers contracted for, cover more comprehensive than those terms conferred.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">When interpreting the policies, it must be remembered that they were in general annual (and always time-limited) policies. It was always theoretically possible for an employer to change his EL insurer. Hence the inclusion of time restrictions in policies. In theory at least, the identification of a particular year of cover as that conferring indemnity might affect reinsurance liabilities, which too could vary from year to year.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is now agreed that the practice of insurers of accepting liability before the decision of this Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Bolton</span> is irrelevant to the interpretation of the policies.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The last of my general observations is that it seems to me that there is not as strong a moral imperative to find the insurers liable as there rightly is to hold the employers liable. It was the employers’ activities that caused their former employees’ mesothelioma. If their employees’ exposure to asbestos fibres could and should have been prevented or reduced, that was the fault of their employers, not the insurers. The insurers, if liable, undertook in their contracts liabilities generally that were not predicted or foreseen by either employers or insurers. As between insurer and insured, I do not see any moral imperative. The moral imperative in favour of the employees and their dependants is that in the absence of insurance liability many of them will not be compensated for their suffering, early death and loss.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, in my judgment, employees did not suffer or sustain an injury within the meaning of the policies when they were exposed to asbestos. We are bound by the decision of this Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Bolton</span>, but I find the logic of the judgment of Longmore LJ convincing. It follows that if the only relevant cover was for injury sustained during a period of insurance by a person who was an employee during that period, the policy would not provide indemnity. In my judgment, injury was not suffered until at the earliest the onset of malignancy. The fact that the malignancy is unknown and presently unknowable is irrelevant.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">More difficult is the question whether an employee “contracted” the disease whenever he was exposed. If an employer changed his insurer after year 1, and both insurers undertook cover for diseases contracted during the policy year, did the employee exposed to asbestos in years 1 and 2 contract mesothelioma in both years? The Oxford English Dictionary gives as a meaning of the verb contract “to become infected with”. Employees were not infected with mesothelioma when they were exposed to asbestos. However, it may be that the OED definition reflects now obsolete understanding of the aetiology or pathogenesis of disease. “Contract” connotes a link, a drawing together (its etymology is from <span style="font-style:italic">con</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">trahere</span>), and there is a link between exposure and disease. So, not without hesitation, I would hold that mesothelioma may be contracted when exposure occurs.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A policy with this wording (i.e., the wording of section 1 (1)) provides cover to an employer, and a policy with the ELCIA 1969 endorsement provides security to an employee, in the case of employees or former employees who, during the period of insurance, develops a malignancy resulting from previous exposure while he was an employee. I have on balance concluded that “employees” includes former employees who claim against their former employer for “bodily injury or disease sustained by [them during the period of insurance], and arising out of and in the course of their employment in Great Britain in that business”.  However, I regret that I cannot agree with Rix LJ that the statute is to be interpreted as requiring causation wording. Section 1(1) requires the employer to have cover in respect of “bodily injury or disease <span style="font-style:italic">sustained</span>” not “<span style="font-style:italic">caused”. </span></p>
