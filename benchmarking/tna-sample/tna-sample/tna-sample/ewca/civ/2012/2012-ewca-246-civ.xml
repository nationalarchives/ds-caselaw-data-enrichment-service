	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This is the judgment of the court. This appeal is about the sale and hire purchase of a vintage Bentley, at a price of £425,000. Large as that sum is, the damages at issue are comparatively small and have been dwarfed by the costs of the litigation. After a year of happy motoring the purchaser stopped paying the hire instalments, while she considered down-sizing her commitments. She then consulted Bonhams, the well-known auction house, with a view to selling the car, and received what she considered to be disturbing news about the nature of her purchase and its value. As it happens, there is no issue in this litigation about value: it is accepted that the car was (more than) worth its price. There are, however, substantial issues as to whether the car was properly described either by the Bentley dealer (by which I refer to both the man and his company) in his dealings with the purchaser, or in the hire purchase contract. The finance house terminated its contract with the purchaser for non-payment. The car was returned or repossessed by the finance house. The dealer made a swift offer to repurchase the car for the price for which he had sold it to the finance house, namely the £425,000<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> Nominally £430,000, but there was a rebate of £5,000</p>
	      </authorialNote>. That offer was in the end accepted, but not, as it was originally intended, as facilitating a tripartite settlement of the whole dispute. (The car has since been resold by the dealer, after further work on it, for £675,000.) That repurchase has ensured, at any rate ultimately, that the financial remedies sought by the parties are comparatively small. The purchaser claimed £94,555 (the deposit and instalments paid by her under the hire purchase contract) from both the dealer and the finance house. The finance house counterclaimed £61,224 (a sum much reduced by reason of the resale of the car back to the dealer), mainly made up of the expenses of recovery, storage and such like. The judge awarded the claim of £94,555 against the dealer and the finance house, and dismissed the finance house’s counterclaim.</p>

He did, however, dispute that he had warranted that the car’s engine was a “Speed Six engine” (authentic or otherwise).

Consequential matters were debated before the judge. Among those matters were the dealer’s and the finance house’s applications for permission to appeal. Lengthy draft grounds of appeal had been submitted in advance of the hearing on behalf of the dealer and briefer grounds were put forward on the day of the hearing on behalf of the finance house. Those draft grounds were responding to judgment 2. They were already essentially in the form before this court. Among the grounds put forward on behalf of the dealer were those that must have made unpleasant reading for the judge, viz that he had failed to address important submissions, that there was the appearance of bias, and that the trial had been unfair. A retrial was requested.</p>

The judge, having dismissed an application for summary judgment on a claim pleaded in contract and negligence, and having said moreover that the claim as so pleaded was bound to fail, had altered his order, after judgment but before his order’s perfection, so as to grant permission to the claimant, on her post-judgment application, to amend her pleading so as to claim in conversion and thus to save her action for the future. On appeal this court held by a majority that the alteration did not fall within the exceptional nature of the jurisdiction: the appeal was therefore allowed with the consequence that the action was dismissed. However, there was there no change in the judge’s judgment, other than in the ultimate outcome: indeed the judge had invited the claimant to amend her pleading to claim in conversion, but it was not until after the judge’s order made in court that, following new advice, she had expressed any wish to do so.</p>

This court held that he was entitled to do so, indeed “since he was persuaded that his initial view was wrong, he was positively obliged to alter it” (at [98] per May LJ, see also [113] per Mance LJ). There were exceptional circumstances, if they were required (at [98]). As for the judge’s final judgment, that on balance survived what May LJ thought in the circumstances was the “inevitable, or at least highly likely” appeal (at [95]). The subject matter of the dispute was a claim under the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975 concerning which a trial judge had to make an assessment which, because it involved the weighing of various factors, was not easily interfered with by a higher court.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">“[94] Once a judgment has been handed down or given, there are obvious reasons why the court should hesitate long and hard before making a material alteration to it…The cases also acknowledge that there may very occasionally be circumstances in which a judge not only can, but should make a material alteration in the interests of justice. There may for instance be a palpable error in the judgment and an alteration would save the parties the expense of an appeal. On the other hand, reopening contentious matters or permitting one or more of the parties to add to their case or make a new case should rarely be allowed. Any attempt to do so is likely to receive summary rejection in most cases. It will only very rarely be appropriate for parties to attempt to do so. This necessarily means that the court would only be persuaded to do so in exceptional circumstances, but that expression by itself is no more than a relatively uninformative label. It is not profitable to debate what it means in isolation from the facts of a particular case.     </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">[95] The practice of providing the parties’ legal representatives with a draft of written reserved judgments a day or two before the date appointed for handing them down is intended to promote efficiency and economy. Typographical corrections may be made so that the judgment is available in its final form for publication on the day it is handed down. The parties are enabled to agree the form of any order and consequential order, for instance as to costs. The court time taken in delivering the judgment is reduced to a minimum. In many cases, the parties are relieved from the expense of their lawyers attending when the judgment is handed down. The standard notice on a draft judgment states the purpose of making it available and the limitations on its use and publication. It is not provided so that the parties may reopen its substance. If a draft judgment is altered materially after it has been provided to the lawyers but before it is handed down, that fact will become known to the clients. As a minimum, disappointment may ensue. The possibility of an appeal based on the differences between the draft judgment and the handed down judgment is increased. This was certainly so in the present case in which, as Rix LJ indicated in <span style="font-style:italic">Noga v Abacha</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">[96] It scarcely needs saying that judges should not send draft judgments to the parties’ legal representatives in accordance with the Practice Direction, if they themselves perceive a risk that they may want to change them materially before they hand them down. More importantly, perhaps, parties should understand that this procedure is not an invitation to the court to reopen or add to contentious matters. The court will only exceptionally make material alterations to a draft judgment provided in this way. So perhaps the uninformative label “exceptional circumstances” needs to be appended to the exercise of the jurisdiction. I personally prefer Rix LJ’s “strong reasons”, but that again is only a label. The question whether to exercise the jurisdiction can only depend on the circumstances of the particular case…</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">[98] The circumstances of the case will usually include the possibility and appropriateness of an appeal. The court in which the problem arises may be a consideration, since appeals in lower courts are generally less troublesome and expensive for the parties than appeals at higher levels. I have indicated my view that there is a material distinction between a judgment which has been handed down or given and a draft judgment which has not yet been handed down. There is also, in my view, a significant difference between a case in which one or more of the parties want to persuade a reluctant judge to reconsider a draft judgment; and a case where the judge himself has decided that his draft judgment is wrong. In the latter case, at least where the judgment is only a draft, I consider that the judge is positively obliged to alter it, however the consequences of doing so may appear. It cannot be right for the law to require a judge to hand down for the first time a judgment which he believes to be wrong…”</p>

The judge was not having second thoughts about his judgment: on the contrary he had formally handed down judgment 3 despite the criticisms made of it (in the form of judgment 2) in the draft grounds of appeal which had been supplied to him. Nor were any of the parties requesting him to reconsider or amend his judgment. He had already adopted in that judgment 3 all the corrections which had been suggested to him by the parties in the light of the distribution of draft judgment 2, as well as made some other not insubstantial changes. On the contrary, the appellants here, the dealer and the finance house, were asking for his permission to appeal from his judgment, on the grounds that it contained errors of law and fact, and in the case of Mr Ticciati’s grounds, that the whole process of trial had  displayed unfairness and apparent bias. In as much as any of those grounds complained of the judge’s failure to deal with matters at trial which had been made the subject matter of submissions to him, Mr Ticciati made it clear that he was not saying that he required further reasons. He wanted to go to appeal.</p>

In this connection, on 5 October 2010 he mentioned <span style="font-style:italic">Malaba v.

Emery Reimbold &amp; Strick Ltd </span>[2002] EWCA Civ 605, [2002] 1 WLR 2409 as encouraging a judge, to whom an application for permission to appeal on the ground of lack of reasons is made, to consider whether he can supply the reasons whose absence is complained of and thus avoid having to give permission to appeal (at 1519). The judge chose to adopt that course: but it was a dangerous course to take in circumstances where this was not the sort of case discussed in <span style="font-style:italic">English </span>(or <span style="font-style:italic">Flannery v.

This was rather a case where the judge had handed down a lengthy judgment but, unfortunately, it was being submitted that his judgment, by reason of errors of both commission and omission, demonstrated apparent bias, all of which required review on appeal. In such a case, and where there was no request for further reasons from him but on the contrary a request that he do not add to his reasons, the judge ought to have been extremely cautious about revisiting his judgment. </p>

The claimant and purchaser of the car is Mrs Mercedes Brewer, a practising US attorney and a practising English solicitor. In this court she is the respondent. She married her husband, Mr Peter Brewer, in 2002. He was a modern car dealer in the 1960s and 1970s and is now a business consultant. He has been a vintage Bentley car enthusiast for many years. He has owned a number of vintage cars, including a 1926 3-litre Bentley. He is particularly knowledgeable about Bentley Speed Sixes. Following her marriage, Mrs Brewer acquired from her husband an enthusiasm for vintage racing Bentleys in general and Speed Sixes in particular. When we say that she is the purchaser, we mean that she took the car on hire purchase from the finance house, having agreed a price with the dealer.

They are respectively the first and third defendants and in this court the first and third appellants. Mr Mann is perhaps the foremost dealer in England in vintage Bentleys, about which he is both an enthusiast and a connoisseur. He has been maintaining and restoring vintage Bentleys and dealing in them since 1975. He has his business premises in Radlett, Hertfordshire. He carries out his business through SMRL. If any liability attaches to the seller in respect of Mrs Brewer’s claim, there is an issue as to whether it rests on Mr Mann personally, or on his company, or on both. The judge found that it rested on both. It was SMRL which sold the car to the finance house, having agreed a price with Mrs Brewer of £430,000, subsequently reduced to £425,000. Mrs Brewer paid a deposit of £40,000 directly to SMRL and subsequently received a rebate of £5,000, which was repaid to her by SMRL by cheque. It is convenient to finesse the issue concerning the party responsible for any collateral warranty given to Mrs Brewer by speaking generally of the “dealer”, but we will also refer to Mr Mann and to his company, by which we will not necessarily intend to exclude the other. </p>

For instance, it is submitted in the appeal that the judge fundamentally erred in his dealing with the credibility of the main witnesses, Mr and Mrs Brewer and Mr Mann, and misunderstood or misinterpreted the evidence of the experts; and that he created issues where there were none. We are conscious of course that there are grave difficulties for any appellant who wishes to challenge the essential findings of a trial judge, especially where they derive from his views as to the credibility of the witnesses he has heard.

However, one of the central issues in the case was whether any contractual warranty was given to Mrs Brewer by the dealer in those terms, and whether the reference to such a car in Fortis’s contract with Mrs Brewer rendered that contract a bailment “by description”: and if so, whether the car complied with that description. Be that as it may, it is convenient to refer to the car as a “1930 Bentley Speed Six”, without prejudice to those issues. The judge himself began his judgment (para 1), in a sentence which goes back to judgment 2 and survived into judgment 4, by saying that “The car was delivered from the Bentley Cricklewood works in 1930”. However, by the end of his judgment, he had concluded that “there was no way that the car could be authenticated as a Speed Six or, indeed as a vintage Bentley” (judgment 4, para 189) and that “Part of the front section of the chassis and its attached chassis number is the only surviving part of the 1930 Speed Six car that had originally been delivered to Miss Unwin” (its first owner) “in February 1930” (para 247(5) of judgment 4).</p>

It is not unusual to find that the superstructure, that is to say the bodywork, itself the masterwork of various coachbuilders, has been completely replaced, as had occurred in the case of the car with which we are concerned. It had started life in 1930 with a saloon body built on the Weymann principle by a coachbuilder known as Freestone &amp; Webb. However, as sold to Mrs Brewer, the car had (as of 1980 or thereabouts) been fitted with a new, replica, bodywork in the style of the coachbuilder Van de Plas’s Le Mans (1929-1930) body. Mrs Brewer knew that, and it is not a matter of complaint. Other parts of the car have inevitably had to be replaced with entirely modern equivalents: as an example we mention the car’s braking system which, in order to meet modern MOT requirements (if the car was to be raced, which it was restored to be capable of), is on modern hydraulic principles. </p>

And did the car meet that description, if it was a warranted description? Mr Mann’s case in this respect was essentially in two parts. First, he says that the definitive test of a car being a Bentley Speed Six is that it contains some part of the original chassis with its original chassis number stamped upon it. In all other respects the car may have been more or less entirely rebuilt. It is only in this respect that the car need be or can perhaps be said to be original or authentic. This is a definition which he says is accepted and acknowledged by the prestigious Bentley Drivers Club (BDC) and by the DVLA authorities and is recognised in the market generally and internationally. He says that he is supported in that approach by the evidence of both expert witnesses at trial. Secondly, if one goes beyond that, he says the question becomes philosophical, and a matter of opinion rather than fact, bound up with the question of how much restoration or rebuilding (reference is also made to “reconstruction”) is permitted before it becomes impossible to say of a car that it is what it once was. However, it is not necessary, he says, for a 1930 Bentley Speed Six to have a 1930 Bentley Speed Six engine in it.</p>

It follows that anyone who consults the relatively small number of Speed Six entries in <span style="font-style:italic">Hay </span>will know immediately that the car’s original engine had the number NH 2732. The entry contains two photographs of the car, described as “Chassis SB 2770”: one as it was in 1938, when owned by a Mr Charles Mortimer, that photograph being reprinted from “an article about the four Speed Sixes he owned in 1937/39, published in <span style="font-style:italic">The Autocar</span>, 27 October 1944”; the other as it was in the late 1970s “outside Stanley Mann’s workshop during rebuild in VdP four-seater form with Le Mans petrol tank and hydraulic brakes”.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, in 1936 the original engine NH 2732 became fitted into another Bentley, as appears from the Bonhams sale particulars of a car auctioned in California in August 2008. The judge regarded those particulars as being correct, on the basis of which it can be said that the engine was removed from Miss Unwin’s car at some time between its delivery and 1936. Thus chassis no 2770 and engine number NH 2732 did not spend long together. After the 1944 <span style="font-style:italic">Autocar </span>entry, the car is lost sight of until the corroded chassis, with two axles and a steering column, were bought by Mr Mann in July 1976 for £2,100 from a Mr Tony Townshend, who was a restorer of vintage cars. Mr Townshend told Mr Mann that the chassis and the axles and steering column came from the same car. Mr Mann had wanted to go racing with a Speed Six, was looking for an original to rebuild, and was told by Mr Townshend that he had a Speed Six chassis. Thus, as the judge accepted, Mr Mann first acquired the chassis for himself, as an “original Speed Six which he could restore, rebuild or reconstruct to his own specification” (judgment 4, para 54). The July 1976 purchase is evidenced by a contemporary purchase note in Mr Mann’s manuscript. It reads: “PG 6345 Chassis SB 2770 (Speed Six) with axles and steering column. In need of restoration.” Mr Mann spent the next four years on that restoration. A 1978 invoice from his expert restorer, Mr Julian Ghosh of Sutton Coalfield, referred to “repair work on Bentley Speed Six chassis SB2770 so as to be suitable for vintage racing”.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As for the car’s engine, it is common ground that it started life, for it too has an original engine number stamped upon it, in a 1927 Bentley Standard 6½ litre car. That was just before the development of the Speed Six and its engine. It is also common ground therefore that the engine could not be described as a “1930 Bentley Speed Six engine” or even a “Speed Six engine”. However, Mr Mann’s case is that the engine was not so referred to, but as a replacement engine “prepared to Speed Six specification”. This is what Mr Mann wrote about the engine in his response dated 14 August 2008 to Mrs Brewer’s letter before action:</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">“For the avoidance of doubt, let me explain right away the difference between a standard Six engine and a Speed Six engine. Both have the same crank case design, both have the same block design, save for improved porting for better gas flow on the Speed model engine, Both have the same sump design, both have the same ignition. The Speed model has two carburettors instead of a single unit. The Speed model has uprated compression pistons, while a choice of camshaft was available. The horsepower output was increased by virtue of these modifications by around 15%. The car in question has all of the features, including the single port Speed model block, which the Speed model specification offered. It has the uprated horsepower. Only the crank case is from a standard car, but is identical to the Speed Six crank case. This part of the engine bears the engine number WK2671.”</p>

Thus both the Standard and the Speed Six engines were of 6½ litre. The Standard engine crank case and the Speed Six engine crank case had always been identical. The superimposed engine block in the case of engine number WK 2671 had been modified to Speed Six specification, and thus had the physical appearance of a Speed Six engine. The critical feature of the Speed Six specification in this respect was a single large port inlet manifold, but all other physical features of a Speed Six specification were also present in the engine. The performance specification of a Speed Six engine was superior to that of a Standard engine, but there was no pleaded complaint about the car’s or the engine’s performance. On the contrary, the Brewers had nothing but compliments for the car’s performance. In his judgments, however, the judge criticised the engine’s performance capabilities, essentially it would seem as having been unproven. Mr Ticciati (for Mr Mann) complains that in this respect the judge committed two serious errors: one was to hold an unpleaded complaint against the dealer; the other was in any event to reverse the burden of proof. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Standard 6½ engine number WK 2671 had started life in a Bentley Standard model with chassis number FW 2614, which had been delivered from the Cricklewood works in January 1927 to its first owner Mr G T Applethwaite. This too is to be found documented in <span style="font-style:italic">Hay </span>(and <span style="font-style:italic">Sedgwick</span>). <span style="font-style:italic">Hay </span>comments: “Engine and f/axle fitted to other cars”. The next that is heard of this engine is that it was bought by Mr Mann from Mr Ulf Smith, a Swedish collector and restorer of vintage Bentleys, in March 1978, for £2,000. The invoice from Mr Smith to Mr Mann refers to “Bentley 6½ litre engine no. WK2671.” Mr Brewer got in touch with Mr Smith for the purposes of the trial. In an email dated 27 January 2010 Mr Smith described himself as “a Bentley fanatic, have owned 27 W.O. Bentleys and rebuilt 21, most of them complete rebuilds”. In another email dated 5 February 2010 Mr Smith recalled having two 6½ litre engines which he sold to Mr Mann. One of them came from a Mr Waldie Greyvensteyn, a South African. Mr Smith also said that one of them “had been upgraded to Sp. 6 spec. which, of course, was done to a large number of them, some by Bentley motors, some by H.M. Bentley and so forth”. The reference to Mr Greyvensteyn is relevant to engine number WK 2671, for Mr Mann recalled in his evidence that it was shipped to him directly from South Africa, and that Mr Smith, who had bought it from Mr Greyvensteyn, had never even seen it. When it arrived, said Mr Mann, it was already in its modified form to Speed Six specification; which is what Mr Smith had said in his email, but he must have got that from Mr Mann, for he had never seen it himself. The judge, however, was to find that this was untrue, and that the modification was carried out by Mr Mann himself, after its purchase. The judge regarded this as going to Mr Mann’s credibility. It was not otherwise a legally relevant issue in the case. The engine had been advertised by Mr Greyvensteyn in BDC’s December 1976 newsletter, for exchange, as a “Touring 6½-litre engine, no WR 2671” with missing parts and damage (where “WR” was simply a mistake for “WK”). The judge relied in part on the fact that both Mr Greyvensteyn’s advertisement and Mr Smith’s invoice had not referred to the engine as a “Speed Six” engine. But then it was not a Speed Six engine.</p>

There is also a note of an engine number TW 2710. This was the number of the other engine which Mr Mann had bought from Mr Smith, possibly in 1979, although there is a purchase note dated 9 March 1981, written up by Mr Mann and countersigned by Mr Smith, reading “Purchased from UJG Smith Engine for Speed Six PG 6345 Eng No TW2710. Now paid for…£2480”. PG 6345 was of course the original registration number of chassis number SB 2770 (see <span style="font-style:italic">Hay </span>etc and the purchase note of the chassis from Mr Townshend. It might be that this registration number was also to be found on the chassis, which was Mr Mann’s evidence). Engine number TW 2710 was regarded by the judge as a Speed Six engine, but that would not seem to be correct for it is said by <span style="font-style:italic">Hay </span>to come from chassis number TW 2705, which was a Standard 6½ litre car. The suggestion put to Mr Mann in cross-examination was that engine number TW 2710 was Mr Mann’s first thoughts for installation in the car with the chassis number SB 2770. That is supported by the fact that <span style="font-style:italic">Hay </span>refers to chassis number SB 2770 as “Now VdP 4 seater with engine TW 2710 ex ch. TW 2705”. Mr Mann said he had been indecisive about which engine to install, but ultimately installed the engine number WK 2671, the modified Standard engine. </p>

That application form has a manuscript notation on it, put there by the DVLC: “Vehicle inspected…Reg. Mark confirmed by ‘All the Pre War Bentleys’ p52 written by S Sedgwick”.

However, Mrs Brewer’s case, as confirmed on her behalf at this appeal by her counsel, Mr Raoul Downey, was <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> based on this advertising or sales material. There was moreover no case of misrepresentation at trial (although one had been pleaded). It was common ground that the car had been sold as a 1930 Bentley Speed Six, and a critical issue at trial was what that entailed, and whether the car conformed. The other main element of Mrs Brewer’s case was what had been said at a meeting of 20 May 2007, for which she relied on the collateral warranty that the car contained an authentic Speed Six engine. Nevertheless, Mr Downey submitted that the judge was entitled “to take account” of the misleading nature of this material.

The report refers to the availability of records, which if consulted would show what was known of the relevant chassis and engine numbers quoted. In those circumstances it is hard to see why anything is assumed. It states that vehicles with original bodies demand a premium, but the firm would not have known from the website whether the car had an original body or not. It states that price may vary enormously (by a factor of more than twelve) depending on condition and provenance. The firm knew nothing about either, other than that the car was restored by Mr Mann in 1980 and had been with its last owner for 26 years. It knew nothing about whether or not it had “a continuous history and other significant Speed Six parts”. The huge disparity of possible valuations, and the specific valuations cited of cars sold in 2004 and 2006, would naturally suggest that our car was not in the same league as the two examples, and came towards the bottom end of the range of value. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On the same day Mr Mann drew up an invoice on his standard stationery, headed “Stanley Mann Racing” with a reference at the foot to “Stanley Mann Racing Limited”. It described the car simply as “Bentley Motor Car” not “1930 Bentley Speed Six”, but it separately stated its “Year” as “1930”. It gave chassis number, engine number (WK 2671, the correct number) and registration number. It was signed by Mr Mann “For and on behalf of Stanley Mann Racing Ltd”. This was the first specific evidence in the case of SMRL being involved. However, it is clear that a copy of that invoice was emailed to Mr Hardiman and by Mr Hardiman to Mr Brewer on that day, from which time Mrs Brewer must be assumed to have known of Mr Mann’s company. As for the invoice’s “Bentley Speed Six”, the judge said that it was “in blatant disregard of Mr Hardiman’s request” (at judgment 4, para 160(6)(d), not found in the earlier judgments). But Mr Mann has never disputed that he presented the car to the Brewers as a 1930 Speed Six.</p>

She had meanwhile, through her husband, paid a deposit of £40,000 to SMRL on behalf of Fortis in anticipation of those contractual arrangements. In as much as Mr Mann either on his own behalf or on behalf of SMRL had made any representations relied on as collateral warranties, ie as warranties collateral to Mrs Brewer’s hire purchase contract with Fortis, such warranties, as we would tend to think, could not have taken effect before either 5 June 2007 at the earliest, when Mr Brewer paid the £40,000 deposit, or 7 June 2007, when the anticipated contracts between SMRL and Fortis, and between Fortis and Mrs Brewer, were completed. We make those points because, as will be seen below, the judge developed a much more complicated contractual analysis, whose development continued between judgments 3 and 4. These dates and analysis are relevant to the question of whether the collateral warranties were given by Mr Mann personally or by SMRL.</p>

Its details were otherwise the same as the sale invoice issued to Fortis, that is to say it referred to a “Bentley Motor Car”, of year 1930, and gave its registration, chassis and engine numbers. The judge held it against Mr Mann that he (or SMRL) did not have title to the car when it was sold to Fortis. That is not a point taken by Fortis, or indeed anyone. No one said that SMRL was in breach of a condition to give good title at the point when title was intended to pass. It is likely to be a bad point. The car was left with Mr Mann or his company, we do not really know which, on sale and return. That would in all probability have authorised Mr Mann or SMRL to sell the car when they had a purchaser. We do not know what conversations Mr Mann and Mr James may have had in the run-up to 7 June 2007. It is clear law that a seller does not need title simply to agree to sell something, only at the time that title is intended to pass under any such agreement. In any event, there is no real evidence of a sale by Mr James to Mr Mann and by Mr Mann to SMRL, only of a sale by Mr James to SMRL.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">These terms were pleaded in Mr Mann’s defence, but ultimately not pressed at trial against Mrs Brewer because (a) they referred to “Contract of Sale”, whereas Mr Mann personally entered into no contract of sale; and (b) any contract of sale made on these terms was made only by SMRL with Fortis. However, as will appear below, at the beginning of the trial, the judge encouraged Mrs Brewer to amend to bring into the case, for the first time, SMRL in addition to Mr Mann. This was opposed by both Mr Mann and by Fortis. Previously, Mrs Brewer had clearly elected <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>to sue SMRL. Previously, Fortis had elected not to third party SMRL. Both Fortis and Mr Mann submitted to the judge, from their respective and opposing viewpoints, that if there was any question of SMRL being joined, it should only be joined on terms that either Fortis should be entitled to bring a third party claim against SMRL (Fortis’s submission) or that it should not be so entitled (Mr Mann’s submission). The judge, in a manner which is heavily criticised on this appeal, overlooked the problematic consequences for Fortis and Mr Mann of joining SMRL, and ordered joinder of SMRL without deciding, or even adverting to, the third party issue. Later, but only in his judgment, he gave permission to Fortis to bring a third party claim against SMRL. The issues which would then arise between Fortis and SMRL have never been capable of being litigated. Plainly, as it seems to us, SMRL’s terms would be potentially relevant to any such issue. They also seem to us to have been potentially relevant to issues of collateral warranty and the meaning of what was said by Mr Mann to the Brewers, but, as they were not relied on for that purpose, we ignore them. They have been cited because the potential future issues between Fortis and Mr Mann are in play in this appeal, in the sense that some proleptic consideration may have to be given to them.</p>

The contract also provided that Fortis had bought the car at Mrs Brewer’s request and that she therefore agreed that no implied condition or warranty of any kind was given to her by Fortis.   </p>

Mr Brewer drove the car to Mr Mann’s showrooms (with Mrs Brewer following in another car), just as he had driven the car away from the showrooms on 7 June.

On return home the Brewers consulted <span style="font-style:italic">Hay </span>and found the references to chassis number SB 2770. They noted that the car’s original engine number had been NH 2732. They noted that the car was now stated to be “VdP 4 seater with engine TW2710 ex ch TW2705” (as recorded above). Mrs Brewer knew that her car’s engine number was not TW2710. Her witness statement said: “I assumed that my engine was but another change at Bentley Motor Works and I still believed my engine was a genuine Speed Six engine…we found it impossible to find the details [of engine number WK 2671] in the Hay Book without the chassis number, but at that point I had no reason to believe I had anything but a genuine Speed Six engine.” Mr Brewer’s witness statement is in identical terms.

She said that a similar agreement had been reached with Mr Brewer during a further conversation with Fortis on 6 August. She asked to know whether or not Fortis was proceeding with its termination. On 11 August her solicitors wrote to Fortis suggesting that Fortis as well as Mrs Brewer had been the victim of misrepresentation “possibly fraudulent”, and therefore requesting co-operation and “that you grant a moratorium of say six weeks to see how matters progress”. That letter was sent for the attention of Ms Isobel McEwan of Fortis, with whom Mrs Brewer had had her telephone conversation with Fortis on 6 August and to whom she had sent her letter to Fortis of the same day. On 11 August Fortis wrote by fax to Mrs Brewer confirming that their agreement had been formally terminated on 7 August and asking for co-operation in the matter of repossession, which had been arranged for 13 August. On 12 August Mrs Brewer replied to that letter, referring to a telephone conversation between its writer (Mr Mark Samson) and her the previous day. The letter did not dispute Fortis’s termination or insist that a moratorium had been agreed, but, in answer to the request for co-operation in repossession, said that she would not be at home on 13 August, that the car was not at her home, but had been “housed for our mutual benefit in a safe, secure storage”.

In her original particulars of claim, there was no mention of or reliance on Mr Brewer’s visit to Mr Mann’s premises on a Sunday before 20 May 2007, ie the dispute about what was said by Mr Mann was limited to the meeting on that day. Her case was also limited to the plea that on that day Mr Mann had represented and warranted that “although the engine inside the Bentley was not the original engine, it was still a Speed Six engine”. It was alleged that Mr Mann had made that representation “when he knew, or ought to have known” that the engine inside the Bentley was not a Speed Six engine but an earlier 1927 6½ litre engine. Reference was also made to Mr Fenn’s valuation as a matter of reliance, and to the Bonhams valuation, but there was no claim in respect of value. The reference to Mr Fenn’s valuation appears to have been part of a plea of mistake (based on “mutual understanding”) undermining her contract with Fortis. There was a claim in misrepresentation (which ultimately was not pursued). The essential claim was for damages for breach of Mr Mann’s “warranty” (in the singular, and relating only to the engine and not the car) and of the Fortis contract (for breach of the implied condition of correspondence with description, again limited to a complaint about the engine, viz that the car did not correspond with its description as a 1930 Bentley Speed Six with a Speed Six engine because the engine was not a Speed Six engine). As stated above, there was a claim to have rejected the car in a conversation with Fortis on 6 August 2008. The primary claim against Fortis was a declaration that the hire purchase agreement was void or not binding (that was not pursued at trial), with damages claimed in the alternative.  </p>

This was partly on the ground that he worked for about two days a week for Mr William Gilbertson, with whom the Brewers were friendly, and whose son, Sholto, had given the Bonhams’ valuation which had controversially precipitated the litigation. The judge rejected these and other criticisms as undermining his credibility. It could have been said on the other side that Mr Mann and Mr Fenn had known each other during their professional lives, and Mr Fenn had been involved in providing his May 2007 valuation. (Mr Fenn said that he had known Mr Mann for 40 years, but had never done a transaction with him, and that “He is regarded in the Club as a quintessentially honest trader. Otherwise he would not have been around that long.”) Neither witness had given expert testimony before. We suspect nevertheless that the judge was on the whole well served by two considerable experts in a field which, being quite small, was likely to involve witnesses who were not wholly divorced from some greater or lesser acquaintanceship with the parties.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On the other hand the two experts, although they complemented one another, perhaps had different strengths. Mr Sibson appears to have been the more hands-on engineer, although his specific experience with Speed Six Bentleys was perhaps limited, while Mr Fenn had what the judge described as “possibly unrivalled” knowledge of Bentley vintage cars and their histories. These different strengths may have played to different aspects of the issues about which they were asked to give evidence. The major issue was how our car could be properly or at any rate adequately described, and in particular whether the expression “1930 Bentley Speed Six” involved a promise about its engine. On that issue, it might be that Mr Fenn could be particularly authoritative. Other matters debated in the experts’ evidence were as to the physical state of the car’s chassis and engine. As for the chassis, if it were the definitive component which gave to the car its status as a Speed Six, did it matter whether the chassis was not in its original state? And as for the engine, granted that it was common ground that it could not be described as a Speed Six engine, was it nevertheless to Speed Six specification, as Mr Mann had described it? (It must be emphasised, however, that the latter issue was not pleaded, even if it grew out of Mr Sibson’s evidence.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="7">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> A question was however put to the experts in the immediate run-up to trial, as to whether the engine was “built to Speed Six specification”: see at para 135 below. That appears to have been directed to its physical properties, rather than its performance.</p>

She also knew that it did not have its original engine. She had been told these matters. Moreover, the car had not been given this style to “inflate” its value, but because Mr Mann had wanted to race the car, when he had started to restore it for himself, and because it appealed to Mr James. And there was no question of the value being “inflated”, for there was no issue at trial about value. As for the engine, granted that it was not an original Speed Six engine, but had it been prepared to Speed Six specification? Mr Sibson does not say it had not, only that its specification “has not been confirmed”. He did not start up or road test the car.

As for the chassis, he went somewhat beyond his first report, which had said that he was “a little concerned that the rear section is thinner metal. It could possibly be from a different chassis altogether”, to state, albeit without a further inspection, that it was of “an entirely different thickness altogether” and “therefore could possibly be from a different chassis altogether”. However, he concentrated, as before, on the shortening of the chassis to say “The chassis is not original as it is definitely not the same length as when it left the factory so cannot be described as original”.

The reasons why the car could not be described as a 1930 Speed Six were because of the survival of only the front section of the chassis and the deficiencies relating to the engine (para 102, cited above).

I accepted Mr Sibson’s opinion and rejected Mr Fenn’s opinion on these matters. Mr Sibson had carefully examined the engine and had concluded that it could not satisfy the performance requirements of the BDC specification, which it would have had to be able to do if it was to comply with that specification.

The experts had been instructed to express their opinion as to how the car and the engine should be described, Mr Fenn’s evidence was somewhat rigidly based on how the BDC would describe the car. This evidence was clearly relevant to the question of how the car might be described within the BDC but was only of marginal relevance on the question of whether the contractual descriptions of the car satisfied the applicable statutory and contractual provisions relating to the need for the car to comply with those descriptions. This wider question must be based on the intentions of the contracting parties, all relevant facts and a correct application of those facts to the relevant statutory and contractual provisions. Mr Sibson did not confine himself to the BDC method of describing Bentleys in general and Speed Sixes in particular. Indeed, Mr Fenn came close to accepting the gist of Mr Sibson’s reasoning when admitting in cross-examination that the car’s description should have included a reference to its reconstructed 1927 Standard engine. However, these matters of description, being the ultimate issues that I had to decide and being mixed questions of law and fact, were not matters on which the two experts could give admissible expert opinion evidence about notwithstanding the procedural orders that had been made for the adducing of expert evidence.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="14">

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">These were formidable sets of submissions, but we can take them relatively shortly, for three reasons. The first is that, on behalf of Mrs Brewer, Mr Downey did not challenge Mr Ticciati’s submission about the overall, but essential, outcome of the experts’ evidence concerning the acceptability of the expression “1930 Bentley Speed Six” in relation to the car (whatever might be said of the engine). His submission rather was that, as a matter of law, to describe the car as a 1930 Speed Six involved a promise as to the car having an original Speed Six engine. Indeed, he made it clear to us that, <span style="font-style:italic">as against Mr Mann and SMRL</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">he did not rely </span>on any finding of a collateral warranty concerning the car itself as distinct from its engine. He did, however, rely on the description of the <span style="font-style:italic">car</span> as against Fortis, for the hire purchase agreement itself described the goods as a 1930 Bentley Speed Six. Therefore, for the purposes of the Fortis appeal, we still have to resolve, if we can, an issue as to whether the car complied with its description. However, the judge’s findings in this respect are much undermined by Mr Downey’s lack of challenge to Mr Ticciati’s submissions concerning the proper assessment of Mr Sibson’s and Mr Fenn’s evidence.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, Mr Downey had no answer to the complaint that the condition of the engine, if it had to be judged against a Speed Six specification, had not been pleaded. In this respect, certain specific criticisms about the car had been identified, in reliance on Mr Sibson’s report, in para 13 of the July 2009 amended particulars of claim: for instance the point about the rear section of the chassis, or points about the car’s petrol pump, or steering drop arm, or gearbox. However, no point was pleaded about the engine’s physical or dynamic conformity with the specification of a 1930 Speed Six engine. (At most there had been a question put to the experts, in the immediate run-up to trial, asking if the engine had been built to Speed Six specification: but Mr Downey placed no specific reliance on this.) It is true that in his evidence Mr Sibson did suggest that the car’s engine could not be said to live up to its specification: however, his bottom line was always that it could not be proved or had not been proved to be within specification. Mr Downey sought to support the judge’s findings in this respect, but in our judgment unsuccessfully. Thus, the judge agreed with Mr Sibson’s suggestion that a test (made in 2009) of pressure at 140 psi was inadequate, and that the result ought to have been 225 psi. However, Mr Fenn’s evidence was that that was ridiculous (see above at para 141), and there was no reason to accept Mr Sibson’s view in preference to Mr Fenn’s, a fortiori on an unpleaded point on which the experts could not be regarded as formally locking horns. There was no specification ingredient in terms of psi, only in terms of compression ratio (5.1 to 1) and brake horse power (180). Mr Downey also relied on Mr Sibson’s complaint that he had not been given the chance to test the engine dynamically, since he had not been invited to the 2009 compression test made by Mr Fenn, and that thereafter Mr Mann had dismantled the engine (presumably to prepare it for the car’s resale). The suggestion was that Mrs Brewer and Mr Sibson had been prevented from proving their case. That, however, would have been an unfair inference in circumstances where no such case had ever been pleaded. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The third reason lies in the essential nature of this appeal, at any rate so far as Mr Mann and SMRL are concerned. Mr Ticciati recognises that the best he could probably hope for, however successful he is in this court on behalf of his clients, is an order for a retrial. This is because he acknowledges that at least SMRL, even if not Mr Mann personally, would be liable for breach of collateral warranty if Mr Mann had assured Mrs Brewer that the engine in the car was a Speed Six engine: but that issue, about what was said on 20 May 2007, cannot finally be resolved in this court. Therefore the gravamen of his appeal, without detracting from any points that this court might find it possible to resolve finally, is to the effect that an overall consideration of the way in which the judge dealt with the numerous issues demonstrates that the judge failed to approach his task with the necessary objectivity, with the result that his judgment cannot stand. The position is, he submits, that on nearly every issue between the parties at trial, whether of fact, or credibility, or preference for one expert over another, or of the application of some potentially difficult law to the facts as they might be found, the judge had to make an evaluation or assessment which required care and objectivity. It was, however, his duty to submit that the judge had failed in that duty, or at least gave the appearance of that failure.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Under the present heading, we would accept that the judge’s treatment of the expert evidence was, in many of the respects complained of, difficult to comprehend. We will revert below,<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"> </span>to matters such as specification, continuous history, the question whether the description of the car is one of fact or opinion, and the law of correspondence with description. We also bear in mind that the ultimate issue can only be considered in the light of all the material in the appeal. For the present, however, it sufficient to say that on the complaints made about the judge’s treatment of the expert evidence, there must be serious concern as to the way in which he summarised the experts’ essential evidence about how the car should be described, which the judge misstated; about the fact that he rewrote his assessment of Mr Fenn’s evidence at judgment 4, para 37, after complaint had been made to him about the coherence of his assessment of the expert evidence; and in this connection about the fact that his summarised reasons for finding that the car did not correspond to its description (para 202) are so much bound up with the state of its engine and with other matters which are at least highly questionable, such as an unpleaded and unproved failure to comply with specification, a lack of continuous history, and an absence of documentation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We have made the point above that Mr Downey accepted that he had and made no case on this appeal against Mr Mann and SMRL based on a collateral warranty about the car as distinct from the engine. This came as something of a surprise to the court, for Mr Mann had always made it clear that he accepted that he referred to the car as a 1930 Bentley Speed Six and was, through his company, ready to stand by that (for what he said it amounted to), and we had been inclined to read the judge’s judgment as holding him and his company responsible not only for a warranty about the engine, but also about the car. Nevertheless, when Mr Downey was pressed by us about this, he was adamant and clear that he had no case on appeal against Mr Mann or SMRL based on any collateral warranty about the car, as distinct from the engine; and that even if there were aspects of the judge’s judgment which might have supported an argument otherwise (such as judgment 4, para 188), he did not rely on them. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There are many obscurities about the judge’s complex (partly because so often rewritten) judgment. The question of what collateral warranty the judge found proved (which is clear enough in the passages just cited) is overlaid by his separate analysis, which was entirely of his own making and not put forward by Mr Malek QC on behalf of Mrs Brewer at trial, of a so-called “deposit contract” which Mrs Brewer and SMRL had made at the time when Mrs Brewer paid the deposit. That was itself bound up with the judge’s theory, again entirely of his own making, that SMRL’s responsibilities under this deposit contract mirrored the responsibilities undertaken by Mr Mann by reference to his collateral warranty and by Fortis when it described the car in its contract with Mrs Brewer as “One 1930 Bentley Speed Six Car”: see judgment 4, paras 159-171.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">“The description “Bentley Motor Car” in the deposit contract between SMRL and Mrs Brewer [which the judge derived from SMRL’s invoice to Fortis] and “1930 Bentley Speed Six Car” in the hire purchase agreement between Fortis and Mrs Brewer are contractual descriptions which have the meaning: a “1930 Bentley Speed Six with a Speed Six engine”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The judge’s development, of his own motion, of this deposit contract was heavily criticised in Mr Ticciati’s submissions. Mr Downey conceded that he placed no reliance on the judge’s analysis in this respect. That is entirely understandable. In the circumstances, we will not have to say much about the deposit contract. However, we will have to say something (see paras 213ff below), for it is relevant to Mr Ticciati’s overriding submission that the judge appears to have lost his objectivity.  </p>

That was certainly vital to the Brewers’ case against Mr Mann and SMRL, and against Fortis as well, since it too was held to bear the burden of what Mr Mann told the Brewers. Of course the judge’s impression of Mr Mann’s credibility bore directly and profoundly on his findings on the issue of what was said at the meeting of 20 May 2007.</p>

Normally, such assessments lie very much within the province of a trial judge. However, in this case, the judge said that demeanour did not assist him, and he found his markers elsewhere. The essential complaint by Mr Ticciati is that the judge found Mr Mann’s lack of credibility in incidental matters about which he considered that Mr Mann had been untruthful and dishonest, where dishonesty had never been asserted or cross-examined to – and then carried that over to his judgment as to the critical meeting. Moreover, the judge seems to have come to his decision first, and to his reasons second, rather than the other way round</p>

He went directly to a discussion of the meeting of 20 May and simply stated that he was “satisfied, taking the evidence as a whole, that Mrs Brewer’s account was correct” (para 78). His reasons were based on what he regarded as the nature of the conversation, viz (i) that the expression “Speed Six specification” had not been shown to have been used by any one else or to have had any valid content (para 81); (ii) that the crucial feature of a Speed Six engine was not in its specification but was existential, in its being originally delivered as a Speed Six engine by the Cricklewood works (para 82); and (iii) that the Brewers would not have been content with a non Speed Six engine which had been adapted to look like and perform like a Speed Six engine (para 84). Therefore, the judge reasoned, Mr Mann had not used the phrase “Speed Six specification”, or, if he had, it would have been objectively understood as merely referring to his rebuilding of what was already a Speed Six engine (para 84). As for Mr Mann’s description of the car as a Speed Six car, that reflected the standpoint of the BDC, which did not suffice on an objective construction of the term (para 106). </p>

Thus, before he arrived at his account of the meeting of 20 May, the judge had already, first, castigated Mr Mann for being untruthful about saying that he had bought the engine in its already modified form, whereas the judge regarded him as having modified it himself (at paras 81-85).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Next the judge blamed Mr Mann for telling the Brewers that the few documents he provided to them about the background to the car were all he possessed: but <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> because Mr Mann had more documents (although there were some further invoices about his work on the car which he said he had overlooked and only found later), but because of the very opposite reason, that he had <span style="font-style:italic">wrongly implied</span> that “there were a variety of other documents that provided a continuous history of the car that had existed but were not in his possession” (at para 89). In other words the judge found an (implied) representation that the car was well documented, when it was not. That is in our judgment an impossible implication. We suppose that the car must have had its history, such as it was, over the years even it largely consisted in having been dismantled at some quite early stage. But in any event it was an acknowledged gap in the history and provenance of the car that all that Mr Mann could say about it was that he had rebuilt it in the late 1970s before selling it to its previous owner in 1981. The Brewers knew that. Although the judge kept on repeating that Mr Mann had somehow failed Mrs Brewer by not providing a continuous and documented history of the car, that was a wholly unjustified theory about the nature of their contract. Mrs Brewer <span style="font-style:italic">knew </span>that the history of the car before its 1980 rebuild was essentially unknown; and Mr Mann made no other promise. </p>

The inference left hanging in the air, but not stated, was that Mr Mann had something to hide: but there was never any pleaded case that the car could not or did not perform to specification, and, in any event, the fact that the car had been prepared to Speed Six specification at some uncertain time in the past had promised absolutely nothing about its current performance (nor was it said to). </p>

The judge built a theory, of his own making, that Mr Mann had somehow been deceptive because he had not had title to the car when he sold it to Fortis. However, as remarked at para 84 above, there is likely to be nothing, and certainly nothing dishonest, in this point.  </p>

It had always been open to her, therefore, to seek to advance a case that, if the car had had the promised virtues with which she alleged it had been presented to her, it would have been worth even more than the price she had agreed. However, she did not do so, and presented no evidence to that effect. The judge was therefore wrong to suggest that Mr Mann was “self-evidently wrong” and even dishonestly so in giving the evidence he did. There was no evidence to the contrary given in the case. Mr Fenn’s evidence on valuation supported Mr Mann’s. The judge in any event was not comparing like with like, for he was assuming an inadequate engine in one case and a good engine in another. For him expressly to hold this against Mr Mann’s credit in a case which to a large extent turned on a disputed oral conversation was, in our judgment, unfair. </p>

It is true that some (only) of Mr Mann’s sales literature had been pleaded by Mrs Brewer for the purpose of a (limited) plea of misrepresentation and warranty focused on the genuineness and authenticity of the car and its engine; and that it was also pleaded that Mr Mann “knew or ought to have known” that the car was “not a 1930 Speed Six that had been restored by him but was actually a reconstruction of a Le Mans type replica using what remained of the chassis of a Speed Six saloon”. That was a <span style="font-style:italic">sub silentio </span>but formally inadequate<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>plea of fraud. However, as Mr Downey made abundantly clear to us, the only complaint was as to a collateral warranty to the effect that car and engine were a Speed Six car and engine, and there was no attack on Mr Mann’s honesty in the transaction, nor on the honesty of his sales literature. Our reading of Mr Mann’s relatively brief cross-examination confirms Mr Downey’s assurance, even if there was a passing reference to Mr Mann’s advertising being “misleading” in the closing written submissions provided to the judge on behalf of Mrs Brewer.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It was against this background that the judge came to the passage of his judgment 2 in which he considered the meeting of 20 May. This passage (at paras 114-124) was almost entirely rewritten as against judgment 1. It began, as before, with an immediate acceptance of Mrs Brewer’s evidence (at para 114) and a rejection of Mr Mann’s evidence (at para 115). He deleted his previous reasoning for those conclusions and reasoned as follows. First, he said that the background was Mrs Brewer’s desire to have a Speed Six engine originally delivered as a Speed Six engine by the Cricklewood works and thereafter documented for any changes to ensure that it could still be correctly described “as the original engine” (at para 116). We comment: that is not a reason for preferring Mrs Brewer’s evidence, but an acceptance of it. Secondly, or what he described as “another crucial reason why I do not accept Mr Mann’s account of the meeting”, he said that the Brewers “particularly wanted to buy one of the very few surviving Speed Six engines. Mrs Brewer was therefore bound to question the provenance of the engine…” (at para 117). However, that is again an acceptance of the Brewers’ evidence, not a reason for its acceptance. Thirdly, the judge said that “I also take into account the misleading nature of his advertisements” (para 118). Therefore the judge held against Mr Mann that his advertisements had been “misleading” (with regards to the engine), even though Mr Downey assures us that it had not been part of the Brewers’ case that they were.  </p>

The first was that Mr Mann was under a duty in the circumstances to have been clear and unambiguous that the engine had started life as a Standard 6½ litre engine, instead of using an expression that was “fraught with ambiguity and…unduly terse and its meaning unclear” (at para 120). That may be a statement about what may or may not have been, in law and in the circumstances, a sufficient disclosure: but we do not think it was a reason for preferring the Brewers’ account to Mr Mann’s <span style="font-style:italic">unless</span>, implicit in that reasoning, is the unspoken premise that, by breaching his duty, Mr Mann displayed himself as untrustworthy. The judge’s second reason for rejecting Mr Mann’s use of the expression “to Speed Six specification” (and this was reasoning that had been used in judgment 1) was that “there is no surviving official or formal Speed Six specification” (at para 122). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Now, it is true that WO Bentley did not publish his own specification (albeit he must have known what he was building). However, BDC did publish a specification for a 1930 Speed Six engine and that was the specification which was used at trial when, for instance, Mr Sibson was saying that the car’s engine had not been proved to comply with its performance criteria. Its details had been set out by the judge in judgment 2, paras 58/59. At para 58, the judge had said “The Speed Six specification comes in two versions, being the 1929 and the 1930 versions, and the parties accepted that the 1930 version was the appropriate one to use for the car”.  Moreover, Mr Sholto Gilbertson in his Bonhams’ valuation had said that the engine “purported to be up-rated to Speed Six specification”. Mr Sibson and Mr Fenn had repeatedly referred to Speed Six specification. For instance, Mr Fenn referred to it in his report at para 6.14 (see at para 133 above), in his reply dated 18 March 2009 to Mrs Brewer’s solicitors’ letter (see at para 137 above), and in his letter dated 30 September 2008 (see at para 138 above). Mrs Brewer’s letters before action had referred to the car’s engine as “purported to be updated to Speed Six Specification” (see at para 103 above). Her solicitors’ letter to Mr Fenn dated 13 March 2009 had referred to an engine “purported to be modified to Speed Six specifications” (see para 137 above). The first of the seven questions put to the experts shortly before trial was whether the engine was built to Speed Six specification. In these circumstances, the question may be asked whether Mr Mann’s first reply to Mrs Brewer’s challenge, and his evidence, that he had spoken of the engine as “prepared to Speed Six specification” are to be doubted on the basis that in 1930 W O Bentley might have published no formal specification? We doubt that this could be a valid reason. The expression “Speed Six specification” is clearly used by everyone in the trade. The judge’s rejection of the expression is strange. </p>

Although the judge did not expressly bring back into his reasoning directly concerned with the 20 May meeting all the complaints, express or otherwise, that he had made elsewhere in his judgment against Mr Mann, it is nevertheless a natural inference that he held all of this material against Mr Mann in evaluating what had been said by Mr Mann. And having rejected Mr Mann’s account, he accepted everything that the Brewers gave evidence about. Or was it the other way about?

In those grounds of appeal, Mr Ticciati submitted that the judge had wholly ignored his submissions inter alia regarding Mrs Brewer’s and Mr Mann’s respective credibility. As for those matters, they were addressed in detail as ground 9 at paras 70-82 of that document. In brief, Mr Ticciati referred to the evidence as to Mr Mann’s excellent reputation, his lack of incentive to lie, his good faith in offering to repurchase, the distinction between the advertisement for our car, which did not use the word “original”, as distinct from what was said about other cars, the ease of checking the origin of engine number WK 2671 in <span style="font-style:italic">Hay</span>, the absence of any allegation that Mrs Brewer had asked about the <span style="font-style:italic">engine </span>as distinct from the <span style="font-style:italic">car </span>in her letter before action, and the circumstances which led to the dispute precipitated as they were by the Brewers’ financial difficulties and the erroneous valuation by Bonhams. At what was then ground 20 he submitted that the judge had put forward inadequate reasons for convicting Mr Mann of lying about whether the conversion to Speed Six specification had been done by him or before he had acquired the engine; and at what was then ground 21 he complained similarly about the judge’s finding that Mr Mann’s evidence about the value of the car with the engine it had as against its value with a Speed six engine was “both self-evidently wrong and highly damaging to his general credibility and reliability”. He submitted that these findings were unjustified and irrelevant and were unfairly destructive of a reputation for honesty that Mr Mann had spent decades building up (and of which Mr Fenn, who had reason to know, had given evidence, see para 127 above). That, he submitted, was in itself another compelling reason why permission to appeal should be granted.</p>

Thus, as for the matter of whether or not Mr Mann had himself modified the engine from Standard to Speed Six specification, the judge found additional reasons to support his conclusion, such as that Mr Mann would have disclosed to the Brewers the provenance of the engine from Mr Greyvensteyn <span style="font-style:italic">if </span>the engine had been already modified to Speed Six specification. However, that seems to us, like the judge’s earlier reasons, to be a weak basis on which to condemn Mr Mann as a liar in this regard. As for the question of valuation, the judge had recourse to adding a citation of the desk-top appraisal of SHM Smith Hodgkinson for its mention of Speed Sixes sold for $1.8 and $5.1 million. He referred to this as “snatches of evidence” which supported his condemnation of Mr Mann in this regard. We would regard this, on a matter not in issue, and with almost total ignorance of these cars, and without expert evidence to assist, as being of insignificance. As for the car’s lack of continuous history, he again relied on the desk-top appraisal, which he cited in full for the first time (at para 194), for the additional comment that it confirmed the importance of the “need for full documentary evidence of the relevant history of a Speed Six”. But that begs the question of whether such documentary history has been promised. Of course such a history is a desirable thing to be able to offer to a customer. That is all the appraisal was saying.</p>

Adopting those starting points, I concluded that there were no obvious reasons for regarding the evidence of Mr and Mrs Brewer as being unreliable, particularly since the factual matrix to the meeting on 20 May 2007 clearly pointed to the probability that Mrs Brewer’s evidence was correct. Thus, there was no reason for regarding Mr Brewer’s supporting evidence as being unreliable. However, and most significantly, Mr Mann’s evidence was inherently unreliable given all the unsatisfactory aspects of his evidence that are summarised above.

If not Mrs Brewer, then at any rate Mr Brewer must have known that the chassis and engine numbers could be checked with <span style="font-style:italic">Hay</span>. The Brewers may not have had a copy of <span style="font-style:italic">Hay </span>at the time of purchase, for they asked Mr Mann to get them a copy, which he promised to do, but they knew about <span style="font-style:italic">Hay </span>and obtained their copy from Mr Mann only shortly after the purchase. They say they immediately checked the book, and confirmed, what they had been told, that engine WK 2671 was not the car’s original engine. However, they did not check to see where WK 2671 came from. This was despite their evidence that the genuineness and authenticity of the engine were vital to the purchase. They kept the car another year or more without attempting to find out about the engine’s origin. When they decided to sell the car, hoping to get a net £650,000 for it, it would have come as a great shock to be told by Bonhams that it was only worth between £300,000 and £350,000 gross. That was only half of their expectations; and at a time when they were facing financial difficulties even in maintaining the hire purchase payments. If they had been told specifically that the engine was a Speed Six engine, then it would be very strange that this allegation would not have been at the very forefront of Mrs Brewer’s immediate letter before action. It was, after all, the nature of the car’s engine that was given by Bonhams as the reason for the disappointing valuation. That was something that Bonhams had researched immediately even before Sholto Gilbertson had come to photograph the car (see the terms of his letter valuation). And as the letter before action only a few days later stated engine number WK 2671 came from a Standard 6½ litre chassis number FW 2614. However, the argument addressed in that letter before action was <span style="font-style:italic">not</span>, as one would expect, a direct complaint that Mrs Brewer had been told, in answer to a specific question, that the engine was a Speed six engine, but rather that it was the description of the <span style="font-style:italic">car </span>as a Speed Six car that led her to think that the car’s engine would be an original Speed Six engine, even if not, as she knew, the car’s original engine. Moreover, it was on the basis of the <span style="font-style:italic">car’s </span>description as a Speed Six that the letter before action went straight to the allegation of fraud. However, that was a weak allegation of fraud compared to the allegation that might have been made if Mrs Brewer had been told specifically that the <span style="font-style:italic">engine </span>was a Speed Six. It might also be said that Mrs Brewer’s reaction to Mr Mann trying to explain to her about the modified engine in their telephone conversation of 11 August 2007 is consistent with her letter before action. Her line remains that she had been misled by what had been said about the <span style="font-style:italic">car </span>as a Speed Six: “I told him that the car should never have been marketed as a Speed Six”. But if she had been told directly that the <span style="font-style:italic">engine </span>was a Speed Six, in answer to her specific question, her rejoinders would very likely have been in different terms.</p>

That is striking. Moreover, the judge only addresses the Brewers’ failure to investigate the car before the purchase, and does not comment on their failure to address the provenance in the almost immediate aftermath of the purchase. We are deliberately concentrating on the nature of Mrs Brewer’s case, and not on her evidence: but it has to be said that the judge’s acceptance of her evidence, namely that she had not been influenced by Mr Fenn’s valuation <span style="font-style:italic">at all</span> (whereas her letters before action and witness statement tell a different story, see at paras 66, 105 above), as evidence “adding to rather than differing from her earlier written evidence and her solicitor’s statements” (at para 131(8)) is unconvincing and very charitable. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On the other side of the argument, Mr Mann knew that the engine had started life as a Standard not a Speed Six engine. If therefore, in answer to a direct question about the engine, he had assured Mrs Brewer that it was a Speed Six engine, it would have been a lie. Why should he lie? The car did not belong to him, it was on sale and return. He could make a profit on it, of course, but his capital was not tied up in it. If, however, he lied, and the car came back to him, he would be stuck with it. Moreover, because of the engine number, his lie could not escape detection, because <span style="font-style:italic">Hay </span>would reveal all. And he offered to provide the Brewers with a copy of <span style="font-style:italic">Hay</span> and not long later did so. That would have been an extraordinary risk to take with his reputation and business. His immediate reaction to Mrs Brewer’s complaint was to explain that he had told the Brewers that the engine was “prepared to Speed Six specification”. That was at a time when Mrs Brewer had not yet said against him that he had said specifically, in answer to her direct question, that it was a Speed Six engine. Therefore his explanation is not defensive. His other immediate reaction was to say: Well, we can work this out. If Mrs Brewer had not wanted a complete indemnity, and had been prepared to compromise her claim, this litigation would have been unnecessary. As it is, he bought the car back for the full price from Fortis. But if he had lied at the time, he must have been conscious of it, in which case his failure to close the gap (no doubt with Fortis’s help), would have been taking an extraordinary risk. Anything is possible, and sometimes the most reputable of dealers turn out to have feet of clay, but this does not sound like a case of dishonest dealing (and was not even, at any rate at trial, alleged to be).</p>

He described them as “Preliminary findings of facts allegedly going to credit”: but of course the judge had made up his mind long since. They are a mixture of old points and some new ones. We have described many of them previously. They amount not only to a rejection of Mr Mann’s credibility <span style="font-style:italic">as a witness</span>, but to a wholesale attack on the honesty of his dealings <span style="font-style:italic">as a dealer</span>, in a case where his honesty as a dealer was not in question.</p>

However, it is another matter for a judge to accuse a party of dishonesty, when none has been alleged against him by the other party at trial, and then to use that finding of dishonesty to undermine the credibility of the party as a witness on the critical factual issue in the case. As it is, despite Mrs Brewer’s early accusation of fraud (in her letter before action), at a time when she had not even formulated her case of an express description of the engine as a Speed Six engine in answer to her specific question, and despite the implicit (but not express) allegation of dishonest knowledge in her particulars of claim, no allegation of dishonesty was put to Mr Mann in cross-examination, and we have Mr Downey’s commendably open assurance that there was at trial and is no allegation of dishonesty in these proceedings. </p>

We have set them out above (at paras 177-181 and 184-189,193, dealing with judgments 2 and 4 respectively). In our judgment, that reasoning is seriously flawed by a combination of assuming the truth of the Brewers’ account of the meeting and doubting Mr Mann’s credibility. Of course, the one thing is an aspect of the other. Moreover, what we do not find is an examination of the parties’ different accounts of the meeting by reference to matters of more contemporaneous documentation or undisputed findings of fact (see at paras 190-192<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>above).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We recognise the difficulties of finding the truth where parties give conflicting evidence about an undocumented meeting which took place a number of years before trial. It is all the harder because, as every judge knows, once an issue has arisen, it is all too easy to persuade oneself, entirely honestly, that one was in the right, or that it was not one’s own failure that let one down, but someone else’s fault. This is a frequently observed pattern of human behaviour. Thus, once Sholto Gilbertson had identified the car’s engine as pulling the car’s value down (albeit he was wrong about his valuation), it was entirely natural for the Brewers to think (and of course we allow it possibly to be true) that what they really wanted was a car with an original Speed Six engine, and that that was what they had been promised. Therefore, on either hypothesis, namely that it was true or that it was thought to be true, the case was made that “Speed Six car” <span style="font-style:italic">means </span>or includes “Speed Six engine”. That was the essential case made in Mrs Brewer’s letters before action, to both Mr Mann/SMRL and to Fortis.

At that time no further details of the conversation were given. As the case made its way to trial, further details appeared about Mrs Brewer’s case. Thus, in her witness statement of April 2009, which she re-signed in September 2009 and thus did not alter after the substantial amendments made to her particulars of claim in July 2009, she gave this account of the conversation:</p>

I then asked if the car was a Speed Six since it did not have the original engine. Mr Mann said yes. Mr Mann went on to say that Bentley often changed engines if a customer came back with a problem. I then asked if the engine was a Speed Six engine. Mr Mann said yes. These questions and the answers Mr Mann gave me clearly led me to the conclusion that the car had at one time or another gone back to old Bentley Motor works and had an engine change to another original Speed Six engine. Mr Mann then went on to describe some of the work he had done in the restoration. He explained that the engine was up to Speed Six racing specifications and that the chassis had been shortened to comply with the specifications of Old Bentley No 2, which was another famous Bentley racing car. He explained that the rear axle had been modified to the Old Bentley No 2 specifications of 3 to 1. Lastly he explained that the Le Mans body was a replica of Old Bentley No 2.”</p>

He added “Both factory and agents as well as private owners frequently undertook changes, not all of which were recorded, while some were inexplicable.” His defence stated that he had said that the engine was prepared to Speed Six specification. His witness statement (June 2009) gave this account of the conversation in very much the terms of his August 2008 letter:</p>

I said it most certainly was a Speed Six motor car but like all cars of that age, of 75 years old, it had undergone changes during its life, but the engine was prepared to Speed Six specification. As I pointed out in my letter to her solicitors dated 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2008…both factory and agents as well as private owners frequently undertook changes, not all of which were recorded, whilst some were inexplicable.

However, the judge’s conclusions about this issue are wholly bound up, as we would conclude, in the judge’s apparent loss of objectivity and unfairness in relation to his dark view of Mr Mann’s honesty and of his evidence. On the central issue of the meeting of 20 May, the judge has combined an unfair, because unheralded, attack, of his own making, on Mr Mann’s honesty with an otherwise unstructured and unaccountable discussion of the opposing cases. It also seems to us that there was similar unfairness and apparent loss of objectivity in the judge’s errors in presentation of the expert evidence which he had heard from Mr Sibson and Mr Fenn; as well as in his finding that the car had been represented and sold, or ought to be treated as if it had been represented and sold, on the basis of a mysteriously but impossibly implied promise of a continuous and documented history. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We consider that the judge’s apparent loss of objectivity is also demonstrated by his re-writing of his judgment 4 in the face of the grounds of appeal presented to him. He was not being invited to give more reasons, where he had given none. He had in fact handed down a highly wrought, carefully considered, lengthy and detailed judgment (judgment 3). He had done so in the face of the criticisms contained in those grounds of appeal. The fact that his reasoning may have been inadequate, if it was, was not a reason to have another go at re-writing it, especially on an issue as sensitive as the parties’ respective credibility. We regret to say that we think that the judge’s extensive re-writing of his judgment was not for the purpose of conducting a reconsideration which his conscience as a judge drove him to undertake, as may exceptionally happen, but for the purpose of providing further material – some of it, such as his “deposit contract” analysis, of a highly idiosyncratic nature not foreshadowed in any argument from the parties – to support the conclusions to which he was already committed. We think that a successful appeal requiring a retrial was almost inevitable from that moment, but we rest our judgment more broadly on all the matters relied on above.</p>

The issue at trial was whether any such warranty was given by him personally, or on behalf of his company, SMRL. The judge found that both were liable: Mr Mann, because he had presented himself to Mrs Brewer as an individual dealer, and not as the representative of a limited company, alternatively because he was liable as the agent of an undisclosed principal; and SMRL because “Mr Ticciati accepted on its behalf that it would be liable to Mrs Brewer if and to the extent that any breach of warranty was established” (judgment 4, para 156). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Ticciati submitted that the judge’s analysis was undermined by his view that responsibility for what was said on 20 May was to be fixed as of that date, rather than as of the date when the primary contract to which the warranty was collateral was concluded (see judgment 4, para 155(4)). Until then, he submitted, the alleged warranty was merely an offer, of the “if” variety: viz, “if you buy (hire purchase) this car, I will warrant that…”. If no primary contract is ever made, then the collateral warranty never becomes contractual, for the hypothesis is never fulfilled. He therefore argued that the time to consider whether the warranty was given on behalf of Mr Mann personally or on behalf of his company was at the time of contract, and not before. Mrs Brewer’s contract with Fortis was made on 7 June 2007. The earliest possible time when Mrs Brewer might have given any consideration for the promise constituted by the warranty was on 5 June when Mr Brewer paid the £40,000 deposit on her behalf, in anticipation of her contract with Fortis. But by that time, and as from 30 May 2007, Mrs Brewer knew about SMRL from its invoice to Fortis, provided to Mrs Brewer through Mr Hardiman and her husband; and on 5 June, when the £40,000 was paid, it was paid to SMRL itself. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We would agree that in principle that submission is correct, and that will change the parameters of the enquiry as to whether Mr Mann was speaking for himself or for his company. Ultimately the question will be whether, in the light of its appearing on the scene as the party contracting with Fortis and receiving the deposit from Mrs Brewer, SMRL supplants Mr Mann as the party on whose behalf any representation amounting to a collateral warranty was made, or whether, any such representation having been originally made by Mr Mann before his company was on the scene, it continues to bind him personally ever thereafter. That, however, is a question, involving a broad-based factual enquiry, that we are unable on this appeal to determine. It will be an issue for any re-trial. However, we also observe that the judge’s constantly shifting analysis of the contractual situation is further ammunition for Mr Ticciati’s case, for it shows the judge utilising changing reasoning to support his previous conclusions, and again calls into question his objectivity.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus, in judgment 1 the judge proceeds on the basis that Mr Mann is liable as from the time of his representation, which was prior to Mrs Brewer finding out from the SMRL invoice on 30 May 2007 that it would be receiving the deposit and selling the car to Fortis: judgment 1, paras 88/89. The judge also reasons (“A further reason why Mr Mann is additionally liable personally”) that his personal liability follows from the fact that “he did not buy the car from Mr James until after SMRL had sold it to Fortis”, judgment 1, para 90. However, this was said on the assumption that Mr James was himself dealing with Mr Mann personally and not with his company, whereas it is SMRL which buys the car from Mr James and pays him (para 84 above). The natural inference is that Mr James was transacting throughout with Mr Mann’s company rather than with Mr Mann personally. The judge then goes on to describe four inter-related contracts: (i) a contract between Mrs Brewer and SMRL as of 5 June 2007 whereby she provides a deposit of £40,000; (ii) a contract between SMRL and Fortis as of 6 June 2007, whereby SMRL sells the car to Fortis for £390,000 (in fact £430,000, finalised on 7 June); (iii) a hire purchase contract between Fortis and Mrs Brewer made by Mrs Brewer’s signing their agreement on 30 May 2007 (in fact on 6 June 2007) and by Fortis countersigning on 6 June 2007 (in fact on 7 June); (iv) the sale of the car by Mr James to SMRL. On that analysis, Mrs Brewer finds out about SMRL on 30 May, signs the Fortis contract form on the same day, and pays the deposit to SMRL on 5 June.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">“148. Finally, Mr Ticciati contended that the collateral contract containing the warranty could only have taken effect when the hire purchase agreement was concluded.

Nevertheless, the judge opined (at para 153) that <span style="font-style:italic">even if this submission was correct</span>, Mr Mann remained liable personally as having induced Mrs Brewer to enter into her contracts. The judge’s footnote 41 then referred to para 159 “for a finding as to when those contracts took effect”. On the way to para 159, the judge stated at para 155(3) that, in his view, even before the hire purchase contract was made by Mrs Brewer, she had entered into the so-called “deposit contract” (the judge’s term). He said:</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">“Although [Mr Ticciati] was referring to the hire purchase agreement as the relevant agreement that brought the contractual warranty into effect, the relevant contract in this case must be Mrs Brewer’s earlier deposit contract. In a conventional situation, that [ie Mr Ticcati’s submission] will usually be the case. However, in this case, the deposit contract and SMRL’s sale contract to Fortis took place on the same day as Mrs Brewer was sent a copy of the invoice which would have alerted her to the existence of SMRL so that that requirement would have been fulfilled, if that event was indeed what brought the contractual effect of the warranty into effect.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">So there it appears that the judge is saying that Mrs Brewer’s deposit contract was contemporaneous with the invoice which would have alerted her to the existence of SMRL. That, however, would place the deposit contract on 30 May, whereas in previous judgments the judge had dated it to 5 June, the date on which Mr Brewer paid the deposit to SMRL. That the judge now has in mind the earlier date of 30 May is highlighted by a footnote to para 155(3), footnote 43, which reads: “Fortis stated in its evidence that the sale agreement was entered into on 30 May 2007. See further paragraph 159(2) below.” So the judge is now suggesting that SMRL’s sale to Fortis was on 30 May 2007, whereas he had previously found it to be made on 6 June 2007 (and it was in fact made on 7 June). </p>

He now finds (i) a “deposit contract” between Mrs Brewer and SMRL “entered into on 30 May 2007 when the sale contract was made and SMRL issued the relevant invoice” (he had previously dated this contract, at one time called a “contract of sale”, to 5 June, which was of course the date on which the deposit was paid); (ii) a contract between SMRL and Fortis by which SMRL sold the car to Fortis “made on 30 May when SMRL sent out its invoice of the same date” (he had previously dated this contract to “on or about 6 June when Fortis transferred £390,000 to SMRL”, which in fact occurred on 7 June); (iii) the hire purchase contract between Fortis and Mrs Brewer, which he now said took effect on 6 June when Mrs Brewer signed it and Fortis paid £390,000 to SMRL (in fact the contract took effect on 7 June, when Fortis countersigned the agreement and also paid SMRL); and (iv) the contract between Mr James and SMRL of 8 June 2006.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Why, one asks, did the judge, in fact inaccurately, advance to an earlier date, 30 May 2007, his contracts (i) and (ii), namely the so-called deposit contract and the sale by SMRL to Fortis? It is by no means clear, if only because the rationale of this part of the judge’s judgment 4 is obscure, but there must be a strong inference that he did this for the purpose somehow of being able to reason that, as of 30 May, Mr Mann’s personal representation was given contractual effect before Mrs Brewer could have had an opportunity to realise that SMRL was on the scene. Thus in an entirely new paragraph 160 (extending over nearly three pages and twelve sub-paragraphs) headed “Deposit contract”, the judge said this about the invoice to Fortis dated 30 May 2007:</p>

That is because, from that moment, the induced party such as Mrs Brewer becomes potentially liable for loss arising from the inducement in the way of pre-contractual expenditure or other loss flowing from the inducement…Mrs Brewer was unaware that Mr Mann had provided his warranty as an agent for SMRL when the warranty was provided on 20 May 2007 and remained unaware of that relationship when she unequivocally agreed to proceed with the acquisition of the car at the same time. Since the first time she could have discovered that SMRL was the contracting party for the deposit contract was on receipt of a copy of SMRL’s invoice to Fortis on 30 May 2007 and since she never subsequently made an election to treat SMRL as the sole warranting party, Mr Mann remains personally liable to Mrs Brewer for any breach of the warranty on the undisclosed principal basis.”   </p>

It appears that the suggestion in the solicitors’ letter not only represented the defence which Mr Mann was minded to make, but he was also to point out in the ensuing correspondence that he was anxious that the liability to pay VAT on legal fees should rest on his company not him: for only SMRL could set off VAT paid against VAT collected. Mr Mann was also concerned that any liability should fall against the company, to be off-set against company profits, whereas he would have no similar recourse in respect of his personal taxation. The assets, such as the property from which he operated, were owned by SMRL.

On 6 July 2009 Mr Mann’s solicitors served in draft his amended defence which took the point that the company was responsible for the advertisements, the website, and for the transaction as a whole; and that Mr Mann dealt through his company. The stand-off on this issue continued down to trial.</p>

In that respect, however, he was stopped in his tracks by Mr Malek’s firm rejoinder: “No, it is not a difference in value case” (Day 1.1112). </p>

It was to emerge in the discussion that Fortis had chosen not to make a third party claim against Mr Mann (with whom it had no contract), nor against his company (with which it did) in the absence of it being a party, but, as Mr Brant remarked to the judge, if SMRL had been a party, a claim over against it would have been pleaded (Day 1.1124). </p>

However, before his evidence got going, there was an objection to the admission of his second statement. That had not been resolved by the time the short adjournment on the second day arrived, but the judge said that after it he wanted to resolve the “uncertainty” of whether a claim over was contemplated by Fortis against SMRL (Day 2.1224/5). We do not understand why there was any uncertainty. Mr Brant had made it clear: without the joinder of SMRL, there was no wish by Fortis to bring a third party claim against it; the position would change, were SMRL to be joined; but SMRL had not been joined.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In due course Mr Ticciati made it clear that he opposed the joinder of SMRL because of the danger that it would bring a third party claim from Fortis in its wake, and because if it was going to happen, it should have been done at the pre-trial case management conference when he had suggested it (but Mrs Brewer had declined): as it was he had cross-examined Mrs Brewer without SMRL being a party. As he said: “We are in this difficulty because the claimant chose consciously and on legal advice not to join the company…they are now seeking to go back on it – not, if I may say so, at their own invitation but at your Lordship’s invitation.” And Mr Brant confirmed that he also opposed the joinder of SMRL because he would then need to bring a claim over against it (in case he would be barred in the future from doing so). He made it clear that previously Fortis had taken a deliberate decision not to involve SMRL. </p>

He otherwise disregarded the deliberate decision of Mrs Brewer not to join SMRL. He gave as his reason the “wholly unsatisfactory” possibility that after these proceedings were over “there would have to be further litigation after today with regard to a claim by [Mrs Brewer] against the limited company, particularly, as is not impossible, if a situation arose in which Mr Mann was personally liable in relation to the claim in tort but his company was liable in relation to the breach of warranty claim” (Day 2.1235). We find it difficult to understand this reasoning: Mr Malek’s written opening had said nothing about a claim against Mr Mann in tort; his skeleton was founded entirely on collateral warranty. Moreover, the premise of the judge’s reasoning is hard to follow. If Mrs Brewer had succeeded against Mr Mann, why should she want to start fresh proceedings against his company? And if she had failed against Mr Mann (a hypothesis the judge did not expressly envisage), it is indeed hard to think that there would have been any possibility of Mrs Brewer starting fresh proceedings against SMRL. The same is, in practice, true, had she succeeded, or failed, against Fortis. Further proceedings would either have been unnecessary, or at least most unlikely. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Submissions to this effect were made to the judge by Mr Ticciati in his grounds of appeal and on 5 October 2010: and he also pointed out to the judge that, although the claim over by Fortis against SMRL had not yet been formulated, yet alone tried and adjudicated, the judge had already in his handed down judgment determined that SMRL <span style="font-style:italic">was </span>liable to Fortis. For the judge had determined that the description of the car in the SMRL sale to Fortis (“Bentley Motor Car”) meant such a car “containing a 1930 Speed Six engine and a 1930 Speed Six chassis”, and that that contract had been broken, and in coming to that conclusion had intruded Mr Mann’s collateral warranty into the meaning and effect of the contracts of sale and of hire purchase (see the judge’s “Principal findings” at judgment 3, para 202 (14) – (19)), and had done so without considering additional issues which arose between SMRL and Fortis (such as the description of the car in SMRL’s invoice to Fortis, SMRL’s conditions of contract, the absence of any collateral warranty to Fortis, and questions of damages).  The judge said that if he had gone too far in expressing any liability as between SMRL and Fortis, that was a “procedural slip” (5 October 2010 transcript at 1474). </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">“SMRL and Fortis have reached agreement that the third party proceedings should be stayed until after the conclusion of any appeal proceedings or any failure to reach agreement as to how the contribution proceedings should be determined in the light of this judgment.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">So the judge sought to undo the gravamen of Mr Ticciati’s complaint that he had effectively resolved the third party claim before it had even been granted entry into the proceedings, by stating that he had not made “any binding findings” between those parties. However, unavoidably, in our judgment, much damage had been done to the fair disposal of any claim by Mrs Brewer against SMRL and any claim over by Fortis against SMRL by the judge’s failure to grapple properly and fairly with the two, inherently interlinked, aspects of any application to implead SMRL for the first time at trial. Mrs Brewer’s application to join SMRL, which was in any event a difficult one, given its procedural history as explained above, could not be decided without taking into account the submissions of potential prejudice arising out of the possibility of a third party claim between Fortis and SMRL. Although the judge said he was acting out of a concern to ensure that all matters were dealt with in one set of proceedings at one trial, he managed to bifurcate Mrs Brewer’s claim and Fortis’s potential third party proceedings, and to leave SMRL to the unresolved prejudice of third party proceedings, prejudice which he ought to have taken into account and resolved before he had even determined to allow any joinder of SMRL. </p>

Once that had been done, it was nothing to do with Mrs Brewer what Fortis did in those new circumstances. We reject those submissions. It was made plain to the judge that he could not decide the question of SMRL’s joinder by Mrs Brewer without also dealing with Fortis’s desire in such a case to bring a claim over against SMRL, and thus with the ensuing prejudice to SMRL. The matters were linked.</p>

We regret to find in these matters as well, when taken with everything else that we have had to discuss, an apparent lack of objectivity and fairness in the judge’s conduct of the trial. In truth, SMRL could not be fairly joined without taking full account of the procedural history of the proceedings down to trial and of the potential consequences for Fortis and SMRL. </p>

Mr Brant accepted that the judge could not properly consider the fairness of permitting that without having the third party claim pleaded out. It could not be predicted what additional witnesses, such as the broker, Mr Hardiman, might be needed.

There was no bailment by description, because there was no reliance on the description of the car as a Bentley Speed Six. The language of the Fortis contract with Mrs Brewer was merely for the sake of identification, not description. For these purposes, the Fortis contract terms were relevant. As part of this submission, we also had to take account of the way in which Mr Ticciati had argued a similar point, which Mr Brant also prayed in aid, to the effect that any description of the car was a matter of opinion and therefore was not to be regarded as intended to become a term of the hire purchase contract: with the result again that there was no bailment by description.</p>

It was a sale of specific goods, and as between Fortis and Mrs Brewer, between whom, unlike the position between Mrs Brewer and Mr Mann or SMRL, there was no discussion as to the car, their contract’s reference to the goods as “One Bentley Speed Six Car” had been put forward by Mr Hardiman (Mrs Brewer’s agent) merely for the sake of identification. Mrs Brewer may have relied on Mr Mann and/or SMRL, but not upon Fortis. Fortis knew nothing about the car; it was a finance house not a dealer in vintage Bentleys. Mr Mann and SMRL were not Fortis’s agents (this was an unregulated hire purchase transaction). In this connection Mr Brant relied upon Fortis’s contract terms, even though the judge found them to be unfair and thus excluded by section 6(2) of the Unfair Contracts Terms Act 1977 and there was no appeal from that finding: because he could rely upon them not as an exclusion but as negativing reliance. </p>

Indeed, Mr Brant barely pressed that point of reliance on Fortis’s terms. He rather relied on some citation of treatises and jurisprudence.

Even so, Fortis knew that, in the run-up to their contract, the Customer had been attracted to the car by the salesmanship of an expert dealer, and that the description of the car in all probability derived from that dealer.

That was a sale by a dealer to a collector, of a painting acquired by the dealer at auction for £30,000 and sold to the collector for £1.5 million. The collector had used the services of a professional agent to help him acquire the painting (albeit the agent’s expertise was vastly outweighed by the dealer’s). The dealer’s brochure had described the painting as by Van Dyck, as did the invoice, and that was the firmly expressed belief of the dealer. However, the dealer had set out in its brochure a full account of the history and scholarship of the painting, including the contrary opinion of a distinguished Van Dyck scholar that the painting was not by Van Dyck himself but had been painted in his studio under his eye. Unfortunately, the agent, too keen to earn his commission, had misrepresented some of the information to his principal, the collector. However, Buckley J held that the buyer was bound by his agent’s knowledge and that a fair reading of the brochure was that there was a contrary opinion by a distinguished scholar, and that there was only limited reliance by the agent. In the event, it was held that the sale was not a sale by description and that it was not intended to be a term of the contract that the painting was by Van Dyck. The case illustrates the subtlety with which such issues may have to be decided.</p>

However, we repeat, the judge has found such terms unfair and there is no appeal from that finding.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">“All this is a matter of common knowledge amongst dealers in the art market, and, I would expect, amongst all but the most inexperienced or naïve of collectors. It means that almost any attribution to a recognised artist, especially of a picture whose provenance is unknown, may be arguable. In sales by auction, where the seller does not know who the buyer will be, the completeness with which the artist’s name is stated in the catalogue, e.g. “Peter Paul Rubens,” “P.P. Rubens” or “Rubens” signifies in a descending scale the degree of confidence with which the attribution is made. Nowadays an auctioneer’s conditions of sale usually, perhaps invariably, so declare and, further, that any description is an opinion only. But in sales by private treaty by one dealer to another there is no such practice. That would suggest that there the seller’s attribution is not a matter of importance. Indeed, Mr. Evelyn Joll, who gave evidence at the trial as to the professional practices of art dealers, went further. The effect of his evidence was that neither of the conditions implied by sections 13(1) and 14(2) could apply by a sale by one dealer to another. He said that an art dealer’s success depended on, and was judged by, his ability to exercise his own judgment. It was not customary for a dealer to rely in any way on the judgment or representations of the dealer from whom a picture was being purchased. </p>

But he did, I think, accept it as showing that many dealers habitually deal with each other on the principle caveat emptor. For my part, being confident that that principle would receive general acceptance amongst dealers, I would say that the astuteness of lawyers ought to be directed towards facilitating, rather than impeding, the efficient working of the market. The court ought to be exceedingly wary in giving a seller’s attribution any contractual effect. To put it in lawyer’s language, the potential arguability of almost any attribution, being part of the common experience of the contracting parties, is part of the factual background against which the effect, if any, of an attribution must be judged.”</p>

Mr Brewer had been a dealer in cars, albeit modern cars, and had been a vintage Bentley enthusiast for many years and was particularly knowledgeable about Speed Sixes (para 34 above), and he was arguably an important influence in the background, even in the foreground, of these transactions. The Brewers knew about <span style="font-style:italic">Hay</span>. Expert opinion was available to the judge as to how such cars were described, even if the judge thought that it was of no relevance to the questions of law he had to decide. There is an intrinsic difficulty about how to describe a car which has in its past been more or less dismantled and is then rebuilt, in part out of an original chassis, in part out of a process of cannibalisation, in part by the fitting on of a replica body, and so on. Such rebuilding is we suspect part and parcel of the survival of all but the rarest of such cars. We applaud the judge in expecting high standards of honesty (even if we fear we have had to criticise him in finding dishonesty where none was alleged). But it is not for the law to destroy a market by demanding some perfect correspondence or authenticity which, save possibly in the rarest and most price-demanding of cases, can no longer be achieved. The intrinsic difficulty of such cases is illustrated in the <span style="font-style:italic">Harlingdon </span>case<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>itself<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>by the fact that Stuart-Smith LJ there dissented.

If, which pending re-trial we cannot anticipate, Mr Mann were able to satisfy the court upon re-trial of the submission made by Mr Ticciati to this court, namely that what Mr Mann said to the Brewers would have been properly and objectively understood as a matter of opinion on the philosophical question of what constitutes a Bentley Speed Six, then it would be an open question whether Mrs Brewer could rely on the description, which she herself introduced into her contract with Fortis, as intended to be a term of the contract on which she relied. In this respect, however, so much depends on the nature of the knowledge which Mr or Mrs Brewer displayed to Mr Mann, and to a proper understanding of the full details of the conversation which the Brewers and Mr Mann had together on 20 May 2007. Plainly Mrs Brewer could not rely on the description of the car in the Fortis hire purchase contract to complain, for instance, of the fact that the car had a replica body on it. Similarly, if Mr Mann had not said, as Mrs Brewer alleges he did, that the car had a Speed Six engine, but had rather said that it had an engine prepared to Speed Six specification, as he alleges, and if, objectively understood, that would have told the Brewers, or put them on notice, that the car did not have a Speed Six engine as distinct from an engine prepared to Speed Six specification, then, even if it were to be the case, which is in dispute, that the description of the car as a 1930 Bentley Speed Six would otherwise prima facie mean that the car also had to have a 1930 Speed Six engine in order to comply with that description,  we do not think that Mrs Brewer could contend that she had an implied term in her contract to the effect that the car must, in order to correspond with its description, contain a 1930 Speed Six engine. Ultimately, therefore, the issue currently under discussion cannot, we think, be divorced from the nature of the information which Mrs Brewer obtained from Mr Mann, and the proper understanding of the expert evidence. Therefore, for the reasons which we have set out above relating to our concerns as to how the judge approached the evidence that he heard, we conclude that this issue cannot ultimately be decided save upon a re-trial.     </p>

Thus, to take this case, the generic description “1930 Speed Six” was one which was capable of covering any car with an authentic Speed Six chassis whatever the provenance of its engine. In this case, the description was intended by the seller to describe a car which started life with a Speed Six [engine] but which had subsequently been provided with a replacement engine which had not started its life as a Speed Six engine. However, Mrs Brewer communicated to Mr Mann prior to the sale of the car that she wanted a car whose engine was a 1930 Speed Six engine that was directly associated with the Speed Six golden age and with W.O.’s racing, speed, engineering and mechanical skills. Mrs Brewer’s evidence, which I have accepted, was that she made it clear to Mr Mann that she wanted a 1930 Speed Six engine for investment, historical and emotional reasons. It was therefore an integral part of the description that she relied on in entering into the deposit contract and hire purchase agreement that the car’s engine was a Speed Six engine, albeit a replacement Speed Six engine, that had been installed into the car in 1930 by the Cricklewood works subsequent to its first delivery earlier that year and which had thereafter retained the essential features of that original engine despite a rebuilding of the car in 1979-1980 with the necessitous use of some new parts.</p>

For SMRL or Fortis to avoid liability, the relevant contractual description would have had to have referred expressly to the replacement engine actually in the car and would also have had to have described the physical changes that had occurred to that engine and its current performance capabilities by reference to a defined specification and the tests that had been carried out to prove those capabilities.</p>

I have already found that the phrase had the same meaning as, or incorporated, the phrase warranted by Mr Mann, namely that the car’s engine was a “Speed Six engine”. There was a breach of the various implied terms that the car conformed to this description in that no part of the extended description was complied with.

Mr Fenn’s support for Mr Mann’s position was significantly eroded when he accepted in cross-examination that the car’s description should have been a “Speed Six with a 1927 Standard engine modified to Speed Six specification”. This approach to describing the car was said to have been confirmed by the fact that the DVLA had been prepared to re-register the car with its Speed Six registration number and the BDC and other European vintage car clubs would classify the car as a Speed Six car…</p>

It is, of course, for the BDC, other vintage car clubs and the DVLA to decide how they will categorise a vintage car for their own particular purposes. Those descriptions or categorisations are not, however, definitive in relation to the meaning of a car’s contractual description, particularly where the contract is subject to the Sale of Goods (Implied Terms) Act. Thus<span style="font-style:italic">, although Mr Fenn’s repeated insistence that the car was a Speed Six might be correct if the description of the car is being considered purely from the standpoint of the BDC, it is wholly incorrect for the purposes of a contractual description </span>or for a bailment by description since the necessary contractual description must describe the car factually and accurately in a way that encapsulates the car that the seller is purporting to sell and the buyer has agreed to buy. As a result, a Speed Six’s contractual description will usually need to be very different from and much more detailed than the generic description promoted by Mr Mann and Mr Fenn in reliance on the BDC method of categorising vintage Bentleys.

The BDC’s limited definition of a Speed Six, or of any other vintage Bentley type, that was championed by Mr Fenn does not include any reference to the car’s continuous history. This means, in the context of the vintage Bentley trade, an authentic documentary record of the car throughout its history since 1930. These documents should identify the registered owner of the car and its use throughout that history and should also identify and authenticate the parts introduced into the car since it left the Cricklewood works. I would add that the car’s continuous history also entails the production of a certified or authenticated test certificate or test results which proves that the car satisfies any stated and accepted applicable specification following any significant change to either its engine or chassis.</p>

These purposes are to define who may be a member of the BDC and which car may enter any particular race, competition or rally that it sponsors. The method of classification used by the BDC was not formally established in evidence but I am satisfied that the broad and somewhat rudimentary system of classification used by Mr Fenn with its reference to chassis number without any reference to continuous documentary history is used within the BDC and is workable for its limited purposes…</p>

However, the BDC’s method of describing a Speed Six is not a sufficient method of describing the Speed Six car type for contractual purposes o[r] for the purposes of a sale by bailment by description. This is because the Speed Six car type has a limited membership of no more than 181 cars but all, or the vast majority of those cars have now been substantially changed and are no longer capable of being accurately described for contractual purposes, without qualification and elaboration, as a 1930 Speed Six car.</p>

Each surviving Speed Six has changed significantly over the years, some beyond recognition, from the car that left the Cricklewood works on first delivery. The Speed Six characteristics or qualities that any one potential buyer or Speed Six enthusiast are looking for in any one of these unique cars include some of the intangible features of the car: its performance during its active racing lifetime; its being the product of the design, engineering and mechanical skills of W.O. and his unique team of assistants in the vital production years between 1929 and 1930; its having been produced in the Cricklewood workshop; its current performing capability; its present standard of upkeep and appearance; its current value as an historic and unique vintage car and its future potential for keeping or increasing its current value as a collector’s item in a changing and unpredictable market.</p>

It may be observed that Mr Fenn’s evidence is in essence accepted, including his firm evidence that the car was, at any rate according to the BDC test, a Speed Six because it incorporated at least part of the chassis with its chassis number; but his evidence is side-stepped. Even so, Mr Ticciati, joined by Mr Brant, would submit that this passage, to the extent that it accepted Mr Fenn’s evidence, omitted to observe and give credit for the fact that such evidence was effectively confirmed also by Mr Sibson where he agreed in cross-examination that the car, even with the engine it contained and such as he found it and the car to be, could still be described as a Speed Six (see at para 139 above). The judge’s acceptance of Mr Fenn’s evidence is also confirmed by the first sentence of his para 186 cited above.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The third strand of the judge’s reasoning also needs emphasising. It is alluded to in a number of places in his judgment, for instance in his comment at judgment 4 para 38 that “Mr Fenn came close to accepting the gist of Mr Sibson’s reasoning when admitting in cross-examination that the car’s description should have included a reference to its reconstructed 1927 Standard engine” (an observation repeated in the judge’s para 175 just cited above). It is emphasised in full flourish in the passage cited above. In our judgment, however, the judge is confusing two separate issues. One is what “Speed Six car” means and whether our car corresponded with that description. The other is how the car might best be described so as to avoid any argument as to whether such a description might be said to be inadequate, negligent or worse. The second issue raises a question which might arise in the context of a claim in misrepresentation, or for breach of a <span style="font-style:italic">Hedley Byrne </span>duty of care, or in fraud, or, where a contract is one of the utmost good faith, in non-disclosure. However, none of those matters are in question in this case, and least of all in the claim against Fortis. The first issue asks, more prosaically (however difficult such questions may be): “What is the description in question? Did the object correspond with it?” The second issue asks a normative question: “What is the defendant’s duty? What should he have said or done? Did he say or do what he should have said or done?” The first issue does not ask a normative question, but raises a question of construction followed by a question of fact.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">What is the judge saying in the extended passage just cited? On any view, his is an extremely demanding test for a car described as a Bentley Speed Six. It may be doubted whether there are many, if any, surviving Speed Sixes which could successfully meet every aspect of this test: at any rate that would have been an interesting matter to put to Mr Fenn and Mr Sibson. There are aspects of the judge’s test, indeed, which do not seem to go to description at all, but to quality. Still other aspects seem to go not to description, but to a means of evidencing performance. The important emphasis placed on a car’s continuous history, required to be proved by “an authentic documentary record…throughout its history since 1930”, reflects a theme which, as we have observed above, is repeatedly played throughout the judgment: but we are unable to acknowledge this requirement as coming within the concept of description of a car, however much such a record would be valuable evidence of provenance. However, in our judgment proof of provenance or of history has to be negotiated for: it does not come for free, and it is not inherent in an article’s description. If a seller sells a Hepplewhite chair, and even if in context that means a chair from Hepplewhite’s workrooms and not just a period chair in the style of Hepplewhite, he does not by that description promise anything further about the chair’s history, provenance, or documentation over the last two centuries and more. As for the aesthetic and romantic aspects of ownership of a Bentley Speed Six, we are not sure these have a role to play in description: but again, if a buyer wants to negotiate for knowledge about “its performance during its active racing lifetime” (if any), then he must stipulate for it. Nothing of this seems to us to be inherent in the car’s description. A Bentley Speed Six would, as it seems to us, be a Bentley Speed Six even if it had spent the whole of its life mouldering in a Maharajah’s garage, and disintegrating there into dilapidation, before being rebuilt in the modern era from its disintegrated parts. Perhaps there is romance even in such a case, but it has nothing to do with description. </p>

So far as is known, none of the surviving Speed Sixes remain in the condition that they were in when they left the Cricklewood works given the racing and hard driving that many were subjected to and the relatively short life of the bodywork. Many would also have been adapted in the early years of their life to incorporate the ever-changing and improved specification of Speed Six parts. After 1931, most of the surviving Speed Sixes were abandoned, mothballed and cannibalised such that, by 1939, a Speed Six had no calculable trade value.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In our judgment, each of the three strands in the judge’s reasoning was in error. As for his first, it was not permissible for the judge to import into the hire purchase contract between Fortis and Mrs Brewer a separate warranty which may have been given by Mr Mann to Mrs Brewer as a result of a private conversation to which Fortis was not privy. It would seem therefore that without importing into the hire purchase contract between Mrs Brewer and Fortis the effect of the conversation between Mrs Brewer and Mr Mann, as controversially found by the judge, the judge would not have been in the position to conclude that Fortis’s responsibilities under its contract with Mrs Brewer extended as far as the judge considered that they did. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, the judge was wrong to ignore and set aside the evidence of both Mr Fenn and Mr Sibson as to the common understanding of what is meant by a “Speed Six car”. To adopt and adapt the reasoning of Nourse LJ in the <span style="font-style:italic">Harlingdon </span>case, that common understanding was part of the factual background against which the description of a Speed Six is to be judged.  As we have observed above (at para 284), Mrs Brewer was not a dealer, nor was she a member of the BDC. However, her husband who advised her in the purchase was knowledgeable about Speed Sixes, and she knew about the BDC and, as her letter before action said (see at para 66 above), “she regarded the Bentley Drivers Club as being of the utmost good standing and importance”. The evidence of Mr Fenn and Mr Sibson in this respect was supported also by the evidence of Mr Mann, but also by the evidence regarding the DVLA registration of the car, and by the fact that Mr James, and even Bonhams, described the car, knowing of its ramifications, as a 1930 Bentley Speed Six. None of them could have described the car in such a way if, in truth, its description as such necessitated that it contain a 1930 original Speed Six engine. The law will go amiss if it sets itself up against the understanding of the market in the way in which the judge thought himself obliged to do.</p>

However, it seems to us that no such necessity exists. One might sell a “1990 Volvo”, but there would, we suggest, be no requirement that it contain a 1990 Volvo engine. The engine might have been replaced in 2000 or 2010, and the replacement engine might differ somewhat from the original, without there being a misdescription. It might again be different if a car were described by its engine size, as in a “Herald 1200”, where a replacement engine might be of a smaller version. In such a case, there might be a failure to correspond with description. However, as has famously been said, context is everything. </p>

Middlebridge Scimitar Limited</span>, (unreported, 27 July 1990, Otton J), the case of the famous Bentley known as “Old Number One”, which the judge attached to his judgment as Appendix 1.

It was only the second of all Speed Sixes to be built and it was extraordinarily successful in racing during the 1929 and 1930 and subsequent seasons. In 1990 it was sold for £10 million (we emphasise the price) as “Old Number One” itself. Thus the case was argued on the basis that the car had to be that very car. The buyer subsequently resiled from the purchase because he suspected its authenticity, but Otton J held that its authenticity had been proved (rather like the proverbial grandfather’s axe) in that it had never completely lost its identity. It was not the “original” Old Number One (because it was not composed of the same parts). It was not the “genuine” Old Number One, for it had changed its character. However, it had never disappeared into limbo or from view, had never died or been abandoned or cannibalised, and therefore was not a “resurrection” or “reconstruction”. Its identity was proved with the help of its logbook and service records at any rate down to 1939; and successive owners could be identified. It had been rebuilt a number of times. The case was decided very much on the basis of expert views as to how to consider such matters. Otton J concluded that “There is no other Bentley either extinct or extant which could legitimately lay claim to the title of Old Number One or its reputation. It was this history and reputation, as well as the metal, which was for sale…”. In our judgment the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Hubbard</span> is of very little assistance to us. However, we note that both its chassis had been modified (although its chassis number survived) and its engine had been completely substituted (from a 6½ litre to a 8½ litre engine). One important witness “knew it by the chassis number which, as he told me, is the true identity of any car”. The judge said that “the expert evidence is all one way”. Mr Hay was one of the witnesses. The car had passed through the hands of Mr Mann, who had sold it to the seller, who had himself rebuilt it. Mr Mann was described as “a celebrated vintage car dealer”. </p>

However, we would also observe that, if we were wrong in that conclusion, it would not automatically follow that Mrs Brewer could hold it against Fortis that the engine in the car was what it was. That would depend on the outcome of a re-trial. For if Mr Mann were to succeed on such a re-trial, so that it was accepted that he did tell Mrs Brewer that the engine was “prepared to Speed Six specification”, and that that signified that the engine was not an original Speed Six engine, then we doubt that Mrs Brewer could complain to Fortis that the engine was not an original Speed Six: just as she could not complain that the bodywork was not original.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In our judgment, the answer to this question has been effectively answered above. Once the judge’s extended description and requirements for the contract are stripped away, as in our judgment they must be, the evidence, which lies essentially in the hands of the two experts, is that the car complied with its description as a “1930 Bentley Speed Six”. We are not concerned with its engine (or with whether any complaint could in certain circumstances be mounted as to whether a car with the “wrong” engine failed to comply with an implied term as to satisfactory quality). Nevertheless Mr Sibson said that only the front part of the chassis (with its chassis number) was original, and the judge accepted that evidence. The judge’s view on that question must, for the reasons given above, fall as part of the need for a re-trial. However, solely for present purposes we assume that his finding survives. Even so, we conclude that on the expert evidence of both experts, the car corresponded with its description. Mr Fenn was clearly of that opinion, and the judge was prepared to accept that, adopting Mr Fenn’s, BDC orientated, stance, the car could be called a 1930 Speed Six. But Mr Sibson, for all his criticisms of the car, ultimately acknowledged a similar conclusion. As he was asked and answered (see para 139 above):</p>

Ex hypothesi, there was no claim for loss of value, and no claim to reject or rescind. For the same reason there could be no claim for repudiation damages. The judge had therefore been wrong to award Mrs Brewer her full claim of £94,555, made up of her deposit of £35,000 and instalments paid under the contract. In any event, even if Mrs Brewer were entitled to more than nominal damages, she had to give credit for the value of the enjoyment of the car for the period it was in her possession, some 14/15 months. </p>

Since in their case the only possible breach could relate to the engine, and not the car, and since there was no claim for loss of value, the only effective breach was, he submitted, the entirely nominal one that the engine had started life as a Standard 6½ litre engine rather than a Speed Six engine. Indeed, unless the modified engine failed to match the specification of a Speed Six engine (which, it will be recalled, was said to have been neither pleaded nor proved) Mrs Brewer’s complaint came down to one about the absence of a stamp of an original Speed Six number mark on the engine. In the absence of any claim based on value, that was an essentially trivial claim which could sound at most in nominal damages. In any event, Mr Ticciati relied on doctrines of causation and remoteness to submit that Mrs Brewer’s damages claim by reference to what she had paid out to Fortis could not have been anticipated. It could not have been anticipated that she would have lost her contract and the car by her own deliberate decision to stop payments under the Fortis contract. Finally, Mr Ticciati also advanced the submission that at very least Mrs Brewer’s claim must give credit for the enjoyment of the car while in her possession.  </p>

Odgers </span>assists Mrs Brewer in respect of either claim. In <span style="font-style:italic">Odgers </span>the dealer warranted that the car was “in perfect condition”, and the customer, in reliance on that collateral warranty, entered into a hire purchase agreement with the finance house. The car was in fact incurably unroadworthy, and the customer only drove 100 miles in it before losing all confidence in it (not unnaturally, since the brakes had failed and the car had crushed a perambulator). He therefore refused to pay any more instalments and asked the finance house to take the car back. He had in truth accepted its repudiation of their agreement. Unfortunately, he was persuaded by the finance house that it was all the same (under the contract) whether the customer returned it or if it repossessed the car under its clause 8, which entitled it to outstanding instalments and damages as though the <span style="font-style:italic">customer </span>had repudiated the agreement. At trial, the finance house was awarded its claim but the customer recovered all his loss against the dealer. No issue arose in that case as to whether the 100 miles unsafely driven in the unroadworthy car should constitute some discount. The finance house, having recovered its claim, drops out of the story; but the dealer appealed, submitting that the damages against him should be reduced because (a) the true measure of the customer’s loss was to be found only in the reduced value of the car; and (b) that the way in which the finance house had taken advantage of the contractual situation was not to be held against him. Therefore, <span style="font-style:italic">Odgers </span>has absolutely nothing to say about damages against a finance house: the finance house itself recovered damages. Nor can we find the concept of reliance damages discussed in the case. </p>

The court was of course entitled to say that a difference in value claim is not the only way in which a customer may suffer loss in such a situation. And the ultimate issue was whether the larger loss that he had suffered because the finance house had successfully bamboozled him about the consequences of the situation was to be at his risk or at the dealer’s. Not surprisingly this court held that it was to be at the dealer’s risk. Holroyd Pearce LJ said (in a passage cited by the judge at judgment 4, para 219) at 222:</p>

In the present case the hire-purchase agreement was the purpose and the product of the warranty. To assess the damage, one has to consider the difference between the defendant’s position if he had entered into such an agreement in respect of a car as warranted and his position when he has entered into it in respect of a persistently and, as it seems, incurably unroadworthy car. The difficulty with regard to the return or retaking of the car was clearly foreseeable and the loss under the agreement was loss directly and naturally resulting from the breach of warranty. That loss includes the wasted instalments and the amounts payable under clause 8. Therefore the judge was entitled to hold as he did.”</p>

Tolly</span>, we would mention <span style="font-style:italic">Yeoman Credit v. Apps </span>[1962] 2 QB 508 (CA). That involved the hire purchase of a second-hand Ford. The car as delivered was unusable, unroadworthy and unsafe and required the spending of some £100 to put it into reasonable condition. The customer complained but paid the first three instalments, then stopped, and the finance house terminated the agreement. The customer was sued, but counterclaimed for £170, the sums paid under the agreement, as money paid on a total failure of consideration. The court held that the customer would have been entitled to accept a repudiation of the agreement, and that had he done so there would have been a total failure of consideration and he could have recovered everything he had paid under the agreement. As it was, however, he had kept the car and could recover only the cost, £100, of putting the car into a roadworthy condition, less the August instalment which had fallen due before the termination. In other words, <span style="font-style:italic">Yeoman Credit v. Apps </span>is not authority for the recovery of the whole of the money expended under a hiring contract, on the contrary, it is against such recovery. The award was to restore the car to the condition to which the customer had been entitled to have it put: the claim that succeeded was only a value claim or its equivalent. In that case, however, the car could be made roadworthy. </p>

The customer had used the car only twice. The trial judge had awarded the customer the estimated costs of repairs, £81, as in <span style="font-style:italic">Yeoman Credit v. Apps</span>. This court, however, held that that was not the correct measure of damages, but that the customer should recover what he had paid (or was required to pay up to termination) in respect of the hiring, less a discount of £5 in respect of the two trips he had made in the car (a total of some £132). <span style="font-style:italic">Yeoman Credit v.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The logic of the award in <span style="font-style:italic">Charterhouse Credit v. Tolly </span>was, for Donovan LJ,  that a hire purchase contract was different from both a sale and a straightforward hiring contract: because the cost of the ultimate option to purchase the car at the end of the hiring for the nominal amount of £1 was built into the transaction. If a defective car was the subject of a straightforward sale, the loss was the difference in value of the car as it ought to have been and as it was, which may be represented by the cost of repairs. If a defective car was simply hired, the loss was prima facie the cost of hiring, for that was all the hirer was supposed to be getting. But under a hire purchase contract, the hirer was also buying the option to purchase the car: therefore what the hirer lost by being provided with a totally defective car was not only the cost of hiring a similar car (for which the finance house contended) but the “cost of hiring a similar car on similar terms as to the eventual option to purchase for £1” (at 706): for which purpose the cost under the contract which was the subject matter of the litigation could stand as an adopted exemplar. However, that was on the basis that “For this outlay…he has received nothing, owing to the company’s breach of contract, except the two rides to Greenwich” (<span style="font-style:italic">ibid</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">per </span>Donovan LJ). For those rides, the customer had to give credit for £5 (see 711, 713 and 717). It would seem therefore that, for Donovan LJ, the finance house in breach must repay by way of damages that element of the hire which represents the cost of the option (ignoring the fact that the reason why the customer has lost the value of that option is his own fault in not maintaining his payments). </p>

But the assessment of damages has never been an exact science; it is essentially practical, and a contracting party who has wholly failed to deliver that which he has contracted to lend cannot complain if the court takes a somewhat severe view of his failure to implement his promise and makes the punishment fit the crime. This case, in my judgment, will lay down no principle of law in the assessment of damages, though it may form a useful guide in similar cases. But for the fact that the car moved briefly and sporadically during the hire the hirer could have reclaimed the money he has paid as on a total failure of consideration.

Donovan LJ had stressed the rationale that, by analogy with both simple sale and simple hire, the prima facie damages in such a case ought to be what it would cost to get elsewhere what had been promised. Upjohn LJ had disagreed with the view that that principle could be applied in a situation where the premium cost (above that of hiring) of the option to purchase had been lost, not by reason of the breach by the finance house but by reason of the hirer’s own non-payment entitling the finance-house to terminate the contract. However, he was prepared to reach the same financial conclusion as Donovan LJ on the basis that the hirer had derived next to no benefit from his contract, and that a robust and severe penalty (making “the punishment fit the crime”) would do justice even if such an assessment was practical rather than principled. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">What is not clear is how the differing rationales of Donovan LJ and Upjohn LJ would apply to the situation in the present case, where the car is not wholly defective, but there is, let us assume, a breach of collateral warranty or a breach of the implied statutory condition. Because the car was wholly unlike the cars in <span style="font-style:italic">Odgers</span>, <span style="font-style:italic"> Apps</span>, <span style="font-style:italic"> </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Tolly </span>in that our car was in good condition and capable of giving the Brewers 14 or so months of highly pleasurable motoring (that much is clear on the Brewers’ witness statements), during which they (or rather Mr Brewer) drove the car for something like 2900 miles, which Mr Mann said in evidence was the equivalent for a modern car of some 40,000 miles, it is not at all clear to us that the <span style="font-style:italic">Charterhouse Credit v. Tolly </span>solution is appropriate here. After all, Upjohn LJ articulated the thought, which seems to us to be correct, that, although a hire-purchase contract contains an important element built into the price of its hiring for the option to purchase at the end of the hiring, the hirer cannot complain of the loss of that element in circumstances where, as in our case, the contract is lost due to the hirer’s own failure to keep up payments under his contract. It seems to us therefore to be entirely feasible that Mrs Brewer has lost nothing. She has had full use of a fine car which has given her and her husband nothing but pleasure, until the Bonhams valuation which only arose because Mrs Brewer had decided to sell the car, and she has lost nothing of value in terms of the car, which was worth every penny which she agreed to spend on it. It is true that she has lost, on the present hypothesis, the chance which she thought she had, of acquiring a Bentley Speed Six, or a car with a warranted Bentley Speed Six engine, which for personal reasons of her own she prized even more highly, for sentimental or aesthetic rather than financial reasons, than the car which she hired for the period of the hire purchase contract. However, how is that loss to be assessed? We have had no submissions from Mr Downey on that subject other than a reliance on <span style="font-style:italic">Yeoman Credit v. Odgers </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Charterhouse Credit v. Tolly</span> together with the submission that, despite the latter, no credit need be given for the use enjoyed. Even that sentimental or aesthetic feeling was disappointed only at the very end of the time of possession of the car, when Mrs Brewer had in any event decided to sell the car. As for any investment value bound up with the correct configuration of car and/or engine, there is, as we have remarked before, no claim.  </p>

Normally, the basis of damages in contract is for the difference between the claimant’s position on the basis that the warranty in question is fulfilled and the position faced in the light of breach. Mrs Brewer’s claim is not for negligent misstatement or in misrepresentation: and even if it were, <span style="font-style:italic">South Australia Asset Management Corporation v. York Montague Ltd (SAAMCO) </span>[1997] AC 191<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>is a modern warning that there are no automatic damages for all the consequences of such misstatements (while damages under the Misrepresentation Act presents its own peculiarities). In any event, if, on the rationale of Upjohn LJ, not even the finance house is prima facie liable for the loss of the purchase option element in the hiring price in circumstances where the customer is himself responsible for the loss of the hiring contract, it would seem to be an a fortiori position that the dealer who gives a warranty to the hirer, and is at one remove from the hire purchase contract, should not be liable for that element either. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">One way of quantifying the amount of this credit is to consider that for some 14 months Mrs Brewer had the use of £390,000 finance for which she had been willing to pay what we would regard as a market driven rate which has been calculated to be at 8.59%. That would provide a sum of approximately £39,000. Another way of looking at the matter is to suppose that it would have cost many hundreds of pounds a day, perhaps as much as £800 a day to hire a valuable car of this nature (although such a rate would almost certainly fall for a lengthy hiring period of 14 months). In such circumstances, it was submitted on behalf of both Mr Mann/SMRL and Fortis that a rate of £100 a day would be on any view an appropriate amount for which Mrs Brewer could properly be required to give credit. She possessed the car from 7 June 2007 to 7 August 2008 under the contract, and retained the car despite the termination of the contract until 3 September 2008. That is 428 days under the contract and a further 28 days after its termination. We consider that Mrs Brewer ought to give credit for £45,000, and that no complaint could be made of such an assessment. That is not raised as a matter of counterclaim, but as an element in the assessment of her own damages.</p>

He does so even though the cases relied on for that submission do not, as it seems to us, support that rationale in a case such as ours; and even though those cases are concerned with cars which were so defective that they provided no value (or next to no value) to the hirer in circumstances, however, where the hirer could not claim a total absence of consideration. In these circumstances, and given the uncertainty, pending re-trial, of what Mr Mann told Mrs Brewer and therefore of the background of Mrs Brewer’s hire purchase of the car from Fortis, we are not minded to go any further into the question of what damages might have been available to Mrs Brewer on any of a number of possible alternative hypotheses.</p>

He set out the relevant provisions of the Fortis contract (clauses 8 and 9) which provided that non-payment of any instalment by the hirer was a breach of a fundamental condition and repudiation of the agreement entitling Fortis to terminate, and that upon such termination by Fortis the hirer would have to pay both any arrears due and, without prejudice to the right to any damages, (i) any demand made (provided it was made) by Fortis in an amount certified by Fortis “equal to the loss or costs sustained by [Fortis] in breaking fixed deposits or for re-employing funds” and (ii) “as agreed compensation for [Fortis’s] loss of profit, the total of all Payments (exclusive of VAT) which would have been payable during the unexpired period of this agreement, discounted at three per cent per annum…”.</p>

	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">(1) She has no outstanding liability to pay the outstanding hire charges because Fortis did not terminate for non-payment of hire but instead terminated in an attempt to pre-empt Mrs Brewer’s intimated claim to rescind the agreement and to reject the car.</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">(2) Further, Mrs Brewer may recover any recovery by Fortis of all its claims and of all payments it has received from Mrs Brewer, whether these for unpaid amounts or for charges or for damages. Mrs Brewer’s recovery is for damages flowing from Fortis’s misdescription so that Fortis’s claim fails either because it is eliminated by Mrs Brewer’s cross-claim or by defence open to Mrs Brewer of circuity of action. </p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">(3) Fortis did not purport to terminate the agreement on the ground that Mrs Brewer had repudiated it as a result of her non-payment and has not claimed damages based on her repudiation. This is because Fortis did not purport to rely on clause 8 or to refer to it in its termination notice when terminating the agreement and reliance on clause 8 cannot be inferred or presumed. </p>
	  </content>
	</level>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">(4) Mrs Brewer did not, in any event, repudiate the agreement.</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">(5) Fortis’s claim is based on an entitlement to claim sums pursuant to clause 9.4 of the contract but no demand or correctly formulated demand has ever been made for payment under that clause and a demand, or if made a correctly formulated written demand for payment, is a condition precedent to such payment. It is clear from the wording of that clause that a demand in writing is a condition precedent to claiming payment under that clause.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">(6) If, contrary to this finding, a written demand was made, it was not one that complied with the requirements of that clause. It is not sufficient for a mere demand for payment to have been made, the necessary demand must be for a precise sum calculated in accordance with clause 9.4 of the agreement. The clause makes it clear that the demand must be a demand for “the following payment”, that is a demand which identifies the sum, or sums, that are being claimed under each of the three heads specified in clause 9.4. Fortis have not pleaded that such a demand, or any demand, was made and no such demand was proved to have been made.”</p>

He points out that the quantum of the counterclaim was agreed. The evidence for it was contained in the second witness statement of Mr Mark Samson, Fortis’s broker manager. That statement was agreed and Mr Samson was not required to attend trial. The statement was based on Fortis’s original claim, post termination, then gave credit for the £425,000 received from SMRL, and ended by adding the costs of the abortive entry of the car into auction, which were £25,895. Fortis had made the required demand under clause 9.4 of the contract, which was not required to be in any form (see for instance the Fortis statement included with its solicitors’ letter to Mrs Brewer’s solicitors dated 15 October 2008, as further explained in Fortis’s solicitors’ letter dated 20 October 2008 with its specific reference to clause 9.4.2 of the contract). He also points out that there was no pleaded defence by reference to the lack of any contractual demand, and that the point was only raised out of the blue at trial (after agreement between the parties as to the amount of the counterclaim had been arrived at).  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In our judgment there is no answer to Fortis’s counterclaim. We have already held that Fortis was not in breach of its contract with Mrs Brewer. Mrs Brewer on the other hand was in breach of the payment provisions of her contract. Whether or not she was at common law in repudiation of her contract, the contract’s terms are clear (and understandable) that failure to pay the contract instalments is to be treated as a repudiation and permits termination, with the contractually agreed consequences. Although Mrs Brewer had pleaded that she had orally rescinded the contract before Fortis had terminated it, there was no attempt at trial, so far as we have been shown, to support that plea (nor Mrs Brewer’s allegation in correspondence that Fortis had agreed a moratorium), and on this appeal Mr Downey has not made any submission in connection with it. Therefore it must be taken to be established that Fortis terminated the contract for Mrs Brewer’s repudiatory breach, and it is irrelevant with what motive it did so. It is in fact entirely understandable that a finance house should terminate its contract in the face of non-payment first explained as being due to cash flow difficulties and then sought to be supported by an allegation of breach. The judge’s terse statements that Fortis did not terminate for non-payment of hire (when that it was precisely what Fortis’s letter of termination stated that it was doing, citing clause 8.2.1.1 of the contract) and that Mrs Brewer did not repudiate the contract are not understood. Mrs Brewer for her part made it plain that she did not seek damages on the basis of her acceptance of a Fortis repudiation or on the basis of rescission, but only on the basis of damages for breach. That means she accepted that she had not herself terminated the contract for Fortis’s breach.</p>

Particularly in an area of understandable concern for consumers, there has over the years been much litigation over such issues. In the present case, however, there was no dispute: it was agreed between Mrs Brewer and Fortis that, if Fortis was entitled to terminate and had properly invoked the termination provisions of its contract, then the amount of the payment to which it was entitled was the figure counterclaimed of £61,224, a sum which, as we have said, had been much reduced by reason of the resale of the car back to the dealer and was mainly made up of loss of finance profit on future instalments and the expenses of recovery, storage and  the abortive move to auction the car and such like.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We would also express our regret, even if in so doing we are ignorant of everything there might be to know about the course of these proceedings, that the parties did not manage to settle their disputes without litigation, or at least prior to trial. The duty of the court is to decide the issues that parties bring to it, but it is also a responsibility of the court, with all the experience it has of litigation, to warn litigants in general of the dangers and difficulties of the process. The sums at issue were not large, at any rate when once the car had been bought back by SMRL, something which Mr Mann had offered from an early stage. The dangers of litigation in terms of costs were considerable, to which might be added the additional dangers of increases in expense as the car lingered in storage and suffered the cost of being entered into and then pulled from auction. There were four potential parties to share in the possibilities of settlement, namely Mr Mann, SMRL (even if that company was eschewed as a defendant by Mrs Brewer), Fortis, and, of course, Mrs Brewer. It might be said that Mr Brewer was also, potentially, in the wings for these purposes. As for the issues, they were numerous and some of them were difficult. An agreed list of issues drawn up by the parties in the course of the proceedings numbered in excess of 20, which does not surprise us. The issues spanned issues of fact, such as the critical issue of what was said between Mrs Brewer and Mr Mann on 20 May 2007, of opinion, and of law. The critical issue of fact, which required the reconstruction of an oral conversation which had not been noted in writing, was always going to give rise to difficulty and uncertainty. The issues of expert evidence included the important and difficult one as to how the expression “Speed Six car” may properly be understood: the difficulty of this area is demonstrated, even if the context there was more or less different, by what Nourse LJ said about the attribution of paintings in the <span style="font-style:italic">Harlingdon </span>case. The same case illustrates the difficulty of legal analysis in a somewhat similar context. These complexities suggest that, unless of course Mr Mann did promise a Speed Six engine, the ultimate merits of the dispute(s) were not obvious. Even if Mr Mann did make that promise, there remained the problems of whether he or SMRL were liable for its breach, and whether Fortis was as well, and on top of that questions as to the extent of damages. In these circumstances it seems a shame that the parties could not have found for themselves a solution which sufficiently satisfied them all, so as to avoid much trouble, distress and risk. Litigation of this kind is or ought to be a matter of last resort.   </p>
