	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A traditional CDO  involves a number of investors contributing capital which is used to acquire a portfolio of income-generating assets.  The portfolio is divided into a notional hierarchy of 'tranches' which all carry different risk characteristics.  Investors are allocated to a tranche, and accordingly stand to gain the income generated by that tranche, whilst also bearing the risk associated with that tranche.  The parameters of each tranche are defined by an attachment point and a detachment point.  The attachment point describes the point at which a default in the underlying portfolio will impact on the tranche, and is usually expressed as a percentage of the total value of the portfolio (or "CDO notional").  For example, an attachment point of 4% means that if the total losses from defaults on the portfolio are less than 4% of the CDO notional, that tranche will suffer no loss.  However, once losses exceed 4%, the capital value of the tranche will begin to be written down. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The detachment point, also usually expressed as a percentage of the CDO notional, defines the level of default in the underlying portfolio at which the risk of losses associated with that tranche is exhausted.  For example, a detachment point of 5.5% means that once losses from defaults on the portfolio exceed 5.5%, there is no income or capital remaining for distribution to the investors holding that tranche, and their investment is wiped out.  The tranche width is the difference between the attachment and detachment points.  The tranche in the above example would have a tranche width of 1.5%.  Expressed in monetary terms, the tranche width represents the capital value of the tranche (i.e. the maximum that investors can lose).  So, for example, for a portfolio of investments worth US$1bn, a tranche width of 1.5% would correspond to a CDO notional of US$15m.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The hierarchical structure of a CDO means that a tranche with a lower attachment point carries a greater risk, and is known as a junior or junior mezzanine tranche.  A tranche with a higher attachment point carries a lesser risk, as it is protected by subordinate tranches which bear the first risk of loss.  In theory, it will also take fewer defaults to extinguish a tranche with a narrow tranche width than one with a wider tranche width. </p>

These include 'synthetic' STCDOs, under which rather than putting in cash to acquire an investment portfolio of bonds upfront, the portfolio is composed of CDS contracts which reference such bonds.  As an STCDO only has one investor, this hierarchy of tranches is wholly notional, in that the level of subordination of a tranche is not defined by reference to parameters of other actual tranches, but rather by reference to the credit buffer represented by the attachment point.  Such a synthetic STCDO can be structured on an unfunded basis, in which case the investors make no up-front payment but instead take the risk of having to make a future payment in the event of sufficient defaults occurring in the portfolio to impact their tranche.  Another potential variation is that the portfolio which underlies the STCDO can be either managed or static. </p>

The judge rejected Mr Bracy's evidence that he did not know what the "pot" was and did not understand that any payment would be kept secret from KWL.

The judge found that this episode ought to have alerted the UBS deal team to the fact that Value Partners was prepared to act contrary to the interests of the client which it purported to represent, and was happy to be paid by both parties to the proposed transaction, but that the deal team were quite content to continue to deal with Value Partners on this highly lucrative transaction and did not even think of ensuring that KWL was aware that this request had been made [214]-[217].</p>

Those present included Mr Heininger, Dr Schirmer, Mr Senf, Mr Blatz, and Mr Bracy.  Value Partners told UBS to avoid mentioning figures during this meeting and to emphasise the advantages of an STCDO for managing risk.  The judge found that this was because it did not want Dr Schirmer, who was making a first appearance in the negotiations at the proposed meeting, to hear figures which would indicate what premium KWL could expect to receive.  During the meeting UBS described the STCDOs as achieving the twin objectives of risk diversification and yield enhancement.  Whilst the meeting resulted in Mr Heininger understanding the nature of an STCDO, on the judge's findings Dr Schirmer had plainly understood very little [225]-[240].</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Because the STCDOs were large, complex and unusual transactions, they required approval by UBS's internal credit risk control ("CRC").  Mr Bracy and others in the deal team regarded this necessity as something of a nuisance.  They understood that for this purpose it would be important to emphasise the risk diversification aspects of the STCDOs since, as the judge found, the view of UBS's CRC would have been that an essentially speculative transaction designed primarily to achieve an upfront cash premium for KWL, which exposed it to even a modest risk of liabilities running into hundreds of millions of dollars, would have been a thoroughly unsuitable transaction for a municipal water company.  The judge found that it was the need to obtain UBS's internal approval for the deal which largely explains the increasing emphasis on risk reduction which appeared in the documents from this time [242]-[243].</p>

In an incident described as "beating up Mr Cox", Mr Senf, Mr Blatz, Mr Bracy and Mr Sanz-Paris saw off this unwelcome interference by Mr Cox.  Mr Senf sent an e-mail reassuring Mr Bracy that Mr Blatz had spoken to Mr Cox and that "everything ok!"  Mr Bracy passed this on to Mr Sanz-Paris, joking: "Anyone else you want me to beat up?".  The judge found that Mr Cox was sat upon by Mr Senf and Mr Blatz to make sure that he did not cause further trouble and that this confirmed the picture of Messrs Senf and Blatz working together with Mr Bracy to ensure the smooth conclusion of the deal regardless of KWL's interests.  It was also at this stage that Value Partners told UBS that they and KWL were not talking to anyone else about the deal.  The judge found that this was extremely valuable information as it left UBS free to maximise its profit from the deal free of any competition from another bank [251]-[258].</p>

On 16 May 2006 Mr Senf emailed both of these to Mr Bracy commenting "use the papers however you want". Mr Bracy acted on this suggestion by causing the two ratings to be split into two separate documents and passing on only the out of date higher rating to Mr Sanz-Paris.  This rating then featured reasonably prominently in the deal team's application for approval of the deal.

Mr Bracy provided Mr Heininger with a script for the meeting which he hoped would satisfy CRC.  Mr Bracy knew that it was likely to be important to CRC that the purpose of the transaction was to reduce KWL's risk, that all necessary approvals were in place, and that KWL had been advised by appropriate professionals. Mr Bracy therefore set out the approach which Mr Heininger should adopt at the meeting, whether or not these things were actually true.  The judge found that the fact that Mr Bracy was telling Value Partners in this way how best to brief Mr Heininger illustrates that their joint objective was to persuade CRC to approve the transaction, if necessary by providing a deceitful account of the purpose of the transaction and that there was no question of Value Partners providing any independent advice to KWL [285]-[297].</p>

Mr Bracy subsequently escalated the approval decision to UBS's senior management, and a protracted struggle for approval ensued.

Pursuant to this condition, on 8 June 2006 Mr Sanz-Paris sent a presentation, headed "Collateralised Debt Obligations — Presentation to KWL", to Mr Heininger for him to present at KWL's next Supervisory Board meeting.  Although the presentation referred to KWL's investment in the STCDO as being "to diversify the risk concentration and achieve an enhanced yield", and although it had from the outset been made clear to UBS that at least one important objective of KWL was to achieve a substantial upfront cash premium, there was no mention in the presentation of the fact that the enhanced yield was to take the form of upfront cash, let alone of the amount of the premium.  The judge found that consistently with Value Partners' instruction to Mr Bracy, even the KWL Supervisory Board was not to be told about one of the most important features of the transaction [320]-[322].</p>

This posed a problem as there was no such material.  Having discussed it with Value Partners it was proposed by Mr Czekalowski of UBS that in order to fulfil this condition a letter should be obtained from Value Partners stating that it had "conceived and marketed the structure to KWL", that it "had a mandate from KWL prior to approaching UBS for execution" and that it had "explained to named senior management of KWL the risks of and the structure of the Transaction and that KWL understood and has accepted the structure and any and all associated risks".  The judge found that the first two of these statements were untrue, as Mr Czekalowski knew.  Value Partners had not conceived or marketed the transaction and did not simply approach UBS to execute an already developed transaction for which it already had a mandate from KWL.  The transaction had been conceived in its general outline by Mr Bracy in his initial discussions with Value Partners.  This outline had then been proposed to Mr Heininger who had responded enthusiastically to the idea of a transaction which could generate US $30 million in cash.  It had then been marketed to KWL by UBS, for example at the 9 May 2006 meeting, and in the course of this marketing, the transaction had been developed to meet KWL's requirements [323]-[326].</p>

On 28 September 2006 the Mayor's office in Leipzig requested KWL's Supervisory Board to investigate and PricewaterhouseCoopers ("PwC") were instructed.  On 6 October 2006 there was a meeting of the Supervisory Board at which Mr Heininger lied about the purpose of his trip to Dubai.  Once PwC had produced their reports, a further Supervisory Board meeting was held on 8 November 2006.  The conclusion of the Supervisory Board was set out in a press release issued on 8 November 2006.  This stated that it had decided that travelling first class and by Concorde was not appropriate for KWL management, that no gifts had been accepted, and that the statements about the trip to Dubai made by Mr Heininger should be accepted.  These statements included that the invitation had come from the "arranger" of the cross-border leases (i.e. Global Capital Finance) which was contrary to his initial explanation, that "no further contractual relationships between the parties (investor, arranger, LVB)" had taken place, and that "no further such trips on invitations of the business partners had taken place".

Their confidence was well founded. The facts that Mr Bracy responded as he did, apparently without surprise or qualms of conscience, and that he was the one who suggested that those he had approached to provide false evidence might need an incentive to co-operate, strongly suggests that so far as he was concerned, and even though he was not aware of the bribe paid to Mr Heininger, the dishonesty of Mr Senf and Mr Blatz was not news.

KWL also sold credit protection to Depfa, as intermediary bank, a 10-year term on two Aa3-rated single tranche STCDOs (with a tranche width of 1.5% covering losses between 4.2% and 5.7% of the portfolio) in return for a combined premium of US$12m.  The KWL-Depfa swaps have been referred to as the "Depfa Front Swap" and the Depfa-UBS swaps as the "Depfa Back Swaps". UBS paid Depfa's intermediation fee of €1.3m.</p>

Although not required to determine the point, the judge would have held that the liability of Depfa to UBS was dependent on KWL being liable to Depfa, but not on actual payment being made by KWL.

He held that this agency arose not from any contract, but from the corrupt arrangement whereby Value Partners undertook to deliver its "captive" clients to UBS for the purpose of making STCDO transactions with them, and UBS undertook to assist Value Partners in that endeavour, knowing that Value Partners was the fiduciary (and advisory) agent of its captive clients, and that Value Partners intended to abuse those fiduciary relationships by encouraging those clients to enter into STCDOs with UBS, regardless of their best interests, for the mutual financial benefit of Value Partners and UBS.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">"596. On the findings which I have already made in the narrative section of this judgment (see e.g. [188] to [201] above), UBS and Value Partners did agree to a relationship which as a matter of law amounted to an agency relationship. From as early as April 2006 there was in place an arrangement between Mr Bracy and Value Partners whereby Value Partners would advise clients which it had represented in connection with cross-border leasing transactions to conclude STCDOs with UBS. It described this arrangement in terms of "delivering the client" to UBS. Indeed, Mr Bracy described Value Partners to his boss in May 2006 as having "captive clients", including KWL, who would in practice do what Value Partners recommended (see [223] and [224] above). He later made clear his understanding that in practice Value Partners would exercise a degree of "control" over clients in directing business to UBS (see [399] to [403] above). It was quite clear to Mr Bracy and to Value Partners that the purpose of their arrangement was to make money for Value Partners and (indirectly) for Mr Bracy, regardless of whether the transaction was in the clients' best interests. All this went well beyond an understandable desire to do business or further business together if suitable opportunities arose.</p>

It is clear too that throughout the period between April 2006 and the conclusion of the Balaba transaction, UBS (primarily but not exclusively in the person of Mr Bracy) and Value Partners did work together in order to ensure the conclusion of the transaction, regardless of KWL's interests. This working together can be seen in the request, albeit not acceded to, for payment in return for recommending UBS GAM as portfolio manager (see [214] above); the preparations for the 9 May 2006 "kickoff" meeting ([225] and [226]); the silencing of Mr Cox ([251] to [256]); the e-mails exchanged between Mr Bracy and Messrs Senf and Blatz in connection with the visit to Wilmington Trust which show a clear alignment between UBS and Value Partners on the one hand and the "client" on the other ([262] to [265]); the briefing of Mr Heininger in preparation for the 30 May 2006 due diligence meeting ([286] to [290]); the care taken to ensure that Dr Schirmer did not have a full understanding of the financial aspects of the transaction ([314] and [315]); and the rather shocking efforts made by Mr Bracy and Mr Senf to remove language from the draft Freshfields opinion which might represent an obstacle to the conclusion of the transaction ([344] to [351])."</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">"<span style="font-weight:bold">Incomplete agency: internal relationship only – the "canvassing" or "introducing" agent.</span>  Article 1(4) seeks to achieve completeness by taking in a well-established type of intermediary who makes no contracts and disposes of no property, but is simply hired, whether as an employee or independent contractor, to introduce parties desirous of contracting and leaves them to contract between themselves.  In effecting such introductions he is remunerated by commission, which he may sometimes take from both parties.  Such a person is a common figure in most western legal systems and may well be referred to as an agent.  The most obvious example of such an intermediary in the English cases is the estate agent, who introduces purchasers to vendors and tenants to lessors of houses, and vice versa.  Such persons are sometimes also referred to as brokers, and indeed in some English speaking countries the estate agent is referred to as a "real estate broker": but this may be misleading since the current practice, at any rate in England, is to use the term "broker" for persons who go beyond introductions and certainly do make contracts for their principals, e.g. commodity brokers, insurance brokers and stockbrokers.  Canvassing agents are on the fringe of the central agency principles used by the common law, since their powers to alter their principals' legal relations are at best extremely limited.  They often, however, have authority to receive and communicate information on their principals' behalf, and in so doing have the capacity to alter their principals' legal position.  They also usually act in a capacity which may involve the repose of trust and confidence, and hence may be subject in some respects to the fiduciary duties of agents towards their principals.  They are also subject of typical rules, largely developed in estate agent cases, as to entitlement to commission, which are normally regarded as part of agency law and are relied on also by agents who have greater powers to bind their principals.  They may sometimes hold money (e.g. deposits) for their principals.  The rules applicable to the internal relationship between principal and agent will therefore apply as appropriate, and for this reason such persons should certainly be treated in a work on agency even though they lack the external powers of the agent.  It is an advantage of the formulation of basic agency principle in Article 1, which selects the internal relationship between principal and agent as a distinguishing feature of agency, that it can be taken to cover such persons.  Canvassing agents are persons to whom the internal parts of agency law may apply, but who, because of the limited nature of their external powers to affect their principals' legal positions, are not agents in the full sense of the word.  They may therefore be said to provide an example of "incomplete agency"."</p>

He submitted that an agent of that kind need not have authority to affect the principal's relations with third parties, and that fiduciary duty was not an essential prerequisite of agency.  He submitted with real force that, if the only reason why the arrangement was not an agency was because it constituted dishonest assistance by UBS in an abuse by Value Partners of its fiduciary relationship with KWL, then this could hardly be a sound reason for exonerating UBS from responsibility for the bribe paid by Value Partners which would naturally flow from the recognition of an agency relationship.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">"[177] These expressions of the central characteristics of the relationship reveal the closeness of identity that is required for the relationship to exist. Not every independent contractor performing a task for, or for the benefit of, a party will be an agent, and so identified as it, or as representing it, and its interests. Agency is a consensual relationship, generally (if not always) bearing a fiduciary character, in which by its terms A acts on behalf of (and in the interests of) P and with a necessary degree of control requisite for the purpose of the role. Central is the conception of identity or representation of the principal: <span style="font-style:italic">Colonial Mutual</span> at 48–9; Seavey op cit at 859. Examples and contexts may be infinite, and any arrangement must be understood and characterised by reference to its legal terms in context. In <span style="font-style:italic">McKenzie v McDonald</span> [1927] VLR 134 at 144 Dixon AJ, in saying that not every agent stands as a fiduciary, was recognising that the word "agent" is used in many senses and is apt to mislead, citing <span style="font-style:italic">Kennedy v De Trafford</span> at 188. That is, however, no more than to say that the word "agent" has a potentially wide and varying meaning in life and business and that, on some occasions, the business description will be given to someone who is not a fiduciary. See also <span style="font-style:italic">Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation</span> (1984) 156 CLR 41 at 71–2; BC8400480 (per Gibbs CJ), compare at 96–7 (per Mason J), <span style="font-style:italic">Boardman v Phipps</span> [1967] 2 AC 46 at 127; [1966] 3 All ER 721, F E Dowrick, "The Relationship of Principal and Agent" (1954) 17 <span style="font-style:italic">Modern Law Review</span> 24 and R P Meagher, J D Heydon and M J Leeming (eds) <span style="font-style:italic">Meagher, Gummow and Lehane's Equity: Doctrines and Remedies</span> (4th ed, LexisNexis, 2002) at 191–192 [5–195]. It is sufficient to recognise that the essential characteristic is that one party (A) acts on the other's (P's) behalf, and that this will generally be in circumstances of a requirement or duty not to act otherwise than in the interests of P in the performance of the consensual arrangement. <span style="font-style:italic">Bowstead and Reynolds on Agency</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic">Restatement</span> and Seavey op cit at 863 include in the conception of agency the characteristic of fiduciary duty. The duty will, of course, conform with the extent and scope of the agency and thus be of potentially varied content, recognising that context (in particular, perhaps, a market or commercial context) may attenuate the rigour or content of the fiduciary duty: <span style="font-style:italic">Birtchnell v Equity Trustees, Executors and Agency Co</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Ltd</span> (1929) 42 CLR 384 at 408; BC2900019; <span style="font-style:italic">Re Goldcorp Exchange Ltd</span> [1995] 1 AC 74 at 98; <span style="font-style:italic">Meagher, Gummow and Lehane</span> (4th ed) at 161–2 [5–010]); Finn J in <span style="font-style:italic">South Sydney v News</span> at [136], and in his text <span style="font-style:italic">Fiduciary Obligations</span> (LawBook Co, 1977) at 201.

At its core was an understanding that Value Partners would abuse its fiduciary duties to its clients, and in particular to KWL, for the purpose of bringing them captive to UBS as counterparties in STCDO transactions, regardless of their interests, and that UBS would, behind those clients' backs, assist Value Partners in doing so, in both cases for the mutual benefit of Value Partners and UBS.  At [701] the judge described this as "the whole point of [the] arrangement".  The active participation in the arrangement by UBS was, as Lord Falconer frankly acknowledged, a form of dishonest assistance to Value Partners in the abuse of its fiduciary duties as agent for KWL.  It was dishonest because it was both deliberate (i.e. carried out in the knowledge that Value Partners was abusing its fiduciary duty to KWL) and secretive, in the sense that UBS knew that KWL was ignorant of the corrupt arrangement.  Using the language of Lord Hutton in <span style="font-style:italic">Barlow Clowes International ltd v Eurotrust International Ltd </span>[2005] UKPC 37, [2006] 1 WLR 1476, at [16], Mr Bracy, and therefore UBS, was aware that those elements of the corrupt arrangement were such as to make participation in it by UBS transgress ordinary standards of honest behaviour.</p>

This could not be achieved either by UBS holding out Value Partners as its agent, or by Value Partners asserting an agency for UBS in dealings with KWL.  On the contrary, the arrangement would only achieve its intended results if, from start to finish, Value Partners purported in its dealings with its captive clients to act loyally on their behalf.</p>

Indeed it is largely, although not entirely, because of the corruption and dishonesty inherent in the arrangement between Value Partners and UBS that we consider that it did not amount to an agency: see our first and second reasons above.

Nonetheless, in our view the differences which separate this particular relationship from those familiar business structures easily outweigh the similarities.  In particular, the fact that Value Partners was already a fiduciary agent of its captive clients, including KWL, that it was pursuing its own interests side by side with those of UBS, and that the arrangement was corrupt and dishonest, places it in a separate category of its own.  Of course it was part of the arrangement that UBS requested Value Partners to achieve a certain result.  But, as is pointed out in the passage cited above from the <span style="font-style:italic">Tonto</span> case, this of itself is insufficient to lead to a categorisation of agency.</p>

On this appeal Mr Lord did not pursue with any vigour a submission that wherever a contract is procured by payment of a bribe, the other party's conscience is inevitably affected, however innocent that party might be.  Rather, he submitted that where (as in the present case) a party dishonestly assists the other party's agent in the abuse of its fiduciary duty to that other party and a contract ensues then, if that abuse of fiduciary duty included the payment of a bribe, the conscience of the dishonest assister will be affected by it even if it was unaware that a bribe had been paid.</p>

His fall-back submission, developed mainly as part of his argument under Issue 3, was that a contracting party's conscience could not be affected by some inequitable conduct on the part of the other party's agent (including the payment of the bribe) unless the first party knew of it, knowledge for that purpose being actual knowledge or wilful blindness ("Nelsonian knowledge"), which amounts to the same thing in law.

The football club had granted a licence to Logicrose to use its land for the holding of a market, unaware that its director and principal (but nominee) shareholder had required Logicrose to make a £70,000 payment to an offshore company under his control.  The director had also concealed adverse advice from the football club's solicitors about the wisdom of granting the licence.  On learning of the payment, the football club rescinded the licence.  At page 1261-2 Millett J said this:</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">"In order to obtain the payment he committed S.U.F.C. to a transaction which, unknown to them, their own solicitors strongly advised against. S.U.F.C. have been deprived of the right to decide for themselves or by a disinterested agent whether to accept or reject that advice. That in itself is not sufficient to entitle S.U.F.C. to a fresh opportunity, as against the plaintiffs, to consider whether it is in their interests to affirm the transaction. For this purpose they must establish that they were deprived of the disinterested advice of their agent by or at least to the knowledge of the plaintiffs. Is this condition satisfied? I have no doubt that it is. It is, of course, immaterial whether the initiative for the agent's taking an interest of his own came from the agent himself or from the other party to the transaction. It must also be immaterial whether the other party provided it directly or knowingly assisted the agent to obtain it, for example by diverting to himself or an associate a payment intended for his principal. In all the reported cases, the other party has provided it himself and has been fully aware of the agent's personal interest. There is, accordingly, no direct authority on the degree of knowledge which he must possess of the existence of the agent's personal interest. With one reservation to which I shall come in a moment, however, and which goes only to the facts of which knowledge must be proved, I accept the submission made on behalf of the plaintiffs that nothing less than actual knowledge or wilful blindness will suffice. In particular, constructive notice will not do. Parties to negotiations do not owe each other a duty to act reasonably, but only to act honestly. In the present context, the principal's right is a right to rescind for fraud, not negligence. There is in my judgment a close parallel with the cases on knowing assistance in a breach of trust. The same facts may give rise to different remedies, and as the present case demonstrates it will often be impossible to distinguish between the payment of a bribe or secret commission properly so-called and the diversion of the principal's money into the agent's pocket. There cannot in truth be any real difference between the secret payment to the agent of a sum additional to the purchase price and the payment to him of part of the purchase price of which his principal is unaware. In my judgment, the difference between the two lines of authority (that is to say the "bribery" cases and the "knowing assistance" cases) lies not in the factual background but in the remedy sought; and the state of mind necessary to make the other party liable ought to be the same whether the claim is for an account of the money which he helped the agent to misappropriate or rescission of the transaction itself.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">My one reservation, which I make for the sake of completeness, is  this. It is clear that, where one party to a transaction takes what Collins L.J. described as "the hazardous course" of making a payment for the personal benefit of the other's agent, and does not disclose it to the principal, he cannot afterwards defend the transaction by claiming that he believed the agent to be an honest man who would disclose it himself: <span style="font-style:italic">Grant v. Gold Exploration and Development Syndicate Ltd.</span> [1900] 1 Q.B. 233, 249-250. Where, therefore, knowing that the agent has an interest of his own he does not himself disclose it to the other party, then in the words of Collins L.J., at p. 249: "he must at least accept the risk of the agent's not doing so." In my judgment, the converse must equally apply: if a man deals secretly with another's agent behind the back of his principal, knowing that the agent intends to conceal the dealing from his principal and that he may be intending to obtain some private advantage for himself, he takes the risk that he does intend to do so. The two are only different aspects of the same general principle, expressed in varying terms and contexts but always forcibly and to the same effect: "any surreptitious dealing between one principal and the agent of the other principal is a fraud on such other principal, cognizable in this court": see the <span style="font-style:italic">Panama</span> case, L.R. 10 Ch.App. 515, 526 per James L.J.; and "the real evil is not the payment of money, but the secrecy attending it": <span style="font-style:italic">Shipway v.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Millett J's analysis broadly confirms the general rule that, for the conscience of the contracting party against whom rescission is sought to be affected, he must know about the bribe or other breach of fiduciary duty committed by his counterparty's agent.  His "one reservation" is we think obiter, since he later concluded that Logicrose's director and principal shareholder knew perfectly well both of the relevant facts about the payment and of the intention that it be concealed from the football club's board.  But the question remains whether Millet J's "one reservation" is correct in law as a limited exception to the requirement for actual knowledge and, if so, whether it is applicable to the present case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In each of the three cases to which Millet J refers under his "one reservation" heading, namely <span style="font-style:italic">Grant v Gold Exploration and Development Syndicate Limited </span>[1900] 1 QB 233, <span style="font-style:italic">Panama and South Pacific Telegraph Co. v India Rubber, Gutta Percha, and Telegraph Works Co. </span>(1875) LR 10 Ch App. 515 and <span style="font-style:italic">Shipway v Broadwood </span>[1899] 1 QB 369, the surreptitious dealings in question consisted of or included the payment of a sum of money by the contracting party to the other contracting party's agent.  There are also dicta by Clarke LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Tigris International NV v China Southern Airlines Company Limited </span>[2014] EWCA Civ 1649, at paragraphs [175]-[178], that the term "surreptitious dealings" as used in those earlier cases was mainly concerned with payments of money, although that was a case where the party resisting rescission was found by the trial judge to be wholly innocent of any fraud or bad faith.  But the principle is expressed in perfectly general terms, both by James LJ's reference to "any surreptitious dealing between one principal and the agent of the other principal" and Millett J's dictum: "If a man deals secretly with another's agent behind the back of his principal…", and by Chitty LJ in saying "the real evil is not the payment of money, but the secrecy attending it".</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The mischief which the principle is aimed at preventing is the secret deprivation of the principal of the disinterested advice which he is entitled to expect from his fiduciary.  The principal thinks he is getting the loyal and disinterested advice of his fiduciary when in truth he is not.  This abuse may be achieved by a secret payment to the fiduciary by the other party to the contemplated transaction, but this is not the only way in which it can be achieved.  The fiduciary may be disabled from giving disinterested advice by a multitude of surreptitious means.  In the present case, UBS well knew of, and both secretly and dishonestly assisted, a wholesale abuse by Value Partners of its fiduciary duty to KWL, in bringing KWL to the STCDO as a counterparty with UBS regardless of KWL's best interests.  The judge found that, although UBS made no payment to Value Partners for that corrupt purpose, it had "at least a good idea" of what Value Partners was being paid in connection with the transaction, namely "a very substantial fee which bore no real relationship to the services or advice that it had actually provided".  UBS also knew that Mr Senf and Mr Blatz of Value Partners had been anxious to keep Dr Schirmer in the dark about the premium being earned from the deal, "and must therefore have realised that it was because of their relationship with Mr Heininger that they were able to extract such a high fee" [405].  UBS actively assisted Value Partners in keeping Dr Schirmer in the dark about the amount of the premium to be derived from the proposed transactions [314]-[315].  </p>

Where a party to an intended transaction deals with the other party's agent secretly and behind his back, and dishonestly assists that agent to abuse his fiduciary duties to the other party so as to bring that transaction about, then the first party's conscience may be affected not merely by the particular form of abuse by the agent of which it actually knew, but also by any other abuse which the agent chose to employ to bring about the transaction with the first party.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On the findings made by the judge we consider that this principle applies so as to affect UBS's conscience in the present case.  The judge described the abuse of Value Partners' fiduciary duty to KWL, for the purpose of bringing KWL into the Balaba STCDO, as the "whole point" of the corrupt arrangement [701].  There is a useful analogy to be had with the question whether the bribe was, as the judge found, within the scope of Value Partners' agency for UBS.  He said, at [617], that the bribe was paid for the very purpose of directing STCDO business to UBS from Value Partners' clients (here KWL), regardless whether it was in the clients' interests.  The fact that in our view the corrupt arrangement was not in law an agency does not detract from the conclusion that the bribing of Mr Heininger was within the scope, or "point" of it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As is well known, the essence of a fiduciary obligation is a duty of undivided loyalty to the person to whom that obligation is owed.  UBS, having dishonestly assisted KWL's fiduciary agent to abuse its duty of loyalty in order to procure a contract by illegitimate means cannot in our view be heard to say that its conscience is clear if that agent, which was known to be dishonest, includes as part of its course of abuse, other illegitimate means such as the payment of a bribe to a decision-maker within the management structure of its principal.</p>

Nonetheless the facts about the corrupt arrangement between UBS and Value Partners and its causative significance in relation to KWL's entry into the STCDOs were the subject of intense investigation and fact-finding by the judge at the trial.  It is difficult to imagine, and Lord Falconer did not explain, what further forensic analysis or fact-finding might have been needed for the purpose of deciding whether, apart from agency, the conscience of UBS was sufficiently affected by the bribe paid to Mr Heininger to make it inequitable for UBS to resist rescission of the Balaba STCDO.</p>

Applying the analysis of Millett J in the <span style="font-style:italic">Logicrose</span> case at [1998] 1 WLR 1256, pp 1260-1, he concluded that Value Partners was subject to that conflict of interest, that UBS both knew of and assisted in creating it, that KWL did not know of or consent to it, and that it had a sufficient connection with KWL's entry into the Balaba STCDO for KWL to have a right of rescission: see [621]-[641] and [697]-[708] of the judgment.</p>

There is no sufficient basis to conclude, and no party suggested, that Dr Schirmer was aware of the monetary bribes paid to Mr Heininger, in connection with either the cross-border lease or the STCDOs, or of the fact that most of the premium generated by the STCDOs would be diverted to Value Partners. But I find that a time must have come when Dr Schirmer must have been aware that Value Partners or its predecessor had adopted a practice of providing extravagant and inappropriate perks to Mr Heininger which can only have meant that it was making lucrative profits from its role in connection with the cross-border leases and the STCDO transactions. That ought to have caused him to question whether Value Partners was giving disinterested advice to KWL. By the time of the 7 September 2006 board meeting it must have been apparent to him that something was wrong, and by the time of the expenses scandal in October 2006 he must have realised that the whole relationship with Value Partners was improper. From then on, for reasons which are not clear but which probably arose from a concern for his own position, he was prepared to collude with Mr Heininger in a cover up. The most likely explanation is that having begun to tell lies about the 2002 Concorde trip and knowing of the much more recent dealings with Value Partners, he felt unable to allow the truth to be known. However, although he could and should have asked some searching questions, I am not persuaded that Dr Schirmer in fact appreciated the impropriety of the relationship with Value Partners before September 2006."</p>

Taken together they plainly constitute material upon which the judge could have found that Dr Schirmer knew that (or turned a blind eye to the fact that) his colleague Mr Heininger had an improper relationship with Value Partners, prior to the completion of the Balaba STCDO.  But it is clear that this experienced judge had all those matters in mind when reaching his conclusion about the time when Dr Schirmer came to have that knowledge.  He set out most of them in his detailed analysis of Dr Schirmer's testimony at [89]-[105], which concluded with the finding now challenged.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At the centre of Lord Falconer's submissions in relation to Issue 3 (and indeed underlying UBS's case on many of the issues raised in this appeal) was his presentation of what, at trial, he called (and the judge referred to as) "the bigger picture", which we must now describe.  Lord Falconer said that the driving force behind KWL's entry into all three disastrous STCDOs was the criminal conspiracy between Mr Heininger and Value Partners to use KWL's entry into the STCDOs as the means of making for themselves large sums of money at KWL's risk and expense, and which manifested itself in the payment of the bribe and Value Partners' misappropriation of the bulk of the premiums.  The corrupt arrangement between Value Partners and UBS played, he said, no causative part in that story.  The STCDOs would have been entered into by KWL, and the bulk of the proceeds misappropriated, whether or not Mr Bracy and Value Partners had made their corrupt arrangement.  Value Partners needed no incentive from UBS to abuse their fiduciary duties to KWL.  Thus the creation of a conflict of interest in Value Partners by means of the corrupt arrangement with UBS was (although Lord Falconer did not use these precise words) no more than an irrelevant sideshow.  Since UBS knew nothing of what Lord Falconer called "the big fraud" involving Mr Heininger and Value Partners, it would be unjust and inequitable to subject it to rescission, and therefore the consequential losses sustained under the hedging transactions which followed the STCDOs, when its participation in the corrupt arrangement, although regrettable, was of no causative effect in the disaster for KWL which then unfolded.</p>

Value Partners was, in substance, the ringleader of a sophisticated fraud of which KWL was the intended victim, and from which Value Partners derived the largest benefit, namely the lion's share of the premiums payable to KWL under the STCDOs, less the €4.5 million received by KWL, the amounts used to fund the CDSs and the bribe of about $3 million paid to Mr Heininger.  Value Partners' ill-gotten gains were only exceeded in amount by the profit booked by UBS for re-hedging (or re-selling) the credit protection constituted by the STCDOs in the market.</p>

Nor in our view would it matter who, as between Mr Heininger and Value Partners, was the ringleader and who was the accomplice.  The policy basis upon which attribution to KWL of Mr Heininger's knowledge is refused is because "it would be absurd and unjust to permit a fraudulent director or employee to be able to use his own serious breach of duty to his corporate employer as a defence": see per Lord Walker in the <span style="font-style:italic">Moulin Global</span> case at [131].

UBS is claiming against KWL under the Balaba STCDO, and KWL is claiming rescission of it.  For the purposes of testing KWL's claim for rescission, the case may fairly be described as a claim by the company (KWL) against a third party (UBS).  But the question of attribution relates to the knowledge of Mr Heininger rather than the knowledge of Value Partners.  UBS were undoubtedly accomplices of Value Partners in the abuse of its fiduciary duties to KWL, but UBS did not know of what Lord Falconer calls "the big fraud" (i.e. the bribe and misappropriation of the premium) and was not, in that sense, a direct accomplice of Mr Heininger.  Rather, they were each dishonestly involved in conspiring with or in assisting Value Partners, without knowing the precise parts of the other's dishonest participation.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus the legal question is whether the rule against attribution which applies where the company is the victim of a breach of fiduciary duty in which the third party defendant is an accomplice also applies in the present context, where the director and the third party are both accomplices of Value Partners, albeit in different aspects of the fraud upon KWL.  </p>

The question is best addressed by asking whether the underlying policy ground for refusing attribution is equally applicable, and in our view it is.  It is no less unjust or absurd to attribute to the corporate victim of a sophisticated fraud the knowledge of one of its participant directors in a claim against another, different, participant in that fraud than it would be in connection with a claim against the ringleader (here Value Partners) or against any accomplice of the director.  In all those cases the company is the victim of the fraud and it would be absurd to attribute to the company knowledge of any aspect of that fraud which is held by one of its directors, for the purpose of constructing an entirely artificial theory that the company is to be taken as having consented to it.</p>

The first is that the judge found, as a fact, that the corrupt arrangement remained a driving force behind KWL's entry into all four STCDO structures, from start to finish.  Causation, if it were necessary, is therefore established as a fact.  It is in that context no answer for UBS to say that the "but for" causation test is not satisfied.  It may be that, even if there had been no corrupt arrangement, KWL would still have entered into the STCDOs, driven there by the fraudulent design shared by Mr Heininger and Value Partners.  But where, as here, there are concurrent causes, it is no defence to say that the transaction would or might have proceeded even if there had only been one cause, for which the defendant is not responsible.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second reason is that causation is not a requirement of the equitable right to rescind, where the decision-making of the party seeking rescission has been undermined by a conflict of interest on the part of its fiduciary adviser which the counterparty resisting rescission either assisted, or of which it knew.

The development company had also received a loan arranged by Mr Johnson from clients of his firm.  The lenders paid what was described as a modest "service charge" to the firm in connection with the loan, which Mr Johnson did not disclose to Mr O'Shea.  He sought equitable rescission of his surety obligation by reason of that non-disclosure.  The Court of Appeal granted him an account of the service charge, but refused him rescission.

Mr Darton submits that Mr O'Shea did not need to obtain an order rescinding the surety covenant: the abuse of confidence simply disentitled Mr Johnson as a matter of law from enforcing the covenant.  Alternatively, if an order of rescission was required, the court either had no discretion to refuse it in a case of an abuse of confidence, or, if it had a discretion, it was obliged to make an order in such a case.</p>

In my judgment, the judge was entitled in the present case to hold that fairness required an order for an account of the service charge, but not rescission of the surety covenant. The transaction was fair. Mr O'Shea was an experienced business man who, the judge found at paragraph 19, "remained focused throughout on competitive rates on interest and would not have dealt with Churchers if it was not in his commercial interests to do so". He held (paragraph 27) that if the service charge had been disclosed to Mr O'Shea, it is possible that he would have sought a reduction in the rate of interest, but if this had been refused, he would still have gone ahead. There is no challenge to any of these findings. In these circumstances, the breach of duty by Mr Johnson was marginal."</p>

It was a highly unusual type of complex derivative, normally traded only between investment banks and similar financial institutions, undertaken by a water company wholly outside the confines of the business activities in which it was experienced.  Furthermore, as the judge said, the whole purpose of the corrupt arrangement between Value Partners and UBS was to draw KWL into the transaction by depriving it of the loyal advice as to its best interests which it was entitled to receive from its financial advisers Value Partners.  Both UBS and Value Partners entered into the corrupt arrangement for financial gain.  For UBS the gain was the immediate booking of a profit from re-hedging or re-selling the credit protection provided by the STCDOs, which was (after allowing for payment of the premium to KWL) broadly equivalent to that premium.  It was a risk-free profit save only for UBS's exposure to KWL's credit risk.  In stark contrast, KWL was wholly exposed to downside risks broadly equivalent to those which UBS undertook by re-hedging, without recourse against anyone other than the Leipzig taxpayers, but for which it nonetheless received a broadly equivalent reward in the form of premium.  </p>

Mr Nicholls accepted that the doctrine applies to a claim for an anti-suit injunction where the claim is based on an allegation that the defendant has started proceedings in a foreign jurisdiction in breach of contract because the claimant and defendant had agreed to an exclusive jurisdiction clause in favour of the English courts.

For the reasons given above we would not regard it as sullying KWL's hands.</p>

He found that, in those circumstances, UBS would still have entered into the Balaba STCDO and hedged or re-sold it into the market.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The judge rejected the alternative claim in deceit for two reasons.  The first was that, applying the tortious measure of damages (designed to put the defrauded party in the position which it would have enjoyed if the representation had not been made) it was likely that the absence of a good faith statement would have been a red flag sufficient to bring the Balaba STCDO (and its subsequent re-hedging) to a halt.  But he held, at [692], that even in this event, the true cause of UBS's loss was not the making of the Balaba STCDO and its re-hedging but rather the rescission of the Balaba STCDO, which deprived UBS of what would otherwise have been a full recourse against KWL for its hedging liabilities.  It is worth quoting the judge's concise reasoning in full:</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">"692. However, I accept KWL's submission that the loss suffered by UBS on its hedging contracts was not caused by its entry into the Balaba STCDO. The real and effective cause of the loss was not that UBS entered into its hedging contracts or even that it entered into the Balaba STCDO. Rather it was that the Balaba STCDO is unenforceable by UBS as a result of matters for which UBS is responsible -- the bribery of Mr Heininger by UBS's agent Value Partners and/or its knowledge of the conflict of interest to which Value Partners was subject. Accordingly its claim for damages fails as a matter of causation. A similar analysis applies to the hedging contracts concluded by UBS in order to generate the premium and profit required for the LBBW and Depfa transactions. If those Back Swaps are valid and enforceable, UBS will have suffered no loss. If they have been rescinded for misrepresentation by UBS, an issue addressed below, it is UBS's own misrepresentation which is the cause of its loss on those hedging contracts."</p>

As to the first he said that the ordinary policy reasons for limiting the effect of a tenuous chain of "but for" causation, such as the scope of duty limitation identified in the <span style="font-style:italic">SAAMCO</span> case [1997] AC 191 do not apply to a claim based in fraud: see <span style="font-style:italic">Smith New Court</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Securities Limited v Citibank</span> NA [1997] AC 254 at 266-7 and 279-80.  As to the judge's second reason, Lord Falconer submitted that if he could trace a causative link between the fraudulent misrepresentation of Mr Heininger and UBS's entry into the re-hedging transactions, then it mattered not that the Balaba STCDO was tainted by some form of illegality, or that UBS had itself contributed to that taint.  While warranties might stand or fall with the transaction itself, so as to cease to operate after rescission, the same could not be said of a fraudulent misrepresentation.</p>

The first was that UBS could not be heard to say that it was induced to make the hedging transactions by having given any credit to Mr Heininger's statement that the STCDOs were, from KWL's perspective, bona fide when UBS itself lied to both LBBW and Depfa in asserting that it knew of no reason to doubt the honesty of Value Partners or Mr Heininger.  This was said to be all the more so since, by the time of the Depfa transaction, UBS knew of and had actively participated in covering up Mr Heininger's dishonesty in the course of the "letter for K" incident, described at paragraphs 51-55 above.  Secondly he submitted that to acknowledge UBS's claim for damages for deceit would give rise to circuity of action because of KWL's equal and opposite claim for equitable compensation on account of UBS's dishonest assistance of Value Partners in its abuse of fiduciary duties to KWL.</p>

Both we and the judge have concluded that, because KWL was the victim of the transaction, Mr Heininger's knowledge of the fraudulent aspects of the means whereby it was committed to the Balaba STCDO is not to be attributed to KWL.  Why, it might be asked, is a company vicariously liable for a fraudulent statement by its director in circumstances where the director's knowledge of the truth is not to be attributed to it?  It may be that the law as to vicarious liability and attribution run in different channels, or that the full implications of the Supreme Court's decision in the <span style="font-style:italic">Bilta</span> case have yet to filter through into the ordinary law of tort.

We think that he was right, or at least entitled on the evidence, to conclude that the cause of UBS's loss was the vulnerability of the Balaba STCDO to rescission.  Had the STCDO been valid and enforceable, UBS's re-hedging or re-selling of the credit protection which it provided in the market would have caused it no loss since, as the judge accepted as common ground, the STCDO liability of KWL (but for rescission) was broadly the same as UBS's hedging losses.  As we have earlier explained, UBS's only risk, on the assumption of a valid Balaba STCDO, was the KWL credit risk, and it has not been suggested that this is sufficient to play any part in the assessment of causation and loss under this issue.</p>

Following the emergence of the "Letter for K" episode during oral evidence at the trial, both LBBW and Depfa amended to claim rescission of the Back Swaps by reason of fraudulent misrepresentation by UBS, and the judge upheld these claims, granting rescission of all three Back Swaps on terms which included undertakings by LBBW and Depfa not to enforce the Front Swaps against KWL: see Issue 7 below.  The result was that, on the judge's analysis, KWL had no liabilities to LBBW or Depfa on the Front Swaps.  Nonetheless he addressed the (fully argued) issue whether KWL should be indemnified by UBS in relation to any such liabilities, and concluded that it should, because KWL's entry into the Front Swaps was caused both by the bribing of Mr Heininger, for which UBS was responsible, and separately because it was also caused by UBS's dishonest assistance in Value Partners' abuse of its fiduciary duties to KWL.</p>

In circumstances where KWL does not succeed in its bribery/dishonest assistance damages claim against UBS in respect of the LBBW and Depfa STCDOs, Lord Falconer submitted that the proper way of achieving practical justice is not to impose upon LBBW and Depfa, as a condition of rescission, that they undertake to the court not to enforce the Front Swaps, but rather that they effectively permit UBS to enforce the Front Swaps against KWL at no risk to themselves.  It was submitted that this reflects practical justice because unless UBS is permitted to enforce the Front Swaps against it by making their assignment (or its equivalent) a condition of the Back Swaps being rescinded, KWL ends up in the same position as if it did have a claim against UBS, and UBS shoulders all of the loss as a result of its losses on its hedging contracts.</p>

However, Lord Falconer submitted that LBBW can be practically protected from the difficulties they fear, simply by allowing UBS to continue to contest KWL's appeal in its own existing capacity as a third party intervenor in the proceedings; or (if LBBW prefer) by granting UBS a power of attorney to contest the appeal on their behalf.</p>

It cannot be shown that the judge has erred in principle in his approach since he has correctly considered how practical justice is best achieved.  In effect UBS therefore needs to establish that the judge's decision is outside "the generous ambit within which a reasonable disagreement is possible" – see <span style="font-style:italic">G v G (Minors: Custody Appeal) </span>[1995] 1 WLR 647 HL at 652; <span style="font-style:italic">Tanfern Ltd v Cameron MacDonald (Practice Note) </span>[2000] 1 WLR 1311 at [32].</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Lord Falconer submitted that the exercise of the judge's discretion was somehow vitiated by reason of the fact that he would have been exercising his discretion on the basis that KWL's claim succeeded.  We do not agree.  The judge does not refer to or rely upon that as a factor.  He was understandably concentrating on the position as between UBS and Depfa/LBBW, not that as between UBS and KWL.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, within Lord Falconer's argument is the assumption that the court should exercise its discretion to achieve practical justice in relation to contracts induced by fraudulent misrepresentation so as to ensure that no loss is suffered by the dishonest representor as a result of contracts entered into by it in reliance on the contracts it had fraudulently induced and in order to fund them.  No principled reason has been advanced as to why the court should exercise its discretion to assist the dishonest representor in this manner.  Nor has any authority been cited in which any such approach has been adopted or indeed argued for.  As KWL put it in its skeleton argument: "UBS can point to no authority that would justify the court in refusing to permit LBBW and Depfa to rescind the contracts that they were duped by UBS into entering merely because to do so leaves UBS out of pocket as a result of arrangements it made to finance its fraud".</p>

That is to say that any competent manager should (and on the balance of probabilities would) have done at least as well as if there had been no management at all. Having trumpeted the advantages of portfolio management as a means of minimising the risk, and taken the fees payable for managing the portfolios, UBS can hardly suggest otherwise. The Balaba and LBBW STCDO portfolios would have suffered no loss at all if they had not been managed. In the case of the Depfa portfolios, with no management there would have been a loss of some US $92 million but only as a result of the presence in the original portfolios of two entities which Mr Dattani removed. However, I accept KWL's submission that if Mr Dattani removed them, the probability is that any competent manager exercising an appropriate standard of care would also have done so. Necessarily this represents something of a broad brush approach, but in my judgment it is realistic and does not involve the making of unduly generous assumptions in favour of KWL (cf. the reservations expressed by Hamblen J in <span style="font-style:italic">Porton Capital Technology Funds v 3M UK Holdings Ltd</span> [2011] EWHC 2895 (Comm) at [237] to [245] concerning earlier cases in which a "generous" approach had been applied)."</p>

The primary function of a first instance judge is to find facts and identify the crucial legal points and to advance reasons for deciding them in a particular way. He should give his reasons in sufficient detail to show the parties and, if need be, the Court of Appeal the principles on which he has acted and the reasons that have led him to his decision. They need not be elaborate. There is no duty on a judge, in giving his reasons, to deal with every argument presented by counsel in support of his case. His function is to reach conclusions and give reasons to support his view, not to spell out every matter as if summing up to a jury. Nor need he deal at any length with matters that are not disputed. It is sufficient if what he says shows the basis on which he has acted.

It is clear, however, that the judge's finding is also directed at the nature and degree of risk taken on thereby.  Thus at [878] the judge finds that Mr Dattani had been wrong to "concentrate on highly correlated financial entities, bond insurers, risky consumer lenders, and banks that were known to have high and rising levels of leverage".  As he pointed out, this high degree of correlation meant that "defaults in one of these areas were likely to trigger defaults in others also".  Similarly, at [906] the judge refers to the "undue and unnecessary concentration of risk" and at [908] to Mr Dattani's breach in making a concentrated bet on "high risk" financial entities.  </p>

Essentially, UBS GAM took a concentrated bet on financials, bond insurers, risky consumer lenders, and banks that were known to have high — and rising — levels of leverage before the credit crisis struck. These sectors were all highly correlated with each other. By July 2008 exposure to these sectors had been ramped up to above 40 per cent in all three portfolios. The subsequent defaults as the crisis intensified came from within these sectors and the very high overlap between the portfolios meant that total loss was suffered (or virtually total loss priced in via unwind) across all four STCDOs".</p>

As Mr Hale stated in the passage accepted by Mr Dattani as being factually correct, this was not "a diversification strategy".  Nor could the failure to adopt such a strategy be justified by the absolute financial sector limits.

There are, however, many passages in Mr Dattani's evidence which support the judge's findings.  The description of the Moody's Metric as "the contractually agreed measure of risk" came from Mr Dattani's own witness statement.  He confirmed in terms in evidence that at all times it was his view that it was "the contractually chosen measure of risk".  He explained this on the basis that "the only way I can maintain the rating is if I maintain the Moody's Metric".  He described it in evidence as "the only measure of risk" and said that there was no need to do a trade unless it was "maintained or improved".  Further, save for some error trades, the evidence was that all Mr Dattani's substitutions did in fact improve the Moody's Metric.  Again no proper basis for overturning the judge's findings has been made out.  Further, even if Mr Dattani did understand that the Moody's Metric was only a Hurdle MM, the evidence was that he carried out his substitutions by reference to it regardless of whether the Hurdle was engaged.</p>

Further, there is no basis for the underlying assumption that a competently managed portfolio must inherently produce results at least as good as a static one.

In that case a doctor was summoned to attend to a child admitted to hospital with breathing difficulties but failed to attend.  The child suffered a cardiac arrest which would have been avoided if the child been intubated.  The claim failed because it was found that although the doctor had been in breach of duty in failing to attend, it was also found that she would not in fact have intubated the child and such a decision would not have been negligent.  The case therefore involved considering what the particular doctor would have done if she had not been negligent.  Similarly, it is submitted that in this case the judge should have considered what the particular portfolio manager, Mr Dattani, would have done if he had not been negligent.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As Mr Salzedo submitted, the <span style="font-style:italic">Bolitho </span>case focuses on issues of causation rather than assessment of loss.  It is likely to be of particular relevance where the negligence consists of an omission and there are different ways of doing what should have been done.  In those circumstances it may well be appropriate to consider what the negligent person would have done.  As pointed out, however, in <span style="font-style:italic">Beary v Pall Mall Investments </span>[2005] EWCA Civ 415, [2005] PNLR 35 in many cases the only relevant question in relation to a defendant's conduct is what should have been done rather than what he would have done if he had not been negligent.  As Dyson LJ stated in that case at [30]:</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">"30. In Bolitho, the claim would have succeeded either if the judge had found that the doctor who negligently failed to attend, would as a matter of fact have intubated if she had attended, or if it would have been negligent not to intubate. It was necessary on the facts of that case to consider what the doctor would have done if she had attended the child. But it does not follow that it is necessary in every case to ask what a defendant would have done if he or she had not been negligent. That question falls to be considered only where it is relevant on the facts of the particular case. In Bolitho it was relevant because the negligence lay in the failure to attend, and there was a causal link between that failure and the injury suffered by the child, because, if the doctor had attended and if she would have intubated, she would thereby have averted the injury. This causal link on the facts of that case was the hypothetical conduct of the defendant herself. In many negligence cases, the question is what would the claimant or some third person have done if the defendant had not been negligent. Usually, the only relevant question in relation to a defendant's conduct is: what should the defendant have done? It will not often be meaningful to go on to ask what the defendant would have done if he had not been negligent. It is tautologous to say that, if the defendant had not been negligent, he would not have acted negligently."</p>

The judge clearly found at [908] that loss was caused as a result of Mr Dattani's concentration on "high risk financial entities" consequent upon the breaches of duty found by him.  The issue is the assessment of that loss.  What Mr Dattani would have done is not relevant to that issue.  That assessment falls to be made by reference to the standards of a reasonably competent manager, just as in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Banque Bruxelles S.A. v Eagle Star </span>[1997] AC 191 the loss was assessed by reference to the standards of a reasonable valuer – see, in particular, the judgment of Lord Hoffmann at pp.221F-222A.</p>

For example, the table now relied upon was not produced at trial and involves and requires expert input.  Further, as Mr Salzedo pointed out, it is internally inconsistent as it assumes that the level of subordination was that at the outset or in July 2007 but relies on the portfolio being comprised of entities that were there at the end rather than at the beginning or in July 2007, thereby ignoring the effect on subordination of the substitutions made.</p>

The judge's findings focused on both the "high risk" of the financials concentrated upon and the extent of their concentration.

KWL paid UBS a premium for each CDS that represented UBS's calculation of the true cost of the CDS, just as it would if it had acquired the CDS from any other market participant.  UBS paid KWL a premium for each STCDO, separately calculated by UBS as the price of the STCDO.  The triggers for liability under the CDSs are separate from and independent of the triggers for liability under the STCDOs.  The CDSs themselves were unobjectionable contracts under which KWL paid a premium for protection against the risk of insolvency of an entity to which it was potentially exposed.  As the victim of bribery and/or a transaction procured via agents with a known conflict of interest of which UBS had notice, KWL was entitled to choose to rescind the objectionable STCDOs but maintain in place the unobjectionable CDSs.

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">"6.9 The crucial issue in the present applications is, however, one of mixed fact and law and it is how one identifies the criteria for determining whether a number of separate contracts are part of a single overall transaction for the purposes of the rule against rescission of part of a transaction. On this point there is little or no help in the authorities, but application of general principles strongly suggests the necessary criteria. If a representee is induced to enter into separate contracts A &amp; B by the same misrepresentation, it may be that performance of contract B depends on the prior performance of contract A. In that case one cannot rescind contract A without also rescinding contract B. To permit the survival of contract B would be inconsistent with the principles of <span style="font-style:italic">restitutio in integrum</span>. But there may be cases where, although both contracts were induced by the same misrepresentation either can be performed without performance of the other. In that case the representee may rescind unless the contract not sought to be rescinded would never have been entered into by the parties without also entering into the other. Thus, for example, in a case where the transaction is divided into different contracts simultaneously negotiated, it may be that the consideration for the whole bargain is written into one contract, leaving only nominal consideration in the other contract. In that event it would not be open to the representee to leave open the contract that gave him the main consideration while rescinding the other contract under which his primary performance obligation lay. Again, to do otherwise would not effect <span style="font-style:italic">restitutio in integrum</span>. Or there may be cases where it is clear from the terms of the contracts and the matrix evidence that the subject matter of the contracts is so interrelated that, although it would be theoretically possible to perform each separately, one would never have been entered into without that contract sought to be rescinded. However, in the absence of structural interdependence between separate contracts, the most usual determinant of inseparability is likely to be the distribution of consideration for the whole bargain between the separate contracts."</p>

KWL had no idea that Value Partners was conducting a fraud on it; UBS did know and took advantage of that fact.  In those circumstances, it was submitted that it is unjust to require KWL to make 'restitution' of sums that it never received (and moreover to pay interest on those sums) as a condition of rescission.  The judge should have concluded that practical justice would be achieved by deducting those sums from the amount of the premiums that KWL is required to pay to UBS (or at the very least not requiring KWL to pay interest on them).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In relation to Issue 1, we conclude that Value Partners was not acting as UBS's agent when it paid the bribe to Mr Heininger, and was therefore not responsible in law for the bribe on that ground.  In relation to Issue 2, however, we consider that by virtue of its dishonest assistance in Value Partners' abuse of its fiduciary duty to KWL, UBS's conscience has been affected by the bribe so as to make it unconscionable for it to enforce the Balaba STCDO, which was a transaction procured by a bribe paid by Value Partners to Mr Heininger in the course of that abuse of duty.  In any event we have also found, in relation to Issue 3, that the Balaba STCDO is unenforceable by reason of UBS's knowledge of, and dishonest assistance in, Value Partners' abuse of its duty to provide disinterested advice to KWL.  The knowledge of Mr Heininger is not, for these purposes, to be attributed to KWL, so that KWL cannot be taken to have consented to that conflict of interest.  Therefore whilst we would allow UBS's appeal on Issue 1, the Balaba STCDO remains unenforceable by UBS by reason of our conclusions on Issues 2 and 3. </p>

By reason of our conclusions in relation to Issues 9 and 10, such rescission requires that KWL cannot retain, or further receive, any sums paid or due under the CDSs, which were part of the same overall transaction as the STCDOs, and that KWL return to UBS a sum equivalent to that portion of the STCDO premiums which was siphoned off by Value Partners.</p>

In effect this reservation represented a very modest extension to the general principle. A can rescind even if B does not have actual knowledge that A's agent was not providing disinterested advice, because B must be taken to have accepted the blatant risk thereof due to something which B knowingly has done.

In my view, UBS's knowledge of the UBS-VP arrangement did not extend to or encompass knowledge of the bribery and nor does it have the consequence that UBS's conscience was affected by the bribery. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Certainly, UBS did not have a level of knowledge of the bribery equivalent to that required for dishonest assistance, per the approach set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Ultraframe </span>which I discuss below under Issue 3. This lack of knowledge is not an end to the matter in relation to Issue 2, since the <span style="font-style:italic">Logicrose</span> reservation is avowedly concerned with whether B's conscience is affected and with circumstances which may not involve knowledge. Nonetheless, to treat UBS's conscience as affected by the bribe fails to delineate the abuse which could fairly affect UBS's conscience. Whilst Value Partners played a role in both the arrangement with UBS and the bribery of Mr Heininger, and breached its duties to KWL through each, the two schemes were otherwise self-standing. Each scheme could have operated without the other and, indeed, the scheme to bribe Mr Heininger was hatched some time before Value Partners made contact with UBS: see [591] of the judgment below. Moreover, it could not even be said that UBS had constructive knowledge of the bribe. This factual distinction is underscored by the significant difference in the gravity of the two arrangements. Quite simply, it is one thing for UBS to know that Value Partners had a conflict of interest because it represented that it would be directing all clients' business towards UBS, but another thing entirely for UBS to know that Value Partners was engaged in a deliberate, calculated bribery of the counterparty, KWL.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Whilst I will return to the point under Issue 3, it is convenient to clarify at this juncture that whereas the UBS-VP arrangement did <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> encompass the relationship between Value Partners and Mr Heininger, I accept that Mr Heininger's knowledge that Value Partners was thoroughly abusing its position <span style="font-style:italic">did</span> extend to the UBS-VP arrangement. In that sense, the UBS-VP arrangement can be conceptualised as a smaller circle of impropriety, within the larger sphere of the improper relationship between Value Partners and Mr Heininger. UBS only knew about, and its conscience was only affected by, the lesser scheme: it knew that Value Partners was going to deliver clients to UBS, regardless of that client's best interests. By contrast Mr Heininger knew that Value Partners was comprehensively abusing its position in relation to KWL, and was in effect seeking to itself benefit from the STCDOs in any way possible, to the direct detriment of KWL. This greater scheme, of which Mr Heininger knew, subsumes the lesser scheme to which UBS was a party. Thus even if Mr Heininger might not have known of the UBS-VP arrangement in terms, this is eclipsed by his knowledge that Value Partners was seeking to benefit from the STCDOs to the fullest possible extent, largely by taking any benefit from KWL for itself.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I interpose briefly that, for related reasons, even if the UBS-VP arrangement had given rise to an agency relationship under Issue 1, I would have concluded that the bribing of Mr Heininger did not come within the scope of that agency. The short point is that, on these facts, the bribery did not arise out of any relationship between UBS and Value Partners, but out of the relationship between Value Partners and Mr Heininger. This is not a question of causation, but of whether the bribe took place as part of one or other (or both) relationship(s). On these facts, in particular that the scheme to bribe Mr Heininger pre-dated any UBS-VP arrangement and that any such agency that exists would be a very exiguous relationship, the bribe can only have taken place as part of the relationship between Value Partners and Mr Heininger.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second reason why I would not extend the <span style="font-style:italic">Logicrose</span> reservation to the present facts is that any approach whereby UBS's conscience is affected by the bribe would constitute a significant inroad on the emphasis in <span style="font-style:italic">Logicrose</span> on actual or Nelsonian knowledge, which would be commercially and practically unworkable. UBS is, of course, responsible for its part in the UBS-VP arrangement. However, it is in my judgment commercially unreal to use this as a springboard to make UBS legally responsible for the bribery carried out by Value Partners, given the absence of knowledge on UBS' part and the conclusion that there was no agency relationship. In practice a contracting party might, for any number of reasons, harbour a degree of suspicion about the conduct of the other party's agent, not least the latter's stated enthusiasm for placing business the contracting party's way, no doubt in both parties' mutual commercial interest. But in order for the entitlement to rescind arising from <span style="font-style:italic">Logicrose</span> to be workable, it must be confined to what that party knows, subject only to very limited qualification. In my view it is impracticable and unreal to introduce into commercial transactions the moral standards of the vicarage – or, put in legal terms, to impose on counter-parties the obligations of a trustee. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The third reason is that there are three important distinctions between the circumstances contemplated by the <span style="font-style:italic">Logicrose</span> reservation and the present facts, which it is important not to overlook in order to maintain appropriate limits on the scope of the reservation. The first distinction is that Millett J conspicuously confined the reservation to A rescinding on the basis that B's conscience was affected by <span style="font-style:italic">dealings between A's agent and B</span>, whereas the general principle had extended to any corruption of A's agent of which B was aware. This accords with the cases cited in support of the reservation, all of which concerned B dealing with A's agent: <span style="font-style:italic">Grant v Gold Exploration and Development Syndicate </span>[1900] 1 QB 233, <span style="font-style:italic">Shipway v Broadwood </span>[1899] 1 QB 369 and <span style="font-style:italic">Panama and South Pacific Telegraph Co v India Rubber, Gitta Percha and Telegraph Works Company </span>(1875) LR 10 Ch App 515. By contrast, here KWL seeks to rely on the reservation to allow rescission on the basis that UBS's conscience was affected by dealings between the agent and a third party (namely Mr Heininger).</p>

The overall legal context is of course that KWL is seeking to rescind a contract entered into with UBS. Here the question of attribution determines whether KWL may say, per Millett J in <span style="font-style:italic">Logicrose </span>at 1261A, that it "is entitled to a further opportunity to consider whether it is in his interests to affirm [the contract]".</p>

UBS was, of course, party to the arrangement with Value Partners to deliver clients to UBS. And Value Partners undoubtedly assisted Mr Heininger in the scheme to pay bribes to Mr Heininger. But UBS assisting Value Partners is not transitive: it is unreal to say that UBS assisted Mr Heininger, when it had no knowledge of that second, independent scheme centred on the bribe. I have already explained, at paragraphs 344-345 above, why the UBS-VP arrangement cannot be equated with the bribery of Mr Heininger.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second reason, and what might be seen as a more legalistic variant of that commonsense point, is that UBS would not be liable in dishonest assistance in relation to any breach of duty by Mr Heininger. The lens of dishonest assistance is particularly relevant insofar as Millett J appeared broadly to equate the level of knowledge B is required to have in order for A to be entitled to rescind, per the general principle of <span style="font-style:italic">Logicrose</span>, with the level of knowledge required of B in order for A to able to bring a claim for dishonest assistance.</p>

This was cited with approval in the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Goldtrail</span>, at [46], where Vos LJ (as he then was) added that there would not be dishonest assistance "where the dishonest assister lacked vital pieces of information known only to the primary fraudster", at [48]. Applying this approach, it seems clear that UBS could not be liable in dishonest assistance in relation to the scheme to bribe Mr Heininger, of which it knew absolutely nothing. So in this very relevant sense, the law does not consider UBS to have assisted Mr Heininger in his breach.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Third, the underlying rationale for equating a third party accomplice who assisted the corporate agent's breach of duty is that they are in the same position in relation to the company.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally, a concept of assistance that extends beyond these confines would appear to produce problematic outcomes. For example, if the arrangement between Value Partners and UBS had instead been actively to deceive Mr Heininger into agreeing to something which benefitted the former two parties, it would be perverse nonetheless to conclude that this was a tripartite relationship of assistance because one of the parties was masterminding the whole scheme.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Lord's response to this was that attributing Mr Heininger's knowledge to KWL nonetheless did not amount to KWL knowing of Value Partners' conflict of interest, since Mr Heininger knew nothing of the UBS-VP arrangement. I do not accept this. For the reasons given at paragraph 345 above, the consequence of attributing Mr Heininger's knowledge is that KWL knew that Value Partners would abuse its position in any way it could. The critical point is that Mr Heininger's knowledge extends far beyond the bribe, and encompasses Value Partners simply having no regard for KWL's interests whatsoever. Mr Heininger knew that Value Partners, or more concretely Mr Senf and Mr Blatz, were primarily motivated by the opportunity for personal enrichment. Moreover, Mr Heininger knew that under the letter of engagement dated 31 May 2006 Value Partners was entitled to retain all proceeds of the transactions in excess of €4.5 million. In this respect, what Mr Heininger knew about Value Partners and what UBS knew about Value Partners were very different indeed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The position is therefore tantamount to KWL knowing that Value Partners was abusing its position in any way in relation to the proposed STCDOs, or at least so long as it did not interfere with the scheme with Mr Heininger. The possibility of an arrangement between Value Partners and UBS was therefore entirely appreciated by KWL. In this sense – of what KWL knew, as opposed to the question of whether it had any causative role – the UBS-VP arrangement did not add anything to what KWL, through Mr Heininger, knew about Value Partners by virtue of other dealings.</p>

Moreover, the judge accepted at [691] that the Balaba STCDO would not have been concluded without this representation, so the deceit is plainly connected to the contract. The fact that Mr Heininger's deceit was procured by the bribe is irrelevant to this enquiry, given the hypothesis that UBS is not responsible for the bribe under either Issue 1 or 2. Thus the position of KWL is that, despite having deceived UBS into entering into the contract, the contract ought to be rescinded at KWL's election. In my view equity debars KWL from doing so.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In light of the unanimous conclusion of this court in relation to Issue 7, the question whether KWL would be indemnified by UBS in respect of any liability to the intermediary banks does not strictly arise. However, my conclusion that KWL is not entitled to rescind the Balaba STCDO would give rise to a live question as to whether KWL is entitled to recover its liability to <span style="font-style:italic">UBS</span> under the <span style="font-style:italic">Balaba</span> STCDO through a claim for dishonest assistance against UBS.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In any event, I would reject all of KWL's claims in relation to dishonest assistance for the same two reasons. First, UBS's dishonest assistance did not cause KWL any loss. Second, it would follow from my conclusions on Issue 3 that KWL consented to Value Partners' conflict, in relation to the UBS-VP arrangement, and accordingly there is no claim for dishonest assistance at all. Thus if the dishonest assistance claims in respect of the LBBW and Depfa STCDOs had arisen, I would have rejected them for these reasons.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my view, the UBS-VP arrangement did not cause KWL to suffer any loss in relation to the Balaba STCDOs or the subsequent LBBW or Depfa STCDOs, even if it helped to bring about those STCDOs in a looser sense. Accordingly, since causation is a prerequisite to a claim for dishonest assistance (see the citation of <span style="font-style:italic">Gwembe Valley </span>by the majority at paragraph 196), KWL's claim for dishonest assistance fails.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This conclusion emerges starkly as soon as one asks the question of what would have happened but for the UBS-VP arrangement. In my view it is absolutely plain on the findings of fact made by the judge that, due to the relationship between Value Partners and Mr Heininger, KWL would have entered into comparable STCDOs in any event. As the judge found at [591]: before any contact with UBS took place there was a corrupt relationship between Value Partners and Mr Heininger; these individuals were already looking to restructure the CBLs for their (as opposed to KWL's) benefit; and personal enrichment was throughout the primary motivation. As I have said, the true position is that Value Partners and Mr Heininger were looking for a bank through which to achieve their objectives, and UBS fitted that bill.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In that context, and put at its absolute highest, the only loss which the UBS-VP arrangement could theoretically have caused was if KWL entered the STCDOs on less favourable terms than it otherwise would have obtained. However, that any such loss was suffered is inconsistent with the judge's other findings and in any event extremely doubtful. For example, the amount which KWL was ever going to receive from the STCDOs was capped at €4.5 million, due to the letter of engagement dated 31 May 2006 but actually signed on 14 June 2006. This letter was the result of the relationship between Value Partners and Mr Heininger and could not have been caused by the UBS-VP arrangement. The capping of the amount which KWL would receive is simply not explicable by reference to Value Partners attempting to deliver clients to UBS. If anything, it runs directly contrary to that arrangement since Value Partners seeking to take more profit at the expense of the client would make any deal less attractive for the client. Conversely, it is entirely explicable in the context of the relationship between Value Partners and Mr Heininger, as indeed the judge appeared to recognise at [54]. Since KWL received this amount on the terms of the STCDOs ultimately entered into, its position would not have been any better without the UBS-VP arrangement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my view, the judge did not in fact purport to decide the question of what would have happened but for the UBS-VP arrangement or, alternatively, insofar as the judge did consider the issue of causation he erred in principle in his approach. What the judge accepted was that the arrangement helped to bring about the Balaba STCDO in a looser sense, but he failed to apply his mind to the question of what would have happened without the arrangement.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The closest the judge came to discussion of causation are his remarks, in the passages reproduced by the majority at paragraphs 137 to 140, that: (i) the Balaba STCDO was "also driven by the corrupt relationship between Mr Bracy and Value Partners"; and (ii) the UBS-VP arrangement "continued to affect" and "continued to operate in" the later STCDOs. However, I do not think either represents a finding that KWL's losses would not have been suffered without the UBS-VP arrangement:</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">In relation to the first remark, the judge accepted a variety of other driving forces in the same sentence, including "the dishonest desire for personal gain of individuals" and "the eagerness of UBS … to conclude an unusual deal". Yet it is plain that the judge was not concluding that the parties' motivations were, in a legal sense, causative of loss which flowed from the Balaba STCDO. Moreover, the judge was here dealing with UBS's argument about whether rescission was unfair and disproportionate, as is put beyond doubt by [697]. Thus the judge did not have to apply his mind to the question of what would have happened but for the UBS-VP arrangement: Lord Falconer's submissions on this point were more holistic, as the judge recorded at [698] and reflected in his reasoning.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the latter two dicta, in my view the judge transposed this more holistic conclusion to the later STCDOs, without recognising that the question which arose in the context of the dishonest assistance claim was a different legal question. Again the judge's choice of words is telling. It may have been the case that the UBS-VP arrangement helped to bring about the LBBW and Depfa STCDOs but it does not follow that, without the arrangement, KWL would not have entered into comparable agreements and suffered the same losses. Furthermore, in my view the judge erred in reasoning that "it would make no sense" for KWL to be entitled to rescind but not to be able to bring a claim for dishonest assistance. This is an entirely possible state of affairs, since causation is irrelevant to rescission but a prerequisite to a claim for dishonest assistance.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly I would accept, overturning the judge's findings if necessary, that the only proper conclusion was that the UBS-VP arrangement did not cause the losses which resulted from any of the STCDOs.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Whilst my conclusion on Issue 3 avoids the inconsistency between the majority's conclusion on attribution and KWL's concession that it was vicariously liable in respect of Mr Heininger's deceit (see paragraph 183), I confess to a discomfort of my own. Namely, my view that KWL is not entitled to rescind because it had knowledge of Value Partners' conflict would appear to be inconsistent with Lord Falconer's concession that UBS was liable in dishonest assistance in relation to that arrangement. If Mr Heininger's knowledge is attributed to KWL, KWL must be taken to have consented to the breach of fiduciary duty by Value Partners in relation to the UBS-VP arrangement. In that light, I do not see how UBS could nevertheless be liable in dishonest assistance for the same. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The correct comparator was a portfolio which was managed by a competent portfolio manager, as indeed I understand the majority to accept at paragraph 285. However, in my view the judge did not use this comparator and instead erred by adopting an unmanaged portfolio as the comparator. This is supported by the judge's remarks at [910] that "a much simpler approach is appropriate" (than that suggested by UBS) and his open acceptance of the chosen method as "broad brush". In addition, I cannot accept that it should be assumed that the competent manager would have achieved at least as good an outcome as an unmanaged portfolio, either for the judge's reason that "UBS [GAM] can hardly suggest otherwise" or for the reasons given by the majority at paragraphs 286 to 294.</p>
