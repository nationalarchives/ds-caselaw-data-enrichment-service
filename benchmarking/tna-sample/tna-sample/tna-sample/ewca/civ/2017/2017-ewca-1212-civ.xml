	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">In 2009 IBM’s UK businesses had pension schemes which provided either final salary (defined benefit – DB) or defined contribution (DC) benefits.  The DB parts of the schemes had been closed to new members for years but they still had about 4000 employee members.  Under pressure from the IBM group’s commitment to investors to increase its earnings per share, and from the effect on asset values of the financial crisis of 2008, IBM decided to close the DB parts of the schemes altogether, except for some employees who were contractually entitled to such benefits, and to do so quickly.  The exercise which it undertook was known as Project Waltz.  It involved three essential elements: (a) excluding employees from membership of the DB parts of the schemes as regards future service from April 2011, (b) bringing to an end a long-standing policy of allowing early retirement, from age 50, on beneficial terms for employees, as from April 2010, and (c) ensuring that future increases in salary would not count towards the employee’s final pensionable salary for the purposes of DB rights referable to past service.  When this was announced it caused great anger and resentment among employees, particularly because there had been two recent previous changes to IBM’s pension schemes, in 2005 (Project Ocean) and 2006 (Project Soto).  The trustee of the schemes was in serious doubt as to the legal validity of what was proposed, and the employees resisted the proposals strongly.  In proceedings brought to test the lawfulness of the proposals, Warren J held that they were not lawful, by reason of breaches of relevant obligations owed by each of two separate IBM companies.  These appeals are brought by the IBM companies against the judge’s orders consequent on his decision.  This is the judgment of the court on those appeals. </p>

It also requires an examination of the duty of trust and confidence, implied into every employment contract, as it bears upon the provision and alteration of pension benefits.  Because of these features, the case has a degree of general relevance which adds to the significance which it has in any event for IBM and for those employees of IBM who are (or would be) affected by the pension benefit changes in issue. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">The litigation concerns two occupational pension schemes established in the UK for IBM’s employees, referred to as the Main Plan and the I Plan.  Under each scheme the First Claimant and Appellant (Holdings) is the Principal Employer, as defined, but it does not employ any relevant individuals.  The Second Claimant and Appellant (UKL) is the employer of the relevant members of the schemes.  The First and Second Defendants and Respondents (together, the RBs) are representative beneficiaries under the two schemes.  The Third Defendant and Respondent (the Trustee) is the trustee of both schemes.  The Main Plan comprises both Defined Benefit (DB) and Defined Contribution (DC) sections; the former includes four different structures.  In general it is not necessary to distinguish for the purposes of the appeal between the Main Plan and the I Plan or between the different DB parts of the Main Plan.  We will therefore refer only to the Main Plan, and to its distinct DB and DC sections, except where a point requires specific reference.  If it is not necessary to identify the particular corporate entity involved we will refer just to IBM or, as regards the UK companies, to IBM UK.  Besides the two UK companies which are the Claimants, we will refer as necessary to IBM UKI, IBM’s abbreviation for its business operations in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, and to IBM Corporation, the ultimate parent, and we will use the same label as the judge did, CHQ, to refer to the group headquarters in the USA. </p>

The Trustee had declined to put the proposals into effect without such a declaration being obtained.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">The proceedings came to trial before Warren J in February 2013, the hearing lasting 30 days.  He decided some points in favour of the Claimants, but on the most contentious issues he held that the Claimants’ actions were in breach of relevant duties.  His judgment following that trial (the Breach Judgment) was delivered on 4 April 2014: [2014] EWHC 980 (Ch).  Then the consequences of the breaches which he had found were debated in a further trial over 9 days in July 2014, upon which he gave judgment on 20 February 2015: [2015] EWHC 389 (Ch), the Remedies Judgment.  (Where we use the formula of either B or R followed by a number, as in B1526, this is a reference to the paragraph so numbered in the Breach Judgment or the Remedies Judgment as the case may be.)  He dealt with some supplementary points after a further hearing in April 2015, in judgments delivered on 18 and 19 May 2015: [2015] EWHC 1385 (Ch) and 1439 (Ch).  In order to give effect to his conclusions he made two orders relevant to the appeals, dated 8 June 2015 (the Breaches Order) and 30 June 2015 (the Remedies Order).  He himself granted permission to appeal to the Claimants and to cross-appeal to the RBs. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">As can be seen from the length of the hearings, the issues in the proceedings were highly contentious as between the Claimants and the RBs.  Although the case had been commenced by a Part 8 Claim Form, the parties’ cases were set out in pleadings, IBM having first given extensive disclosure of documents.  It was common ground that the burden of proof lay on the RBs on the disputed issues of breach of duty, and they therefore took the position of Claimants in the conduct of the trial. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">One of the points dealt with in the First Supplemental Judgment is the error in the Breach Judgment where (except in B3) the judge proceeds on the basis that Holdings was not only the Principal Employer under the pension schemes but also the employer of the relevant employees, and therefore that Holdings was subject not only to the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial</span> duty but also to the contractual duty of trust and confidence.  In fact Holdings had no relevant employees; UKL was the employer and therefore subject to the contractual duty.  When reading the Breach Judgment it is necessary to bear this confusion in mind.  The judge discussed the consequences of this error in paragraphs 2 to 18 of the First Supplemental Judgment.  His conclusion may be summarised adequately for present purposes as being that the Breach Judgment and the Remedies Judgment should be corrected to record that the breaches of contractual duty attributed in the Breach Judgment to Holdings should instead be attributed to UKL, and correspondingly in the Remedies Judgment the breaches of contractual duty and the consequent remedies should be attributed to UKL only, not to Holdings. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">The court had to consider a series of steps in relation to the pension schemes which together were labelled Project Waltz.  This was formulated and announced in 2009, to take effect, as regards its separate elements, between late 2009 and April 2011.  Different aspects of it involved action by Holdings, as Principal Employer under the schemes, and by UKL, as employer of the relevant employees.  Among the issues which the judge had to decide was whether the actions by Holdings were within the ambit of one of the powers under the schemes which was to be relied on, and whether they were a proper exercise of that power.  On those points the judge decided in favour of Holdings, but the RBs challenge by their cross-appeal his rejection of their contention that the power was used for an improper purpose. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">Otherwise the issues turned primarily on two related duties incumbent on Holdings and UKL respectively: the duty of trust and confidence implied by law into every employment contract, and the similar duty (sometimes referred to as a duty of good faith) imposed on a party such as Holdings which has a non-fiduciary discretionary power under an occupational pension scheme.  This is known as the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial</span> duty, after the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial Group Pension Trust Ltd v Imperial Tobacco Ltd</span> [1991] 1 WLR 589, at 596-9 in which the duty was first formulated.  The judge held that each of Holdings and UKL was in breach of its respective duty in implementing Project Waltz.  The Claimants appeal against that decision and against some of the judge’s conclusions as to the consequences of those breaches. </p>

We were shown three illustrative examples.  Details of one of them are set out in Appendix Two to this judgment.  This concerns a hypothetical male employee who had joined the C Plan (the main section of the DB Part of the Main Plan) at the age of 25, was paid £40,000 p.a. on 6 April 2010 and would be 55 years of age on 5 April 2011.

If he were to wait until 60 to retire, his pension but for Project Waltz would have been worth £490,000, whereas his pension after Project Waltz is shown as being reduced by 21% to a value of £404,000 (although, for reasons mentioned in the Appendix, the reduction would in fact have been less than this).  Given that all affected members had been employees of the IBM group for a long time, it is not difficult to understand the strongly adverse reaction of members of the DB parts of the Plans to the Project Waltz proposals. </p>

The provision of daily transcripts enabled the advocates, in some cases, to proceed much more quickly than would otherwise have been possible, and the provision of virtually all of the documentation in the case (including authorities) in electronic form has been of considerable assistance to us in the preparation of this judgment.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">The judge had a massive and unenviable task, both at the first trial and at the later hearing concerned with remedies, in coping with the huge amount of material placed before him, as regards both documentation and factual and expert evidence, and the complex and sometimes confusing interaction of many difficult and diverse issues.  His extensive specialist experience of the law and practice in relation to trusts, and in particular to occupational pension schemes, was of great assistance to him in his command of the issues arising, as is apparent from the judgments.  In our judgment, inevitably, we focus on aspects of his judgments with which one or another party sought to take exception.  On a good many of these points we do not agree with the judge’s reasoning or conclusions as set out in his judgments, and we have sometimes found that the complex structure of, in particular, the Breach Judgment made his treatment of some of the issues somewhat difficult to grasp and therefore the subject of doubt or dispute as to their meaning.  We should, however, point out that there is a great deal in those judgments which no party sought to challenge.  For example, his consideration of the consultation process, in the course of which he made trenchant criticisms of aspects of IBM’s conduct, and of the issues arising as regards consultation, stand unchallenged.  Moreover, his discussion of the true nature and scope of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial</span> duty, though not in issue before us, seems likely to provide a valuable contribution to the development of the law in this respect. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">The fourth of these points was implemented by asking employees who were members of the DB sections to sign Non-Pensionability Agreements (NPAs), expressed to agree that future increases in their pay would not count towards their pensionable salary for the purposes of the Plans.  If they signed such a document they would receive pay increases; if they did not they would not.  Initially, when these were proposed to employees in November 2009, there was no limit in time to the period during which no salary increase was to be paid if the NPA was not signed.  Soon afterwards this was corrected and the member was told that this would only affect salary for the years 2009 and 2010.  Some members had signed such forms before the second communication.  Some members signed under express protest, whether at the time of signature or afterwards, but before any pay rise was implemented.  For these reasons, there are several categories of employee to which points concerning the NPAs are relevant.  NPAs were sought, and some were signed, during 2010 and also during 2011, the latter, it seems, also on the basis of an indefinite period of deprivation from any pay rise for those who did not sign. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">A central part of the judge’s basis for deciding the case in favour of the RBs was that IBM had created what he termed Reasonable Expectations for the active members of the schemes, which would be thwarted by the implementation of Project Waltz.  We will examine these in some detail, but the genesis of most, if not all, of the Reasonable Expectations lay in communications made by IBM to members at the time of Project Ocean and Project Soto.  Correspondingly, although many members objected strongly to the terms of Project Waltz in themselves, a major factor in the sense of anger and betrayal expressed by members in relation to the announcement of Project Waltz was that it followed so hard upon the previous changes, and appeared to be inconsistent with them.   </p>

Strictly speaking the phrase “the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty” is a misnomer or is at least capable of being misleading: it is a constraint or limitation on the use of an apparently unlimited discretionary power, as the judge recognised at B372.  The judge did say, however, that it could properly be classified as a duty, though a negative duty rather than one which could require the person subject to it to act in a given way: see B471, his discussion between R364 and R379, again between R393 and R396, and his further observations at R431.  He held that breach of this obligation could provide the basis for a claim for equitable compensation.  These aspects of his judgment have not featured among the issues on the appeal, and we say no more about them than that, in a case in which such issues arise for decision on the facts, what he has said in those various passages is likely to be of value in carrying the debate forward.

He said that the obligation of good faith required that the company should exercise its rights “(a) with a view to the efficient running of the scheme established by the fund and (b) not for the collateral purpose of forcing the members to give up their accrued rights in the existing fund subject to this scheme”.  In that case an existing scheme prohibited the payment of any surplus to the employer.  Following a take-over the new owner wished to transfer members to a new scheme under which any surplus could be applied for the employer.

I do not think they did.  My reasons include these.  First, and crucially, rule 7.3 of the current Rules (and its predecessors) conferred on Prudential a discretion which was not subject to any express restrictions.  Secondly, although pension increases had been more or less in line with RPI since 1991, the relationship between RPI and pension increases had been less clear in earlier years.  Thirdly, whilst there was an expectation among members that pensions increases would be granted, there was also an appreciation that Prudential had not guaranteed or committed itself to increases.  Fourthly, Prudential was entitled to have regard to its own interests when deciding on increases.  Fifthly, Prudential was undertaking to make contributions substantially in excess of those that were required of it under the Rules.  Lastly, there had been changes in circumstances: in particular, investment returns had declined, longevity had increased, and the Scheme’s solvency had deteriorated. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">The latter case is particularly useful, even though the factual context was very different.  The case concerned a death in service benefit under a contract of employment which was not payable if, in the opinion of the employer, the death resulted from suicide.  The employer had concluded that it was a case of suicide.  The issue for the court was the test to be applied in deciding whether the employer was entitled to come to that conclusion.  The judgments in the Supreme Court differed as to the outcome but not significantly as to the correct legal test.  Baroness Hale observed at paragraph 18 that where a contractual term gives one party to the contract the power to exercise a discretion, or to form an opinion as to relevant facts, the court cannot rewrite the bargain nor substitute itself as the decision-maker, but it will seek to ensure that such contractual powers are not abused.  In the same paragraph she aligned a unilateral power to exercise a discretion with a contractual power to find facts, such as was directly at issue in that case.  That applies all the more so, she said, “where there is a significant imbalance of power between the contracting parties as there often will be in an employment contract.”  In order to seek to prevent abuse of such powers the courts have implied “a term as to the manner in which such powers may be exercised, a term which may vary according to the terms of the contract and the context in which the decisionmaking power is given.” </p>

Having said at paragraph 28 that the contractual implied term “is drawing closer and closer to the principles applicable in judicial review”, she spoke at paragraph 29 of the duty to exclude extraneous considerations and to take into account those considerations that are obviously relevant to the decision in question.

Lord Hodge also said at paragraph 55 that “the personal relationship which employment involves may justify a more intense scrutiny of the employer’s decision-making process than would be appropriate in some commercial contracts” and said in the following paragraph that the intensity of the scrutiny would depend on the nature of the decision to be made.  A decision as to the cause of death is far removed in this context from, for example, decisions about contractual bonuses, where the employee is entitled to a bona fide and rational exercise of the employer’s discretion.  Such an entitlement is capable of enforcement by the court, but does not allow much scope for an intensive scrutiny of the decision-making process (paragraph 57).  Lord Kerr agreed with both Baroness Hale and Lord Hodge.  Lord Neuberger expressed the same view at paragraph 103, although he (and Lord Wilson, agreeing with his judgment) came to the opposite conclusion when applying the test to the facts of the case. </p>

The Employment Tribunal had spoken of employers being under a duty to treat employees in a fair and even-handed manner.  In the Court of Appeal the employer challenged the use of that test (which the court agreed was incorrect), but also submitted that the duty of trust and confidence could not require the employer to offer any employee a variation of his contract.

So much was common ground before him and on the appeal, but there was an issue before the judge as to whether there were two distinct elements to the test, or only one.  The RBs argued for what was referred to as a “two-pronged” approach, involving two distinct issues: first, whether Holdings or UKL had conducted itself in a proscribed manner and, if so, secondly, whether it had done so without reasonable and probable cause.  The judge rejected this approach in favour of a unitary approach: B385.  It is accepted that, if the employee makes out a case of improper conduct, an evidential burden shifts to the employer to show what its reasons were, and in some of the employment cases, particularly those concerned with discretionary bonuses, the employer has not attempted to show that.  However, leaving aside that proposition, the judge held that the test was unitary and that the legal burden of proof remains on the employee throughout.   </p>

He asserted and relied on an implied term of the employment contract that the bank would not exercise any discretion it had as regards his bonus irrationally or perversely; that duty was admitted.  The bank sought summary judgment on the basis that he had no reasonable prospect of showing a breach of the term, and appealed (successfully) against the judge’s dismissal of that application.  Mummery LJ recorded the submission for the bank that Mr Keen must show that no rational employer bank would have awarded bonuses less in amount than those recommended by his line manager, which were significantly higher than those in fact awarded, “in other words that the bank had exercised its discretion to award bonuses irrationally, arbitrarily or perversely” (paragraph 52).

The claimants had been employed by a company in the Dresdner Bank group.  In August 2008, in order to motivate staff to stay, a senior manager had announced that a large guaranteed minimum bonus pool had been declared for 2008, to be distributed “come what may” on a discretionary basis as between the relevant employees.  However, Dresdner was then taken over by Commerzbank, which took a different view as to the appropriateness of paying bonuses on this basis.   It introduced a “material adverse change” clause into the arrangements for the bonus, and then it reduced the bonus pool by 90%.  The Court of Appeal affirmed the judge’s decision on the first point argued, namely that the guaranteed bonus pool was a matter of contract as between employer and employee, from which the bank was not entitled to resile.  The court went on to consider the second question, though on this basis it did not strictly arise, namely whether the introduction of the clause was in breach of the duty of trust and confidence.  Elias LJ (with whom Maurice Kay and Beatson LJJ agreed) said at paragraph 102 that this involved two questions: first, what was the employer’s reason for so acting, and second, did its reason constitute reasonable and proper cause?  No witness had given evidence as to the employer’s reasons for introducing the clause; some documents were in evidence, but none from Dresdner’s original owners (Allianz) or from Commerzbank.  The judge inferred that the reason for the change was pressure from Commerzbank.  Elias LJ said at paragraph 130: </p>

This was a striking absence of evidence given that the onus of establishing a reasonable and proper cause lay on the employer, once the objective breach of trust and confidence had been established. </p>

The legal burden of proof lies with the claimants throughout.  If, however, the claimants show a prima facie case that the decision is at least questionable, then an evidential burden may shift to the employer to show what its reasons were.

It is clear from his judgment that, but for his findings about Reasonable Expectations, both as regards the facts and their legal relevance, he would not have decided the case in favour of the RBs as regards the principal attack on Project Waltz, nor indeed was it argued for the RBs that he could do so: see for example B1519. </p>

The judge concluded, first, that a misrepresentation relied on by employees could be relevant even if it was not deliberate or reckless but merely negligent or even wholly innocent (B465), and secondly that conduct could not be ruled out as irrelevant even if it did not amount to a promise, commitment or guarantee: B466.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">The significance of that observation can be seen later in the Breach Judgment, after the judge had said something about the change in the corporate culture of IBM in the early 1990s, and posed the question “to what extent the new culture can properly be invoked to override any such Reasonable Expectations as can be established”: B530.  He agreed with Mr Simmonds that the assessment of commercial matters and the making of business decisions is a matter for the company, on which the court cannot second-guess the business judgment of management.  The judge did not accept Mr Simmonds’ next submission, that “where there is a coherent, rational (in terms of making business sense in the context of IBM’s business) and a <span style="font-style:italic">bona</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">fide</span> case for the pension changes, the Court should not seek to go behind that case”: B532.  The judge accepted that the existence of such a business case would be highly relevant and “other things being equal” the court should not go behind it, “not least because it is ill-equipped to do so”.  But he postulated a case in which the company had bound itself by contract with employees, for example, to keep the DB Plans open until 2014.  He said at B533 that the company could not override that contractual obligation, and that, by analogy, a proposed course of conduct might, as a matter of fact, override and disappoint Reasonable Expectations and therefore be in breach of duty.  In the following paragraph he said that, however rational and strong might be the business case for the changes on the part of an employer “untrammelled by commitments to its workforce”, the test of irrationality and perversity under the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial</span> duty “is focused on a course of conduct which no reasonable employer would pursue.  Irrationality, in that sense, may have nothing or little to do with the underlying financial and economic business case.”  He said that he would revert to IBM’s business justification for Project Waltz later in the judgment (B535). </p>

We can be much shorter, given that the facts are not in issue and by no means so many are relevant to the issues before us as were to those which the judge had to decide.  Nevertheless, the complexity of some of the points and of the development of the history is such that it cannot be told as simply and succinctly as we would wish.

This is the annual accounting expense or income that a company must recognise in its Income and Expenditure Account.  There are several elements to the NPPC.  One of importance for present purposes is the Expected Return on Assets (EROA): the return that the company would expect on its pension plan’s assets over the accounting period, calculated by reference to the Market-Related Value of Assets and the expected long-term rate of return on assets. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Another topic which the judge identified as important is that of volatility in relation to pension schemes.  As he explained at B518, the word is straightforward, referring to a likelihood of sudden, unexpected or unpredictable changes, but what matters is to what it is applied.  An obvious application is to the value of scheme assets, as values change on relevant markets.  It can also apply to the amount of scheme liabilities, though these will not normally change so suddenly as asset values can.  Volatility can also be spoken of as regards the gap between the value of scheme assets and the amount of scheme liabilities, and it can also be applied to NPPC.  The judge observed that this last aspect of volatility was of greatest concern to CHQ because of its effect on the group’s accounts and on the level of Earnings Per Share (EPS), which was perceived as being of importance for the group in its relations with actual and potential shareholders. </p>

He referred to IBM’s pre-eminence in technology in the 1980s, which generated significant profits and allowed for generous provision for employees, but also to its failure to respond to competition by the early 1990s such that by 1993 it was on the verge of insolvency.  A new CEO, Mr Gerstner, began to change the corporate culture, limiting employment costs and focussing on increased shareholder value as a key indicator of success.  The judge recorded that Mr MacDonald gave evidence that many senior IBM executives who survived the “near-death experience” of the early 1990s remained determined to retain tough controls on employee costs, as part of the bottom line (B529).  He also noted that this change of attitudes led to resentment and opposition on the part of other longstanding employees of IBM, with which the resistance to the pension changes which we have to consider is entirely consistent.

Over the three years 2000, 2001 and 2002 the actual Return on Assets (ROA) fell short of EROA by more than £2 billion.  Recovery started in 2003, but the figures for previous losses were spread over following years, by way of smoothing the effect of such major changes.  A triennial actuarial valuation of the Plans was due as at 31 December 2003.  It became clear in 2004 that there would be a substantial funding deficit; in the event it turned out to be £900 million for the Main Plan and £19 million for the I Plan.  Moreover, the IBM UKI businesses were seen as underperforming by comparison with other parts of the worldwide business, so that the UK management team started to prepare a business recovery plan.  A review of pension provision formed part of this.  This led to the formulation of Project Ocean. </p>

This was regarded as appropriate by the Trustee at the time though it was recognised that, as the Plan matured, the allocation would need to change in favour of bonds, which are regarded as less volatile in terms of value and more closely matched to the nature of the Plan liabilities.  A modest change, to 79/21, was made in terms of policy and reality in 2002.  Further change was deferred until after the 2003 actuarial valuation.  The asset allocation policy had an immediate impact on NPPC since the EROA on equities and other property would be higher than on bonds.   </p>

The Trustee agreed, in the light of this, that the valuation could be undertaken on a less cautious basis (the “best estimate basis” rather than the “central basis”).

In the Webcast Mr Heath outlined the proposed changes, which he described as action taken “with the intention of securing the sustainability of our defined benefit pension schemes”. He dealt first with the increase in employee contributions in respect of future service benefits, stressing that this had nothing to do with the past service deficit to which employees were not being asked to contribute, and making the point that much of the increased cost of future benefits arose from greater longevity.  He then turned to the past service deficit and the figures from the actuarial valuation.  He explained the additional cash contributions of £200 million each year for three years and the guarantee by the parent company, which he described as “excellent news for members” which “enhances the security of members’ benefits and demonstrates IBM’s continuing commitment to the Plans and their members”.  At the end of the Webcast he referred to there having been consideration of other proposals including changes to benefit design, but said that the particular changes proposed were thought to be right in terms of a balance between the need to ask members to contribute more and greater security.  He said that these changes convinced him that IBM’s DB pension schemes would in this way be put “on a firm footing for the future”, and said that he believed the proposal “demonstrates IBM’s commitment to underpin the sustainability” of the UK DB schemes. </p>

In the course of that he held that members had a Reasonable Expectation that they would be entitled to retire early on favourable terms.  This was a widespread perception from IBM’s long-standing practice, engendered by IBM and of which IBM was aware: see paragraph B687, quoted at paragraph [250] below.  The practice could be changed for the future, but since it affected the amount of pension earned by past service, it might be open to question whether and in what circumstances it could be changed so as to affect the pension attributable to past service.  When the judge returned to his discussion of the Webcast he held (at B689) that its contents confirmed and reinforced the Reasonable Expectation as to the early retirement policy, but that a significant change in financial and economic circumstances might be such as to justify a departure from the Reasonable Expectation without the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial</span> duty being engaged or, if engaged, being breached (B690). </p>

This was of concern to CHQ in terms of the contribution of the UK Plans to IBM’s overall NPPC, both for 2006 in particular and on a longer-term basis.  CHQ also wished to reduce volatility in terms of the gap between the amount of the pension liabilities and the value of the pension scheme assets.  The judge said that the Project Soto changes were initiated by CHQ, not in the UK.  CHQ had identified similar problems of an acute nature in several countries: Canada, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, UK, US and Switzerland.  Solutions were to be sought in each country.  CHQ introduced the subject to UK management in September 2005, with cessation of DB accrual as a possible solution to be considered.  UK management resisted this, and in the end did not propose it.  The UK proposals put to CHQ by way of response would have made substantial reductions in 2006 NPPC, but were not accepted as adequate by CHQ.  The proposals were therefore developed further before being approved by CHQ and then put to the Trustee in November.

Thus at B835 the judge recorded the RBs’ case as being that the Soto changes were approved by the Trustee on the basis that the Plans would have a sustainable long-term future, and that IBM contended that this was the expectation of UK management at the time. The judge accepted that this was indeed the expectation of UK management, but said that it was difficult to believe that Mr Koppl or Ms Salinaro at CHQ, for instance, thought that the DB plans had a long-term future. </p>

As regards future benefit accrual he found that the Reasonable Expectation which he regarded as arising from Project Ocean was modified by Project Soto, because not all of future pay increases would count towards a DB pension, but subject to that he made findings as to the existence of Reasonable Expectations (at B1045, B1052, B1053 and B1054) which we have already quoted from his later summary in B1510: see paragraph [64] above.  We have also referred to his clarification of those findings at paragraph [65] above.

There were several aspects to this case on behalf of the RBs.  One, which is important in the light of what the judge said about it, is that Project Soto would have had little effect on volatility, and that Mr Koppl and other executives at CHQ knew it would not solve the problem of volatility, but that a contrary message was given to UK management who in turn conveyed an inaccurate message to members.  This in itself was said to be a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial</span> duty.  The judge said at B967 that it was clear that Project Soto did not solve the volatility problems facing the DB Plans, but he was satisfied that “IBM could reasonably have thought that there could be a positive impact on both breadth of variance volatility [that is, volatility as regards the gap between the value of the scheme assets and the amount of the pension liabilities] and on downside risk [that is, the worst possible projected outcome in a given year]”. </p>

Further, it is hardly a ringing endorsement of the proposition that IBM saw the DB Plans as sustainable at that time; it even makes questionable the proposition that IBM had no current intention to make further changes in the near or even foreseeable future.  And it clearly shows that CHQ’s thoughts were not to be shared with UK management, something which Mr Koppl accepted.  That requirement for secrecy was, it seems to me, a reflection of the fact that CHQ knew things that it did not want UK management to know because it would undermine the message which CHQ was sending out about addressing volatility and sustainability. </p>

He referred to the secrecy maintained by CHQ, as referred to in B971 (quoted above), and then went on to consider what was known by whom in IBM’s management.

He said that Mr Greene (IBM Corporation’s Treasurer and Chief Financial Risk Officer, and a member of the Trustee board and Investment Committee from 2002-2011), Mr Loughridge (IBM’s global CFO), Mr Castellanos (Vice President Human Resources at CHQ) and Ms Salinaro (also of CHQ) were fully aware of Mr Koppl’s projections and Towers Perrin’s advice: B985.  He then said it was unclear what other senior executives, whether in CHQ or in the UK, actually knew, but that they relied on Mr Koppl and others at CHQ to inform them of the position, and in particular that UK management depended on CHQ for an understanding both of the effect of Project Soto on volatility and of what level of volatility was acceptable to CHQ. </p>

In the light of his consideration of the question of corporate hierarchy, he said that it was necessary to ask not only whether Holdings had reasonable grounds for making the statements it made, but also whether CHQ had reasonable grounds for allowing the statements to be made or, in other words, whether CHQ could properly have made the statements itself (B1033).  The judge held that no criticism could properly be made of Holdings and the UK management for having made any relevant statements.  However, he noted that Mr Simmonds had accepted that Mr Koppl would have agreed that he would have had no reasonable grounds for saying that the DB Plans were sustainable or that volatility had been addressed in a significant way (B1036). Mr Koppl did not keep his knowledge of the position to himself, of course, but shared it with other senior staff at CHQ.  At B1020 the judge recorded that Ms Salinaro, Mr Loughridge and Mr Greene knew that Project Soto was not solving the volatility problem and that, on that footing, CHQ knew that to be the position.  It would therefore not be correct to describe the DB Plans as sustainable in the absence of a solution to the volatility problem.

The issue of volatility was addressed by CHQ in the sense of having been considered by them; but not even a partial solution was really provided.  I accept that the Soto changes had some positive effect on volatility but the extent of the amelioration was only small in the context of the problem which IBM Corporation was facing.  That CHQ knew a message was being given which was, at best, hugely optimistic, in all likelihood disingenuous and, on an extreme view, deliberately misleading, is underlined by its requirement for secrecy: CHQ knew things that it did not want UK management to know because it would undermine the message which CHQ was sending out about addressing volatility and sustainability. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">The next important aspect of the history is what is called the 2010 EPS Roadmap.  This was developed by Mr Loughridge and presented to investors in May 2007: B1075.  It set out a target of achieving double digit earnings per share growth over the long term; illustrations given to investors related to the period to 2010.  EPS had been $6.06 in 2006; the target was $11.01 in 2010.  There were several elements to the plan, but a reduction of pension costs was to be a significant factor, estimated to generate $0.90 per share.  In B1076 the judge showed how this was to be seen in context.  Prospectively it required a reduction of worldwide retirement related costs, which in 2006 had been $2,428 million, to $707 million, which would require a profit figure of $428 million for NPPC. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">The judge observed at B1096 that keeping to the 2010 EPS Roadmap became a corporate imperative.  A fairly strong message had been given to the market and although it could not be regarded as a promise, a failure to deliver what the market had been led to expect might have had a serious impact on IBM’s share price.  It left IBM with little room for manoeuvre if market performance were to fall short of expectations: B1097.  So IBM was faced with a major problem when the global financial crisis occurred in 2008, leading to a collapse in asset values.  All areas of the IBM business had to take steps to achieve the level of savings set out in the 2010 EPS Roadmap. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">In this situation, attention was devoted at CHQ to retirement related costs (and, no doubt, also to other aspects of costs).  At a meeting late in July the forecast contribution from pensions was down from $0.90 to $0.70 and a month later it was $0.66.  That was at the time of a meeting between Mr Loughridge, Mr MacDonald and Mr Koppl, who was given the task of considering the various options.  They had discussed reducing DC benefits and medical plan benefits, but this was regarded as inconsistent with IBM’s general policy of encouraging DC membership, and Mr MacDonald also had in mind the recent closure of the US DB plans.  Mr Koppl was therefore left with changes to DB plans worldwide as being the only other available course.  By 10 October 2008, after particularly severe falls in the market (which may have been the lowest point in the market), the projected contribution from pensions was no more than $0.21.  It was at this time that consideration of the project was embarked on which, for countries outside the US, became Project Waltz.  Three countries were identified as giving rise to particular problems because of their high service cost: Germany, Japan and the UK.  By the end of October examination and development of the project was well under way in relation to these three and three other countries, with the benefit of preliminary work by Towers Perrin but on the basis that local teams and local UK consultants would take over the development of the proposals for the UK. </p>

They discussed the closure of the DB Plans.  Mr Wilson said that this would present difficulties as regards relations with the Trustee and with employees, particularly in the light of the two recent sets of changes.  Mr MacDonald understood what he said as even stronger, namely that closure would not be possible.  He reacted by telling Mr Loughridge that Mr Wilson ought to be moved on from his role as CFO.  The judge interpreted this as confirmation that CHQ had by then decided that DB accrual in the UK Plans should be terminated.  Mr Wilson was eventually removed from discussions about changes to the UK Plans in late January 2009, and left IBM in April. </p>

He identified ways in which UKI needed to change in order to meet the current economic circumstances.  The resulting project, planned in the second half of 2008, was launched in January 2009 and was called UKI Transformation.  It aimed to improve the underlying competitiveness of the UK business and its profit contribution, to ensure that the reward structure was fair as between different groups of employees, and to reduce the volatility of and risk attached to pension liabilities and (in order to assist competitiveness and profitability) to reduce future pension costs: see B1140.  The initiative was driven by the need for UKI to compete with other parts of the IBM empire for investment, in relation to which, before Mr Riley arrived, the UK operation was not seen as especially attractive. </p>

It was on the agenda for a board meeting of Holdings on 29 April, at which it was approved.  The judge examined the evidence about this meeting in detail, between B1212 and B1230.  Mr Chrystie, the new CFO for IBM UKI, played a significant part.  He was aware of two motivations for the changes, one local to the UK and one global.  (These are what were referred to as the local and the global strands.)  His focus was more on the local position.  The judge accepted his evidence as to his state of mind: B1222.  The judge also accepted (at B1226) that the board was presented with a business case for the changes, both in terms of the UK business and also of CHQ’s involvement and the need to make savings so as to assist in meeting the 2010 EPS Roadmap target.  While the judge accepted that CHQ “was in practical terms calling the shots”, he said (at B1230) that he was satisfied that the board of Holdings: </p>

Mr Lamb’s reaction, unsurprisingly, was to oppose the idea of further changes.  The Project Waltz proposals were presented formally to the Trustee board on 7 May 2009.  One feature was that they were presented on the basis that the DB Plans would close on 5 April 2010, whereas Holdings had already decided that the relevant date would be 2011.  Discussions with the Trustee were not easy.  Holdings took the view that it could implement the proposals without Trustee consent, but clearly wished to obtain that consent on the basis that it would make life easier in a number of respects.  The Trustee did not agree to the proposals, taking the view that, in the circumstances, they were legally questionable, and that they could not properly be implemented without the court ruling on their validity. </p>

The consultation process was to run from 5 August to 5 October 2009, though in the end it started on 10 August and was supposed to end on 20 October.  Employees were told that no final decisions would be made until the end of the consultation period.  IBM posted information for the consultation on an internal group web page.  From the outset it stated that the changes on which it was consulting were intended to take effect on 6 April 2010, although it was clear from the evidence before the judge that the only real choice under consideration by IBM was between start dates in 2011 and 2012.  The member representatives and the Trustee both sought information from IBM as to the details of the proposals and as to the rationale for them, without much success.  The judge described the points made at some of the PCC meetings at B1273 to B1286.  At B1276 he said that additional suggestions had been put forward at the sixth session on 9 September and observed that, given the very serious effect that the proposals would have on some members, “one might reasonably expect that IBM would give genuine consideration to any sensible proposal”, and that the time had not arrived at which it would be too late for new suggestions.

At the eighth meeting, on 23 September, IBM said that the employee suggestions were not accepted, and set out its proposals (including an effective date of April 2011).  These proposals were not well received, and employee representatives continued to press for information including as to the business rationale for Project Waltz, which up to that time had been given in only such general terms as not to provide a worthwhile basis for comment and real consultation.  Despite this request, of which the judge said it was an eminently reasonable stance for the employee representatives to take, IBM declined to offer any more than had already been said.  That position was made clear at the ninth meeting on 30 September 2009.  The judge observed at B1288 that there was no hint in any communication with the Trustee or the employee representatives that a significant factor (to say the least) for IBM was the 2010 EPS Roadmap. </p>

IBM’s initial position about this suggestion was that it was not justified, and although it made certain concessions later as regards members who might have had such a right, it did not modify its position in the Project Waltz consultation, and pressed ahead with the proposals without regard to this matter, despite (for example) a letter from the Trustee dated 14 October expressing concern about this issue. </p>

The point of these, for IBM, was to ensure that future increases in salary did not increase the cost of the DB benefits.  The termination of DB accrual would mean that future service would not count for the calculation of a member’s DB pension, but, without more, the pension attributable to past service would be calculated by reference to the member’s final pensionable salary, and would therefore be affected by pay rises, whether attributable to promotion or otherwise.  This is what is known as the final salary link.  IBM wished to eliminate this element of the cost of service during membership of the DB Plans.    </p>

With this in prospect, IBM offered an opportunity to active DB members who would be 50 or older by 5 April 2010 to take advantage of the old policy: B30 to B32.  The first mention to employees came in a Factsheet published on 25 September 2009, which said there would be an early retirement window in the fourth quarter of 2009 but gave no further detail.  It was announced in detail by Mr Ferrar on 21 October by email to all relevant employees inviting them to express interest in taking early retirement before the change in the policy.  They were given until 16 November to express interest in early retirement, with support by way of seminars, a modeller and one to one consultation in the meantime.  Those expressing interest by then would be given IBM’s decision by 4 December and would have until 11 December to decide whether or not to proceed with early retirement on the basis of the terms offered.  The judge recorded at B31 (iii) that of 2324 employees eligible to apply, 1162 did apply and 861 of those took early retirement. </p>

Thus, the new policy would not affect active members of the C Plan who wished to retire at or after the age of 60, even though the NRD for that Plan was 63.  As also mentioned above, IBM’s response to the rectification issue being raised in the course of the consultation was an issue before the judge (it is Issue 20 on the appeal).

Members of the DB sections of the Main Plan would therefore be excluded as members by the exercise of the Exclusion Power, but allowed to rejoin as members of the M Plan.

The notice may direct that the person or class “shall not be eligible for membership, or shall cease to be a Member or Members”.  Membership means membership of the scheme as a whole.  Such a notice will terminate the membership of a relevant person who is currently a Member, will preclude someone who is not a member from becoming one, and, so the judge held (at B270), will also preclude someone who ceases to be a Member by the effect of the notice from being eligible for membership.

The Rules relating to the DC part of the scheme provide for eligibility for membership in Schedule B rule 1.  A person satisfying conditions set out in rule 1(1) becomes a Member unless rule 1(2) applies, which covers cases of the person opting out of membership, but also (among other cases) the person being precluded from membership by a notice served under Clause 4 of Part V of the Trust Deed.  Rule 2, correspondingly, says that a Member shall cease to be a Member, among other cases, if he is precluded from continued membership of the Plan by the Employer under a notice under clause 4.  However, rule 3 provides that a person who has ceased to be a Member by reason of any of the events mentioned in rule 2 (and who otherwise still satisfies the conditions of eligibility) “may resume his membership of the Plan”, but this is at the sole discretion of the Trustee.  There is also rule 1(5) under which the Trustee, at the request of the Principal Employer, may waive any or all of the eligibility and entrance conditions set out in the rule.  Probably this provision relates, in practice at any rate, only to persons who have not yet become Members, and not to someone who is a former Member whose membership came to an end by way of a notice under clause 4. </p>

Thus, what was on offer to the I Plan members was very similar to the judge’s hypothetical case in B285.  Moreover, the Exclusion Power in the I Plan was not subject to the implied limitation as regards the final salary link, because it was not introduced into that scheme by amendment under a power which itself was limited.  It was in the documentation for that scheme from its outset. </p>

They need not have taken up this option: there were other courses open to them that they might prefer to follow, including joining the new private pension plan.  Resumption of membership was not precluded by the service of the notice, as is shown by rules 1(5) and 3.  The consent of the Trustee would be necessary.  The point of the statement about not being ineligible to join the DC part was only to make it clear that Holdings would consent to that happening, if desired and if its consent was necessary.  That could have been stated in different language, but the intention is clear, against the context of the Trust Deed and the Rules, and to hold that the latter statement vitiated the exercise of the power would be an excessively technical approach.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">As regards the other part of Mr Stallworthy’s argument, relying on IBM’s intention, which it could not fulfil, to break the final salary link, this is a different kind of situation.  It is not really a case of improper purpose at all but, at most, of what is sometimes called excessive execution, that is to say a purported exercise of a power which, for some reason, cannot take effect in full.  That is quite unlike the classic cases of improper purpose where the defect lies not in the terms of the execution of the power but in the motive lying behind it.  The judge considered this very line of authority earlier in his judgment when addressing the first issue, whether the exclusion power had been validly introduced into the Main Scheme trust deed at all.  He referred at B199 and following to several authorities, including <span style="font-style:italic">Bestrustees</span> v <span style="font-style:italic">Stuart</span>: [2001] EWHC 649 (Ch), [2001] PLR 283, which Mr Simmonds also showed to us.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">By the same reasoning, it seems to us that there is no reason why the exercise of the Exclusion Power by the notices actually given in this case should not be held valid to the extent permitted by the implicit limitation on the power.  If one were to ask whether Holdings would have given the same Notices if it had been aware that it would not be able thereby to break the final salary link, the answer would have to be that it would.  The object of terminating DB accrual was the principal reason for using the power.  That it could not break the final salary link would perhaps have been seen as a disadvantage, but not at all as a reason for not exercising the power to the full extent available, not least because that feature was also to be dealt with by the NPAs as a separate element of Project Waltz. </p>

That may be so in some cases, but in the present case it seems to us that Holdings’ intention was to use the power to exclude DB Members from their membership of the scheme, which is within the scope of the power.  The fact that IBM also hoped, but failed, thereby to break the final salary link was incidental.  We therefore dismiss the cross-appeal.   </p>

Adopting the test in relation to the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty which I have explained, the question would be whether making changes to the terms of pension provision would be within the range of decisions which a reasonable employer could take.  In this example, if IBM sought to close the Plans or change the early retirement policy on the basis that it needed to do so in order to achieve savings required to meet its commitment to investors, a close examination would be required of precisely what it had committed to investors and whether, in the light of its <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty, it could properly have committed to what it did commit.  Even if that commitment had been properly given, a close examination would also be required to see whether IBM could meet that commitment whilst at the same time acting in compliance with the Reasonable Expectations which it had engendered.  Only if it could not do so, it seems to me, would IBM have an argument for saying that the commitment to investors trumped its obligations to members.  </p>

At B366, he accepted a proposition for the RBs that “at the end of the day the only relevant test is whether the impact of conduct complained of has, objectively, seriously damaged the relationship of trust and confidence”.   </p>

Moreover, although his propositions are stated principally in relation to the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial</span> duty, it seems to us that what he said at B441 to B444 (quoted at paragraphs [184] and following above) applied both to the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial</span> duty and to the contractual duty; this follows, in particular, both from his reliance on contractual cases including <span style="font-style:italic">Clark v Nomura</span>, and from his use of the phrase (in B443) “in the context of employer/employee (and I would say employer/member) relationships”.

Correspondingly, he held that, absent a business case, UKL’s conduct in relation to the 2009 NPAs would have given rise to a breach of the contractual duty of trust and confidence.  He did, however, observe that this conclusion only followed from treating the NPAs as a part of Project Waltz.  If they had stood on their own they would not have been in breach of any duty (subject to one separate point) because there was no Reasonable Expectation about salary increases (B1516).  In particular, he rejected an argument that, albeit that there was no Reasonable Expectation about any particular salary increase, there was at least a Reasonable Expectation that there would be no discrimination as regards salary increases by reference to the choice made at the stage of Project Soto as between staying with the DB Plan and moving to the DC Plan: B1517-8.

In the light of the Reasonable Expectations, Holdings could be expected to adopt proposals to meet such concerns as there were about the operational cost (including the cost, from a UK accounting and scheme-funding perspective, of meeting any UK DB Plan deficit) in ways which, so far as reasonably possible, were consistent with those Reasonable Expectations.  I have little doubt that, had the only need been to meet local objectives of that sort, proposals of far less severity could and would have been devised.  Indeed, Mr Riley effectively accepted that proposition.  </p>

For the UK, that included pension savings of such a scale and having such attributes that the target set for the UK would be met.  I am wholly unconvinced that proposals could not have been developed which would have met those twin objectives; indeed, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that they could have been. In the first place, the necessary savings to meet the EPS target (in contrast with the savings in NPPC cost) did not need to come from DB Pension plans, let alone from the UK DB Plans.  If pension cost was an essential element, DC Plans could have been targeted: as the evidence (particularly from Mr Koppl) shows, that was an option and would have provided an easier solution.  Another option might have been to impose heavier burdens on other DB Plans in countries where members had no similar Reasonable Expectations or no remedies arising out of them.  </p>

But to expect members to make such an important decision under the sort of pressure which was put on them was not, in my view, consonant with Holding’s <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial</span> duty or its contractual duty of trust and confidence.

That is clear from his use of the phrases “so far as reasonably possible” in sub-paragraph (iv) and “so far as possible” in sub-paragraph (viii).  It is also shown by what he said in subparagraphs (x) and (xi).  In the former he spoke of IBM not having a free hand to act as they chose.  Because of the Reasonable Expectations, he said, they did not have a free hand, so that if they went beyond such freedom as they did have, the court could hold that there was a breach of duty on the part of Holdings.

He asked, rhetorically, how it could be supposed that, having directed himself correctly and repeatedly as to the right test in law, the judge could fairly be read as having departed from this test at the moment of his actual decision.  He also pointed to the fact that the sub-paragraphs in B1526 are said to be the judge’s principal, not his only, reasons, and that he referred to the “no reasonable employer” test in subparagraph (xiii) (quoted at paragraph [396] below) and again in B1528.

In our judgment, Miss Rose is right to contend that these passages show the judge proceeding from his finding of Reasonable Expectations, as set out in B1510, and his finding that Project Waltz was inconsistent with those Reasonable Expectations, to a position in which the business case advanced by IBM as the justification for Project Waltz was held to be inadequate unless there had been no alternative course of action open to IBM.  It is true that the judge does not articulate this in terms in sub-paragraphs (iv), (viii), (ix) or (xi), but he says that IBM should have sought alternative courses of action which would not conflict with the Reasonable Expectations, and that IBM could have found some such, and in sub-paragraph (x) he describes Holdings as not having a free hand, because of the Reasonable Expectations, and therefore as being constrained in its freedom of action. </p>

To put the existence of Reasonable Expectations on the same footing as the existence of a separate binding legal obligation seems to us to be revealing of the judge’s attitude, which formed part of his eventual reasoning, that the existence of Reasonable Expectations has a special significance in relation to the decision-making process, so that it is not merely one among many relevant factors which should be considered and taken into account in the course of the decision-making process. </p>

Both limbs of the test can apply, but it was not argued in the present case that any irrelevant matter had been taken into account, or any relevant matter left out of account.

Although the judge directed himself that the test to be applied was one of capriciousness, perversity or arbitrariness, which is close to the rationality test, he accorded an overriding substantive significance to the Reasonable Expectations such that they could only lawfully be disappointed in a case of necessity, which is not compatible with the correct approach.   Members’ expectations, even if they satisfy the judge’s criteria for a Reasonable Expectation, do not constitute more than a relevant factor which the decision-maker can, and where appropriate should, take into account in the course of its decision-making process. </p>

At B1045 he had referred to the position after Project Soto and referred to the Reasonable Expectation about DB accrual as being affected by Project Soto, but that, as so altered, it “would not be further changed for some period of time in the absence of a significant change in financial and economic circumstances”.  In turn, at B1392, having put the case about the effect of the Reasonable Expectation in terms which foreshadowed his reasoning that they should prevail unless there was no other alternative course (in B1391), he said that a significant change in financial conditions might be capable of justifying changes to the Plans, but that that was a different question: see paragraph [197] above.  This had been foreshadowed by what he had said at B697 and B1052.  In particular, at B697, dealing with expectations about continued DB accrual, he said this: </p>

His expectation would be qualified by an acceptance that such changes in financial and economic circumstances could justify a change.  Whether one categorises that situation as one where the extent of the Reasonable Expectation is circumscribed by the qualification or as one where a disappointment of that Expectation has no consequence does not matter much, if at all. </p>

We agree that, of the ways in which the judge puts it at B697, the more logical formulation is that significant changes in financial and economic circumstances can override the expectation, so that no separate justification is needed.  The member is not led to expect that (in this case) DB accrual will continue for the period which the judge identified as material (eventually, until 2014) if in the meantime there is a significant change in financial and economic circumstances.  That fits with the judge’s formulation of that Reasonable Expectation at B1052 and B1510. </p>

At B1100 the judge had noted that the collapse in asset values which was part of the financial crash in 2008 was projected to have a dramatic effect on pension costs (as measured by NPPC) and this had an adverse effect on the projection for the EPS in 2010.  By early October 2008 the contribution of NPPC towards the improvement of EPS figures under the 2010 EPS Roadmap, which had been put at $0.90 in 2007, had fallen to $0.21.  A month later it had recovered a little, to $0.27.  At B1111, having referred to the severity of the market falls by October 2008, the judge said that those falls did play a causative role in the decision to proceed with Project Waltz and that IBM was entitled to rely on those falls in the market as justifying its actions, though he left open for separate consideration whether, even with that reliance, IBM’s “actions can be justified”. </p>

From the position, which was not contested, that the assumptions as regards NPPC which underlay the 2010 EPS Roadmap as formulated in 2007 were reasonable best estimate assumptions (see B1340(i)), and the further position that IBM regarded it as vital to adhere and live up to that commitment despite the financial collapse in 2008, the parties entered into a debate as to whether, as IBM said, the crisis in 2008 was of almost unprecedented and unpredictable magnitude or, as the RBs argued, the effects of the 2008 market falls were neither unprecedented nor unpredictable: B1343-4.  The judge rejected the proposition that the 2008 crash was foreseeable (B1348), and he accepted that in October 2008 it was widely thought that the crisis would deepen still further (B1353).  He said that, if it had not been for the Reasonable Expectations, the response of IBM and its group operating companies to the 2008 crash “made perfectly good commercial sense”, and that “the commitment to the 2010 EPS Roadmap was an entirely rational reason for the Project Waltz changes”: B1354.  However, he drew a distinction between the position as CHQ saw it and the position of Holdings (and UKL) given the Reasonable Expectations which he had held to be established.  He said that separate consideration was needed, having regard to the position of Holdings and UKL, as to whether the Project Waltz changes could properly be implemented.   </p>

He argued that the judge had examined the business justification contended for by IBM, which depended heavily on the effect of the 2008 crash, and had considered the crash as part of that process.  He submitted that the relevant issue was not the significance of the crash on a global basis but its impact on IBM, that is to say whether, as a result of it, IBM had undergone a significant change in circumstances.  He drew attention to the fact that the crash had little effect on IBM’s operational performance, as distinct from its effect on the pension funds.  He also relied on the graph at B938 which shows that, although the Return on Assets in 2008 was significantly below the Expected Return on Assets, it had been almost as much below EROA in the wake of the dotcom crash in 2002.  From that he submitted that the judge was entitled to take the view that there was no substantial difference between the two cases and therefore the events of 2008 did not represent a significant change in relevant circumstances.

This was referred to as the “Heads I win, tails you lose” argument.  As Mr Simmonds pointed out, this was an argument that the judge rejected, and which is revived by way of the Respondent’s Notice (Issue 17).

If there had been a significant change in financial and economic circumstances, then the expectations that he had held to exist would give way to the effect of the change, so as to be overridden.  Accordingly, for the judge to hold that the changes made by Project Waltz did disappoint the Reasonable Expectations, it was necessary for him (on his own approach) to come to a decision that there had not been a relevant change in financial and economic circumstances.  On what we see as the correct approach, as submitted to us for IBM, he should have considered and decided whether or not IBM could rationally have taken the view that there had been such a change.  Certainly the judge did not consider that question.  We do not accept that the judge can be regarded as having decided the point, on either basis, without having said so expressly.  On this point, as on the other ingredients of their case, the burden of proof lay on the RBs.  It follows that, in the absence of a decision on the point, they failed to make out an essential ingredient of their case. </p>

In particular, his statement in B1526(i), that Project Waltz was inconsistent with the Reasonable Expectations, was not justified in the absence of a finding on the question of significant change.

The basis for saying that this perception was “engendered” by Holdings was the fact that this was, and had for a long time been, its policy, about which it was quite open and which it did apply openly and consistently. </p>

As it seems to us, the situation described by the judge in B687 can fairly be categorised as one in which members do expect that in future they will be able to retire early on favourable terms, through the application of the company’s policy, because they expect that in the ordinary course of events the policy will continue to be operated and the favourable discount factors will continue to be made available.  All that Holdings had done to engender this expectation was to adopt the policy, to continue to apply it, and to do so openly.  That is, of course, something within its control but so is a practice such as that to which the judge refers by way of example in the context of a mere expectation, namely discretionary increases.   </p>

Of course, a policy as to the discount factor to be applied on early retirement inherently affects benefits earned by past service, but it does so by allowing the member more by way of pension for that past service than he or she is strictly entitled to, by allowing the pension to come into payment early, but without discounting the amount of pension to the full extent appropriate to allow for the acceleration of payment.  A rule which allowed for that would be one thing (and certain C Plan members were entitled to the benefit of such a rule from age 60 by virtue of the rectification of the Trust Deed and Rules) but the case we are considering is one which depends on the exercise of an unfettered discretion by Holdings.  In our judgment what the judge said at B687 as to a Reasonable Expectation about the early retirement policy existing already in 2004 is not justified by his own definition of Reasonable Expectation at B386(iv).   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">In B687 the judge was considering the position in 2004, when Project Ocean was launched.  Project Ocean had no effect on early retirement as such.  However, as we have said, the judge did hold that a Reasonable Expectation as to early retirement policy arose from the Webcast and from Project Ocean on the basis that because the deficit attributable to all past service benefits provided by the DB Plans (including early retirement policy and practice) was to be guaranteed up to early 2014, therefore the reasonable member would be entitled to expect that those benefits would continue to be provided.  Nothing was said in the context of Project Soto that had any bearing on early retirement at all, so the position as regards expectation, reasonable or not, in respect of early retirement cannot have changed at that stage.  Accordingly, it seems to us that the judge’s finding as to a Reasonable Expectation relating to the early retirement policy is almost entirely based on what he said in paragraph 687 about there being a Reasonable Expectation already in 2004.  That, however, is not justified even on the judge’s own definition of Reasonable Expectation.  If there was no more than a mere expectation in 2004 on the continuance of the early retirement policy, it does not seem to us that anything said in relation to Project Ocean, the changes under which did not affect or relate to early retirement policy in any way, can have converted the mere expectation into a Reasonable Expectation as defined by the judge.  We therefore conclude that the Reasonable Expectation as to the early retirement policy was not made out on the judge’s own test. </p>

Project Soto, of course did affect future accrual, so the communications in relation to that are material.  We have already referred (at paragraph [110] above) to what the judge said at B886, about a reasonable member reading words including “long-term” in the last paragraph of Mr Lamb’s letter.  At B1052 the judge held that the reasonable member would have a Reasonable Expectation, after the Project Soto communications and changes, that DB accrual (as affected by Project Soto) would continue into the future, subject to being displaced by a change in circumstances.  In B1053 he went on to hold that, by virtue of the renewal of the message at the time of Project Soto in 2006, the Reasonable Expectation would last at least until April 2011.  That was (almost) sufficient for his purpose, since the Project Waltz changes were in this respect to take effect on 6 April 2011, so if the Reasonable Expectation was still subsisting then, he could say that Project Waltz was incompatible with the Reasonable Expectation. </p>

At R426 he went further and decided that the Reasonable Expectation as to future accrual covered the period up to 31 March 2014.  His reasoning in that paragraph explicitly ties the date to the duration of the other Reasonable Expectation as to the continuance of the old early retirement policy.  If, however, there was no proper basis for his finding of a Reasonable Expectation as to the early retirement policy, for the reasons we have given above, then this reasoning in turn is not soundly based.  Moreover, the date of 2014, which is derived solely from the Webcast, is the date when the funding guarantee comes to an end, but the judge had said that the guarantee was not a proper basis for any Reasonable Expectation.  He said so, for example, in B628, B646, B648-9, B710 and B878. </p>

He proceeds from the point where he says that the foreseeable future is a wholly uncertain period, which may not be more than three years, to the position of saying, in effect, that it is rather more than five years, and that it starts from 2006, the time of Project Soto, so as to run as far as, and some way beyond, 6 April 2011.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">The judge did refer to Holdings’ promise, under Project Ocean, to contribute £200 million each year for three years in order to reduce the deficit, as an indicator of the duration of Holdings’ commitment to keep the DB Plans open: see B669.  However the judge said that this would only justify an expectation of continued DB accrual for “at least” three years.  The RBs argued that that reference by the judge gave insufficient weight to the guarantee and to other statements about continuing support made in relation to Project Ocean.  Since Holdings was in any event liable to make up the deficit, which the latest actuarial valuation showed to be £900 million, it is not clear how the programme of deficit reduction could be seen as the basis for anything at all.  The RBs also relied on the fact that the deficit as so calculated presupposed the continuance of DB accrual and of the current early retirement policy, and built on that proposition the contention that members could therefore reasonably expect that the policy would indeed continue for the future.  The flaw in that argument is that an actuarial valuation is, of course and necessarily, based on assumptions as to what will be the case in a number of respects, some of which are within the employer’s control, such as pay policy and early retirement policy.  However, these are no more than assumptions, which will be reviewed every three years as successive actuarial valuations fall to be made.  They cannot properly be seen as a commitment by the employer not to change the basis of the assumptions, either within the three years for which, in effect, they apply or at any stage in the future.  They fall into the judge’s category of “mere” expectations, as explained at B386(iv), since they involve assumptions that things will carry on as they are in the ordinary course of events.  </p>

As we have said, expectations held by employees and other members of a pension scheme may be legitimate matters to be taken into account by a decision-maker, such as someone in the position of Holdings, when considering the exercise of a non-fiduciary discretionary power under a pension scheme, or in that of UKL acting as employer with a general discretionary power (express or implicit) under the contract of employment.

We think there is much to be said for IBM’s proposition that the standards ought to be equivalent to what is required for a contract or an estoppel.  We note the judge’s comparison at B533 between a case where there is a binding contract to keep a scheme open for DB accrual until a given date and a case where a Reasonable Expectation to the same effect has arisen from actions of the employer or Principal Employer.  There is a clear legal difference between those cases which has nothing to do with the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial</span> duty, since in the first case to act inconsistently would be a straightforward breach of contract and in the second it would not.

In other words, representations were made to them, which were intended to be relied on, and the recipients of the representations did act in reliance on them.  As regards acting in reliance, it is easy to understand the proposition in relation to Project Soto, where members had to decide between continuing with DB accrual, but on the basis that only two-thirds of future pay increases would be pensionable, or changing to the DC section for future accrual, on favourable terms.  However, the RBs do not contend that the communications in question satisfied the test for estoppel: the judge recorded that at B468.  (He also used an analogy with group estoppel at B475 to justify the approach of allowing the members of the group of members as a whole to found their case on communications from IBM on which they could rely as a group.)

If Holdings had given a commitment which met the standard of clarity and certainty of content which the judge envisaged there, then either it would satisfy the tests for contract or estoppel (if acted on) or it would at least be a highly material factor for the decision-maker to take into account.  It might be such that a decision not to fulfil the commitment would not satisfy the applicable rationality test (see paragraph [46] above), in which case there might be a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial</span> duty.  That is not this case, and it is interesting to note that the judge recognised that IBM was careful to make it clear that it was not giving a commitment to, or guarantee of, any particular course of action.  For example, the word “commitment” was used in the Webcast, for example, but only in two rather general passages: Holdings’ “continuing commitment to the Plans and their members” and its “commitment to underpin the sustainability of” the DB Plans in the UK.  We have already quoted the last paragraph of Mr Lamb’s letter to members in January 2006 in which he said in terms that IBM was not giving a commitment that there would be no further changes to pension benefits: paragraph [104] above. </p>

This, and his review of the communications generally, led him to make the finding at B1052 that there was a Reasonable Expectation as to future benefit accrual, subject to changes in financial and economic conditions, which he reiterated at B1510(i), quoted at paragraph [64] above, and clarified in the Remedies Judgment as explained at paragraph [65] above.

However, he also considered the Early Retirement Window in the alternative context of there being no relevant Reasonable Expectation, at B1526(xii) after the first sentence: see paragraph [214] above.  In this passage the judge seems to hold that to change the early retirement policy, by withdrawing the previous practice of allowing a favourable discount on early retirement, and to do so with effect before 2014, was “not consonant with” the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial</span> duty, and that the Early Retirement Window allowed was unreasonably short, and would have been a breach of duty even if there had been no relevant Reasonable Expectations.  </p>

At paragraph 21 he said, first, that there was no implied restriction on the exercise of the discretion to determine an early retirement policy to the effect that it can only be exercised upon giving some reasonable period of notice.  Accordingly, a change without notice could only be challenged as a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial</span> duty.

Moreover, Mr Tennet was not able to point to any communication relating to Project Ocean or Project Soto which could have been relevant for this more limited purpose, nor did the judge identify any.

Mr Stallworthy for the RBs defended the judge’s conclusion by saying that a member who knew of the policy (that is, the pre-Project Waltz policy) and had not been told that it had been changed, was entitled to proceed on the basis that it had not.  He accepted that a member who was told, before he or she opted for early retirement, that the new policy would be applied after 31 March 2014 would not be entitled to complain of the absence of any more general notice.   </p>

However, in reply Mr Simmonds showed us a benefit statement dated in 2011, which had been before the judge.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">At paragraph 1530 the judge said, of this point, “I do not need to rely on that point as supporting the conclusion that there has been a breach of duty and, in the light of IBM’s case on that, I do not do so”.  Mr Tennet criticised this sentence for its reference to IBM’s case.  It is not altogether clear to what the judge was referring by that phrase.  However, if the judge were right on his principal conclusions about the effect of the Reasonable Expectations, it would be difficult to find serious fault with his declining to decide this point as an additional factor in the RBs’ favour.  Conversely, if he was wrong on the main issues, as we have held, then it is impossible to see that this point on its own could justify a conclusion that Holdings was acting irrationally or perversely in these respects so as to give rise to a finding of breach of duty.  Accordingly, we reject the RBs’ contention on this issue. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">There is no doubt that IBM contended at trial that its actions were justified by its business case for Project Waltz.  IBM’s case was that there was a business case for the following reasons. Project Waltz was driven by CHQ’s need, in the light of the 2008 crisis, to make NPPC savings in order to meet its commitment to investors to improve earnings per share from $6.06 in 2006 to $10-11 in 2010 as set out in the 2010 EPS Roadmap (B1330(i)).  Further, CHQ’s need to make NPPC savings resulted in the imposition of PTI (profit before tax and interest) and NPPC targets at the local level including in the UK. Project Waltz was Holdings’ response to, among other things, the targets imposed by CHQ.  Meeting the targets set by CHQ assisted Holdings to obtain internal investment by CHQ in the various IBM business units in the UK with a result that larger amounts were available for employee reward programmes.  Holdings’ decision to implement Project Waltz in those circumstances was a rational decision that could not constitute a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial</span> duty.  </p>

The Project Waltz changes served to assist in meeting the objectives of this project.

I agree with Mr Simmonds’ analysis that the facts demonstrate that the commitment to the 2010 EPS Roadmap was an entirely rational reason for the Project Waltz changes: it made perfect sense on the financial data available to IBM, as the savings made from the pension changes flowed into reductions in the NPPC, which in turn assisted in achieving the ultimate EPS target….

I am wholly unconvinced that proposals could not have been developed which would have met those twin objectives; indeed, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that they could have been. In the first place, the necessary savings to meet the EPS target (in contrast with the savings in NPPC cost) did not need to come from DB Pension plans, let alone from the UK DB Plans.  If pension cost was an essential element, DC Plans could have been targeted: as the evidence (particularly from Mr Koppl) shows, that was an option and would have provided an easier solution.  Another option might have been to impose heavier burdens on other DB Plans in countries where members had no similar Reasonable Expectations or no remedies arising out of them <span style="font-style:italic">[relevant to Issues 22 and 25]</span>. </p>

The point is that they did not have a free hand; so that if they went beyond such freedom as they did have, the court can say that there has been a breach of duty.  I am guilty of some slightly truncated language there: IBM Corporation and CHQ did, of course, have a free hand in the sense that this court cannot control their actions; but they did not have a free hand in the sense (see paragraphs 1007<span style="font-style:italic">ff</span><span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>above) that their actions and decisions can have no impact on Holdings’ own position and whether it has acted in breach of its duties <span style="font-style:italic">[relevant to Issues 22 and 25]</span>. </p>

The ‘as employer’ approach explains why, on the positive side, the judge felt he had to consider whether there was any alternative course Holdings could have taken – for otherwise the ‘as employer’ approach would have been elevated into an absolute obligation  - and, on the negative side, why the judge did not consider whether, in response to the financial conditions in which the group found itself, IBM could not rationally seek to effect Project Waltz, even though (at B1111) he took the view that the adverse effects of the global financial crisis were among the causes of Project Waltz.  Indeed, IBM relied upon the unpredictable and unprecedented characteristics of the crisis as one of the causes (B1339, B1340). The judge accepted that IBM could rely on the crisis for this purpose (B1348)   Nonetheless, the question, as the judge saw it, was: </p>

In particular, at B1510 (i) he referred to significant changes in circumstances including trading and competitiveness.  That suggests that the judge was not necessarily limiting his focus to the position of the company (here UKL) as employer.  Moreover, in relation to the Reasonable Expectation of which he there spoke, the relevant entity was Holdings, not UKL.  He dealt with Holdings and the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial</span> duty in the same terms as for breach of the contractual duty, although Holdings was not an employer at all, so it would make no sense to limit the consideration to its position ‘as employer’.  It is, however, notable that, as regards UKL which was the employer, the judge (as we have already discussed) did not address substantively the issue of whether a relevant significant change had occurred.   </p>

As the judge held, it was the 2010 EPS Roadmap which was the principal driver for Project Waltz.  There is no real evidence that there was any risk of disinvestment.  IBM did not give evidence that it had seriously considered the possibility.  Any decision by UKL to approve Project Waltz lacked any reasonable cause.  That is why Mr Wilson had challenged Project Waltz as not justified by any change in UKL’s business.  The economic pressure placed on UKL by CHQ would not restore the breach of trust in confidence.   </p>

The court may then pierce the corporate veil for the purpose, and only for the purpose, of depriving the company or its controller of the advantage that they would otherwise have obtained by the company's separate legal personality. The principle is properly described as a limited one, because in almost every case where the test is satisfied, the facts will in practice disclose a legal relationship between the company and its controller which will make it unnecessary to pierce the corporate veil. Like Munby J in <span style="font-style:italic">Ben Hashem v Al Shayif </span>[2009] 1 FLR 115 , I consider that if it is not necessary to pierce the corporate veil, it is not appropriate to do so, because on that footing there is no public policy imperative which justifies that course. I therefore disagree with the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">VTB Capital v Nutritek</span> [2012] 2 Lloyd's Rep 313 who suggested otherwise at para 79. For all of these reasons, the principle has been recognised far more often than it has been applied. But the recognition of a small residual category of cases where the abuse of the corporate veil to evade or frustrate the law can be addressed only by disregarding the legal personality of the company is, I believe, consistent with authority and with longstanding principles of legal policy.  </p>

Mr Simmonds relied on this to show that no-one regarded pension costs in other countries as relevant at the trial.  Mr Tennet’s riposte was to show that there had been an order for the production of un-redacted copies of documents including this one, which showed, he submitted, that the information about pension costs in other countries was regarded as relevant.  To that, in reply Mr Simmonds accepted that such an order had been made, but pointed out that, despite the order, it was the redacted document that had been included in the agreed trial bundle, which showed what the parties regarded as relevant at the time of preparation for trial.  So, he argued, as matters proceeded before the judge there was no investigation of, and no intention to investigate, pension costs in other countries. </p>

Certainly, there were suggestions recorded in the judgment to that effect and, as one would expect, steps were taken to investigate other possibilities.  However, there was no pleaded case, nor was it put to IBM’s witnesses that this could have been done.  In those circumstances, it was not open to the judge to make a finding that there was an alternative and less onerous means of achieving Project Waltz.  The requirement that a material allegation be pleaded is not simply a technicality: it is a procedural guarantee that is there to ensure that the trial is fair.

IBM could also have been criticised if (counter-factually) it had given members assurances as to the future of the plans despite having already given potentially conflicting EPS ‘commitments’ to investors.  That does not mean that the judge was wrong to criticise IBM on the basis that he did.

However, in the circumstances of this case, we consider that the judge was fully justified in holding that this was a factor which could properly be taken into account.

The issue of volatility was addressed by CHQ in the sense of having been considered by them; but not even a partial solution was really provided.

It means that IBM provided information knowing it to be unfair or incomplete, even if it did not intend deliberately to mislead the plan members.  In fact, the judge draws a distinction between disingenuous statements and deliberately misleading statements, which is hard to follow.  Even, however, if there was a valid distinction to be drawn here, the criticism is still a grave one because to be disingenuous is to act in bad faith.  <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Submissions </span></p>

The type of bad faith necessary to constitute conduct disingenuous involves fraud, since it implies a deceptive practice for the purpose of gain. “Disingenuous” is not a word that is used lightly. It is well known that any allegation of fraud must be specifically pleaded.  That requirement is now found in paragraph 8.2 of the Practice Direction supplementing Civil Procedure Rule 16. The furthest the pleading goes is to allege that, as a result of Project Ocean and Project Soto the DB members were led to believe a number of matters to the knowledge of CHQ (para 179 of the Re-Amended Particulars of the “good faith claim”, that is, of breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial</span> duty).  This was insufficient to comply with the Civil Procedure Rules if an allegation of bad faith was being made in the context of engendering the Reasonable Expectations. It is also no answer that IBM knew that the RBs alleged that some IBM officers knew about certain matters not disclosed to IBM UK, for example, Mr Koppl’s opinion as to the sustainability of the proposals for restructuring the plans.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">In our judgment, <span style="font-style:italic">Henderson v Foxworth</span>, much relied on for the RBs, is not inconsistent with that conclusion, because, when read with care, it can be seen that the appeal involved a challenge to the findings of primary fact made by Lord Glennie, the Lord Ordinary, as trial judge.  The issue on appeal was indeed, therefore, whether his decision was “plainly wrong”.  The significant issue in the case was what was the true consideration for the transaction that was being challenged as having been at an undervalue.  That was not a matter of evaluation; it was a matter of finding the primary facts, to be decided on the evidence that the Lord Ordinary, as trial judge, had heard and which the Extra Division of the Court of Session, from whom the appeal was successfully brought, had not. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">With regard to Issue 32, which simply adds the element of “threat” (or as the RBs have it “threats or coercive conduct”) in telling employees that there would be no salary increases except on NPA terms, this draws on observations by the judge at B1521 and B1535(ii), but we do not see that that makes any real difference.  In our judgment, it was not a breach of the contractual duty for the employer to say that it did not intend to award pay increases in future except on a non-pensionable basis.  Absent the wider breaches of duty alleged by the RBs, arising out of the Reasonable Expectations, we cannot see that the firm terms in which the pay increases were to be offered constituted any breach of the relevant duty. </p>

In that case the judge rejected a contention that, when the BBC offered Mr Bradbury a pay increase on the basis that only as to 1% would it be pensionable, this was in breach of the contractual duty by reason that it involved applying improper coercion. </p>

It seems to us in reality that the breaches for which the RBs contended depended upon the success, or otherwise, of the overall attack on the Project.  Once that attack had failed, because the case on Reasonable Expectations failed, we do not consider that these separate attacks focussed on UKL’s contractual duty could succeed. </p>

Except to the extent that the RBs succeed on these issues, the result of these appeals is that the RBs have failed to establish liability on the part of IBM. Both issues are about the legal consequences of the process by which IBM UK consulted the members of the Plans in preparation for Project Waltz.  Each Issue has a distinct but related aim for the RBs.  By Issue 21 they seek to establish that the defects in the consultation, and IBM UK’s implementation of Project Waltz despite these defects, were breaches of both the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial</span> duty and the contractual duty such as vitiate Project Waltz entirely and render it voidable for breach of duty.  By Issue 38, as a fall back, they ask the court to prevent Project Waltz from being implemented until a further and proper consultation has taken place.  Success on either would preclude IBM from relying on the Project Waltz changes, though in different ways. </p>

This was not argued before the judge, as he noted at B1394, B1508 and B1537.

At the Breach Hearing, no real distinction was drawn between Holdings and UKL in relation to consultation.  The consultation which actually took place related to the various elements of Project Waltz some of which were to be implemented by Holdings and some by UKL.  It was a consultation not just by UKL but also by Holdings – at least, no relevant distinction was ever drawn by IBM UK during the course of the exercise any more than it was at the Breach Hearing.  Having decided to consult at all, it can be argued strongly that Holdings, as much as UKL, should have consulted properly and that the members should have some sort of remedy for its failure to do so. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Of course, the circumstances of cases differ widely.  It is evident that, in the present case, the formulation of the case for the RBs at trial had been prepared and addressed with elaborate care and preparation.  Mr Stallworthy contends that, since the consultation was in issue as such in the context of the allegations of breach of duty against both Holdings and UKL, it is not clear in what way the evidence adduced before the court would have differed if it had been made clear that a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial</span> duty was alleged against Holdings for pressing ahead with Project Waltz, as well as a breach of the contractual duty against UKL for the deficient consultation as such.  However, the burden is on the RBs to satisfy us that the trial could not have been conducted differently.  Moreover, the judge would have had to have addressed the point, and to have made findings about it, which he did not.  In those circumstances, given the very full and thorough way in which the case had been prepared and put at trial for the RBs, it does not seem to us that it would be right to allow them, as an afterthought, to widen their case now, by expanding the asserted consequences of the deficient consultation process, and therefore relying on it as an additional reason for setting aside the steps taken as part of Project Waltz.  We therefore find for IBM on Issue 21, both because permission to appeal was necessary in order to put it before the court, and because, even if such permission had been sought (which it was not) we would not have granted it because it involves raising a point which had not been relied on below and the circumstances are such that allowing that point to be taken would not, we consider, be a proper exercise of the court’s discretion. </p>

UKL was, however, in breach of its contractual duty, and both it and Holdings were in breach of their statutory duty under the Consultation Regulations, because of the manner in which they conducted the consultation.

Necessarily, such a consultation would have to be about new proposals.  It would make no sense to ask in 2017 (or later) for comments about proposals designed in 2009 to take effect between 2009 and 2011.  IBM would have to develop a new set of proposals.  IBM also points out that no attempt has been made to suggest in what respect, if any, Project Waltz as implemented would have been different if the consultation process had not been deficient in any of the respects identified by the judge.  Thus, as a consequence of UKL having broken the contractual duty by the defects in the consultation process, and both Holdings and UKL having broken their statutory duties, Holdings and UKL would be required to unwind the implementation of Project Waltz, a scheme which was in itself a proper and lawful exercise of the relevant powers, and start again to address what changes should now be proposed by way of changes of the relevant provisions of the Plans.  Members of the Plans would be put in a very different position from that in which they would have been either under Project Waltz or under other different proposals if they had been put forward in 2009.  They would certainly not be put back into the position they ought to have been in after a proper consultation in 2009 on the Project Waltz proposals. </p>

The employees could not, in the end, choose whether to be transferred or not, but claimed that if they had been given accurate information they would have put pressure on their employer to negotiate an improved position for them on pension provision and other matters.  In the end the judge held that the employer was not under any liability as alleged, but he discussed the question of quantum at paragraphs 338 to 347.  It is clear from that discussion that the position would have been difficult to measure, but the courts are familiar with such challenges.  It would be necessary for the RBs to advance a case as to what improvements would, on the balance of probability, have been made to the proposals, from their point of view, if IBM had acted properly in the conduct of the consultation, and to put before the court enough material on which to assess whether and if so to what extent beneficiaries would have been better off as a result.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">As for inequality of arms, it is clear that the RBs have not hitherto suffered from that in the conduct of the litigation.  We were told that the RBs’ litigation expenses have until now been met out of the funds of the Plans, and that their protection, as regards both costs incurred and any contingent liability for other parties’ costs, has been covered by protective costs orders.  (In practice, because the Plans are all in deficit, IBM has borne the burden of the RBs’ costs, because their payment out of the funds increases the deficit which IBM is liable to make good.)  We have not seen those orders, but we proceed on that basis, and on the basis that, to the extent that the litigation continues, for example as regards a damages claim for breach of the duty we are now discussing, the RBs will be able to seek and, subject to normal considerations as to merits and the like, might obtain continued protection by way of such an order.  We should make it clear that we make no assumption as to whether they could get such an order, and we also note that the RBs might not be appropriate as representative claimants in a claim for damages.  Whether or not such an order could be obtained, we do not consider that inequality of arms is a determinative point in favour of the RBs’ claim for injunctive relief. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">The principal reason for rejecting the claim for an injunction as a matter of discretion is that it would change the position of IBM and of the members of the Plans far too radically, by requiring Project Waltz (which on this basis is not legally objectionable in itself) to be unravelled and cancelled, and by putting IBM in the position of having to consider and formulate what would have to be entirely new proposals for the reform of the benefit provisions of the Plans, a long time after the relevant events, namely the consultation process in 2009, and in what are likely to be profoundly altered circumstances.  It would not be a case of consulting again, in a proper manner, on the original proposals.  It would not result in restoring the beneficiaries to the position they would have been in if a proper consultation had been carried out in 2009. </p>

The capital value of the pensions is given for ease of comparison; it uses the 1:20 factor recommended by the Government Actuary’s Department for use in calculating the value of a pension for Lifetime Allowance purposes.  The pension figures are taken from projections made for the Trustee in July 2010 by Towers Watson, the Scheme Actuary.  As noted under Case Two below, the post-Waltz projections in that case are too low. </p>
