	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.09in;text-indent:0.5in">The main appeal arises from the determination by Leggatt J of preliminary issues in relation to claims arising out of the detention of Serdar Mohammed (SM) by Her Majesty’s armed forces (HM armed forces) in 2010 in Afghanistan.  They were acting as part of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), a multinational force under NATO command that was deployed to assist the Afghan Government in the maintenance of security in Afghanistan and to fight the insurgency led by the Taliban and others. HM armed forces believed SM posed a threat to their safety and to the achievement of the ISAF mission. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.09in;text-indent:0.5in">The assumed premise for the determination of the preliminary issues was that SM was a commander in the Taliban who was later duly convicted in the Afghanistan courts and therefore posed a threat to the safety of HM forces and ISAF’s mission when detained.  On that assumption and given the arrangements made, the Secretary of State contended that SM was lawfully detained from 7 April 2010 (when he was captured) until 25 July 2010 (when he was handed over to the Afghan authorities). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.09in;text-indent:0.5in">However, it was contended by SM that under the arrangements under which HM armed forces operated in Afghanistan they were not authorised to detain him for more than 96 hours after his capture.  On the expiry of the period of 96 hours, the obligation of HM armed forces was to hand him over to the appropriate Afghan authorities or to release him. SM contends therefore that his detention from 10 April 2010 until 25 July 2010 was unlawful.  He claims damages for that period of detention.  </p>

We are, however, bound by the decision of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Smith v MoD</span> which applies the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Al-Skeini</span>.</p>

The public law and private law claims therefore lie in principle against the Secretary of State.  We have concluded that, whether brought as a public law claim or as a common law private law claim in tort, SM's claim succeeds because the Secretary of State is unable to show a lawful basis for the detention.  Our reasons for that conclusion on the assumed facts in relation to SM can be summarised as follows: </p>

International humanitarian law has not reached the stage where it confers a right to detain in a noninternational armed conflict as distinct from an international armed conflict: see paragraphs 164 to 253. </p>

It could be seen as acting as agent for the host State and therefore possibly authorised or outside the 96 hour rule.  Although the question as to whether there was authority to detain for this purpose was not expressly explored before the judge or before us, detention during this period was unlawful as the required procedural protections for detention were not met.   </p>

He contends that, as handing him over to the Afghan authorities subjected him to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or to the risk of an unfair trial, HM armed forces were in further breach of the ECHR by handing him over and not releasing him on the expiry of 96 hours.  On that basis, the second claim for damages encompasses the treatment he alleges he suffered at the hands of the Afghan authorities after his transfer to them on 25 July 2010.  The issues in relation to that second claim were not the subject of the hearing before the judge and do not directly arise on the appeal.  However, that second claim illustrates the real and substantial difficulties that faced HM armed forces as a result of the application of the ECHR to their mission in Afghanistan; as we have noted, we refer further to these difficulties at paragraphs 95 to 97. </p>

It is only necessary to refer to that section of his judgment ([179] to [226]).  As made clear by the judge at [179] of his judgment in that case, the defence of Crown or domestic act of state was relied on in answer to the claims that the claimants were unlawfully detained by HM armed forces before being transferred to the US and that the transfer to US custody was unlawful.  </p>

In the cases of Yunus Rahmatullah and the Iraqi civilian claimants the principles we identify on act of state in the appeal of SM (see paragraphs 358 to 361 below) apply.  However, because the facts in their cases have not been established, we are unable to determine whether or not a defence of act of state is available to the Secretary of State in their cases: see paragraphs 366 to 368.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.09in;text-indent:0.5in">The formulation by the United Kingdom of its own policy occurred at the time of a major redeployment of HM armed forces.  Around 3,500 troops from the United Kingdom arrived in Helmand province between January and July 2006.  This led to an increased likelihood of it becoming necessary for the United Kingdom to detain persons for reasons of force protection.  Prior to this the policy was to avoid detaining individuals where possible.  The security environment in Helmand province where the newly deployed forces were located led to a change in policy and to UK SOI J3-9. We describe how that policy developed at paragraph 153 below.  By the time of SM’s detention in 2010, the policy operated by the United Kingdom provided a mechanism for approving longer periods of detention than the ISAF policy, principally to try to obtain intelligence, before handover to the Afghan authorities.  We consider this detention policy and UK SOI J3-9 at paragraphs 68(i) (in relation to the attribution of SM’s detention to ISAF), 153 (authority to detain) and 258 to 268 (procedural safeguards). </p>

The United Nations Security Council by UNSCR 1244 of 10 June 1999 decided on the deployment in Kosovo under UN auspices of international civil and security presences and authorised Member States, inter alia, to establish the international security presence in Kosovo “with all necessary means to fulfil its responsibilities”.

It considered that the key question was whether the Security Council “retained ultimate authority and control so that operational command only was delegated” (at [133]).  In its view the following factors established that the Security Council retained such ultimate authority and control.  First, Chapter VII allowed the Security Council to delegate to Member States.  Secondly, the relevant power was a delegable power.  Thirdly, “that delegation was neither presumed nor implicit, but rather prior and explicit in the Resolution itself”.  Fourthly, the resolution put sufficiently defined limits on the delegation by fixing the mandate with adequate precision, as it set out the objectives to be attained, the roles and responsibilities accorded, as well as the means to be employed.  Fifthly, the leadership of the military presence was required by the resolution to report to the Security Council so as to allow the Security Council to exercise its overall authority and control (at [134]).   </p>

The Security Council retained ultimate authority and control over the security mission and it delegated to NATO both the power to establish and the operational command of the international presence KFOR.  NATO in turn fulfilled its command mission via a chain of command to the commander of KFOR.  The court accepted that troop contributing nations retained some authority over their troops, NATO’s command of operational matters was not intended to be exclusive.  The essential question was whether, despite such involvement by troop contributing nations, NATO’s operational command was effective.  The court was not persuaded that the involvement of the troop contributing nations, either actual or structural, was incompatible with the effectiveness of NATO’s operational command. </p>

By contrast, no such clear command structure existed in Iraq linking the Multi-National Force to the Security Council.  On the contrary, the unified command structure under which the Multi-National Force operated had been in place prior to the UNSCRs conferring the mandate on the MultiNational Force and was not changed as a result of those Resolutions.  In the case of Afghanistan, however, we consider that there did exist a chain of command from the Security Council to ISAF which justifies the conclusion that the actions of ISAF are attributable to the United Nations.

However, ISAF was established pursuant to UNSCR 1386 as a newly created force.  As explained by Mr Devine in evidence, the UK contribution to ISAF was distinct from its contribution to Operation Enduring Freedom.  Crucially, as I see it, ISAF had its own command structure.  Initially, the leadership of ISAF was provided by different nations on a rotating basis: first the UK, then Turkey, followed by Germany and the Netherlands jointly.  Subsequently, on 11 August 2003 NATO took command of ISAF at the request of the UN and the Government of Afghanistan.

As Leggatt J. pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic">Al-Saadoon v Secretary of State for Defence</span> [2015] EWHC 715 (Admin) at [106], it follows from <span style="font-style:italic">Al-Skeini</span> that whenever and wherever a State which is a contracting party to the ECHR purports to exercise legal authority or uses physical force abroad, it must do so in a way that does not violate ECHR rights.  Indeed in <span style="font-style:italic">Al-Saadoon</span> it was held (at [294]) that the ECHR applied when an individual was shot by HM armed forces in Iraq both because such shootings occurred in the course of security operations in which HM armed forces were exercising public powers that would normally be exercised by the Iraqi Government and because shooting someone involves the exercise of physical power over that person.  </p>

Particular questions will arise where HM armed forces act at the behest of the lawful government of the host State and where they are part of a multi-national force whose members include States which are not parties to the ECHR.  Moreover, as will appear from later sections of this judgment, the precise relationship between the ECHR and international humanitarian law in relation to extra-territorial military operations is a matter of great complexity and uncertainty (see paragraphs 116 to 124 and paragraph 210 below).  </p>

The Court of Appeal considered that although Canadian forces had command and control over their detention facility it was within a facility shared by Canada and several other States participating in ISAF.  The control of the detention facilities by the Canadian authorities could not be considered effective within the meaning of the Strasbourg court in <span style="font-style:italic">Bankovic</span>.  The Canadian forces were not an occupying force; they were there at the request of the Afghan governing authority which had not acquiesced in the extension of Canadian law over its nationals.  There was, moreover, evidence before the motions judge that the governments of Afghanistan and Canada had expressly identified international law, including international humanitarian law, as the law governing the treatment of detainees in Canadian custody, an issue to which we return at paragraph 190 below. </p>

It considered that since the central purpose of the Act was to provide a remedial structure in domestic law for the rights guaranteed by the ECHR it would not be offensive to the sovereignty of another State to make those remedies available in respect of extra-territorial acts.  In interpreting the rights under the ECHR in the Schedule to the Act, courts must take account of the territorial scope of the relevant right under the ECHR.  Accordingly, section 6 of the Act should be interpreted as applying not only when a public authority acts within the United Kingdom but also when it acts within its jurisdiction for the purposes of Article 1, ECHR, but outside the territory of the United Kingdom.  </p>

However, it considered that there were important differences of context and purpose between arrests carried out during peacetime and “the arrest of a combatant in the course of an armed conflict”.  It noted that it had not been the practice of States to derogate from their obligations under Article 5 in order to detain persons on the basis of the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions (Geneva III and Geneva IV) during international armed conflicts.  The provisions of those Conventions relating to internment were designed to protect captured combatants and civilians who posed a security threat.  The court noted that the ICJ had held that the protection offered by human rights conventions and that offered by international humanitarian law coexisted in situations of armed conflict and that the court must endeavour to interpret  and apply the ECHR in a manner which was consistent with this framework under international law. </p>

Nonetheless, and consistently with the case-law of the International Court of Justice, the Court considers that, even in situations of international armed conflict, the safeguards under the Convention continue to apply, albeit interpreted against the background of the provisions of international humanitarian law. By reason of the coexistence of the safeguards provided by international humanitarian law and by the Convention in time of armed conflict, the grounds of permitted deprivation of liberty set out in subparagraphs (a) to (f) of that provision should be accommodated, as far as possible, with the taking of prisoners of war and the detention of civilians who pose a risk to security under the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions.  The Court is mindful of the fact that internment in peacetime does not fall within the scheme of deprivation of liberty governed by Article 5 of the Convention without the exercise of the power of derogation under Article 15 (see paragraph 97 above). It can only be in cases of international armed conflict, where the taking of prisoners of war and the detention of civilians who pose a threat to security are accepted features of international humanitarian law, that Article 5 could be interpreted as permitting the exercise of such broad powers.</span></p>

As regards procedural safeguards, the Court considers that, in relation to detention taking place during an international armed conflict, Article 5 §§ 2 and 4 must also be interpreted in a manner which takes into account the context and the applicable rules of international humanitarian law. Articles 43 and 78 of the Fourth Geneva Convention provide that internment “shall be subject to periodical review, if possible every six months, by a competent body”. Whilst it might not be practicable, in the course of an international armed conflict, for the legality of detention to be determined by an independent “court” in the sense generally required by Article 5 § 4 …, nonetheless, if the Contracting State is to comply with its obligations under Article 5 § 4 in this context, the “competent body” should provide sufficient guarantees of impartiality and fair procedure to protect against arbitrariness. Moreover, the first review should take place shortly after the person is taken into detention, with subsequent reviews at frequent intervals, to ensure that any person who does not fall into one of the categories subject to internment under international humanitarian law is released without undue delay. While the applicant in addition relies on Article 5 § 3, the Court considers that this provision has no application in the present case since Tarek Hassan was not detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1(c) of Article 5.” </span>

There was no relevant case law and the point had never been litigated.  The judge was proceeding solely on the basis of the evidence relating to the Code and the Constitution.  It was said that it was self-evidently wrong that HM armed forces and the forces of other States contributing troops to ISAF had no greater powers of arrest than those of an Afghan citizen or the Afghan police.  It was obvious that those fighting an insurgency had to have significantly greater powers of detention and simply could not release onto the battlefield an insurgent whom they had captured.  It would be irrational for the law of a sovereign State so to provide.  As the conclusion was self-evidently wrong and irrational, the judge should not have acceded to the evidence called on behalf of SM without clear and incontrovertible evidence.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.09in;text-indent:0.5in">Although we see some force in the Secretary of State’s submission, the evidence before the judge was clear and compelling.  He was plainly entitled on that evidence to make the findings which he did.  There is nothing irrational or self-evidently wrong in the judge determining that obligations entered into under an agreement made by the Executive government do not have the force of domestic law within the State unless and until action is taken in accordance with the constitution to give effect to that agreement under domestic law. The same applies to obligations under UNSCRs. Moreover, a national of a sovereign State (as Afghanistan was at the material time and is) can ordinarily expect to be entitled to protection against detention by its own Executive government or the authorities employed by that government to maintain law and order, unless that government acts in accordance with law made under the constitution.  All the international agreements made with Afghanistan by other States relating to the provision of armed forces in Afghanistan, beginning with the Bonn agreement to which we have referred at paragraph 31 above and the UNSCRs (see the preamble to UNSCR 1890 of 2009 set out at paragraph 139 below), accepted the sovereignty of Afghanistan, that the responsibility for security was that of the authorities in Afghanistan and that the international forces were there to assist those authorities.  Looked at from this perspective, it is difficult to see how it can be irrational or unreasonable for the law of a State to provide that forces invited to assist the Executive government have no greater powers of detention than the Executive government and its own authorities responsible for law and order, unless legislation made under the constitution expressly otherwise provides.  There is no basis on which the decision of the judge can, in our view, be challenged. </p>

On its language, it authorised the use of lethal force to enable ISAF to fulfil its mission or mandate.  It is difficult to see why therefore it did not authorise detention as long as was necessary in all the circumstances to enable ISAF to fulfil its mission.  The question of whether the authority under the UNSCR was limited or qualified by a system of human rights law is a separate question.  The first question to be addressed is a question of interpretation of the UNSCRs.  The second question is whether there is any qualification to the authority given under the UNSCR by a system of international human rights law.  That is a separate question as that will depend on the terms of the particular system of human rights law (if any) which may be applicable to the armed forces of the particular State.  The issue of construction must apply to all operating under the UNSCR and cannot be influenced by the terms of a particular system of human rights law.

And in the majority of cases, the UK armed forces will operate in this manner.

In these circumstances the Government have concluded that Ministers should be able to authorise detention beyond 96 hours, in British detention facilities to which the ICRC has access.

The first and second are to consider whether international humanitarian law conferred power or authority on HM armed forces to detain him, and, if it did, on what grounds.  These questions are closely linked to the third stage of the analysis, the procedural safeguards required by international human rights law in order for detention to be lawful, whether under the ECHR or other systems of international human rights law or otherwise.  This is because it was accepted that the legality of such detention depends on identifying and meeting certain procedural safeguards.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.09in;text-indent:0.5in">The conflict in Afghanistan was clearly not a “traditional” non-international armed conflict.  The question is whether the typology of non-international armed conflicts which distinguished “traditional” non-international armed conflicts which were purely internal from those which were “internationalised” is purely descriptive or whether the identification of a non-international armed conflict as “internationalised” affects the legal rules governing it.  Are the treaty provisions dealing with non-international armed conflicts solely describing or prescribing minimum standards?  If so, no assistance can be derived from them in determining whether there is a legal basis or authority for detention.  If not, they may be of assistance in the identification of a legal basis.  A closely related question is whether, despite the absence of express provisions in the treaties conferring authority to detain in a non-international armed conflict, any assistance in identifying a rule of customary international law can be derived from the treaty provisions dealing with international armed conflicts.  Those provisions include the power in Articles 21 and 118 of Geneva III to intern prisoners of war, and in Article 42 of Geneva IV to detain civilians where “the security of the Detaining Power makes it [this] absolutely necessary”. </p>

The Secretary of State also pointed to the language of APII, Article 2(2) and Article 78 of Geneva IV.  His alternative case was that such a power was established on such grounds as a matter of customary international law.  Absent a power to detain, an individual captured during an armed engagement would have to be released in effect “back onto the battlefield”.  This was referred to as a “Catch-22” position.  It was also the Secretary of State’s case that there were procedural safeguards for noninternational armed conflicts in substance similar to the principles expressly provided for international armed conflicts in Geneva III and IV, which could be derived from the nature of international humanitarian law and customary international law, taking account of instruments of international human rights law.  </p>

The judge accepted that argument (see [243] to [244] and [251]) but also gave other reasons for his conclusion that Common Article 3 and APII did not confer a legal power to detain (see [242], [245] to [250]) which we discuss at paragraphs 200 to 219 below.  </p>

One of the reasons why the States subscribing to what became Common Article 3 and APII did not make provision for a power to detain in a non-international armed conflict was that to do so would have enabled insurgents to claim that the principles of equality, equivalence and reciprocity (which would be usual in international humanitarian law) meant that they would also be entitled to detain captured members of the government’s army.  </p>

Whether or not this is the case as a matter of logic, the fact is that, as seen in the ICRC’s commentary, concerns about reciprocity were an influential factor in the formation of the treaties.  This also provides an explanation for the decision not to include the Convention provisions authorising detention in Common Article 3 and APII, and of the terms of paragraph 4 of Common Article 3, which provides that it does not “affect the legal status of the parties to the conflict”.   </p>

In the judge’s words (at [245]), an entitlement conferred on insurgents to detain would have been anathema to most States which faced internal armed conflict on their territory and did not wish to confer legitimacy on rebels and insurgents.  States have traditionally regarded attempts to regulate internal armed conflicts as contrary to the principle of the preservation of State sovereignty and an intrusion into their domestic jurisdiction, in particular their criminal jurisdiction.

In chapter 15 on internal armed conflict, it is stated (at §15.5) that it is not easy to determine the exact content of customary international law applicable to noninternational armed conflicts, but (§15.30.3) that the treatment of detainees in a noninternational armed conflict is governed by the domestic law of the country concerned, any human rights treaties binding on that State in times of armed conflict, and the basic humanitarian principles of international humanitarian law mentioned in §15.30. </p>

The proliferation of “internationalised” non-international armed conflicts where not all the parties to the conflicts are sovereign States, has led some to state that, notwithstanding the categorisation of a conflict such as that in Afghanistan as a non-international armed conflict, the legal regime governing it differs from that in a purely internal armed conflict, a “traditional” non-international armed conflict.

But this is certainly not the case under international law as it stands at the present. Far from laying down a general prohibition that States may not extend the application of their laws and the jurisdiction of their courts to persons, property and acts outside their territory, it leaves them in this respect a wide measure of discretion which is only limited in certain cases by prohibitive rules; as regards other cases, every State remains free to adopt the principles which it regards as best and most suitable.” </span>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.09in">The first limb of the Secretary of State’s argument was that Common Article 3 and APII implicitly authorised detention in a non-international armed conflict, and were thus the source of the power to detain.  The Secretary of State relied on the express references in Common Article 3 to “detention” and in APII, Articles 2, 4(1), 5(1) and (2), and 6 to those “deprived of their liberty or whose liberty has been restricted for reasons related to the conflict” and to “detention” and “internment”.  He submitted that the premise of those references and the existence of rules in Common Article 3 and APII for the protection of those detained in a non-international armed conflict was that there was an inherent power to detain provided that was done in accordance with those rules.  His argument has the support of a number of commentators, some of whom were cited by the judge at [240].  </p>

One requirement of humanity is to give quarter rather than using lethal force. Rule 46 of <span style="font-style:italic">Customary International Humanitarian Law </span>(2005) states “ordering that no quarter will be given…is prohibited”.  The corollary of that position in the case of a person who is taking a direct part in hostilities and represents an imminent threat is to permit the detention of that person so as to render him or her <span style="font-style:italic">hors de combat</span>.  The Secretary of State submitted that was the only way of encouraging armed forces to take a lesser step than exercising lethal force and, in this way, to promote the humanitarian side of international humanitarian law.  He argued that it would be legally incoherent not to recognise a power to detain those posing an imperative security threat to whom quarter has been given in battle.

It is that “the very structure of [international humanitarian law] provides an answer to the outer boundaries of permissible state actions in [non-international armed conflicts]” and that “state actions which are permitted by [international humanitarian law] in international armed conflict are permitted by [international humanitarian law] in [non-international armed conflicts]” (<span style="font-style:italic">Just Security</span>,<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>5 February 2015). He states that this is not reasoning by analogy, but reasoning by structure, because States have accepted more exacting obligations under international humanitarian law in international armed conflicts than in non-international armed conflicts.  He argues (at (2009) 103 AJIL 48 at 50) that, since international humanitarian law is less restrictive in non-international armed conflicts than in international armed conflicts, “if states have authority to engage in particular practices in an international armed conflict (e.g., targeting direct participants in hostilities), they a fortiori possess the authority to undertake those practices in non-international conflict.”  </p>

He gave a similar reason (at [343]) for rejecting the argument that the requirement in Article 5(3) to bring a detainee promptly before a judicial officer should be regarded as inapplicable or interpreted sufficiently flexibly to accommodate the fact that the UK authorities had no power to bring SM before an Afghan court.  He stated that it was only if they chose to keep him in custody that Article 5(3) required him to be brought before a court and that they could comply with it by releasing him if he could not be transferred promptly.

A person may not pose an imminent threat while he is in fact detained.  Assume, however, that he will do so immediately on release and that he cannot be transferred safely or lawfully to Afghan control.  In this scenario if, as the judge held, he cannot lawfully be detained beyond 72 or 96 hours, he would have to be released.  As we have stated at paragraph 147, we consider that a person who is detained but who has to be released after such a short time should generally be regarded as posing an imminent threat, albeit one subject to a contingency.  </p>

These factors show an intention to reject the expansion of the law in the treaties governing international armed conflicts to all types of non-international armed conflicts.  </p>

The proposition also glosses over the fact that the safeguards in the Geneva Conventions do not apply and that the UK/Afghanistan Memorandum of Understanding (to which we have referred at paragraph 41 above), unlike, for example, the agreement between Canada and Afghanistan, does not provide for detainees to be treated as Prisoners of War.

They seek to find the scope of the power and the safeguards in other rules of international humanitarian law, including international human rights law.  There is, however, a certain artificiality in basing the authority to detain in a non-international armed conflict on Common Article 3 and APII, but basing its scope and the safeguards on a different legal source.  Finally, as the judge stated (at [244]), the purpose of Common Article 3 and APII is to protect individuals rather than to establish a legal framework: see the ICRC’s <span style="font-style:italic">Commentary on APII</span> (1987) at 1384 to 1386 and Debuf, <span style="font-style:italic">op. cit.</span> 467 and 468.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.09in;text-indent:0.5in">The Secretary of State’s argument about State practice proceeded as follows.  States involved in armed conflict, and particularly internationalised non-international armed conflicts do detain, and have done so for many years.  This is acknowledged in treaties concerning non-international armed conflicts: see the references to “detention” in Common Article 3 and APII, and to “internment” in APII. States have detained individuals in such circumstances without derogating from international human rights conventions such as the ECHR.  The Secretary of State relied heavily on <span style="font-style:italic">Hassan</span>, although (as we have discussed at paragraphs 121 to 124 above) that case was concerned with an international armed conflict not a non-international armed conflict.  While there may also be authority for detention in domestic law, he argued that did not detract from the fact that States detain in non-international armed conflicts as of right.  It is at this stage that the suggestion in Brownlie’s text (see paragraph 198 above) that, where practice is largely treaty-based, <span style="font-style:italic">opinio juris</span> may be sufficient to expand application of treaty norms as custom and that of Cassese (see paragraph 199 above) that the requirements may be less stringent in the case of the emergence of a customary rule of international humanitarian law, become relevant.  The Secretary of State relied on the statement by Thirlway in <span style="font-style:italic">The Sources of International Law</span> (2014) at 78 that “what is generally regarded as required is the existence of an <span style="font-style:italic">opinio </span>[<span style="font-style:italic">juris</span>] as to the law, that the law is, or is becoming, such as to require or authorise a given action” and that the phrase “<span style="font-style:italic">opinio juris</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">sive necessitatis</span>”, “in its entirety signifies that it is or may be sufficient if there is an <span style="font-style:italic">opinio </span>to the effect that the action (or refraining from it, as the case may be) is required as being, in some sense, necessary”.  </p>

The preamble (especially §§IV and VII) recognises the challenges of agreeing a precise description of the interaction between international humanitarian law and international human rights law and of handling detainees in non-international armed conflicts.  The Secretary of State relied in particular on §III of the Preamble, which states that the participants “recognised that detention is a necessary, lawful and legitimate means of achieving the objectives of international military operations”, a term which (see §IX) referred to non-international armed conflicts. Principles 12 and 13 envisage deprivation of liberty “for security reasons” and “on suspicion of having committed a criminal offence”.  The former are to have a “prompt initial review” and “the decision to detain reconsidered by an impartial and objective authority that is authorised to determine the lawfulness and appropriateness of detention”.  The latter are to be transferred to or have proceedings initiated against them by an appropriate authority “as soon as circumstances permit”.  Principle 7 requires persons detained to be promptly informed of the reasons for their detention, and Principle 9 provides that detaining authorities are responsible for providing detainees with adequate conditions of detention.  Principles 13 and 15 recognise the possibility that a transfer of a detainee may be delayed to protect the detainee from serious mistreatment.  </p>

Moreover, save for the case of the Netherlands, the practice relied on does not provide unequivocal support for an international humanitarian law basis for authority to detain in a non-international armed conflict.

It, however, appears to have been on the basis of US legislation such as the Authorisation of Military Force Act 2001 and the Military Commissions Act 2006 which provide for the extraterritoriality of its domestic legal structures.  Although Goodman ((2009) 103 AJIL 48 at 49) states that the international humanitarian law regime constitutes the legal background against which US detention policies have been enacted, he also states that the lawmakers and some courts “misconstrued and misappropriated” aspects of that regime.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.09in;text-indent:0.5in">A similar approach is taken by E. Crawford in <span style="font-style:italic">The Treatment of Combatants and Insurgents under the Law of Armed Conflict </span>(2010) to which we have referred at paragraphs 185 and 188 above.  She states (at pg 37) that, as well as the customary status of certain fundamental principles of international humanitarian law, “there is evidence of a general trend towards the application of the rules and principles regarding international armed conflict to non-international armed conflict”.  She also states (at pg 97 to 98) that the nature of modern armed conflict has essentially rendered the legal distinction between types of armed conflict irrelevant.  However, her examples (see pg 37 to 39) of State practice are of practice which supports the acceptance in particular situations of the international humanitarian law obligations that apply to an international armed conflict to a non-international armed conflict rather than practice supporting a general authority in a non-international armed conflict to take particular action.  The examples concerned establishing prisoner of war camps and allowing the ICRC to visit detainees in internal armed conflicts in Yemen and Nigeria in the early 1960s, and the limitation of military action to military objectives in the civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  Even this practice is equivocal because, as E. Crawford accepts, the statements made by the participants may have been made for policy rather than legal reasons, although she submits (at pg 39) that the fact that they were made at all is conducive to the “increased blurring of the laws of armed conflict, and demonstrative of an acceptance of the universality of the fundamental rules of [international humanitarian law]”.

The argument was that the principle of distinction means that States are authorised to target non-State actors participating in a non-international armed conflict: see ICRC, <span style="font-style:italic">Interpretative Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities under </span>IHR (2009) 12 and 73; <span style="font-style:italic">Customary International Humanitarian Law </span>(2005), Rule 1, which is stated to apply in a non-international armed conflict as well as an international armed conflict; Schmidt in Gill and Fleck (eds), <span style="font-style:italic">The Handbook of the International Law of Military Operations </span>(2010) 16.02; <span style="font-style:italic">Abella v Argentina</span>, 18 November 1997, Inter-American Commission of Human Rights, OEA/Ser.L.V. ii.95 Doc. 7 Rev at [177] to [179].  The balance required between military necessity and the requirements of humanity that underpin international humanitarian law meant that there was authority to detain in a non-international armed conflict.  The Secretary of State submitted that it would be very odd to say that there was no authority to do so when there was such authority in an international armed conflict.  The conclusion that there was such authority flows from the structure and nature of international humanitarian law, which is to temper the savagery of war with humanitarian concerns. </p>

It is significant that the rules identified are primarily prohibitive and the discussion as to how rules and principles concerning international armed conflicts might be extended to non-international armed conflicts focuses on extending what is prohibited in the former to the latter on the ground that “what is inhumane, and consequently proscribed, in international wars, cannot but be inhumane and inadmissible in civil strife”. </p>

It is, however, clear from the documents that Ministerial approval was given on 12 April 2010 in order “to gain further valuable intelligence” and subsequent reviews on 19 and 25 April 2010 respectively stated that, if SM was not detained, an opportunity to gain intelligence on a key Improvised Explosive Device facilitation network would be lost.  Those for 24 April and 18 June 2010 stated that his was a “weak case to hand to the NDS … [U]nless there is corroboration of his identity or a signed statement then the likelihood of prosecution will be limited”.  </p>

This, however, is a statement about the position in general and not about SM.<span style="font-weight:bold">  </span>What Mr Devine stated about SM was that initially he was held beyond 96 hours “for the purposes of intelligence exploitation” and that his continued detention was not assessed to be necessary “for force protection purposes”.   Moreover, as the judge stated at [333], the sole purpose for extending detention alleged in the Defence of the Secretary of State was interrogation with the aim of obtaining valuable intelligence and there was no other criterion set out in the UK policy guidance UK SOI J3-9 which Ministers could have used at that time to approve an extension of detention.  In the light of these matters, we do not consider that, on the evidence and material before him, the judge erred in his conclusion. </p>

He accepted (at [288] to [290]) that the <span style="font-style:italic">lex specialis</span> principle was a principle of interpretation so that the rights in international human rights law, for example in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights needed to be interpreted as far as possible in harmony with other principles of international law.  Accordingly, in principle, the question what amounted to an arbitrary arrest or detention would fall to be determined by the applicable <span style="font-style:italic">lex specialis</span>, namely the law applicable in a non-international armed conflict.  He considered it more difficult to do this in respect of Article 5 ECHR, which is much more specific than Article 9(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, because it prohibited detention “save in the following cases” which were then defined (in Article 5(1)(a)-(f)).  He stated that the specificity of Article 5 left little scope for <span style="font-style:italic">lex specialis</span> to operate as a principle of interpretation.  Moreover, his conclusion that, in a non-international armed conflict, international humanitarian law did not specify procedures to be followed, meant that there were no relevant rules of international humanitarian law with which to try to harmonise the interpretation of Article 5.  Understandably, he therefore did not go into detail as to what they might be.  The result was that he held that the requirements of Article 5 had to be satisfied and they were not.  </p>

This, it was said, was because, even if international humanitarian law in principle provided a legal basis for detention in an internationalised non-international armed conflict, it was not possible to determine the procedural rules of international humanitarian law which would apply and be capable of modifying Article 5 in the way that the treaty provisions in the Geneva Conventions governing an international armed conflict did.  Putting it another way, it was not possible to identify procedural rules of international humanitarian law which would render procedural breaches of Article 5 ECHR in a non-international armed conflict lawful.  This, it was submitted, was recognised by the ICRC which, in view of the paucity of international humanitarian law treaty and customary rules on procedural safeguards in noninternational armed conflicts, considered it was necessary to try and bridge the uncertainty by means of the institutional guidelines to which we have referred at paragraph 223 above. </p>

The first review should take place shortly after a person is taken into detention, and subsequent reviews should be at frequent intervals “to ensure that any person who does not fall into one of the categories subject to internment under [international humanitarian law] is released without undue delay”.  While it might not be practicable for the review of the legality of detention in the course of an international armed conflict to be determined by a court in the sense generally required by Article 5(4), the “competent body” should “provide sufficient guarantees of impartiality and fair procedures to protect against arbitrariness” (see [106]).  </p>

Article 9(2) does not expressly provide that a detainee is to be told the reason for his detention in a language he understands, and, whereas Article 9(4) provides that detainees shall be entitled to take proceedings before a court, in order that that court may decide “without delay” on the lawfulness of their detention, Article 5(4) ECHR uses the term “speedily”.  </p>

The court lacks the factual context required to reach a decision about the independence of the reviewing body.

The relationship of the Legal Adviser who was also a core member of the Detention Review Committee and those responsible for “tactical legal issues”, who it was stated should not be core members, was not explained.  We, however, note that the Legal and Political Advisers and the Force Provost Marshal provided advice to the Detention Authority as to whether to release, transfer or detain in the first 48 hours. The Force Provost Marshal was stated to be the subject-matter specialist for detention issues.  This does not sit easily with, and might even be thought to be contrary to the requirement that all members of the Committee should be able to present cases “cold” to the Detention Authority.  Moreover, the Detention Authority reported to military superiors, and MoD civil servants advised a government minister who made the decision about whether to authorise further detention.  For these reasons, we also doubt that the new regime was sufficiently independent, although our doubts are of a lesser order than those concerning the former Detention Authority regime. </p>

Decisions on detainees were said to be within “the sole discretion” of the Commander of Joint Task Force Afghanistan: see [2008] 4 FCR 546 at [56] and [62]. Mactavish J also stated (at [63]) that, in the exercise of the discretion to determine whether a detainee shall be retained in custody, transferred to the Afghan national security forces, or released, determinations are made on a case-by-case basis by the Canadian Commander of Task Force Afghanistan at “regular review meetings”.  The reviews were thus also by a non-judicial body and not outside the chain of command.  As the reviews were made by the Canadian Commander of Task Force Afghanistan and not by someone outside the direct chain of command, it is difficult to see how they complied with the third of the core procedural safeguards identified by the Secretary of State; periodical review “by an impartial and objective authority”. </p>

No one suggested that the detention was legal or justified under English law save by operation of the act of state doctrine.

The reason for the adoption of a detention policy going beyond the ISAF detention policy authorised by the UNSCRs was the need to interrogate those who were assessed to pose a “substantial and imminent threat to” HM armed forces who would otherwise have to be released or handed over to the Afghan authorities, who would then release them (see paragraph 153(i) and 153(iv) above). This policy was, however, not enacted or authorised in either primary or secondary legislation.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.09in;text-indent:0.5in">In his judgment in the main action, the judge (at [374] to [376]) identified the general principle underlying act of state as the constitutional principle that the conduct of foreign affairs is the province of the Executive arm of the State and that the judiciary should not involve itself in or bring into jeopardy the conduct of such affairs.  In this regard he noted that, although the decision of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for Civil Service</span> [1985] AC 374 established that the mere fact that a power derives from the prerogative does not exclude it from the scope of judicial review, the House of Lords accepted that the subject matter of certain powers made their exercise unsuitable for judicial review.  Lord Fraser (at pg 398) had referred, by way of example, to the prerogative powers concerned with control of the armed forces and with foreign policy.  In subsequent cases the courts had asserted a willingness in principle to review the exercise of prerogative powers even in these areas (e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">R (Bancoult) v Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs </span>[2009] 1 AC 453).  Nevertheless the courts had continued to exercise considerable restraint when invited to review Executive decisions involving matters of foreign policy.  In the judge’s view, however, such restraint no longer rests on a rule that certain areas of decision making by the Executive such as foreign policy are “no-go” areas for the courts but on a consideration of whether or to what extent the particular decision of the Executive with which the case is concerned is or is not justiciable.  </p>

Once it was accepted that the act in question was justiciable in the sense that it is cognisable and capable of being reviewed by the courts, the justiciability limb of act of state could not apply. In his view the question whether HM armed forces acted lawfully under Afghan law in detaining SM was plainly justiciable as it did not require determination of any matter which a court is unsuited to deal with.  </p>

But if and insofar as acts done in Afghanistan by agents of the UK state in carrying out its policy infringe Afghan domestic law, that in my opinion is a matter for which redress must be sought in the courts of Afghanistan. It is not the business of the English courts to enforce against the UK state rights of foreign nationals arising under Afghan law for acts done on the authority of the UK government abroad, where to do so would undercut the policy of the executive arm of the UK state in conducting foreign military operations.” </span>

Accordingly, act of state operates as an exception to the general principle that proceedings may be brought in this country founded on a tort which is actionable under the law of a foreign country where the law of that country is the applicable law.  The judge emphasised that this limb of act of state is narrow in its application.  It applies only to acts which are directly authorised or ratified by the UK Government.  It applies only to Executive acts done abroad pursuant to deliberate UK foreign policy and may well be confined to acts involving the use of military force.  It was, he said, unnecessary for him to decide if it could be relied on by a British citizen although he found it difficult to see how the nationality of the claimant could in principle be relevant.  Furthermore, he considered (at [401]) that the availability of a defence under this limb of act of state does not depend on whether the UK Government was or was not purporting to comply with Afghan law in operating its detention policy.

Furthermore, most tort claims could be characterised as involving an infringement of human rights and he could not see a coherent basis for allowing some such claims to be enforced and not others.  It was far from clear that the present claim could be described as a grave or gross violation of human rights.

Secondly (at [210] to [215]) he rejected a submission that even if a second limb of act of state as a defence to a claim in tort had once existed, it had been extinguished by the Crown Proceedings Act 1947.  Thirdly (at [216] to [222]) he rejected a submission that an act of state defence to a claim in tort was incompatible with the right of access to a court conferred by Article 6 ECHR.

In <span style="font-style:italic">Nissan</span> British troops, operating in Cyprus as part of a truce force under an agreement between the United Kingdom and Cyprus, took possession of the plaintiff’s hotel near Nicosia for use as headquarters of the British command. Subsequently HM armed forces became part of a UN peace-keeping force. The plaintiff began an action in the High Court claiming declarations against the Crown that he was entitled to compensation for the occupation and alleged damage to the hotel and its contents.  The House of Lords unanimously rejected a plea of act of state which, it appears, was advanced by the Crown on the basis of the justiciability limb (see Lord Wilberforce at pg 231F-G).  Lord Reid decided the case on the basis that act of state could not be successfully raised against a British subject.  The other members of the appellate committee left open that question but held that the conduct in question did not constitute an act of state.  They considered that while the making of the treaty between the United Kingdom and Cyprus was an act of state and some acts done pursuant to the treaty might be acts of state, the occupation of the hotel and conduct which was alleged to have caused damage were not sufficiently closely connected with the treaty to constitute acts of state (Lord Morris at pg 216E to 217D, 218F-G; Lord Pearce pg 227A-C; Lord Wilberforce pg 235F to 236A; Lord Pearson pg 239G to 240D). </p>

They identified a number of rules of English law which may result in an English court being unable to decide a disputed issue on its merits including State immunity and the act of state doctrine. They described the latter as conferring immunity from liability on certain persons in respect of certain acts. It is not clear whether this reference is to domestic act of state, foreign act of state or to both.  However, they considered that the term “non-justiciability” refers to something different, namely a case where an issue is said to be inherently unsuitable for judicial determination by reason only of its subject matter.  Such cases, they considered, generally fall into one of two categories.  The first comprises cases where the issue in question is beyond the constitutional competence assigned to the courts under our conception of the separation of powers.  They observed that cases in this category are rare for they may result in a denial of justice which could only exceptionally be justified either at common law or under Article 6 ECHR.  Certain transactions of foreign States and proceedings in Parliament were identified as the paradigm cases.  “The distinctive feature of all these cases is that once the forbidden area is identified, the court may not adjudicate on the matters within it, even if it is necessary to do so in order to decide some other issue which is itself unquestionably justiciable.”  The second category comprises claims or defences which are based neither on private legal rights or obligations, nor on reviewable matters of public law. However, the court will adjudicate “if a justiciable legitimate expectation or an ECHR right depends on it” or “if a private law liability was asserted which depended on such a matter”. </p>

At first instance ([2009] EWHC 397 (QB)) Underhill J (at [74]) approached the matter on the basis that he was concerned with the non-justiciability limb of act of state.  He took as his starting point the position that the decision to contribute British forces to the multi-national force was plainly an act of state, as it was quintessentially a policy decision in the field of foreign affairs. Following the approach of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Nissan</span>, he then considered whether the claimant’s detention had a sufficiently close link to that act.  He considered that internment was a specific part of the task which the multi-national force was invited by the Government of Iraq and mandated by the Security Council to undertake.  In his view, therefore, the detention was done in performance of the original decision to contribute forces.  He observed that although the act of state rule might apply even in the absence of such an obligation, its justification was clearer where an obligation to detain existed. </p>

Arden LJ, dissenting, agreed with the conclusions and reasoning of Underhill J on this point (at [107] to [110]).  However, this conclusion rested on and was carefully limited to the overriding force of UNSCR 1546.  In her view the United Kingdom was entitled and bound, under Article 103 of the UN Charter, to intern persons where this was necessary for the internal security of Iraq and internment for this purpose would, therefore, clearly qualify as an act of state.  There could be no challenge to a review of detention carried out under those powers in any manner permitted by Geneva IV or to the legality of a decision to detain made in exercise of the powers conferred by the UNSCR.  Elias LJ, while noting that this complex issue had not been fully argued and while doubting whether it was legitimate for the Secretary of State to rely on act of state when it had not been raised in the earlier proceedings, expressed the view (at [195]) that the detention was </p>

There is here no requirement to adjudicate on questions of policy in the absence of “judicial or manageable standards” suitable for application by the courts. There is nothing constitutionally inappropriate in a court in this jurisdiction applying the local law to determine the lawfulness of the claimants’ detention.  Indeed, in section 11 of the 1995 Act, Parliament enacted that as the “general rule”. The court will not be required to rule on the legality or otherwise of high level policy decisions such as whether to participate in the multi-national force, issues from which the complaints made in these proceedings are remote.  On the contrary, the court is well equipped to deal with such issues, albeit arising under the law of a foreign State.  As the judge observed, determining whether an individual has been unlawfully deprived of his liberty is quintessentially a matter for a court.  In our view, precisely the same reasoning applies to the claims relating to the delivery of the claimants to the Afghan authorities. </p>

In our view, whether issues are justiciable cannot depend on the nature of the proceedings.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.09in;text-indent:0.5in">In his judgment in the main action, the judge (at [371]) distinguished the observations of Underhill J, Arden and Elias LJJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Al-Jedda</span> on the ground that it was integral to their reasoning that such internment, where necessary for imperative reasons of security, was a positive obligation undertaken by the United Kingdom under international law when it agreed to contribute British forces to the multi-national force in Iraq.  In his judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Rahmatullah</span>, however, the judge returned to this issue and on further consideration questioned whether the opinion that the claim in <span style="font-style:italic">Al-Jedda</span> was barred by the doctrine of act of state might not be better explained on the basis of the other limb which provides a defence to a claim in tort (at [194] to [197]). He questioned why, on the assumption that the policy decision to contribute British forces to the multi-national force in Iraq was not justiciable, it should follow that a decision taken by British forces participating in the multi-national force to intern a particular individual was not justiciable. In his view, the characterisation of the decision to intern Mr Al-Jedda as a non-justiciable act of state was evidently driven by the view that the United Kingdom was under a positive obligation imposed by UNSCR 1546 to intern people who were believed to be a threat to security.  However, such an approach was hard to reconcile with the principle that obligations undertaken by the United Kingdom under treaties have no domestic legal effect except in so far as they are enacted by the legislature into domestic law. </p>

In October 1840 Commander Denman, an officer in the Royal Navy on the Sierra Leone station, received a request from the Governor of Sierra Leone requesting him to take measures for the liberation of Fry Norman and her daughter, both British subjects, who were detained as slaves at the Gallinas by Prince Manna, the son of King Siacca, the sovereign of that country.  He entered the Gallinas River with an armed force, liberated some slaves held by Spaniards and took possession of the barracoons belonging to the plaintiff, a Spanish national.  At Commander Denman’s request Fry Norman and her daughter were delivered up to him.  He then concluded a treaty with Prince Manna, acting on behalf of King Siacca and the chiefs of the country for the abolition of the slave trade there.  The report states that “[o]n the 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> November, the defendant, in the execution of this treaty, commenced burning the plaintiff’s barracoons” (1848) 2 Ex. 167 at 176.  The plaintiff’s barracoons were destroyed.  The slave dealers deserted the factories and let loose the slaves, great numbers of whom were subsequently carried by the defendant to Sierra Leone where they were emancipated.  The goods stored were claimed by King Siacca as forfeit to him by reason of defiance of his law.  Commander Denman “continued to fire the barracoons” (1848) 2 Ex. 167 at 176.  He then sailed to Sierra Leone, having liberated 841 slaves.  The plaintiff brought proceedings in trespass in England against Commander Denman.  When notified of these proceedings the Admiralty and the Secretaries of State for the foreign and colonial departments adopted and ratified the acts of Commander Denman.  In his direction to the jury, Parke B. concentrated on the effect of the ratification of the conduct of Commander Denman, directing them that the ratification was equivalent to a prior command and rendered it an act of state for which the Crown was alone responsible.  No explanation was provided as to why the conduct would be regarded as an act of state.   </p>

In particular, the defendant’s conduct was, following ratification, to be regarded as sovereign conduct at the international level in implementation of a treaty.

The defence can be raised in regard to an act performed outside the United Kingdom and its colonies against the person or property of an alien and is also available in regard to the deportation or internment of an alien of enemy nationality. The defence is probably not available in regard to acts affecting the property in the United Kingdom of a non-resident alien. It is an open question whether the defence can apply to acts performed outside the United Kingdom and its colonies against the person or property of a British citizen.

The 1947 Act reverses the rule as regards the liability of the Crown as principal. If the Crown is still to be allowed the option of pleading act of state in relation to its acts abroad, it would be a very curious – indeed circular – means of achieving this by means of a proviso focusing on the effect of the plea on the liability of the agent.

Act of state, unlike the general immunity in tort, is not available in respect of an act done within British territory (<span style="font-style:italic">Walker v</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Baird</span> [1892] AC 491; <span style="font-style:italic">Johnstone v Pedlar</span> [1921] 2 AC 262).  Furthermore, in an ordinary case of Crown immunity an agent of the Crown who committed a tort could still be sued personally, whereas act of state protects both the Crown and its agent (<span style="font-style:italic">Buron v Denman</span>). </p>

It is a procedural rule of the <span style="font-style:italic">lex fori</span> which confers an immunity from suit.  It is reflected in section 14(3)(a) of the 1995 Act. Notwithstanding the fact that the subject matter may be justiciable, there will be circumstances in which it will be essential that our courts should have a residual power to bar claims founded on foreign law on grounds of public policy.  Thus, for example, if <span style="font-style:italic">Buron v Denman</span> fell for decision today, the claim for compensation for loss of the claimant’s slaves and damage to his slaving activities would unhesitatingly be rejected, if on no other ground, on the basis that property rights in slaves arising in foreign law should not be recognised and that to afford such a remedy in such circumstances would be offensive to the public policy of this country.  However, we would expect that, in circumstances in which the claim is justiciable, such a bar on grounds of act of state would be infrequently applied, and the absence of decided cases supports this view. </p>

The continuing importance of the common law, which continues to develop in parallel to the system of ECHR rights introduced by the Human Rights Act 1998, has been recognised since soon after that statute came into force: see, for example, the approach in<span style="font-style:italic"> McCartan Turkington Green v Times Newspapers</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Ltd.</span> [2001] 2 AC 277 at 297 and <span style="font-style:italic">R v Shayler</span> [2003] 1 AC 247 at [21], and see the clear recent statements by Lord Toulson and Lord Mance in <span style="font-style:italic">Kennedy v Charity Commission</span> [2015] AC 455, at [133] and [46]. </p>

Furthermore, the judge held - and it has not been challenged on this appeal, rightly in our view - that Parliament by enacting the Human Rights Act 1998 requires the adjudication of justiciable claims under the ECHR, notwithstanding that they arise out of the conduct of foreign relations.  </p>

The Secretary of State did not assert that claims for torture by HM armed forces brought by foreign nationals would be barred by the defence of act of state.  This, he submitted, is because such an act would not be authorised conduct or it would not properly be considered a Crown act or it would amount to a grave violation of rights.  The act of state defence is sufficiently flexible to allow the court to strike a balance as to when it should apply.

In the case of SM there are two public interests which clash.  The first is the public interest that harm shall not be done to the nation by precluding HM armed forces from detaining a commander in the Taliban for more than 96 hours because it appeared that questioning him would provide significant new intelligence vital for force protection purposes.  The second is the public interest in allowing SM access to the courts in circumstances where it appeared that there was no legal basis for his detention under any of the possible applicable legal systems. </p>

In the particular circumstances of SM’s case, there was no authority to detain either under the legal regime established by the United Nations or under the law of Afghanistan or under UK legislation.

However, he concluded that provided that this is demonstrated, the claims to recover damages in tort based on the contention that their detention by British forces was unlawful under the law of Iraq will be barred by the act of state doctrine.

The existence of such an obligation would, at the very least, be support for the view that the court is here concerned with policy in the conduct of foreign relations.  Moreover, this would, in our view, be a highly relevant consideration, notwithstanding that the relevant obligations in international law have not been given effect in domestic law within the United Kingdom.

The effect of act of state is, of course, to deny such access in the cases where it applies and, as a result, Article 6 ECHR is engaged.  The Strasbourg case law recognises that the right is not absolute but is subject to limitations.  Contracting States enjoy a margin of appreciation in this regard.  However, national courts must be satisfied that the limitations applied do not restrict or reduce the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired.  Moreover, a limitation will not be compatible with Article 6(1) if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is no reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved.

Even if this were to be considered a legitimate objective, the means proposed are not suitable for its achievement.  Secondly, to the extent that it is said that claims in tort are required to be barred to prevent the obstruction by the judiciary of the conduct of foreign relations or its implementation, we do not accept that such an objective requires the courts to decline to entertain all private law claims founded on an Executive act done abroad pursuant to deliberate UK policy. </p>

There may therefore be dangers in reasoning by analogy from one to the other.  If, however, we are correct in our conclusion that the limb of act of state which operates as a defence to claims in tort is essentially a principle of public policy, we have difficulty in seeing how it could be successfully invoked if the conduct in issue constituted a grave breach of international law or human rights law.
