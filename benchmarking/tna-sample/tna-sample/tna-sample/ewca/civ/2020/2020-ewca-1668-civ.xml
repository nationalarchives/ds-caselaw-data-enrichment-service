	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">These appeals follow nine years of litigation, involving three trials and several very substantial interlocutory applications. Global Energy Horizons Corporation (‘GEHC’) issued proceedings in December 2010, claiming that the Appellant, Robert Gray, had, in breach of his fiduciary duties, received profits and benefits for which he was accountable to it. Following a 12-day trial on liability, Vos J held that Mr Gray owed fiduciary duties to GEHC and that he had placed himself in a position of conflict between his duties to GEHC and his personal interests, such that he was accountable for profits and benefits that he had already received and might receive in the future. There has been no appeal against the order of Vos J. He directed Mr Gray to give an account, pursuant to which Mr Gray swore three affidavits in which he denied the receipt of any profits or benefits. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">GEHC challenged Mr Gray’s account, which was the subject of a 21-day trial before Asplin J in 2015. Mr Gray was ordered to account for sums amounting to US$3 million and to some £1.67 million<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>and for interests in businesses exploiting technology for use in the oil industry in the Russian Federation and in the rest of the world. She was unable on the evidence before her to determine the value of those interests and she directed a further hearing for that purpose. A 5-day valuation hearing took place before Arnold J in 2019. Arnold J found that these interests had no value. GEHC does not appeal against that finding. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The hearing of the appeals before us took six full days. The great majority of the issues arose on Mr Gray’s appeal against Asplin J’s order, for which permission was granted by Arnold J. The issues included extensive challenges to the judge’s findings of fact and involved applications by Mr Gray to adduce new evidence. GEHC appealed against some parts of Arnold J’s order.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">These proceedings arise out of a project between two former friends and business partners, Brian de Clare and Mr Gray.  GEHC was set up by Mr de Clare in order to exploit what he saw as a promising business venture, based on a new ultrasound technology which was said to increase oil production from depleting oil wells reaching the end of their life.  Mr Gray joined the team at GEHC in 2004 and he and Mr de Clare worked together for a time, agreeing that they would benefit equally from any income generated by the business.  They worked in particular on trying to get access to the relevant technology which was held by a company called Klamath Falls Inc (‘Klamath Falls’) and on seeking funding to invest in testing the technology with the aim ultimately of setting up a special purpose vehicle (‘SPV’) to acquire late life oil wells and using the technology to improve their production rates.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In December 2005 Mr Gray, a former banker specialising in oil and gas assets, was invited by Pieter Heerema, a billionaire entrepreneur, to take on the management of a substantial fund to invest in upstream oil and gas opportunities. Mr Heerema owns the Heerema group, whose business includes the fabrication, transportation and installation of offshore oil and gas production facilities. The companies through which the Heerema group became involved in ultrasound technology investments mostly included the word “RegEnersys” in their name. There were a number of RegEnersys entities and for some purposes it is important to distinguish one RegEnersys company from the other.  Where it is significant, we refer to the specific entity, but otherwise just to ‘RegEnersys’.  </p>

When the interests in Petrosound were distributed in 2013, GEHC did not receive an interest in any aspect of the business and was not entitled to any share in revenues generated by the technology going forward.  Instead, GEHC claimed, Mr Gray wrongly exploited the opportunity on behalf of Mr Heerema and himself and took an indirect share personally in the vehicles set up to exploit the technology.   </p>

Mr Gray contested every element of the claim. He denied that he had ever owed fiduciary duties to GEHC.  If he had owed any such duties, he denied that he had acted in breach of them. Alternatively, he contended that in some respects GEHC had known about his work for Mr Heerema and had consented to that work. He also denied that he had obtained any benefit from the exploitation of the opportunities for which he was liable to account to GEHC.  He said that the Klamath Falls technology, even combined with the work of the Russian Scientists, had proved unsuccessful in the field.  Far from making any money from it, both he and the RegEnersys fund had suffered substantial financial losses and had nothing to show for their investment of time and money.  </p>

Broadly, he contends that Asplin J was wrong to include the management fees and the Klamath Falls settlement money within the scope of the account either because they were not, he submits, sufficiently connected to his breaches of duty or because they were assets deriving from Mr Gray’s acquisition of shares in Klamath Falls to which GEHC had given its informed consent.  In the alternative with regard to those assets, Mr Gray criticises the way that the amount for which he was liable to account was calculated, including Asplin J’s refusal to grant him an equitable allowance for his work on the project over the years.  As regards the Business Assets, Mr Gray mounts a challenge to the factual findings made by Asplin J which led her to reject his contention that he did not hold any such interests.  He relies on documents that were included in the VIYM disclosure but which were not before the court at the Enquiry Hearing and which he says show that her factual findings cannot be sustained.  He asserts in the alternative that even if we are not satisfied that Asplin J’s findings of fact were wrong, there were such serious procedural irregularities in the way that the case was conducted before Asplin J, and in the decision Asplin J took to hive off the valuation exercise to a later hearing, that we should set aside her orders.  </p>

Mr Gray acquired 31.33% of the shares in GEHC in return for his investment of $260,000 and he entered into a shareholders’ agreement with the other shareholders: [Vos/86 and 298].  Secondly, Mr Zolezzi said that he wanted to raise $20 million by selling some of his shares in Klamath Falls. He appointed GEHC to act for him in finding a buyer and negotiating the terms of that sale. Thirdly and perhaps most significantly, Mr Heerema invited Mr Gray to manage the RegEnersys fund, in which Mr Heerema expected to invest some $500 million to hold energy-related private equity investments. </p>

In January 2006, Mr Gray met Mr Heerema in the Netherlands and gave him a presentation about the Acquisition Strategy.

Mr Gray provided his services to the fund through his own service entity called ReVysion LP (‘ReVysion’).  On 17 March 2006, Mr Pronk sent Mr Gray an email setting out his remuneration proposal with which Mr Gray agreed (‘the 17 March 2006 email’).  The email referred to Mr Gray receiving 20% of the ordinary shares of the fund and mentioned a 2% management fee.  The 17 March 2006 email also referred to the discussions between Mr Gray and Mr Pronk as to how the interests in the SPV to carry forward the Acquisition Strategy would be shared between the Heerema group, the oil exploration company and GEHC.  Initial discussions referred to GEHC receiving a ‘carried interest’ of 20% and the oil company and Heerema receiving 40% each in return for providing the funding on a 50:50 basis.  The parties understood the reference to a ‘carried interest’ as being an interest in the equity that was given to a partner who did not invest with money but who gave advice or provided other services, the percentage interest remaining constant even if more equity was issued by the company in future.  Discussions continued during mid 2006 with the sticking points being the cooperation of Mr Hurtado and the ability of Mr Zolezzi to procure a technology licence to be granted by Klamath Falls to the Acquisition Strategy SPV.  Mr de Clare was also becoming concerned that GEHC was putting in a great deal of work on the project without having any firm agreement as to its future stake in the Acquisition Strategy SPV.  He worried that once all the building blocks were in place, GEHC might have outlived its usefulness and be shut out of the deal by the other partners it had brought to the table.  Mr de Clare was relying on Mr Gray to protect and advance GEHC’s interest.  </p>

First, looking at all the circumstances from December 2005 when Mr Gray’s involvement with Mr de Clare and GEHC started until December 2005 when Mr Gray agreed to manage the RegEnersys fund, Vos J held that GEHC was reasonably entitled to expect that Mr Gray would not use his position in a way that was adverse to its interests: [Vos/440].  </p>

There was undoubtedly a potential conflict between Mr Heerema’s interests and GEHC’s interests as soon as Mr Heerema came on the scene, whether or not this was immediately recognised by the protagonists. Vos J had no doubt that, despite Mr Gray’s revelation to Mr de Clare that he would in the future act for Mr Heerema in relation to his fund, Mr Gray continued to act for GEHC when he introduced Mr Heerema to GEHC in relation to the Acquisition Strategy: [Vos/459].  He held further that by this stage Mr Gray had an <span style="font-style:italic">actual</span> conflict of interest because of the opposing interests of his two principals. It was in Mr Heerema’s interests for Mr Gray to negotiate for the RegEnersys fund to receive the maximum share in an eventual acquisition vehicle. That was in conflict with GEHC’s interests in maximising its carried interest in that same vehicle.  This was the case by the end of the initial January 2006 meetings once Mr Heerema had expressed serious interest in making an investment.  However, by this stage there was no actual conflict between Mr Gray’s <span style="font-style:italic">personal</span> interests and those of GEHC since his method of remuneration had not yet been determined.  </p>

Mr de Clare said that he never understood that Mr Gray was acting against GEHC's interests in relation to the Acquisition Strategy or the grant of a licence for the technology - he always understood Mr Gray still to be promoting GEHC's carried interest in the acquisition vehicle.

The fund was set up in February 2007 as a limited partnership called RegEnersys LP in which Mr Gray took a 20% share.  The way the fund worked going forward was that RegEnersys LP had a number of wholly-owned subsidiaries, each of which was an SPV formed to exploit one particular investment which the fund decided to make.  The investment in ultrasound technology was carried out through a wholly-owned subsidiary of RegEnersys LP which was called RegEnersys Investment I Limited (‘RegEnersys I’). </p>

As a result of the 6 June 2007 transactions, RegEnersys Inc acquired from Mr Zolezzi a 10% shareholding in Klamath Falls and entered into the non-exclusive Licence Agreement and the Cooperation Agreement.  Shortly after, on 3 August 2007, RegEnersys Inc assigned the benefit of the Licence Agreement and the Cooperation Agreement to RegEnersys I but continued to hold the 10% shareholding in Klamath Falls itself.  In February 2011 RegEnersys Inc changed its name to Celloteck Holding Inc but we shall anticipate that change and refer to it generally from here on as ‘Celloteck’ in order to distinguish it from RegEnersys I where necessary.  It is important to keep in mind that Celloteck was the entity which loaned the money to the fund and which took an 80% interest in the project and held shares in Klamath Falls and that RegEnersys I was the entity, wholly owned by the RegEnersys fund, that was organising the exploitation of the ultrasound technology and was the party to the Cooperation Agreement and Licence Agreement with Klamath Falls.  </p>

Broadly, RegEnersys LP was replaced by RegEnersys (UK) LP as the owner of RegEnersys I. As a result of the changes to Mr Gray’s remuneration package, his interest increased from the 20% he had held in RegEnersys LP to a 51% share in RegEnersys (UK) LP. Celloteck’s interest was correspondingly reduced from the 80% share it had held in RegEnersys LP to a 49% share in RegEnersys (UK) LP.  </p>

Mr Gray also decided to send some of his own personal funds to the Russian Scientists to help pay their overheads and to finance programmes testing the technology. In March 2010 Mr Gray met the Russian Scientists in Moscow.  The proposal at that stage was that he would personally invest $1.5 million in return for equity in a future Russian vehicle.

They had produced a total of six valuation reports between them and two joint statements. Their conclusions differed widely. She noted that Dr Becker had based his report on the technology being like “a car ready to run down the road” whereas she considered that the present state of the technology was “semi-experimental”. Dr Becker’s conclusions were therefore based upon a false premise both as to the present status of the technology and the realities in which it had to operate: [Asplin/251]. She was also not satisfied that Mr MacGregor’s approach was correct. He had concluded that the technology had no value at all.  This, she held, failed to take into account the realities of the situation which included the fact that recent contracts had been entered into as well as a joint venture and that technical papers had been published by the Russian Scientists amongst others asserting that the technology created a viable process.  She was unable to arrive at a valuation for the Business Assets and she directed that further expert evidence be filed based on her findings of fact and her findings as to viability and that the issue of valuation be determined at a further hearing.  </p>

On the evidence before Arnold J, it was clear that there was no separate Opco and any ROW business was simply carried on by Sonoplus alongside the Russian business.  This created a conundrum because if the ROW business in fact had any value that would already be reflected in the value of the Russian Business Assets, namely the 30% of Petrosound shares in which Mr Gray held a 51% interest. It was not clear how one would then deal with the additional percentage interest that Mr Gray was declared by the July 2015 Order to hold in the international part of the business.  In the event, Arnold J stated that he did not have to resolve that conundrum since he held that the value of this licensing business and hence of any interest held by Mr Gray in the ROW business was also nil.  </p>

There were various other practical reasons why he declined to make the order sought, not least that Petrosound had been struck off the register of companies in the Seychelles on 18 July 2018. Any order for the transfer of the Business Assets would, he said, “be quite simply unenforceable” as against Professor Abramov and the VIYM Executives and there was no prospect of any order ever being complied with.  </p>

The first set was the costs of the Enquiry Hearing before Asplin J since she had reserved those costs in the July 2015 Order.  He held that the overall result was that neither party could be said to have been successful at that Hearing. The right order was that each side should bear its own costs.  The second set was the costs of the Set Aside Application launched by Mr Gray in October 2016 and withdrawn in May 2017.  Arnold J held that the underlying merits of the application had yet to be determined.  </p>

Arnold J’s rulings of 3 and 4 October on these various consequential matters were then given effect to by the Arnold Order of 4 October 2019.  By an order dated 20 December 2019, Patten LJ granted GEHC further permission to appeal against the refusal to order the transfer of the Business Assets and the costs order in respect of the Enquiry Hearing. He directed that GEHC’s and Mr Gray’s appeals be heard together.  Mr Gray has issued a Respondent’s notice in GEHC’s appeal seeking to uphold Arnold J’s decision to refuse to order the transfer of the Business Assets and his decisions on the costs of the Enquiry Hearing and the Set Aside Application.   </p>

The first was an application to amend Ground 1 and Ground 3 of his appeal, and for permission to rely on Ground 4 if, as GEHC contended, permission had not been granted by Arnold J (‘Application D’). Mr Gray’s second application (‘Application E’) was to rely on a supplemental skeleton argument and on additional documents that were among those included in the VIYM disclosure but not put before the court at the Enquiry Hearing.  Application E was in addition to an application that Mr Gray had included in his Notice of Appeal for several other documents from the VIYM disclosure to be admitted in the appeals.  Directions were given that the ancillary application in Mr Gray’s notice of appeal and both Application D and Application E, all of which are opposed by GEHC, be heard at the same time as the substantive appeals.

Mr Gray may well have been correct to view the share sale and the Acquisition Strategy as inextricably linked, but Vos J was satisfied that this was not how Mr de Clare saw things, and the consent which he gave to Mr Gray was correspondingly circumscribed. </p>

As Arden LJ in the <span style="font-style:italic">Murad</span> case makes clear, the defaulting fiduciary is only liable to account in respect of profits made within the scope of his duty which conflicted with his personal interest. The same is true here in relation to the assets and opportunities arising as a result of Mr Gray's breaches of duty. Thereafter, to the extent that an asset in relation to which there is sufficient causal link has become mixed with other assets without such a connection, it seems to me that the long accepted principles in relation to mixed funds apply. </p>

By this he means that at some stage “some causal connection” will become insufficient to require the fiduciary to account. He too relies upon the <span style="font-style:italic">Murad</span> case. I agree that logically when determining whether there is “some causal connection” there will be a point at which that connection fails or is insufficient. However, in my judgment, I do not consider that the imposition of the further concept of remoteness with all of its overtones assists matters. “Some causal connection” is just what it says.

In our respectful opinion, she was wrong to do so, although we emphasise that we have not heard argument on the question, and it appears to have been common ground before her that the relevant test could appropriately be framed in terms of causation. The important point, in our judgment, is that the liability of a defaulting fiduciary to account for unauthorised profits is a strict one, which has always been jealously enforced by courts of equity. There needs to be some link or nexus between the breach of duty proved and the profits for which an account is ordered, such that there is a “reasonable relationship” between them (as Lewison J said in the <span style="font-style:italic">Ultraframe</span> case).  But the link or nexus does not need to be of a causal character. It will normally be sufficient if the profit arose within the scope of the defaulting fiduciary’s conduct in breach of duty.

We were shown his lengthy Partial Award dated 9 August 2011 (“the Partial Award”), which does not appear to have been the subject of specific submissions at the Enquiry or Valuation Hearings, but was referred to by Vos J in the Liability Judgment at [Vos/210]. </p>

Mr Gray submits that Asplin J’s reference to RegEnersys I in this paragraph must have been a mistake, because the only RegEnersys entity which owned an interest in the Klamath Falls technology at the relevant time was Celloteck (then called RegEnersys Inc). Celloteck’s ownership of 10% of the shares in Klamath Falls gave it the ownership of an “interest” in the technology, whereas RegEnersys I had no more than the benefit of a non-exclusive contractual licence to exploit the technology, and of other contractual obligations contained in the Cooperation Agreement. Those contractual rights, says Mr Gray, cannot properly be described as giving rise to the ownership of an interest in the technology, so Asplin J must have intended to refer to Celloteck. </p>

It is clear to us, not least from the final sentence of [Asplin/196], that the judge intended to refer specifically to RegEnersys I in line with the procedure she had said she would adopt in [Asplin/11] of referring to all RegEnersys entities as “RegEnersys” only, unless it was material to refer to a specific RegEnersys entity. The presumption must therefore be that Asplin J’s reference to RegEnersys I was deliberate, which then prompts the question whether the contractual rights of RegEnersys I under the Licence and Cooperation Agreements could properly be described as the ownership of an interest in the Klamath Falls technology. In our view, there is no difficulty of either language or substance in so describing the commercial rights enjoyed by RegEnersys I under those two agreements. The rights were commercially valuable, and were capable of assignment. Furthermore, section 2.1 of the Licence Agreement (conveniently quoted in the Partial Award at paragraph 460) expressly gave RegEnersys I the “right to grant sub licences to Affiliates”. To describe these rights as ownership of an interest in the Klamath Falls technology seems to us an entirely normal use of language. It cannot begin to </p>

In a very real sense, therefore, the settlement did involve the affirmation of the contractual rights of RegEnersys I under the Licence and Cooperation Agreements, because Klamath Falls agreed to pay $5.1 million at a time when those were the only remaining claims which could still be pursued in the arbitration. Accordingly, we conclude that there was a clear link between the receipt of the $5.1 million (which, we repeat, the judge found to be a receipt by Mr Gray personally) and the contractual rights in the Klamath Falls technology owned by RegEnersys I. </p>

As we have explained, the exclusion must be narrowly construed as referring only to amounts received by Mr Gray in respect of the purchase of a 10% shareholding in Klamath Falls, because that is the only conflict of interest to which Mr de Clare gave GEHC’s fully informed consent. </p>

The opportunity of which Mr Gray availed himself in breach of duty can be traced first into Mr Gray’s initial interest in RegEnersys I, when owned by RegEnersys LP from August 2007. After 31 December 2010, it became his 51% interest in RegEnersys I, when owned by RegEnersys UK. He succeeded in using this to obtain a 51% interest in Chiloquin’s interest in Klamath Falls in February 2012, and then in turning both into a beneficial stake in Celloteck or Chiloquin by secret agreement with Mr Pronk in 2012 – which beneficial stake gave him his interest in Petrosound Ltd in 2013. </p>

It seems to me that the licence in respect of the Klamath Falls technology was a manifestation of the opportunity obtained in breach of fiduciary duty and there is no reason to seek to freeze the opportunity at that juncture. Such a conclusion is inconsistent with the acceptance throughout that the Russian Scientists were the key to the technology and my findings as to the nature of that technology.” </p>

They too were derived, not from the shareholding of Celloteck in Klamath Falls, but rather from the business opportunity in respect of the ultrasound technology to which Mr Gray was introduced and to which GEHC (through Mr de Clare) had not given its informed consent. There is no appeal against Asplin J’s findings of fact in [Asplin/193], quoted above, which explain how that opportunity can be traced into Mr Gray’s indirect interests in Petrosound. That alone in our view establishes the existence of a sufficient link between Mr Gray’s breaches of duty and his receipt of the Russian Business Assets. In common with the $5.1 million, the receipt of those assets by Mr Gray clearly falls outside the scope of the Klamath Falls exclusion in the Vos Order. Furthermore, the fact that there may have been other contributory reasons for Mr Gray’s receipt of these assets is immaterial. He received them in the course of the unauthorised conduct which constituted his breach of fiduciary duty, and in the absence of informed consent he is liable to account for them under the strict rule which equity applies to defaulting fiduciaries.  </p>

It would not be profitable to embark upon an examination of those arguments at this stage, particularly as GEHC accepts that Mr Gray did argue causation (or, as we would prefer to call it, the question of linkage) as a separate issue.  Nor, in our view, is it helpful to draw a sharp distinction between that issue and the issue of the scope of the account, because there is a considerable degree of overlap between them.  Although Ground 1 is headed “Failure to have regard to the scope of the liability to account”, the arguments relied upon by Mr Gray in support of the ground are in truth mainly arguments about linkage, with the exception of the question of construction of the Klamath Falls exclusion.  </p>

On the footing that, contrary to Mr Gray’s primary submission which we have rejected, those words were not meant to refer to Celloteck’s shareholding in Klamath Falls, but rather referred only to RegEnersys I’s rights as licensee, then Mr Gray now wishes to argue (a) that it was not open to Asplin </p>

The addition of the words “in whole or in part” to Ground 1 is intended to pave the way for an apportionment argument, while the alternative contention added to the ground attacks the judge’s finding of fact that Mr Gray’s receipt of the relevant assets was connected only to the licence held by RegEnersys I. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It is convenient to take first the attack on Asplin J’s finding of fact in [Asplin/196], on the assumption that (as we have held) it was directed only to the contractual rights of RegEnersys I under the Licence and Cooperation Agreements. The proposed amendment avers that such a finding was inconsistent with the terms of the Klamath Falls Settlement, but in our view there is no inconsistency. To the contrary, as we have explained, the finding was fully in accord with the terms of the settlement, bearing in mind that the only live issues (apart from costs) after the Partial Award were contractual issues relating to the agreements. Furthermore, there was no direct connection between those rights vested in RegEnersys I and Celloteck’s shareholding in Klamath Falls, and it was only the latter which fell within the narrow scope of the Klamath Falls exclusion. Asplin J must have had the exclusion well in mind because she had expressly referred to it shortly before in [Asplin/194]. We therefore see no real possibility of a successful attack on Asplin J’s finding if it is given the interpretation which we would place upon it.  At most, it might be said that there was also an indirect connection between the receipt of the $5.1 million and Celloteck’s shareholding, but that would not invalidate Asplin J’s approach or her conclusion, because the main operative link would still have been with the licence and other contractual rights held by RegEnersys I, all of which clearly fell outside the scope of the Klamath Falls exclusion. </p>

Mr Gray now puts forward two possible models of apportionment which he says would have been open to Asplin J on the documentary evidence before her. He submits that she should have adopted one or the other of them, or something similar. The first model would apportion the whole of the funds received under the Klamath Falls Settlement to Celloteck, on the footing that Celloteck acquired its 10% shareholding in Klamath Falls for a total consideration of approximately $21 million, whereas no monetary consideration was given by RegEnersys I when the Licence and Cooperation Agreements were later assigned to it. The second model would apportion the settlement monies between the shareholding and RegEnersys I’s non-exclusive licence in proportion to their respective values at the time of the settlement. It is suggested that a reasonable approach would be to apportion 80% to the shareholding and 20% to the licence. </p>

In summary, the fees relate to two distinct and consecutive periods. The first period runs from March 2006, when Mr Gray agreed his remuneration package with Mr Heerema, until the end of 2009. The second period began in 2010, after Mr Heerema had placed a cap on the RegEnersys fund. This led to a renegotiation of Mr Gray’s remuneration for managing the fund, and his entitlement to an annual fee of 2% of the committed funds was replaced by a single consultancy fee of $10 million. This was spread over three years for tax reasons and was fully drawn down by October 2012. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In a little more detail, during the first period (2006 to 2009) Mr Gray, through his corporate vehicle (ReVysion), was entitled to an annual fee of 2% of the funds committed by or on behalf of Mr Heerema to the RegEnersys fund (initially $250 million, later increased by stages to $500 million). The amount of that fee was calculated as a straight percentage of the committed funds, regardless of whether or how they were actually invested. Thus it began as an annual fee of $5 million, and increased to an annual fee of $10 million when the amount of the committed funds had doubled. In addition, Mr Gray was in principle entitled, in his personal capacity, to a profit share of 20% based on his 20% participation in the limited partnership which owned the RegEnersys fund, but his share of profits would only become payable after payment of all expenses and liabilities, payment of a further annual sum of $5 million, and a preferred return to RegEnersys Inc of 6% of funds invested: see [Vos/191]. In practice, this threshold was never reached, so Mr Gray never received any equity return on his investment in the fund (with the possible exception of a sum of €3.5 million paid to him in 2009 as a “performance uplift” following the successful disposition of the fund’s investment in a North Sea gas field). Asplin J found, however, that this sum should be treated as part of his management fee for 2009: see [Asplin/187]).  </p>

Asplin J found that the $10 million consultancy fee “should be treated in the same way as the remainder of the management fees”: [Asplin/190].

Mr Heerema asked Mr Gray to manage the funds before he even knew about the ultrasound technology or Mr Gray’s involvement in it. Secondly, Vos J made no order for Mr Gray to account for the management and consultancy fees, and his findings as to Mr Gray’s breaches of duty do not extend to Mr Gray’s conduct in managing the fund. Indeed, Vos J found that Mr de Clare always knew and understood that Mr Gray would be remunerated for doing so, although he did not know the details.

The equitable principle here engaged is the obligation on a fiduciary not to place himself in a position of actual or potential conflict of interest when he owes an unqualified duty of loyalty to his principal. This obligation is quite separate from, and often anterior to, the operation of the so-called “no profit rule”, which is reflected in paragraph 1(2) of the Vos Order, and involved Mr Gray taking advantage of GEHC’s “maturing business opportunity… to participate in the Acquisition Strategy and to obtain rights in the ultrasound technology”. </p>

Mr Snowden [<span style="font-style:italic">counsel for GEHC</span>] submitted, as I have said, that Mr Gray first obtained a personal interest in Mr Heerema’s fund and, therefore, in the Acquisition Strategy when he agreed to the remuneration proposal in Mr Pronk’s 17th March 2006 email. Mr Atherton [<span style="font-style:italic">counsel for Mr Gray</span>] submitted that in March 2006 no deal had yet been done, and there was no certainty that there would be any investment by Mr Heerema in the Acquisition Strategy at that stage. Moreover, he argued that Mr de Clare must have realised that Mr Gray would be remunerated in some way for managing Mr Heerema’s funds, and what was agreed was no more than a standard kind of fee and remuneration for such activities. </p>

But, the email also makes clear that, if an investment were made by Mr Heerema in the Acquisition Strategy, Mr Gray would have 20% of the ordinary shares and a 2% management fee, and would make a co-investment of USD 1 million or 20% alongside Mr Heerema’s fund. This proposed arrangement gave rise to three problems. Mr Gray would be motivated to reduce GEHC’s interest so as to (i) increase Mr Heerema’s share and therefore (ii) to increase Mr Gray’s own return on his intended 20% shareholding. The third problem is that Mr Gray was secretly taking a personal interest in a business opportunity belonging to GEHC. These problems may go more towards the question of breach to which I shall turn in due course. </p>

That is the fact that, up to 17th March 2006, Mr Gray’s conflict between his personal interests and his duty was a potential one, since he could have been remunerated otherwise than by a direct share of Mr Heerema’s profits. After 17th March 2006, there was an actual conflict between his personal interests and his duty to GEHC, for the same reasons as there was an actual conflict between his duty to Mr Heerema and his duty to GEHC from January 2006.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It seems to us to follow from this analysis that the remuneration arrangements made in March 2006, including the 2% annual management fee, gave rise to an immediate actual conflict between Mr Gray’s personal interests and his duty to GEHC. The three problems identified by Vos J in [462] were then unavoidably engaged, and a duty to account might in principle arise as soon as any investments were made by the fund pursuant to the Acquisition Strategy. Furthermore, we think it would be a misreading of this passage in the judgment of Vos J to confine the duty to account to any profit share which might ultimately be obtained by Mr Gray from his 20% equity interest in the fund. On the contrary, we see no reason why an appropriate proportion of the annual management fee should not also have become subject to the liability to account, once investments were actually made pursuant to the Acquisition Strategy, and once time and resources were devoted by Mr Gray and his staff to considering the making of such investments. The remuneration package formed a single, indivisible whole, and Mr Gray was (as we have said) in a position of actual conflict of interest, on Vos J’s findings, from 17 March 2006 onwards. Accordingly, any aspect of his remuneration which was derived, directly or indirectly, from the inclusion of ultrasound-related investments in the fund was in our view potentially within the scope of his liability to account from that date onwards, and falls squarely within the terms of paragraph 1(1) of the Vos Order.  </p>

The issue which Vos J was considering, in this penultimate section of his lengthy judgment, was whether GEHC needed to show that it had suffered loss in order to move on to the next stage of the split trial, i.e. the Enquiry Hearing. For that limited purpose, it was enough for Vos J to summarise his main conclusions on liability. He was fully aware that he was in no position to rule definitively on all the profits for which Mr Gray might be liable to account, assuming liability in principle to have been established.

I know, of course, that he denies that he made any such profit, and that he has adduced some evidence to show that he has not. But I have only seen one side of the story. I cannot, therefore, find that GEHC has no real chance of establishing that it is entitled to recover some material profits once the necessary account is taken. Mr Atherton also seeks to limit the relief that GEHC can obtain by foreclosing the argument about what benefits Mr Gray may or may not have received from his exploitation of GEHC’s maturing business opportunity in relation to the Acquisition Strategy and the ultrasound technology. I do not think that would be appropriate in the absence of clear and undisputed evidence as to what precisely Mr Gray has received or is likely in the future to receive. There may be a whole host of arguments on both sides that I cannot now predict and have not yet been adumbrated.” </p>

Our conclusion is reinforced by a further point. If Vos J had intended to exclude the fees in their entirety from the scope of his order, one would expect him to have said so expressly, and to have included in the order an exclusion analogous to the Klamath Falls exclusion which we have considered under Ground 1. </p>

We agree with Mr de Mestre that there is nothing in this point. The fact that the fee was calculated on this basis does not, in itself, answer the question whether some part of the fee may be referable to Mr Gray’s breach of duty. As the Liability Judgment makes clear, Mr Gray was in a position of actual conflict of interest from the date when his remuneration was first agreed. The fees which he then received were in principle capable of relating to his breach of duty once the RegEnersys fund included ultrasound-related investments, or the making of such investments was under active consideration, because the making and review of such investments embodied the very conflict of interest which Vos J had identified. That was sufficient to establish the necessary link, and in our view Asplin J was clearly entitled to evaluate the evidence on this point and reach the conclusion that she did. </p>

GEHC’s response to Ground 3, in its respondent’s skeleton argument dated 18 December 2019, made it clear that the ground, as originally formulated, had been founded on a misconception. The methodology laid down by the judge for calculating the portion of the $10 million for which Mr Gray was liable to account did indeed provide for the deduction of expenses properly incurred in earning the fee, with the exception of money spent on or in relation to the present litigation which Mr Gray’s own expert, Mr MacGregor, had rightly excluded from the calculation on the basis that such expenditure should not be treated as part of the costs incurred by Mr Gray in advising on and managing the RegEnersys fund.  </p>

The fee was in principle capable of being paid in advance. Indeed, Mr Gray could have demanded payment of the entire $10 million in 2010, and on the judge’s findings it was only for tax reasons that he chose to spread the receipt over three years. But if the work which he was paid to perform in return for the fee continued thereafter, there is no logical reason why relevant expenditure incurred by Mr Gray in relation to that work should not have continued to be deductible in ascertaining his net profit. The judge appears to have treated it as axiomatic that the date of final drawdown should also have marked the end of the period of permissible deductions. With respect to the judge, however, we consider that this approach was mistaken. The correct approach, in principle, would have been to ascertain the full period over which the work referable to the consultancy fee was performed, both before and after October 2012, and to permit the deduction of expenditure properly referable to that work by the application of generally accepted accountancy principles. If there was a particular reason why the deductibility of expenditure should cease on the same date as the fee was finally drawn down in full, the judge needed to articulate what that reason was, and to explain why it should override normal principles of commercial accounting. But she did not do so, and her reasoning on the issue does not really extend beyond the single sentence which we have quoted from [Asplin/210]. </p>

Thus, even though the essential nature of the fee was the same as that of the annual fee payable before 2010, it was payable in respect of a three year period which began at some point in 2011, and also related back to work which had already been done by Mr Gray in 2010.

First, it is now agreed that the calculation should be based on the full amount of the actual management fees received by Mr Gray between 2006 and 2009, after deduction of expenses. This net figure amounted to £9,457,797. Secondly, it is agreed that Asplin J’s reference to “the fund as a whole” in the passage from [205] which we have quoted should be read as a reference to the full amount of the net fees, or in other words the same amount of £9,457,797. That is the fund which needs to be apportioned. Thirdly, it is also now agreed that the numerator of the apportionment fraction to be applied to the net fees received in each year comprises (a) the amount of ultrasound-related investments comprised in the RegEnersys fund during the year (based on the amount invested rather that its fluctuating value from time to time) plus (b) 90% of the investments relating to the Klamath Falls shareholding, as shown on Schedule A (although without the 10% deduction).  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The single issue which now divides the parties concerns the denominator of the apportionment fraction. In general, it was in the interests of Mr Gray to argue that the denominator (or Amount B as it was conveniently called) should be as large as possible, thereby reducing the amount of the proportion of the fees for which he would be liable to account. Conversely, it was in the interests of GEHC to argue for the smallest possible Amount B, because that would maximise the amount for which Mr Gray had to account. Three options were canvassed before the judge, and two of them are reflected in Schedule A (which, as we have said, was submitted on behalf of Mr Gray). Mr Gray’s primary case was that Amount B should be taken as the full amount of the committed funds under management during each year, whether or not </p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">those funds had been invested. The obvious point in favour of this option was the fact that the annual management fee itself was calculated by reference to the amount of committed funds, regardless of their state of investment. At the other extreme, GEHC contended that Amount B should be taken as comprising the total sums actually invested by the RegEnersys fund, ignoring any funds which had been committed but not yet invested in any projects. The main argument for this approach was that it concentrated on the investments actually made as a result of Mr Gray’s management of the fund. It was, however, open to the objection that it took no account of the work which had to be done in evaluating and choosing between possible investments, which forms a substantial part of the work of any active fund manager. Accordingly, the intermediate option, and Mr Gray’s fall-back position, was that Amount B should comprise the funds actually invested but with the addition of a notional amount to reflect the work done by Mr Gray and ReVysion in considering potential investment opportunities, even though they might ultimately be rejected. This notional amount was shown on Schedule A as an inevitably arbitrary amount of $100 million. In his oral closing submissions to Asplin J, Mr Cavender described this figure as “just a stab in the dark” or “an educated guess”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Asplin J decided on the middle option, and treated Amount B as comprising the funds actually invested plus a notional amount of $100 million to represent investment opportunities not taken. The relevant words in [Asplin/205], although this may not be immediately apparent from the judge’s rather compressed language, are “ultrasound invested funds and investment opportunities … in Mr Cavender’s Schedule A, over the relevant period.” The resulting calculations are then helpfully set out in a table which formed part of GEHC’s skeleton argument for the hearing on consequential matters in July 2015. The apportionment percentages for the four relevant years were: zero for 2006 (because no ultrasound-related investments had yet been made, nor had the 10% shareholding in Klamath Falls been acquired); 9.7% in 2007; 16.3% in 2008; and 15.5% in 2009. These figures yielded a mean percentage of 10.367% (to three decimal places) which, applied to the total net management fee of £9,457,797, produced the judgment sum of £980,526. By contrast, if Amount B had been taken as the total committed funds, the mean percentage would have been 4.3% and the sum for which Mr Gray was obliged to account would have been £400,525. It follows that approximately £580,000 (before interest) turns on this issue.  </p>

Although he put the argument in a number of slightly different ways during his oral submissions, this was in substance the single point to which he returned on each occasion. Because that was the contractual basis on which the fees were paid, it should also be used in calculating the apportionment percentage. He was also inclined to accept that, if Asplin J could not be shown to have erred in principle in choosing the middle option, then the use of an indicative sum to represent investment opportunities was probably the best that could be done in the circumstances.

The court is looking for the appropriate degree of connection in the light of the evidence before the court. It is not searching for a single magic formula which will produce the right result.

In fact, as Mr Ahlquist was able to demonstrate, this was an arithmetical error for $697,000. Nothing turns on this, however, because Mr Ahlquist was content to accept that the payments had been taken into account as deductions from the $10 million consultancy fee agreed with Mr Gray in 2010. Accordingly, the point would only be a live one if Mr Gray had succeeded on Ground 2, with the consequence that the $10 million fee fell outside his liability to account altogether.

His decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal [1965] Ch. 992 and ultimately by this House under the name of <span style="font-style:italic">Boardman v Phipps</span> [1967] 2 A.C. 46. In that case a trust estate included a minority holding in a private company which fell on lean times. The trustees declined to attempt to acquire a controlling interest in the company in order to improve its performance. The solicitor to the trust [<span style="font-style:italic">Mr Boardman</span>] and one of the beneficiaries, with the knowledge and approval of the trustees, purchased the controlling interest from outside shareholders for themselves with the help of information about the shareholders acquired by the solicitor in the course of acting for the trust. The company’s position was improved and the shares bought by the solicitor and the purchasing beneficiary were ultimately sold at a profit. A complaining beneficiary was held to be entitled to a share of the profits on the resale on the grounds that the solicitor and the purchasing beneficiary were assisted in the original purchase by the information derived from the trust. The purchase of a controlling interest might have turned out badly and in that case the solicitor and the purchasing beneficiary would have made irrecoverable personal losses. In these circumstances it is not surprising that Wilberforce J decided that in calculating the undeserved profit which accrued to the trust estate there should be deducted a generous allowance for the work and trouble of the solicitor and purchasing beneficiary in acquiring the controlling shares and restoring the company to prosperity. <span style="font-style:italic">Phipps v Boardman</span> decides that in exceptional circumstances a court of equity may award remuneration to the trustee.”  </p>

In relation to those fees, it was anyway necessary to compute the expenses that should properly be deducted from them in arriving at the net profit received by Mr Gray. The question of an equitable allowance could therefore conveniently be dealt with, throughout the relevant period, by means of a further allowance reflecting the value of Mr Gray’s services as (in effect) the chief executive officer (“CEO”) of ReVysion. We note in this connection that it is agreed Mr Gray did not pay himself a salary: see [Asplin/212]. In this way, it was presumably thought that a further deduction from the net fee income of amounts equivalent to a suitable annual salary for Mr Gray could serve as an appropriate proxy for the grant to him of an equitable allowance.  </p>

In paragraph 149, the point was also made that there is nothing discretionary about the deduction of expenses incurred in obtaining profits. The allowance for which Mr Gray contended then was dealt with at paragraphs 488 to 493. Reliance was placed on the submission that Mr Gray had “acted as effective CEO of ReVysion, working full-time for it since its inception”, and that, prior to the establishment of ReVysion, Mr Gray “took steps to set up and manage what was to become RegEnersys from about April 2006”. </p>

Furthermore, Mr Dutton submitted, the word “or” could be read as suggesting that the judge regarded the deduction of expenses and the grant of an equitable allowance as alternatives. We can say at once that we regard the latter suggestion as implausible. We are satisfied that Asplin J did not intend the word “or” to be read in a strictly disjunctive sense. However, the first point appears to us to be well taken, and neither of the authorities cited by Asplin J provides any support for the proposition that the deduction of expenses in computing an unauthorised profit is in any way discretionary. The expenses must of course have been properly incurred, and must be properly attributable to the gross receipt, so there is scope for some exercise of judgment and there may be areas of potential disagreement in performing the exercise.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">A number of factors lead us to this conclusion. In the first place, in the parts of the judgment which deal with the fees received by Mr Gray, there is nothing to suggest that Asplin J regarded the deduction of proper expenses as anything other than a necessary step in ascertaining the amount for which Mr Gray was liable to account. This was the approach adopted by Mr MacGregor in his expert evidence, which in substance the judge accepted (subject to issues of causation, the correction of certain errors, and her rejection of the equitable allowance claimed). Secondly, it is apparent from numerous passages in the judgment that Asplin J was fully aware of the distinction between a gross receipt and a net profit for which a defaulting fiduciary might be liable to account. Thirdly, in both the offending passages the judge directed herself, entirely correctly, that the making of an equitable allowance was discretionary. Fourthly, in the paragraphs where she deals with the making of an equitable allowance, we can find no hint of any confusion about the legal principles to be applied, or of contamination by her prior discussion of the issue of causation. Finally, there are some contributory factors which may help to explain why Asplin J failed to notice her slip. She thought she was merely recording common ground, so may have failed to notice her error for that reason. And the way in which Mr MacGregor dealt with the equitable allowance in his report, by treating it as a further deduction from the net profit, might have tended to blur the conceptual distinction between such an allowance and the deduction of expenses properly incurred in computing the net profit. </p>

First, she did not consider it an appropriate case for the grant of any allowance at all, given the way in which the litigation had proceeded, and Mr Gray’s failure “to account properly or at all in respect of his benefit from his fiduciary duty”. Secondly, even if she had considered it appropriate to make an allowance, she had insufficient evidence to quantify an appropriate amount. She rejected Mr Ward’s evidence as a “rule of thumb” which failed to provide “an appropriate basis for doing justice”.  </p>

Since we have rejected the submission that Asplin J’s approach was vitiated by a material error of law, and since the question is admittedly one for the discretion of the trial judge, the difficulties in Mr Gray’s path are formidable. After a five week trial, during which Mr Gray’s witnesses, including Mr Ward, had given evidence and been cross-examined at length, the judge had rejected his case on most of the issues in dispute. In particular, she had rejected his case that he had disposed of the entirety of his interest in RegEnersys to Celloteck in August 2012 and found it to be false. She also found, contrary to his denials, that he had reached the secret agreement with the Russian Scientists and others to retain a beneficial interest in the ultrasound technology. These were central planks in Mr Gray’s case that he had provided a full and truthful account of matters in his affidavit and other evidence, but to a very significant extent the judge found that account to be false. </p>

Furthermore, the judge found that there were two payments of £50,000 each to the Russian Scientists which he had failed to disclose. The relevant point is not that these payments were particularly large in amount or number, but rather that they had been made by an indirect route which Mr Gray must have hoped would enable them to remain undetected. Add to this the serious adverse findings about Mr Gray’s credibility in the Liability Judgment against which there has been no appeal, and in respect of which Mr Dutton rightly said that Mr Gray will have to live with them for the rest of his life.  Against that background, it is in our judgment impossible to say that Asplin J erred in refusing to grant Mr Gray an equitable allowance. The facts in our view fall well short of the kind of exceptional circumstances in which an allowance may be justified. In terms of the underlying policy identified by Lord Goff in <span style="font-style:italic">Guinness plc v Saunders</span>, we think that the grant of an allowance in this case could indeed have the effect of encouraging a fiduciary such as Mr Gray to put himself in a position where his interests conflict with his duty to his principal. A review of all the circumstances, including Mr Gray’s conduct of the litigation, provides ample support for the judge’s conclusion, and in our view her exercise of discretion in declining to grant an allowance cannot be faulted.  </p>

As will appear, the only grounds on which we propose to allow his appeal are Grounds 3A.1 and 7.2. The former of those grounds concerns a relatively minor part of the overall picture, and it goes only to the computation of the net profit for which Mr Gray is liable to account in respect of the $10 million consultancy fee. Similarly, Ground 7.2 raises a narrow issue about the legal characterisation of the ROW Business Asset. The reasoning of Asplin J on Ground 5 is rather compressed; but in the absence of any demonstrable error of law or principle in her approach, there is no basis for this court to interfere. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In the light of our conclusion on this issue, it is unnecessary for us to go on to consider Asplin J’s second reason for refusing to make an allowance. We would merely observe that she cannot in our view be criticised for confining her attention to the claim for an allowance as it was actually presented to her and argued at trial. Mr Dutton seemed at times to suggest in his oral submissions that the judge was under an obligation to consider the question, if necessary of her own motion, regardless of how it was argued before her, and that this court too should, if necessary, adopt a similar approach. If that is what Mr Dutton intended to submit, we do not agree with him. A claim for an equitable allowance should in principle be pleaded and supported by evidence in the usual way. The fact that it is a form of equitable relief does not authorise or require the court to embark on a roving commission to achieve a just result, nor does it mean that a judge can fairly be criticised for not proactively seeking alternatives to the allowance claimed if the judge considers it excessive or wrong in principle. There may occasionally be cases in which it is appropriate for a judge to take the initiative in that way, but we do not consider the present case to be one of that character.  Asplin J was in our view fully entitled not to go beyond the case for an allowance which was presented to her at trial.  </p>

Very briefly, two findings are in particular challenged. The first is that the 2010 agreement was reached in October 2010 with the Russian Scientists that RegEnersys would receive a 30% interest in the Russian business and a 51% interest in the ROW business.  As will be seen, there is an issue as to whether Asplin J found that a binding agreement, as opposed to an arrangement or understanding, had been made. There is also an issue as to whether in any event it is open to Mr Gray, on the grounds of appeal for which he has permission, to challenge this finding. The second finding is that, notwithstanding the terms of the 2012 SPA entered into on 17 August 2012 whereby RegEnersys sold its wholly-owned subsidiary Chiloquin to Celloteck, a secret agreement was made between Mr Gray and Mr Pronk on behalf of the Heerema group whereby Mr Gray would continue to be entitled to a 51% interest in any investment in the ultrasound technology. On this basis, GEHC claimed, and Asplin J found, that Mr Gray was entitled to the Russian Business Assets namely 51% of what was found to be </p>

At [172] to [174], she referred to (i) an email of 7 December 2010 in which Graham Knight, a colleague of Mr Gray working for ReVysion, told Mr Gray that he had made a request to the Russian lawyers for share certificates for 30% of the shares to be issued in the name of RegEnersys; (ii) the cross-examination of Mr Knight and Mr Pronk in which they accepted that there was an agreement, understanding or arrangement as to the 30%; (iii) emails at around this time from Professor Abramov suggesting that he intended to honour “the arrangement which had been finalised” (Asplin J specifically rejected oral evidence given by Professor Abramov to contrary effect); and (iv) many documents that referred to RegEnersys’ stake in the Russian business.  These included a document known as the Feasibility Study produced in December 2010 and translated in 2011 (she specifically rejected Mr Knight’s evidence that he was unaware of the contents, preferring the evidence in this respect of Mr Kantor), a draft licence agreement prepared for Sonovita (a subsidiary of Sonoplus) by Mr Knight and emailed to Mr Kantor on 17 May 2011, and emails from Mr Knight to Mr Ward in July 2011.  </p>

As to that, she said that it appeared that VIYM “had no doubt as to the nature and extent of the Gray/RegEnersys interest in Petrosound and the international operation and made their investment on that basis”.

In addition, in 2012, Mr Kantor set up his “Bill Barrett” email address used for correspondence with the Russian Scientists which he did not disclose until its existence had been revealed in disclosure from VIYM provided in November 2014. The account was closed in 2013 and Mr Kantor accepted that he knew that in doing so the emails would be deleted.

Mr Pronk’s explanation in cross examination was incoherent and I was unable to follow it. I also take into account in this regard the fact that there is no contemporaneous documentary evidence of any kind either seeking repayment of any part of the $65m on the part of the Heerema Group or a desire to do so on behalf of Mr Gray. I also consider it relevant that there was no obligation to repay the loan directly. It was to be repaid over time from a percentage of any monies realised on the sale of assets. In this regard, I also take account of the fact that Mr Heerema was unable to explain how the figure of $65m had been arrived at and that Mr Pronk was unable to point to a document recording Mr Gray’s alleged desire to pay back the loan or to give particulars of when such a desire was made clear and gave untruthful evidence in relation to the use of the remainder of the Chilean arbitration settlement monies. </p>

At [26], she said “GEHC contends therefore, that by no later than 25 October 2010, Mr Gray had come to a clear agreement, arrangement or understanding with the Russian Scientists as to the terms of the interest RegEnersys was to have in the Russian operation and that a formal written agreement had not been executed as a result of the ongoing arbitration in Chile”. This accurately reflects GEHC’s case. In its Part 18 Response, GEHC repeatedly alleged that RegEnersys had reached “an arrangement or understanding” in October 2010, but did not once use the term “agreement”, still less “contract” or “binding agreement”. Mr Dutton referred us to the oral closing submissions for GEHC, but again it seems clear to us that a binding agreement was not being alleged. In the passage to which we were referred, counsel said as regards the claim to the 15% shareholding “realistically, we have to agree that it depends on establishing the agreement, understanding, however you like, in October 2010”. It needed to be a “firm agreement”; there was “a settled approach”. A firm agreement or understanding is not the same as a contract and, as appears from the judge’s summary of GEHC’s case at [26], it is clear that she did not understand a contract or binding agreement to be alleged.  </p>

At [172], for example, when dealing with the claim to the 15% shareholding in Petrosound, she said, “[t]here is a considerable amount of evidence that in 2010 it was understood that in return for the investment already made RegEnersys would have a 30% stake in the Russian business”. She further said that in cross-examination, Mr Knight and Mr Pronk accepted there was “an agreement/understanding or arrangement as to the 30%” and that Professor Abramov’s emails suggested that “he intended to honour the arrangement which had been finalised”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Contrary to Mr Dutton’s submissions, it was not necessary to GEHC’s claims to the 15% shareholding in Petrosound in the names of Mr Volchenkov and Mr Ivanov or to a 51% interest in the ROW business that the 2010 agreement should have been a binding contract. That would be necessary only if GEHC had to show that RegEnersys (and, indirectly, Mr Gray) or Celloteck had a proprietary interest as at the date of the 2012 SPA, such interest deriving from a specifically enforceable contract. That was not necessary and it was enough for GEHC’s claim that Celloteck (and, through it, Mr Gray by virtue of the secret agreement) subsequently acquired an interest in Petrosound or the ROW business. GEHC’s claim against Mr Gray is based on the opportunity to invest in the ultrasound technology and business which became available to him as a result of his involvement in GEHC and of which he took advantage through his participation in RegEnersys. GEHC needed no more than that to succeed in its claim to Mr Gray’s 51% interest in the 15% shareholding in Petrosound issued to Celloteck. The same is true of Mr Gray’s interest in the 15% shareholding in Petrosound issued to the VIYM Executives, once it is established that they held the shares as nominees for Celloteck. However, as GEHC’s counsel acknowledged in the passage cited above, the claim that those shares were held for Celloteck would, in practice, be established only if there were a firm understanding, arrangement or agreement reached in October 2010. The agreement or arrangement did not, however, need to be legally binding.   </p>

It submitted that no mention of such a challenge is made in the grounds of appeal. The overarching ground set out in Ground 6 is that the judge was “wrong to find that the Defendant had any <span style="font-style:italic">ongoing </span>interest in the ultrasound technology, or that he had concealed any such interest” (emphasis added). The challenge to the finding of an <span style="font-style:italic">ongoing </span>interest showed that Ground 6 was aimed at the finding of the secret agreement, as borne out by the relevant section of Mr Gray’s skeleton argument. Indeed, paragraph 66 begins “[i]n respect of this ground of appeal Mr Gray challenges the crucial findings of fact made by Asplin J at the Enquiry Trial that he had dishonestly concealed an ongoing interest in the ultrasound technology”.  Mr de Mestre submitted that the following lengthy section of the skeleton argument is, consistently with that opening paragraph and the terms of Ground 6, directed to the finding of a secret agreement. By contrast, there is no reference in the skeleton argument to [175] of the Enquiry Judgment where Asplin J sets out her finding as to the 2010 agreement.   </p>

That challenge was neither expressly nor implicitly linked to the finding of the 2010 agreement. It was entirely coherent to challenge just the finding of the secret agreement. Given the centrality of the finding of the 2010 agreement, one would expect it to be separately and fully addressed, instead of a brief mention in a sub-paragraph of a skeleton argument. In fact, paragraph 84.10(b) is a small part of the reasons leading up to the conclusion at paragraph 85 that “[o]nce it is clear that there was no secret agreement in 2012 and that the Russian businesses failed, the key elements of Mr Gray’s evidence are vindicated”. </p>

The documents were significant because they appeared to show after October 2010 an open discussion taking place about Celloteck’s future participation in the venture without acknowledging any existing commitment on either side. Mr Dutton informed us that they had been described as window-dressing no less than 24 times in GEHC’s written closing submissions but, save in one instance, Asplin J made no findings at all about these documents. In circumstances where, in Mr Dutton submission, GEHC’s case could not succeed if the documents were genuine, rather than window-dressing, the judge’s failure to deal with this issue fatally undermined her finding that the 2010 agreement had been made, which accordingly could not stand.  </p>

To date there has been discussion around a bifurcated structure where Celloteck would control international operations and the Russian Organization (RO) would control operations within the Former Soviet Union in exchange for an assignment of the Klamath IP. However, as discussions have progressed, it has become increasingly apparent that there will be a material price tag attached to Celloteck participation. While this was not clear in the initial discussions, I believe now that that the RO will not complete a deal unless both the IP is contributed and funding in the area of $3-5MM is committed (either as equity or as a shareholder loan)” </p>

In the third paragraph, he stated that the existing arrangement with the Russian Scientists involved Celloteck having a minority stake in a subsidiary, with no right in the core business and “subject to dilution or even clawback if the Russian Scientists did not perform”. Mr Kantor continued: “Given the current financial and equity situation of the company, I cannot recommend that Celloteck commit to funding the business or to participating in any subsidiary equity position. The business as a whole is too unstable today to put funding into (even solely at international level), and taking a minority equity position in the RO would likely put us in conflict with the existing Investors”.

Of course, for us to discuss that we have to imply a relationship with the Russians that we don’t have, and I believe this has been the best strategy as we have been sounding out the market. However, I think we may have exhausted our flexibility, and it may be prudent to focus on locking down some sort of interest in the Russian technology while our IP and equipment still has some value. Hopefully we will soon get a better sense of what a deal would look like given what we can put on the table (i.e. the IP and equipment but no cash or deployment opportunity), and I will revert back with that information.” </p>

However, Mr Knight says that during his telephone conversation the Professor suggested offering only 10% of the shares to Celloteck and as a result he hung up on him. He went on to explain that in a further conversation later that evening, the Professor agreed to 15% instead of 30% for Celloteck. In fact, the 30% shareholding had been canvassed in email correspondence between Mr Kantor and Professor Abramov in September 2013 and Mr Knight accepted that he had been in Moscow the previous week and had had a relatively lengthy meeting at which the 30% had been hammered out. </p>

Accordingly, I am unable to accept it. It also seems to me that had the reduction from 30% come about in the way it was described, there would be a large number of email complaints on behalf of RegEnersys/Heerema and possibly the involvement of lawyers. There is also no explanation of why if Messrs Volchenkov and Ivanov were holding 15% of the shareholding on behalf of VIYM, it is said that their employment was terminated.

Professor Abramov on the other hand, stated in cross examination that his estimation of Mr Knight’s ability in relation to the oil and gas business was extremely low, that he viewed him as Mr Gray’s driver and that his relationship with Mr Knight had been destroyed. Save to say that the company was his to do with as he pleased, he did not explain why, therefore, he had allotted shares to Mr Knight and had allotted only 15% of the shares in Petrosound to Celloteck.  He did state that he had reached an agreement with Messrs Volchenkov and Ivanov “for one year and $750,000”. He added that they had returned the 15% shareholding allotted to them to him.

In fact, Ms Deeney accepted that Mr Gray was not away at the time and that in any event, she directed the making of the payments and copied Mr Gray in.

He referred to the transcript of Mr Pronk’s evidence where he said in cross-examination that he told his staff as regards Celloteck, “Deal this with me first”. Mr Dutton emphasised the word “first”. The evidence was not that no-one else in the office was to deal with the Celloteck matter at all, only that it was to be referred to him first. The judge was therefore wrong to accept GEHC’s submission that Mr Pronk was effectively keeping the true nature of Celloteck’s interest a secret even from those in his office. It was not a finding open to the judge on the evidence. Why, Mr Dutton asked, should this be kept secret from Mr Smits who was closely involved in the acquisition of Chiloquin by Celloteck, and why indeed should Mr Pronk and the Heerema group do all this for Mr Gray?  </p>

The circumstances in which the fax was sent, as shown by the faxes from Ms Deeney which immediately preceded and followed it, and the very fact that it was sent by fax and not by email, show that it was both very important and highly confidential, intended for Mr Pronk’s eyes only. The timing of the fax, less than two weeks before the 2012 SPA was signed and before Mr Gray was due to provide his witness statement for the Liability Hearing, was significant. Given the unique character of the fax and its evident importance, it is surprising that at least Mr Pronk, and perhaps Mr Kantor, gave evidence that they had no recollection of it. In our judgment, Asplin J was entitled to draw from these circumstances the inference that, as she said, the fax <span style="font-style:italic">related to</span> a secret agreement to conceal Mr Gray’s continuing interests in the ultrasound technology. We also accept Mr de Mestre’s submission that she was entitled to treat Mr Pronk’s evidence as showing that he, and not others in his office, were to deal with Celloteck matters. The fact that Mr Smits was dealing with the 2012 SPA does not mean that Mr Pronk wished him to be involved in a secret agreement with Mr Gray. </p>

The phrase “just want equity remote from me” was explicable on the basis that Mr Gray simply wanted no part of Celloteck nor anything involving an interest in Klamath Falls. The language was capable of supporting his evidence, and that of other witnesses, that he had no interest after the 2012 SPA was made, although Mr Dutton accepted that it was capable of bearing a different meaning. Mr Gray’s use of “remote” in other contexts, on which the judge relied, did not dictate its meaning in this email. As the judge acknowledged at [159], Mr Gray had stated his case as regards this email in the further information he provided in October 2014. He said that it meant that he “wanted out” and Mr Dutton submitted that the judge was wrong to criticise the absence of any further comment on it in his witness statements. It was not incumbent on him to comment on every document in his written evidence; that was a matter for cross-examination. Moreover, the judge had wrongly said that there was no reference in his written evidence to debt reduction as a reason for the 2012<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>SPA<span style="font-weight:bold">, </span>misled in this respect by GEHC’s closing submissions.

Asplin J did not direct a formal split trial or a new enquiry but directed only a further hearing, before her if available, to deal with the issue of value, on which she found there to be insufficient evidence at the Enquiry Hearing. We do not consider there to be any substance in this point. Asplin J gave judgment following the Enquiry Hearing, finally determining all issues before her other than valuation. The relevant documents were not before her and, therefore, on an appeal from the July 2015 Order, they are new evidence.

The evidence which Mr Gray asks to be admitted on this appeal against Asplin J’s order does not relate to the issue on which there is inconsistency, namely whether (as Arnold J found) the ROW business was conducted through Sonoplus, owned by Petrosound and VIYM, or whether (as Asplin J found) it would be conducted through a separate corporate structure in which Celloteck would have a 51% interest.

First, they would have affected Asplin J’s rejection at [125] – [127] of certain evidence given by Professor Abramov, which in turn would have had an important influence on the judge’s rejection of his evidence as to the 2010 agreement and the secret agreement. Secondly, they would have had an important influence on the judge’s conclusions as to the viability of the technology and the value of the Business Assets, although she was unable on the evidence before her to determine their value. In turn, this would have had an important influence on her finding of the existence of the secret agreement.

During 2014 numerous well treatments have been carried out. On 4 September 2014, Mr Ildyakov sent the results of 19 ultrasound treatments carried out between 25 January and 31 August 2014 to Mr Knight. The results show an increase in production and do not contain any reference to damage caused by jet pumps. Furthermore on 10 November 2014, Professor Abramov’s daughter, Anna, sent answers to questions to Mr Knight, included in which was a reference to negotiations with a company called Weatherford. Further, in the case of Samatlorneftegaz, 40 wells were to be treated between April and December 2014, 36 of which were completed by the end of November.  In the case of RN-Nizhnevartovsk, 20 wells were treated between April and December 2014, 18 of which had been treated by the end of November when the Professor signed his witness statement. He made no reference to any problems with the contracts. However, in cross examination, he stated that the contracts were “not going smoothly” and in reexamination stated that a jet pump used in conjunction with the treatment had destroyed “three fields” by which it was assumed he meant wells. He also attributed difficulties and a move purely to geological consultancy upon the collapse of the rouble. He neither made reference to any equipment difficulties in his witness statement nor to the alleged effects of the exchange rate which in fact, was much the same when he gave evidence to how it had been when he signed his witness statement.  </p>

The first is an exchange of emails on 5 August 2014 from Aleksandr Ildyakov, the director general of CUT-Service LLC (‘CUT-Service’) (a subsidiary of Sonoplus) to Alexander Voronkov at VIYM. Mr Ildyakov asked why there was such a large difference between the budget figure of “5 million” for July and the result of “1.1 million, incl. no inflow of Samatlorneftegaz” (‘SNG’).

In the forwarded email, Mr Ildyakov wrote that the Viatech group was experiencing “significant problems with business financing: late payment of wages to employees, taxes, leasing payments, overdue accounts payable to suppliers and contractors”. Further details are given, in particular that CUT-Service started ultrasonic treatments under a contract with Rosneft in June 2014 but the contract provided for payment in 60-90 days, meaning that payment would not start until September 2014. The email ended with a request for loans totalling $400,000 to pay liabilities. Arnold J specifically took account of this email as corroboration of the evidence from the financial statements of CUT-Service for 2014 and 2015, which were not in the VIYM disclosure or otherwise available to GEHC at the Enquiry Hearing, that CUT-Service was not trading profitably in those years: see [Arnold/85]. </p>

Mr Dutton focused on the line for income from SNG, which was zero for each month up to and including August 2014 and 681,372.50 roubles for September 2014. That equated to the price for two treatments under the contract with SNG. Mr Dutton contrasted this with Asplin J’s finding in [125] that “in the case of Samatlorneftegaz, 40 wells were to be treated between April and December 2014, 36 of which were completed by the end of November”. This was based on a schedule to the contract with SNG which referred to the treatment of four or five wells each month between April and December 2014. The email dated 21 July 2014 established that the treatments had started in June not April 2014. There is an error in what the judge said, stemming from an understandable misreading of GEHC’s closing submissions on this point. The figure of 36 wells to the end of November 2014 was not the number of SNG wells treated to the end of November 2014, but the figure appearing in the contract schedule. There was no evidence of the number of SNG wells in fact treated in 2014 or up to the end of November.  </p>

Given that the payment terms were 60-90 days, payments could not be expected until September 2014 and the cashflow analysis shows that payment was made in September for two<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>treatments.

The cashflow analysis simply showed payment received, not well treatments. Mr Dutton relied on the fact that the cashflow analysis showed zero receipts from SNG for October to December 2014 as establishing that no further payments were made under the contract in 2014. This is, however, a bad point. The analysis shows zero for each revenue line from all sources for those months. The reason is that the document is not a cash flow forecast but an analysis showing cashflow up to September 2014, as the heading “Reporting period: 8 months 2014” makes clear.  </p>

In our judgment, they would not do so. Professor Abramov made his witness statement for the Enquiry Hearing in November 2014, so one would expect the performance of the SNG and other contracts in 2014 to be very much in his mind. However, he made no reference to any problems with the contracts. His evidence that they were not running smoothly was given for the first time in cross-examination. When asked in re-examination to explain the reasons, he attributed it to the action of a jet pump destroying three “fields” (by which it is assumed he meant wells) and to the collapse of the rouble. He made no reference to problems with the SNG or other specific contracts, even though he was giving evidence in April or May 2015 when again such matters could be expected to be in his mind. </p>

The challenge as regards the treatments in 2014 goes back to the documents already discussed in relation to Professor Abramov’s evidence. As regards the joint venture in Tatarstan, it is submitted that its activities were, at best, far less developed than Asplin J appears to have assumed. Mr Gray complains that the judge was not referred to the witness statement of Andrey<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>Yakunin, a partner in VIYM, made in English on 4 December 2014 pursuant to the third party disclosure order. Mr Yakunin explained that, although a joint venture agreement (dated 21 March 2014) between a subsidiary of Sonoplus and a Tatarstan state company provided for investment by the latter of 99 million roubles (about $2.4 million), no investment had been made by the date of the affidavit and in consequence no revenue had been received. His affidavit is not new evidence; it was included in the trial bundle. Neither side referred Asplin J to it, although Mr Gray’s team did refer to a separate witness statement from VIYM in the same part of the trial bundle. Professor Abramov gave evidence that trials on wells in Tatarstan would start at the end of May 2015. It is difficult to see that Mr Gray can gain any assistance from this point about the Tatarstan joint venture. </p>

In his report for the Enquiry Hearing, the expert relied, but on a reduced basis, on assumptions as to the development of the business made in a feasibility study prepared in October 2010.<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>The VIYM documents showed that the assumptions had not been realised in the period up to and including 2014. Likewise, the actual number of well treatments was far lower than contemplated when VIYM invested in Sonoplus in 2012. In this respect, the further application to adduce new evidence (Application E)<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>includes a spreadsheet from late May 2013 summarising the volume of well treatments performed by CUT-Service at that date. It noted that, while the financing model required 140 treatments in the first half of 2013, 36 had been scheduled and 9 had been completed. Permission is also sought to admit spreadsheets containing operating forecasts and budgets for 2013 to 2015. They show, in particular, that the capital costs of manufacturing ultrasound tools were very much higher than those assumed by GEHC’s valuation expert. </p>

Shortly put, the points are (i) why would Mr Gray have wanted to maintain secretly interests in valueless assets, (ii) why would Mr Pronk have agreed to Mr Gray secretly maintaining those interests, and (iii) why would Mr Pronk and other witnesses have conspired to present a false case to the court? </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This submission faces the difficulty that the secret agreement, as found by Asplin J, was in 2012, prior to the execution of the 2012 SPA in August. The steps which the judge found to have been taken to implement it, principally the issue of shares in Petrosound to Mr Volchenkov and Mr Ivanov of VIYM as nominees for Celloteck, took place in November 2013.  Moreover, Mr Gray made his witness statement for the Liability Hearing, denying any interest in the technology, in August 2012. The evidence which Mr Gray applies to admit does not relate to the value or the perceived value of the Russian or ROW business in 2012 and has very little, if any, bearing on value at that time. Nor does the evidence have a significant effect on the perception of value in 2013. Arnold J’s analysis, and the expert evidence before him, was directed to value in July 2015. Asplin J’s finding of the secret agreement was based on a large number of factors, including her assessment of the witnesses who gave oral evidence. We can see no basis on which it could be said that the new evidence would have any material influence, still less an important influence, on her finding. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It may be noted that the available evidence suggests that the Russian and ROW business was perceived as valuable in 2012 and beyond. VIYM invested $3 million for a 25.1% share of the equity of Sonoplus in 2012, and between January 2013 and April 2014 it made loans totalling $3.45 million to Sonoplus. In the course of 2012, RegEnersys acquired a controlling stake in Klamath Falls, which held the US patents, for $2.1 million, and in September Celloteck acquired the remaining shares. Mr Gray’s own closing submissions to Asplin J at para 189 underlined his efforts up to and including 2012 to obtain an interest in the technology and the similar efforts of Mr Kantor and Mr Knight after the 2012 SPA. </p>

In the same paragraph and at [116], the judge referred to an email sent on the same day by Mr Volchenkov to the Russian Scientists, forwarding Mr Knight’s proposal and saying “We need to think…I would propose admitting him [Mr Knight] instead of Rob’s 30% <span style="font-family:'Segoe UI Symbol';font-size:14pt">☺</span>, so that Sonoplus had 51%. In addition, what’s going on with Azerbaijan: 49/51% - international affairs were split with Rob, CIS and the world…This should be discussed and the issue should be raised with the Board of Directors with a presentation made.”. “Rob” was a reference to Mr Gray, but the judge accepted that it was never envisaged that he personally, rather than the RegEnersys fund, was to be the investor.

That email was in the VIYM disclosure but not included in the trial bundle. The omission was significant, it was submitted, for two reasons. First, GEHC had argued that the smiley face showed that any idea of replacing “Rob’s 30%” was a joke because they all knew that they were committed to giving ‘Rob’ 30% and could not simply shift his share to Mr Knight. This construction of the smiley face email was not sustainable when read with the later email. Secondly, the later email showed that as late as May 2013, the question whether GEHC would take a 30% interest in the Russian business and a 51% interest in the ROW business had not been settled, thus undermining the finding of the 2010 agreement. </p>

She does not refer to it as having any significance and relies on the email only because of its references to the 30% and 51% interests. As to the second submission, it is one of a number of documents and other items of evidence on which the judge relied for her finding of the 2010 agreement, and Mr Gray’s continuing involvement after the 2012 SPA. Its references to “Rob’s” interests are consistent with that agreement. If the judge had found that the 2010 agreement was an enforceable contract, the later email might have had more significance, but even then it must be remembered that it was an internal email within VIYM which was not a party to the 2010 agreement. </p>

It is headed “Marketing Activities of “Viatech” Group of Companies Outside of Russia”. It starts “Currently we do not consider it reasonable to continue cooperation with the “Heerema” company on the transference to it of shares in “Viatech” LLC”. It refers also to Mr Knight’s efforts to find investors and states that he has found three investors willing to finance international activities and that he had offered to buy out patents from the Heerema company. Mr Knight had also suggested an allocation of shares in the company operating outside the former Soviet Union, of Sonoplus 49%, new investor 49% and Mr Knight 2%.

The document clearly refers to an existing arrangement with the Heerema group (to which, as we have said, VIYM was not a party) and suggests that it should be replaced.

It does not appear to us that <span style="font-style:italic">Takher v Gracefield Developments Ltd</span> is of much assistance, as it concerned the circumstances in which an unsuccessful party can apply to set aside a judgment obtained by fraud, in which case it is no bar that the relevant evidence could have been obtained by the exercise of due diligence. In such a case, as the majority judgment of Lord Sumption makes clear, an unsuccessful party has a cause of action to set aside the judgment.  It was not concerned with the admission of new evidence on an appeal from the original order. As regards the statements of Denning LJ, there have been considerable developments since 1951 in the standards to be expected from parties and their lawyers. The result is not, however, that Mr Dutton’s submissions are necessarily to be accepted. Can a party rely on the negligence of the other party in complying with its duties to the court to overcome the effect of its own lack of diligence in not obtaining the relevant documents or (in this case) reviewing those documents which were already in its possession? In addition, would the effect of nondisclosure by one party to its expert be restricted to its effect on the expert’s evidence, or would it go further and provide a route for the admission of the relevant documents for all purposes, notwithstanding the other party’s inability to satisfy the <span style="font-style:italic">Ladd v Marshall </span>criteria? </p>

That witness statement (‘the Bruce WS’) had been lodged in support of the Set Aside Application in October 2016.  The witness statement in support of the subsequent Application E seeking permission to admit a larger number of documents (Elliss (4)) also relied on the Bruce WS.

They are a letter dated 9 January 2017 written by Mr Nimmo, the responsible partner in Rosenblatt, to Asplin J in the context of the Set Aside Application and an earlier email dated 4 October 2016, enclosed with that letter, from Mr Nimmo to Bird &amp; Bird immediately after the issue of the Set Aside Application.  Bird &amp; Bird had taken over from Rosenblatt in acting for GEHC after the Enquiry Hearing<span style="font-style:italic">. </span>Mr Dutton submitted that these showed that Mr Nimmo accepted that he did read relevant documents but did not provide them to Dr Becker, GEHC’s valuation expert, or to the court because he regarded them as transparent fakes or as irrelevant to the issues in the case. Mr Gray’s case is that Mr Nimmo was not only wrong in those views but was in breach of duty in taking those views and, on that basis, not providing the documents to Dr Becker or the court.  </p>

The Set Aside Application was ready for hearing, whereas the judge had made third party disclosure orders relating to valuation, with the result that the valuation issues would not be ready for hearing for some considerable time.

Where there is no hearing or ruling on the merits, it is difficult to see more than a technical distinction between the withdrawal with an order dismissing the application and a withdrawal without such an order. That a principle designed to achieve a just result for the parties and a proper application of the court’s resources should turn on such a distinction is to defeat the purpose of the abuse of process doctrine.

The only order made on the first application was one reciting that the application had been withdrawn and providing that the costs of the application be costs in the case. As it happens, on the facts of the case, the judge held that the second application was not an abuse of the court’s process. Mr Dutton submitted that, while the approach taken by Nugee J may be applicable to sequential interlocutory applications, it could not apply in this case where an interlocutory application was withdrawn specifically on the basis that Mr Gray maintained his position and that it would be a matter for an appeal in due course. In fact, the letter withdrawing the application did not reserve the issue for an appeal but, even if it had, we are unable to see any good reason why it should make any difference. </p>

First, the argument was raised only when Mr Gray made his second application in April this year. We see no reason why that should debar GEHC from taking the point. Secondly, Mr Gray was given permission to appeal on Grounds 9.3 and 9.4. That cannot possibly be an answer. The grant of permission to appeal does no more than that: it does not inhibit the approach or course that the full court may take on the hearing the appeal. Thirdly, there was good reason for Mr Gray to withdraw the Set Aside Application. The reason given at the time was that it had “limited practical utility”, in the light of the directions given by Asplin J. In our view, there is no reason why he should be permitted to revive this challenge, having abandoned it at a time when it was ready for hearing and Asplin J had given directions for it to be heard in October 2017.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">An order that a defaulting fiduciary should transfer a beneficial interest he holds in an identified asset is an appropriate order for a judge to make following an enquiry into the fiduciary’s account. The enforcement of fiduciary duties by the court would be seriously impeded if the judge could only make such an order if it were possible at that point to identify precisely who held the legal title to the asset.  There are many cases in which the assets of a fiduciary are held through a complex network of corporate or trust vehicles.  This may be the case even if there is no intention to conceal or obfuscate ownership.  As long as the beneficial interest in an asset is capable of identification, the legal ownership of it is a matter that can be considered at the next stage of valuing or ordering the transfer of the asset.  The order following the enquiry will, as here, give directions for any further proceedings needed, including </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The first point to reiterate is, as we have explained above, Asplin J did not find that a legally binding agreement had been made in October 2010, entitling RegEnersys as a matter of enforceable right to any interest in either the Russian or the ROW business. She found that an arrangement or understanding had been reached that RegEnersys would receive a 30% interest in the Russian business and a 51% share “in an international roll out of the technology outside Russia” ([Asplin/179]). As at the date of the trial before her, the Russian business was being carried on by Petrosound and, as she found, RegEnersys had received its 30% interest through the 15% shareholding issued to it and through the 15% shareholding issued to Mr Volchenkov and Mr Ivanov. The position was very different as regards the ROW business. On the evidence before Asplin J, it had yet to start, certainly as a business separate from Petrosound and its subsidiaries. Although it had been contemplated that it might be carried on by Petrosound International Limited, a company incorporated in England in October 2013 by Mr Knight for this purpose, that company never traded and it was dissolved shortly before the trial: see [Asplin/118]. There was no evidence of any other corporate entity that had yet been identified to replace it.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The position at the date of the trial therefore, as found by Asplin J, was that “it is intended that a 51% interest in any international business which may be commenced after these proceedings is to be held for RegEnersys/Mr Gray”: [Asplin/183]. In some of the documents in evidence the term “Opco” had been used to denote the entity through which the ROW business would be conducted. The same term was used by the valuation experts, and in places by the judge, for the same purpose. However, it was never suggested that “Opco” in fact existed at the date of the trial. Asplin J made the position clear at [Asplin/255] where she referred to “the potential interest in an Opco”. </p>

There was an arrangement, but not a legally binding agreement, that RegEnersys was to receive a 51% interest in any ROW business that might in the future be commenced. In practice this was likely to mean a 51% shareholding in any company through which such business was conducted. By reason of his 51% interest in RegEnersys and the secret agreement made in 2012, Mr Gray would himself have a 51% interest in any such interest of RegEnersys in a future ROW business. </p>

Although Asplin J found that it had been intended that the international business would be carried on by [Petrosound International Ltd], she also found that it could take a different form. Although an operating company was envisaged, there is nothing in her judgment to exclude the adoption of a different business model. It is now known that, as at the Valuation Date, Petrosound's international business was being carried on by its subsidiary Sonoplus and took the form of a licensing business. Accordingly, I must value that business. The fact that it can now be seen that Petrosound's international business was subsumed within Petrosound (which is why Dr Becker included a value for OpCo in his valuation of Petrosound) is a conundrum for the Court of Appeal to attempt to resolve if need be. It is not my function to value the opportunity to carry on an operational business, even if that is legally possible, because that is not what the order dated 28 July 2015 requires. Moreover, as will appear, that was not the approach which Dr Becker adopted. Finally, I consider that the reality principle means that Sonoplus must be taken as it was on the Valuation Date, namely a company which was carrying on both the Russian business and the international business and whose financial position was as described above.” </p>

By seeking to exploit the opportunity after resignation he is appropriating for himself that property.  He is just as accountable as a trustee who retires without properly accounting for trust property.  In the case of the director he becomes a constructive trustee of the fruit of his abuse of the company’s property, which he has acquired in circumstances where he knowingly had a conflict of interest, and exploited it by resigning from the company.” </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">CMS Dolphin</span> the remedy that the claimant was seeking and that it ultimately obtained was not the transfer back to it of ‘the opportunity’ but an account of the profits which the defaulting fiduciary and his new company had made from exploiting the opportunity.  The judge in that case did not decide that the opportunity was truly a form of property in the sense that the opportunity itself, rather than the profits derived from it, could be the subject of an order for transfer. GEHC also drew our attention to the description of a business opportunity as “an intangible asset” by Arden LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Lindsley v Woodfull </span>[2004] 2 BCLC 131, [26].  Again, that may be a helpful description when explaining why it is that the fiduciary is liable to account for profits arising from the exploitation of the opportunity.

They submit that the precise nature of the interests Mr Gray received and the terms of the shareholder agreement governing the potential for any revenue from those interests were no basis for denying GEHC any remedy.  We disagree. The order that GEHC sought transferring to it the shares in Petrosound or ‘OpCo’ went beyond the findings as to the benefits Mr Gray had received.  He had not received an interest in the shares themselves but only a 51% interest in the assets transferred to Celloteck which held the 15% shares in Petrosound through Chiloquin and a further beneficial interest in the VIYM Executives’ 15% share. An order that Mr Gray transfer the shares or 51% of the shares would give GEHC more than its entitlement.  Further, Celloteck’s own entitlement to any monies from its interests in the Petrosound shares was very speculative.  Arnold J had described in the Valuation Judgment the terms of the shareholders agreement between VIYM and Petrosound, the two shareholders in Sonoplus.  Petrosound was not entitled to any income from Sonoplus or its subsidiaries until the loans made to the business by VIYM’s client had been repaid in full.  Petrosound’s shareholding in Sonoplus was partially pledged as security for those loans: [Arnold/79]. In our judgment these findings amply justified </p>

We reject this criticism.  Once proceedings reach the stage of formulating relief, it is essential that the judge’s discretion is exercised on the basis of the facts as they appear at the time when that order is to be made, not on the basis of findings that have since been shown to be inaccurate or incomplete. Both sides had acquired documents after the Enquiry Judgment pursuant to disclosure orders made by Asplin J during the course of 2016.  The picture had not remained static between the Enquiry Hearing and the Valuation Hearing.  It was common ground at the Valuation Hearing that Petrosound had been dissolved.  There was no evidence that GEHC was entitled or had evinced any intention to apply to reinstate it.  The poor financial state of the Russian business as described in the Valuation Judgment fully justified Arnold J’s conclusion that there was no need to consider further whether, for example, the business had been transferred before the company’s dissolution to another entity in which Celloteck might have been given an interest.  If the ROW Business Asset had been relevant, which it is not for the reasons given above, his finding that the licensing business had generated no value and showed no signs of doing so in the future removed the need for any detailed exploration of how possible remedies might have been structured and enforced if the ROW business had proved successful.   </p>

It seeks an order that Mr Gray take all necessary steps available to him to require Professor Abramov or the VIYM Executives or any third parties to transfer their shares to GEHC and further that Mr Gray serve an affidavit providing a full account of how those interests were held by him or what had become of them and the steps he had taken to satisfy those obligations.   </p>

The correct approach, in principle, would have been to ascertain the full period over which the work referable to the consultancy fee was performed, both before and after October 2012, and to permit the deduction of expenditure properly referable to that work by the application of generally accepted accountancy principles: [192] – [193] .  We dismiss Ground 3A.2 and hold that Asplin J was entitled to use the amount of the RegEnersys fund that had been actually invested plus an additional amount of $100 million to reflect work done in considering potential investments when calculating the percentage of the consultancy fees for which Mr Gray was liable to account: [200].  </p>

In respect of these grounds we hold that Asplin J did not find that the 2010 agreement was a legally binding agreement between RegEnersys and the Russian Scientists that the former would receive 30% of the company established to carry on the Russian business and 51% of the ROW business: [277] – [282].  Mr Gray did not raise the issue of the existence of the 2010 agreement in his grounds of appeal and did not have permission to raise it: [288].  In any event we find that the challenge is not well founded. Asplin J did not err in failing to consider as a separate issue what Mr Gray says was the inherent implausibility of the case being put by GEHC: [297].  Her finding as to the existence of the 2010 agreement is not vitiated by a failure to address certain documents said to undermine GEHC’s case: [311] – [312].  We reject the submission that Asplin J adopted an incorrect or unprincipled approach to the drawing of adverse inferences from (a) Mr Gray’s failure to deal in his evidence with payments made indirectly to the Russian Scientists: [319], or (b) her conclusion that certain documents had been withheld from the court by Mr Gray: [320] – [333]. We further reject the submission that Asplin J failed to address the seriousness of the allegations made by GEHC that Mr Gray had conspired with other witnesses to hide his interest in the ultrasound technology through false documents and evidence, particularly in relation to the 2012 SPA and the secret agreement: [340]. </p>

We find that the new evidence does not meet the test for admission in <span style="font-style:italic">Ladd v Marshall</span> because Mr Gray could with reasonable diligence have identified the relevant documents from the VIYM disclosure in time for the Enquiry Hearing: [358].  We find, further, that the documents would not have had an influence on the result of the case because (a) they would not have led to the acceptance of Professor Abramov’s evidence: [371] – [373], (b) they would not have affected Asplin J’s view of the viability of the technology: [379]; (c) they could not have caused Asplin J to conclude at the end of the Enquiry Hearing that the Business Assets had no value and so alter her view as to the credibility of Mr Gray’s evidence: [383] – [385]; and (d) they did not undermine Asplin J’s finding as to the existence of the 2010 agreement: [390] – [392].

Just as those principles guide the appeal court in determining the appeal, so they must guide the first instance court or the appeal court in deciding whether to give permission to appeal findings of fact. In framing draft grounds of appeal, and in advancing submissions in favour of the grant of permission, the putative appellant must anchor their case to those principles and explain which of them is engaged, and why, as regards each challenge.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This is vitally important, because an appeal against findings of fact in any case, but particularly in a factually complex case such as the present, will absorb a significant amount of the time and resources not only of the parties and their advisers but of the court. As we earlier mentioned, the hearing of the present appeal took six full days and the preparation of this judgment has absorbed a great deal of judicial time. After all that, we have firmly concluded that there was no real substance to the challenges made by Mr Gray to the findings of Asplin J under Grounds 6 and 9. The only exception arises from the inconsistency between the findings of Asplin J and Arnold J as to the ROW business and Opco, which gave rise to essentially legal issues as to the appropriate remedy. At least some of the Grounds other than 6 and 9 raised arguable points, and indeed Mr Gray has succeeded on a couple of them, but they principally raised issues of law and could have been completed in a hearing of two days at most. With the exception of the inconsistency just mentioned, we consider that this is one of those cases where permission to appeal should not have been given as regards Grounds 6 and 9.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It is very unfortunate that in this case the application for permission to appeal against Asplin J’s order was heard, not by the trial judge shortly after she had delivered judgment, but by a different judge over four years after judgment had been given. Arnold J was, of course, familiar with the case having dealt with the valuation issue, but there was no need for him to be familiar with the detail of the evidence that had been before Asplin J, save as regards viability and valuation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It was all the more unfortunate that the draft Grounds of Appeal, a 40-page skeleton argument in support of the application for permission to appeal and an 18-page witness statement by Mr Gray’s solicitor, containing additional detailed argument and with an exhibit of over 60 pages, was not served on GEHC’s solicitors until three working days before the hearing fixed to deal with consequential matters, notwithstanding that Arnold J had with commendable speed given judgment over four months earlier, only eight days after the conclusion of the Valuation Hearing.

	    <p style="margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">that background, leading counsel then appearing for GEHC (who had not appeared at the trial before Asplin J) understandably sought an adjournment so as to be able to make fully informed submissions. That application was refused and Arnold J heard Mr Gray’s application without the benefit of such submissions. We are far from convinced that permission would have been given on much of Grounds 6 and 9 if the opportunity for those submissions had been taken. While on many matters, including generally issues of law, there may be little that the successful party can say in opposition to an application for permission to appeal, we do not share the view that the same applies where detailed findings of fact in a complex case are challenged, and that goes as much for applications to this court as to the court below. </p>
