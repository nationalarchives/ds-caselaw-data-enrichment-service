	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On 2 April 1996 Inchcape Testing Services (UK) Limited (“ITS”) issued its certificate of quality in respect of a cargo of regular gasoline grade M2 due to be loaded on the <span style="font-style:italic">Kriti Palm</span> for carriage to New York (the “certificate”). The sample analysed was described in the certificate as that of a “Shore Composite Blend”. It was a composite sample derived that day, before loading of the vessel, from four separate shore tanks at the refinery of Mobil at Coryton in England. The certificate described a large number of properties of the gasoline, the test methods applied, and the results. The property with which this case is concerned was the gasoline’s Reid Vapour Pressure (“RVP”). The Colonial Pipeline Specification (“CPS”) on which the gasoline had been sold and for which ITS had been instructed to provide a certificate of quality required that RVP should be maximum 9 psi as found by test method ASTM D5191. Unfortunately, in error ITS tested the RVP by an alternative test method ASTM D323. The certificate stated that the RVP as tested by D323 produced a result of 8.22. Both that and all the other results listed on the certificate were within the nominal result requirements of the specification. The certificate stated, at its foot, “FUEL MEETS SPECIFICATION”.</p>

The on-sale was to Galaxy Energy (USA) Inc (“Galaxy”). The on-sale contract’s quality clause relating to the regular gasoline parcel stated “meeting statutory baseline” ie the CPS which had statutory force in the United States “with the following guarantees…RVP 9.0 psi”. The determination of quality clause stated: “As ascertained at loadport and confirmed by Calebrett”. Caleb Brett is an internationally famous name in the world of testing houses, and it resided within the Inchcape group. (The ultimate holding company is now known as Intertek Group plc.) ITS’s associate company in the US is ITS (or Caleb Brett) USA (“ITS USA”), which was appointed discharge port inspector under AIC’s on-sale. The on-sale determination of quality clause was not expressly stated to be final and binding. The determination of quantity clause, however, was stated to be binding: quantity was to be ascertained at discharge port by Caleb Brett (viz ITS USA) “whose findings are binding”. The contract’s payments clause stated that “Payment to be made against telexed invoice, telexed inspection report of out-turn quantity and quality…”. No mention was there made of any load port certificate of quality. The “general terms” clause incorporated the Inco terms of 1990 with latest amendments for “ex-ship duty-paid”. There was no express choice of law clause.</p>

On that day, 15 April, Galaxy faxed AIC to report that discharge tests gave an RVP for the regular gasoline parcel of 9.11 to 9.56. Those results were obtained from an analysis of samples of cargo taken from the vessel’s tanks. Galaxy complained that AIC was refusing to release loadport samples for testing. Galaxy said that it would refuse to discharge further until such retesting had proved the parcel to be on specification. AIC’s initial refusal to allow access to the loadport samples appears not long to have been persisted in, because on the same day ITS USA issued an analysis report on the regular gasoline parcel stating that its RVP as tested by D5191 was 9.04 and that analysis was carried out on the sealed sample for the composite blend ex shore tanks at the loading port. The seal number was recorded in the report. There was also an ITS USA D5191 test on a loadport sample ex the vessel’s tanks after loading, which recorded an RVP of 9.3.</p>

By then, still further analyses had been performed at Galaxy’s request by another well known testing house, SGS, on further samples obtained from the vessel’s tanks at New York, and these provided RVP results of 9.3 to 9.69.</p>

It soon emerged that ITS had tested by the wrong method for the purposes of its certificate. He initiated a retest by the right method, D5191, on surviving residues of the testing (and therefore unsealed) samples, taken from the four individual shore tanks, which had been tested at the time of the blending of the original cargo. These residues were by then some two weeks old. The retest was not carried out on a composite blend from the four shore tanks. The results therefore had to be subject to a further calculation to provide an overall result. This calculation was performed by Mr Rackham.  The calculated result was 9.33. The tests were carried out by Mr Michael Cooper, an ITS chemist, and have therefore become known in this litigation as the “Cooper retest”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On 17 April 1996 an important telephone conversation took place between Mr Tom Whitaker of AIC and Mr Nigel Lucas of ITS. Mr Whitaker was a trader at AIC. Mr Lucas was ITS’s general manager. AIC had already intimated a claim, and the failure of the conversation led to the appointment of lawyers on both sides. The majority of that conversation was recorded by Mr Lucas, and a transcript of it survives. Mr Rackham was present with Mr Lucas and heard the conversation, but did not participate in it. There was a dispute at trial as to whether Mr Lucas then knew of the Cooper retest or its results. Mr Rackham certainly knew of them. The judge found that Mr Lucas did as well. In that conversation it was common ground between Mr Whitaker and Mr Lucas that for the purpose of its certificate ITS had tested the RVP by the wrong method. Mr Lucas also told Mr Whitaker that he did not know whether the D323 test had been inaccurate or not. However, at what has turned out to be a critical point in the conversation, there was the following exchange:</p>

He therefore found that ITS was liable for all the financial consequences of AIC’s reliance on the certificate in an ongoing dispute and ultimately unsuccessful litigation with Galaxy. He found that implicit in what Mr Lucas said was a representation that the certificate was good and valid, or good and reliable, and that, by reason of his knowledge of the Cooper retest results, Mr Lucas was reckless as to the truth of that implied representation, which was “probably wrong”. He said (at para 284 of his judgment):</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second main issue is this. AIC commenced these proceedings on 17 May 2002, one month more than six years after the telephone conversation of 17 April 1996, and six weeks more than six years after the issue of the certificate. AIC explains the delay by reference to legal advice it received from its Swiss lawyers to the effect that the commencement of such proceedings against ITS would prejudice its defence of Galaxy’s counterclaim in Switzerland in proceedings brought there by AIC. The effect, however, of the running of more than six years is that, subject to an argument concerning continuing duties, AIC is time barred in respect of any of its other causes of action for breach of contract or duty, apart from deceit, <span style="font-style:italic">unless</span> it can bring itself within section 32 of the Limitation Act 1980 and in particular section 32(1)(b) which prevents time running in the case of the deliberate concealment of “any fact relevant to the plaintiff’s right of action”. In this respect AIC has complained that ITS has deliberately concealed the Cooper retest and its results until their disclosure in these proceedings in June 2004. There are a number of sub-issues implicit in this point, but in general it may be described as “deliberate concealment”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The cause of action in deceit was also prima facie time barred after six years. However, no time bar was relied upon at trial in connection with deceit, for reasons which are not transparent (but may be connected with the fact that section 32(1)(a) extends the running of time where “the action is based on fraud…until the plaintiff has discovered the fraud”). In any event, the judge did not deal with fraud on the basis that it was prima facie time barred – even though at para 12 of his judgment he recorded that ITS said that all claims (other than a claim for contribution from ITS to AIC’s liability to Galaxy) were time barred.  Indeed, we were told on this appeal that there is no time bar in fraud, which is not correct.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The judge, having found deceit, said that it was not strictly necessary to consider section 32(1)(b), and dealt with it relatively lightly towards the end of his judgment (at paras 293/332). He concluded that there had been deliberate concealment of the Cooper retest results, which he described as “a key piece of evidence, highly relevant to the conclusion that the Vapour Pressure results by test D323 stated in the ITS certificates of quality for the regular cargo were probably wrong” (at para 328). The judge found that the deliberate concealment had been carried out both by Mr Lucas and by his colleague Mr John Chalmers. In 1996 Mr Chalmers was the ITS claims manager. The judge found that both Mr Lucas and Mr Chalmers knew about the Cooper retest at latest shortly after the conversation of 17 April 1996. It is not, however, immediately clear which of many pleaded causes of action the judge had in mind in coming to this (obiter) conclusion about deliberate concealment, but possibly all.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is common ground, that were it to be necessary, that is to say in the absence of deceit, to come to a firm conclusion as to alternative causes of action and section 32 (or continuing duties), and if ITS remained liable on that basis to AIC in respect of such other causes of action, there would have to be a remission back to the commercial court for it to determine consequential issues of causation and quantum.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In sum, for the purposes of this introduction: there are two main issues, those of deceit and of deliberate concealment. Both depend on the unavailability to AIC until June 2004 of information about the Cooper retest and results. The finding of the judge at trial was that the original D323 results were probably wrong; that Mr Lucas was reckless as to the truth of his implied representation in his telephone conversation with Mr Whitaker on 17 April 1996 and was therefore guilty of deceit; and that both he and Mr Chalmers thereafter deliberately concealed the Cooper retest and its results from AIC in respect of unidentified causes of action. ITS challenge both these conclusions on appeal.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On behalf of ITS, Mr Jonathan Gaisman QC, who was not ITS’s counsel at trial, put the matter thus. There was no deceit. Mr Lucas, who had been away until the morning of 17 April 1996, had only a hurried briefing from Mr Rackham before his telephone conversation with Mr Whitaker. He was not told about the Cooper retest. Even if he was, he did not take in what he was told nor was he alive to its ramifications. And even if he had known about the Cooper retest, his honest judgment would have been that he was entitled, in a situation where the conversation was the prelude to the imminent appointment of lawyers by both parties to deal with a claim which AIC had already intimated, to reveal nothing. In fact, his dominant concern during the conversation was that Mr Whitaker was asking him to do something which he felt he could not do, which was to amend or supplement or replace the certificate. It was in that context that he said that ITS would stand by the certificate, meaning that it was a historical record which could not be tampered with. The judge, in finding deceit, erred in his interpretation of the conversation and in extracting from it an implied representation which accorded neither with what Mr Lucas actually said, nor with what he intended to say nor with what Mr Whitaker understood him to say. The judge failed to address the immediately following correspondence between the parties, which was a better guide to what was then intended and understood. In any event, he did not find that Mr Lucas knew that what he said was false, only that he was reckless as to the truth, but he applied a concept of recklessness which was more akin to negligence than the necessary dishonesty. Moreover, his reasoning was inadequate, and he paid scant if any attention to the need to address and to rationalise the rival factual cases, or to get into Mr Lucas’s mind. His finding of deceit could not stand. It was plainly wrong.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to deliberate concealment, Mr Gaisman said there was none. Such a concept required an unconscionable flouting of a duty to disclose, none of which existed. There was no unconscionableness, because the Cooper retest was not regarded as important, having been performed on unsealed residues of a testing sample, rather than on an official sealed and formally retained sample. There were better guides in the sealed loadport composite sample tested at New York, or in the sealed samples retained by ITS but untested by AIC. As for a duty to disclose, there was none. ITS’s duty was to carry out its instructions properly and carefully. It had not carried out its instructions, because it had used the wrong test. On the judge’s findings at trial, that even its D323 findings were probably wrong, it was open to conclude that there was additional negligence in the performance of the (wrong) test badly. All this was a breach of contract, but there was no additional duty of disclosure. As for those breaches of contract (or equivalent breaches of duty), AIC knew all that it needed to know, or could with reasonable diligence have learned all that it needed to know, in order to plead its right of action, back in April 1996. Therefore it was time barred, and section 32 did not avail it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to deceit, Mr Hamblen stressed that the judge had found that Mr Lucas (and Mr Chalmers) knew, understood and appreciated, at the relevant time, that the Cooper retest showed that the original D323 test had significantly understated the RVP of the regular gasoline and that the D323 certificate test result was therefore probably wrong. Thus the cargo, if it had been originally tested by the right D5191 test, would have been shown to be off-specification. The judge described the Cooper retest and its results as “key”. Moreover, he regarded the retest as having been done clandestinely, with the purpose of using its results against AIC if they had turned out favourably; but as it was, they were deliberately kept from Mr Whitaker. In coming to his conclusion of deceit, the judge had been unimpressed by both ITS’s principal witnesses, Mr Lucas and Mr Chalmers, whose credibility he regarded as suspect. If, as the judge concluded, Mr Lucas and Mr Chalmers were not telling the truth about the Cooper retest results and their respective knowledge of and understanding of their importance, then the implications were clear: they were lying because they appreciated that these were matters which AIC should have been told and were seeking to explain away their deliberate failure to do so. In such a case, where the principal witnesses had been disbelieved, it was particularly hard to reverse a finding of fraud made at trial.</p>

Mr Lucas himself acknowledged, in his evidence, that AIC should have been told about the Cooper retest results. It also followed from applicable international and internal ITS guidelines, as the judge found. Moreover, the Cooper retest was performed on samples which were held to AIC’s (and Mobil’s) order, or were even their property, and was therefore unauthorised: these were additional or cumulative reasons why ITS was under a duty to disclose both the fact of the retest and the nature of the results.</p>

In deceit, Mr Hamblen submitted that even if Mr Lucas’s mind had not been dishonest during the telephone conversation, he knew enough shortly thereafter to have become guilty of deceit when he failed, in breach of a duty to speak, to correct the way in which he had left matters during that conversation. Moreover, Mr Chalmers, as claims manager, was in the same position, and was also guilty of deceit in failing to correct the outcome of Mr Lucas’s conversation.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus, in a nutshell, the dispute was this. ITS had undoubtedly erred, and broken its contract, in failing to provide a contractual certificate relating to the testing of the cargo in accordance with its required specification. However, that cause of action had expired six years after 2 April 1996. The question was whether any cause of action survived the expiry of that limitation period. One answer was in deceit, premised not on a fraudulent certificate, but on a dishonest representation that the certificate was still effective when it was known to ITS, but in breach of contract and of duty not to AIC, that a retest demonstrated its inadequacy. The other answer, somewhat different but bound up in the first, was in the statutory concept of deliberate concealment which enabled some cause of action to survive limitation. A far distant third answer is said to be found in the nature of continuing duties.</p>

In the former case, the error was only relevant if it was material in the sense of actually affecting the ultimate result, and the question would then be whether the error was “manifest” for the purposes of the clause. In the case of a departure from instructions, however, such as employing the wrong test method, it was irrelevant that the practical effect was immaterial. Only an immaterial departure from instructions, such as one that could not even potentially affect the scientific or commercial process, would be irrelevant. That certainly did not apply to the use of the wrong test method, even where that could not affect the result. As Simon Brown LJ said at para 26(vi):</p>

As Mr. Goldstone has pointed out, it cannot be assumed that the choice of a particular method of testing is a consequence solely of the parties’ desire to achieve an accurate result. There may be different reasons which have been dictated by the terms of other related contracts and/or related letters of credit. The possibility that there may be such other reasons is by no means far-fetched in the context of a commercial contract which is likely to be one of a chain. These are not matters about which the Court can or should speculate. The starting point is that if the parties have agreed that a determination using method A is to be binding, then a determination using method B will not be binding because the parties have not agreed that it will be. It follows that the determination is not binding and the appeal must be dismissed.”</p>

Indeed, this is a much stronger case for that conclusion than <span style="font-style:italic">Veba Oil </span>itself, for in the present case it was never common ground that use of the wrong test was obviously immaterial. In the first place, and critically, conformity with CPS was necessary under US law for importation of the cargo into the US as regular gasoline of the appropriate grade. Thus, the cargo could not be imported as such, without either being blended anew so as to render its RVP to conform to CPS or being downgraded from regular gasoline to a blend stock. Moreover, although at trial, after hearing expert witnesses and choosing between them, Cresswell J found that the two tests, D323 and D5191, gave “comparable” results, that was a conclusion reached by the judge only after trial. Indeed, at the time of the conversation on 17 April 1996, it was believed that D323 would tend to give a lower, or at any rate a different, RVP reading vis a vis D5191.

It may have suited ITS to do the same in the context of accusations about its failure to withdraw its certificate. Even so, <span style="font-style:italic">Veba Oil</span> was discussed in ITS’s closing written submissions. It was there submitted that the law was still uncertain in 1996 and was only clarified in <span style="font-style:italic">Veba Oil</span>. It was therefore said that Mobil “(who are no slouches in this area of the law)” could be understood in the attitude it took in 1996 that it could continue to rely on the certificate even after the use of the wrong test was clear. Mr David Mildon QC, who was leading counsel at trial for ITS, then submitted that “That approach was correct on the then state of the law because the burden would have been on AIC to show that the use of the wrong method had materially affected the result.” In my judgment, that analysis was wrong for 1996, but in any event it was definitively wrong, even on Mr Mildon’s approach, at the time of trial.</p>

I refer under issue 6 below to test methods which are technically equivalent and would be expected to give results that are not significantly different. If the tests ASTM D323 and ASTM D5191 had been performed correctly the results should be comparable. Once it was clear that ITS had departed from instructions as to the test method (and used D323 instead of D5191) it was perfectly understandable commercially that AIC (with its very limited experience) would look to ITS (as an independent inspection company) for an answer one way or the other as to whether ITS was standing by the certificate which said “Fuel meets specification”, and act accordingly vis-à-vis Mobil or Galaxy.”</p>

In any event, the status of the certificate in the circumstances was ultimately a question of law – and AIC appointed (US) lawyers almost immediately. During the argument of the appeal, the court made it clear that it regarded the question of AIC’s inexperience as irrelevant, and Mr Hamblen did not seek to dissuade us otherwise. In any event, I do not think the judge was right to regard ITS, whether AIC was to be regarded as inexperienced or not, as being placed in the position of an adviser. ITS was an independent testing, inspecting and certifying house, but not a professional or commercial adviser, and least of all to one only out of a number of traders who might be affected by a certificate and because of that trader’s absence of experience in need of advice.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As of 1 January 1996, ITS and Mobil had entered into a contract for the provision by ITS of cargo inspection services. Although this contract was only between ITS and Mobil, it was pleaded by AIC and common ground at trial that, for the purposes of the joint instructions which Mobil and AIC had issued to ITS in respect of the <span style="font-style:italic">Kriti Palm</span> cargo, the contract bound ITS and AIC in addition. The terms of that contract therefore are at the basis of the relationship between those parties. The only term in that contract to which our (or the judge’s attention) was drawn is in its Schedule A, which is introduced in clause 1 of the contract as describing the “Work” to be performed by ITS. The important clause in Schedule A is:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In drawing out these implied obligations the judge had primary regard to international and ITS internal guidelines, to which I will refer below. Suffice it to say at present that there is a dispute as to whether the judge had regard to the applicable guidelines. ITS says that he did not, and has erred accordingly. To some extent, the judge supported his implied obligations by reference to admissions made by ITS’s principal witnesses, to which I will also refer below. Mr Hamblen accepts that the judge’s implied obligations are at the cutting-edge of the law, in that no other authority has stated an inspecting house’s duties in these detailed terms before. The judge himself recognised that his treatment of such duties rendered an appeal necessary. The first paragraph of his judgment stated that “This case raises important issues about the duties owed by inspection companies in domestic and international trade.” When asked by ITS to grant permission to appeal to this court, he refused to do so on the ground that there was a realistic prospect of appeal, and only did so on the alternative ground that there is some other compelling reason why the appeal should be heard, adding “The judgment contains an analysis of the duties of inspection agencies. This is of wide international importance.” Moreover, the judge did not derive his implied obligations by the traditional method of asking whether they were necessary. I will content myself for the moment with saying that the judge’s implied obligations read rather like legislation. An obligation to take reasonable care in the performance of services may, I suppose, be broken in all kinds of ways: but the duty is at any rate easily stated. Mr Gaisman on behalf of ITS did not agree with the judge’s restatement, and in particular challenged obligations (vii) and (viii). It will be necessary to consider the extent of ITS’s duties below.</p>

No Mobil product was ready to be loaded, nor could it be loaded until ITS had certified that it complied with specification. On 30 March, ITS issued its first certificate, for one of the four shore tanks nominated for loading, namely tank 75 x 1. This individual shore tank certificate stated that RVP tested by D323 measured at 8.91/8.98 (upper and lower tank level readings). The vessel commenced loading.</p>

An individual shore tank certificate, again for shore tank 75 x 1 but in respect of a second parcel, stated the D323 RVP results at 7.69/7.60. Another individual shore tank certificate, for shore tank 100 x 1, stated the D323 RVP at 7.83/7.81. A fourth individual shore tank certificate, for shore tank 61 x 4, stated the D323 RVP test results at 8.85/9.01. It is agreed that the average of these last figures is 8.93 and thus would have been within specification if performed by the right test. Nevertheless, because the gasoline from that shore tank failed the tests for MON and Olefins, that certificate stated “Fuel does not meet specification”. As for the overall blend certificate, the tests in respect of that were performed on a weighted lab blend from the other four samples. This produced a calculated overall RVP result of 8.22 and the other tests also fell within specification, possibly after some reblending. AIC and Mobil received all five certificates (the “certificates”).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is a dispute between AIC and ITS about the status of the various samples. ITS submits that a contractual “retained sample” is a term of art and refers to those samples formally preserved (for 90 days) and listed on the formal Sample List. ITS would accept in respect of these samples, which were intended to be consulted, with the authority of the clients, should any dispute arise, that ITS would not be entitled to use them unilaterally for its own purposes. However, ITS says that that did not apply to the testing samples, which could have been thrown away and in any event were no longer fit for official use. AIC on the other hand submits that all the samples brought into existence, both the unused retained samples and the testing samples used by ITS for the purpose of its tests were contractually or at any rate professionally to be retained for 90 days, were the property of AIC and Mobil, and could not be used again without their authority. AIC accepts that the results obtained by retesting the already used testing samples could not be made certifiable, but nevertheless regards them as potentially valuable evidence. That was disputed by ITS’s principal witnesses, albeit, as will appear below, its witnesses were not entirely unanimous on the subject.</p>

Thus “results concur with load port C of Q” does not appear to be correct: the whole problem was that they did not. This may possibly have been a reference to the premium gasoline parcel. Moreover, “not possible to perform RVP test” is also problematic, since high RVP had been found on the retained shore and ship’s loading port samples: and this is Mr Sampino reporting to Mr Rackham. The possible meaning is that it was not possible to perform a reliable RVP test on the samples retained on board ship, owing to the nature of the samples and their containers.

Mr Mailey was the chemist who had performed the original load port tests at Mobil’s Coryton facility. The note reads “393 [sic] – RVP. 5191 Grabner”. This may, in a compressed form represent Mr Rackham querying with Mr Mailey the “wrong test” information passed to him by Mr Sampino, and Mr Rackham learning of the reason for the error from Mr Mailey. Apparently it stemmed from the fact that RVP or Reid Vapour Pressure suggests the “Reid” method, which in essence involves a “wet” procedure, the D323 test. However, D5191, which requires the Grabner machine, is in essence a “dry” procedure or its equivalent, and results, with the help of a calculation using a correlation equation, in a dry vapour pressure equivalent or DVPE. I put the matter rather simplistically and unscientifically, but I hope sufficiently. It may be during this telephone call to Mr Mailey that Mr Rackham asked Mr Mailey to investigate whether the testing samples used by Mr Mailey still survived: as a result of learning that they did, Mr Rackham had them delivered to Mr Cooper and asked him to retest them by the D5191 method (see below).</p>

Mr Hamblen submits that this is evidence that these testing samples had been formally retained as “retained samples”. So far as the document is concerned, I am not sure that it demonstrates much more than that as of 16 April Mr Rackham had asked Mr Mailey to locate the testing samples and retain them until further notice. It would seem that they had already by then been delivered to Mr Cooper for his retest.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">When he had completed his retest, Mr Cooper prepared a manuscript note of his findings, dated 16 April. It is not known exactly at what time that day his retest was completed or his note was compiled. His note stated that all sample bottles were 500 ml containers 50/75% full. The findings were that RVP on the individual samples varied from 8.47 to 9.46. Two shore tanks gave results below 9 and two above 9. However, his note did not provide a composite calculation. His witness statement said that the samples were noted to be broached and therefore not valid for vapour pressure testing. He repeated this in his oral evidence, when he said that, being broached, they were not samples which would normally be analysed at all for vapour pressure and “should not really be analysed”. That is something which he said he had mentioned to Mr Rackham at the time. However, as recorded in the judgment, he also said that if the broached samples remained intact and in good order one would generally expect vapour pressure to go down – because of the risk of light ends being lost. In this connection he also said that it would depend on how the samples were stored, and on the risk, with broached samples, of contamination.   The judge found that both D323 and D5191 tests state “do not perform tests on broached samples” (at para 261).</p>

Thus at 1409 Mr Rackham said in a further email to ITS at Rotterdam (where help had been offered) that “present indications are that situation is resolved”.</p>

The probable explanation of this note is that Mr Rackham had telephoned Mr Chalmers, had got on to his secretary in his absence, and had asked for her help in speaking to Mr Chalmers about the <span style="font-style:italic">Kriti Palm</span>. In these circumstances the call at 1333 probably came from Mr Chalmers, ringing in to Mr Rackham during a lunch break. Mr Chalmers had his laptop with him, which would have enabled him at some time to read Mr Rackham’s 1010 email. So much is clear. However, the note at 1333 is disputed. AIC’s case, which was accepted by the judge, was that this recorded Mr Chalmers telling Mr Rackham that he should harass Mr Cooper to come up with the results of his retest, so that a low RVP, ie under 9, could be established in order to resolve the issue. ITS’s case, on the other hand, remains that this is not a report of what Mr Chalmers said to Mr Rackham, but of what Mr Rackham explained to Mr Chalmers, namely that AIC was harassing ITS UK (whereas Mr Cooper had been referred to in Mr Rackham’s log as “LD”) because it, AIC, needed a low RVP (vis-à-vis Galaxy).</p>

He calculated what the judge described as “some kind of” average for the regular parcel as a whole (the nature of the calculation is not apparent from his document) and derived a figure of 9.16. He also “applied an EPA seasonal correction factor” (which has not been explained to us), deriving individual shore tank sample figures not found in Mr Cooper’s document. He then averaged those figures, and calculated an average of 9.33. This 9.33 figure is the one that Mr Rackham reported to his senior colleagues (see his 17 April email below) and has been used as the critical figure for the purposes of argument in connection with the claim in deceit. Ironically, Mr Rackham’s calculations were inaccurate. We have been told that the correct average figure to be derived from Mr Cooper’s results, accepted at trial, was 9.1, a figure with which Mr Lucas was at times cross-examined.

However, AIC, in a faxed letter signed by Mr Sampino, repudiated any liability, saying, somewhat strangely, that “the load port samples have been tested and the results show that the product is fully within spec, thus proving that the disport samples are not representative of the actual cargo”.

First, the judge does not say that Mr Lucas or Mr Chalmers knew, understood and appreciated the matters set out in paragraph 198 of his judgment. This is possibly important because, unless one has been able to eliminate contamination from a comparative exercise, it is impossible to find that a retest of loading samples and comparable disport figures are mutually corroborative. Secondly, the judge at this point does not explain why he states that Mr Lucas and Mr Chalmers knew, understood and appreciated what Mr Revell had opined or what the judge found to have occurred on the balance of probabilities. It remains to be seen whether that is subsequently explained. Thirdly, the judge does not say at what stage Mr Lucas and Mr Chalmers had the requisite knowledge.</p>

No previous issue had asked a question as to Mr Lucas’s state of knowledge at that time, except issue 23, which was limited to the Cooper retest and its results: “<span style="font-style:italic">Did Mr Lucas know of the re-tests and the results thereof (i) by the time of the telcon on 17 April 1996 and (ii) thereafter?</span>” The judge had dealt with that issue briefly, making the findings set out in para 89 above. It appears therefore to have been treated as axiomatic or implicit in those findings, relating to what Mr Rackham told Mr Lucas, that Mr Lucas assimilated the information, contextualised it, and immediately and consciously derived all the knowledge which the judge had considered was to be derived on the balance of probabilities with the help of expert witnesses by the conclusion of the trial.</p>

That might be right, but there is no real way of telling. All one can say is that the transcript, from where it begins, reads as though it is quite close to the start of the serious part of the conversation, for Mr Whitaker’s first comment is to make the point that D323 had been used instead of the CPS requirement for D5191, and his second comment is that already cited of “why I am calling you on a fairly urgent way”. Once started, the transcript reads as though it is complete, and it ends with Mr Lucas saying “Bye”.</p>

It will be recalled that Mr Rackham had said in his first email (that of 16 April) that Mr Sampino had reported to him that it was not possible to perform a RVP test “as all samples comped in tin cans”. Mr Gaisman submits that the impossibility of which Mr Lucas was speaking was the impossibility of a certifiable or reliable further certificate. Mr Lucas was not denying the existence of available samples, and all parties would have known about the formally retained samples, some of which had already been tested at New York by ITS USA (Caleb Brett), something to which Mr Whitaker had just referred.

In the light of the absence of Mr Whitaker’s evidence from the trial, it is also Mr Whitaker’s only statement. Like Mr Lucas’s fax to which it is a reply, it is not at any rate in substance mentioned in the judgment below. It is quite likely to have been drafted with legal assistance. It will be noted that the issue raised in the first paragraph is an issue of validity of the certificate – the <span style="font-style:italic">Veba Oil</span> point. The paragraph seeks to downplay Mr Whitaker’s telephone demand for a new certificate stating the cargo to be off specification to a mere enquiry: if the old certificate is not valid does it need to be reissued with corrected results for the right test? As for the critical third paragraph, this properly links Mr Lucas’s “stand by” comment with his repeated comments that he cannot be certain about the quality of the goods tested by the right test. It is somewhat inaccurate, however, in glossing what Mr Lucas said about standing by the certificate with standing by its results.</p>

Mr Lucas’s fax is headed “Cargo: Reg. Unleaded/Prem. Unleaded”, ie referring to both parcels of gasoline. This was the “above cargo” of which he spoke in the fax. This was in one sense an error, because the RVP problem had only arisen about the regular gasoline parcel. That had been clear to Mr Rackham, see, for instance, his resumé email of early on 17 April. Nevertheless, in the telephone conversation Mr Whitaker had more than once referred to a problem with <span style="font-style:italic">both</span> parcels. Thus, Mr Whitaker had spoken of a certificate for both M2 (regular) and R2 (premium) grades as having erroneously stated the relevant parcels to be on specification when the wrong test had been used: and it was in that context that he had said that “I don’t have colonial” and asked for a new certificate. In an important sense he was right, for of course Galaxy was also making a fuss about another property of the premium parcel, although not about its RVP.</p>

Mr Cooper had found the premium parcel RVP result by D5191 to be 8.12/8.17. Mr Rackham had recalculated it (erroneously) at 8.34/8.54. The original premium parcel certificate of quality had given the D323 result at 8.12/8.26. At New York, the ship’s composite blend sample for the premium parcel had been tested by the D5191 method at 8.11 and the on discharge test had resulted in readings of 8.37/8.43: in terms of RVP there was no specification problem, for the limit for premium R2 grade was again 9.</p>

He said that he did not think that he told Mr Lucas about them, and he repeated that evidence at trial. He also said in his first statement that he was sure he gave Mr Lucas as full a briefing on events as possible but could not recall the detail. The judge preferred Mr Rackham’s general remark as supporting a finding that he did tell Mr Lucas about the Cooper retest and results. On that basis, Mr Rackham above all, although the more junior manager, could have been expected to be fully complicit with any dishonesty involved in the conversation. He said of the conversation, after being shown the transcript and confirming that it accorded with his recollection:</p>

The reasoning of the Swiss court of appeal as found by Cresswell J (at para 65) was to this effect. There was no contractual provision that the shore composite blend would be determinative. The cargo supplied was therefore uncontractual, as shown by the discharge port tests. AIC therefore had to demonstrate an absence of fault, but it could not do so since (i) AIC knowingly loaded out of specification cargo, since the 61 x 4 shore tank parcel was out of specification; (ii) AIC had refused to produce the certificate in respect of that parcel, a certificate which Galaxy only obtained through ITS’s discovery in the English proceedings; (iii) Mr Whitaker knew that the composite blend certificate had involved the wrong test; (iv) despite the results obtained at New York by ITS USA, AIC refused any further testing or discussions, discharged the cargo, and enforced its contract with Galaxy; (v) AIC acted contrary to the most elementary rules of good faith.</p>

On any view the certificate, whatever its status under the AIC/Galaxy contract, was invalid because it had involved a test outside the governing specification. Therefore the question was simply whether the goods delivered were in accordance with specification. Even if the cargo quality, in the absence of any valid loading certificate, was to be judged at loading, the only evidence of any tests by the contractual test method showed the cargo to be out of specification. Therefore Galaxy must succeed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The judge dealt with the guidelines in two passages of his judgment. The first, headed “International standards” at paras 150/163, records the agreement of the experts. He there finds, according to that agreement, that NAMAS M10 applied to ITS West Thurrock, ISO 9002 (1994) applied to the ITS Inspection Division, and ISO 9001 (1994) applied to the Coryton laboratory at Mobil’s facility: that is to say that each of those units had accreditation with respect to the relevant standards. Accreditation is not mandatory from a regulatory point of view. However, lack of accreditation or withdrawal of accreditation may result in a company experiencing loss of credibility, subsequent loss of business and being prevented from applying for certain business. The judge went on to explain that NAMAS (now ISO 17025) dealt specifically with laboratory facilities; and that the ISO 9000 series stated the requirements for a quality management system applicable to organisations concerned with production, testing, research and inspection activities.</p>

He repeated (at para 187) the experts’ agreement that ITS West Thurrock was accredited to NAMAS M10 and ITS Inspection was accredited to ISO 9002. However, he then proceeded to ignore ISO 9002 and to refer only to NAMAS. The only explanation given by the judge for doing so is at para 191 where he says that “The certificates were issued by the Gray’s office which is based at West Thurrock. The relevant provisions of NAMAS Accreditation Standard M10 that applied to ITS West Thurrock represented internationally accepted practice at the material time…”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On this appeal Mr Gaisman submits that the judge has erred. The original testing by Mr Mailey was done at the Coryton laboratory, but the inspection certificate was issued by Mr Twyford as part of the ITS Inspection Division. This division was described as “Grays” (so-called after its previous location and referred to by the judge at his para 191 just cited), but was then based at West Thurrock where ITS had a building known as Caleb Brett House. There was also a separate laboratory at West Thurrock, which was where Mr Cooper worked. The critical standards were those which applied to the Inspection Division, which had issued the certificates. Thus Mr Rackham’s 16 April 1996 email was headed “Possible claim for Grays Inspection” and referred to “ITS Grays loadport C of Q”. However, the judge, without explanation, ignored the separate standards which applied to the Gray’s Inspection Division and instead applied standards which related specifically to laboratories. The laboratory at West Thurrock had neither issued the certificates nor performed the Mailey vapour tests.  The possibility of confusion between the two separate elements both in West Thurrock, viz the Inspection Division (“Gray’s”) and the West Thurrock laboratory should be noted.</p>

To this inquiry, which the judge flagged up as being important to him, Mr Mildon responded by referring to the two laboratories involved, Coryton  and ISO 9001 (Mr Mailey) and West Thurrock and NAMAS (Mr Cooper), but not, as Mr Gaisman submits that he should have done, to the ITS Inspection Division and ISO 9002. In the end, after expressing some preference for the Coryton laboratory as being the place where the original tests referred to in the certificates themselves had been performed, Mr Mildon was content to rest on NAMAS:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The judge relied on ITS’s internal manuals in one other important respect, and that was with regard to the retention of samples. He considered this under issues:<span style="font-style:italic"> 15. What was ITS’ standard practice as regards sample retention? What material was subject to ITS’ sample retention? 18. Was the material re-tested by Mr Cooper being held by ITS on behalf of AIC and Mobil? 19. Was the material re-tested by Mr Cooper properly to be regarded as the joint property of AIC and Mobil? 20. Should ITS have sought AIC’s and Mobil’s permission before conducting such re-tests and was ITS in breach of duty in failing to do so?</span> The judge considered these issues at paras 242/244 and 246/259.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In sum, the judge found it was ITS’s practice to retain all samples taken, including broached testing samples, for 90 days. It appears, but it is not entirely clear, that he considered that the RVP testing samples (used by Mr Cooper) were “retained samples”, a submission made to him by Mr Hamblen. Thus he referred to them as “retained and broached” samples (at para 252) and regarded it as significant that in the draft report dated 3 April 1996 (see at para 57 above) these samples had been listed as being retained for 90 days (at para 253 of his judgment). Regardless of the precise legal status of those samples prior to AIC’s complaint, they ought to have been recognised as “important evidence which should in the circumstances have been held to the order of Mobil and AIC” once a complaint or doubt had been raised about the original tests (para 255). He cited Mr Lucas’s evidence that these samples were potentially important and that it was not appropriate to take them and use or retest them without informing the clients (para 256: see, however, herein below under paras 214/215). He therefore found that ITS was “in breach of a duty to take reasonable care” in failing to seek permission from AIC and Mobil before conducting the retest. He did not, however, expressly find whether or not the samples were the joint property of AIC and Mobil. He concluded by stating:</p>

The “Responsibility” clause merely assigns internal responsibility for the handling of samples. In any event, the broached Cooper samples were not “unused” surplus sample material. The judge’s conclusions could not be justified on the basis of this material.</p>

It is necessary to encapsulate the evidence given by Mr Lucas, and the judge’s findings on that evidence. That will leave Mr Chalmers’ evidence to consider. However I take Mr Lucas first, for two reasons. Mr Lucas held his telephone conversation with Mr Whitaker before Mr Chalmers returned to the office from his course: and there is no evidence that there was any contact between the two on the matter of the <span style="font-style:italic">Kriti Palm</span> prior to the telephone conversation. Secondly, the judge made no finding of deceit against Mr Chalmers. Ultimately, however, it will be necessary to consider Mr Lucas’s evidence in the light of other evidence including that of Mr Chalmers, and vice versa, especially for the purposes of AIC’s respondent’s notice concerning an on-going duty on the part of both Mr Lucas and Mr Chalmers to correct what Mr Lucas had said to Mr Whitaker on the telephone and in that context concerning the further allegation of deceit levelled at both of them.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The essence of Mr Lucas’s evidence was this. On the morning of 17 April 1996 he came entirely new to the problem of the <span style="font-style:italic">Kriti Palm</span>. He had only 15 minutes to be briefed on the problem by Mr Rackham. Mr Rackham did not tell him about the Cooper retest. He had faith in Mr Mailey as a chemist. Although it was clear that Mr Mailey had used the wrong test, the certificates issued by ITS remained the proper historical record of what Mr Mailey had found (using the wrong test). He, Mr Lucas, did not know whether there was a correlation between D323 and D5191. Mr Whitaker told him that D5191 would give a higher RVP reading than D323. What the loading RVP of the cargo was he did not know. He was happy to state that the wrong test had been used, but he was not prepared to issue a new certificate or equivalent statement to say that the cargo was off-specification when it had been loaded. He did not know whether or not it was, and there were no samples available which could properly permit him to certify that the cargo had been off-specification. This was despite the disport results, of which he knew. He was wary and upset that Mr Whitaker was asking him to do something that he thought that ITS could not properly do. It was in that sense, and because he regarded the existing certificate as the historical record of what ITS had done, that he said that ITS would be standing by it. It was a case of “publish and be damned”. He was also wary because he was facing a claim situation where legal action had already been threatened. In those circumstances he was not prepared to admit that there had been any fault on the part of ITS – other than that the wrong test had been used. His wariness had led him to record the conversation at the time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">After the conversation, he was very upset. That had led him to write in the terms of his fax later that day. He also instructed Mr Pople that day, the only time he had instructed lawyers. As for the Cooper retest, he did not recall when he found out about it, but he assumed he would have learned of it from Mr Chalmers at some later time. He was uncertain why Mr Rackham had ordered the retest. Opened samples were unreliable. They could not be made the basis of any new certificate. He still did not know the correlation of D323 and D5191, but he accepted it would be logical to assume that they would produce comparable results. If he had known of the Cooper results he would (“of course”) have had to tell Mr Whitaker of them, but with a warning that he should not have been relying on them. So, the fact that he had told Mr Whitaker that it was impossible to go back into the samples seemed to him now to be clear evidence that he did not know about the Cooper retest at the time, for such a statement “would have been … misleading”. And it would also have been misleading simply to say he did not know whether the certificated result was inaccurate, if he had known of the Cooper retest result.  On the other hand, there were other things he did not then know which he could have discussed, such as the correlation between the original and Cooper figures for the premium cargo. In retrospect that was significant.</p>

He agreed with the view expressed by Mr Loughead in a witness statement that these were “potentially important samples”, on the basis that “Any sample concerned with this ship is important, yes”. Nevertheless, he thought that Mr Rackham had been misguided to commission the Cooper retest. If he had known about it in advance, he would have stopped him: “It is ridiculous, do not do it”. The tested samples were two weeks old, they were unstable, and he would have regarded them as totally unreliable.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The end of his cross-examination was reached without Mr Hamblen having put to him that he had been deceitful in anything he had said or done. He had not even been directly challenged in his evidence that he had not known about the Cooper retest at the time of his conversation with Mr Whitaker. (He had been questioned, at the outset of his cross-examination, as to whether he had read Mr Rackham’s email to him of 16 April (which did not mention the Cooper retest) or Mr Rackham’s second email sent early on 17 April (which did mention the retest and its results), a copy of which had Mr Lucas’s initials (VNL) on it in manuscript. He was questioned on the basis that the latter email had been handed to him by Mr Rackham as part of his briefing, but he said he had not seen it until later.) He was not cross-examined on the basis of Mr Rackham’s evidence as to the nature of his briefing (see above at para 89). In one sense that had been equivocal, but it provided no direct evidence that Mr Rackham had told Mr Lucas about the retest: on the contrary, Mr Rackham had said that he did not think that he had told Mr Lucas. So that may explain the line that cross-examination had taken. When Mr Hamblen came to question Mr Lucas about his telephone conversation with Mr Whitaker, he did it expressly on the assumption that he then knew about the Cooper retest and results.</p>

The judge said that he thought it very important that “the case is fairly and fully put to every witness”. Mr Hamblen therefore resumed his cross-examination, and put a case of fraud in the most perfunctory of ways, and not by any specific reference to the Cooper retest results, nor by reference to the implied representation subsequently found by the judge, nor even by reference to any express words contained in the transcript of the telephone conversation.

Thus 8.22 for RVP was within specification. The judge then put (what I think of as the <span style="font-style:italic">Veba Oil</span> point): “But the specification required a particular test…so the fuel on that view did not meet the specification?” To which Mr Lucas replied that he did not know: “I could not look at this and say that the fuel did not meet specification because D323 was used…The question is: was it 8.22 and would it have been 8.22 by ASTM D5191? My feeling is, looking at this, I could not say it would not be…” (Mr Lucas thus reversed the burden of the legal effect of the error, but that is a matter of law.) The judge then obtained Mr Lucas’s agreement that an inspection house was like an “independent arbitrator”, and asked: “This may not be fair and I am simply trying to understand what happened, but the position that you took in this telephone conversation…was that you maintained that the certificate…was a valid certificate and that the fuel met specification”, to which Mr Lucas replied: “That was my view at the time and is still my view today.”</p>

If it is unknown, then of course the certificate will not be withdrawn, but it will be invalid nevertheless. “Invalid” in this sense also refers to the position between the traders involved, who so commonly contract, as all inspecting houses know, on the basis that the certificate is binding. The same was true of the certificate in this case, where the wrong test was performed, even if Mr Lucas did not recognise that.)</p>

In that role he had management responsibility for every Caleb Brett site in the United Kingdom (plus Norway and Nigeria). He held that position from 1990 to 1998.

Mr Lucas said that at the time of his conversation with Mr Whitaker on 17 April he believed that the certificates that ITS produced were reliable certificates. When giving evidence Mr Lucas said that he understood that Mr Mailey was working 100% for Mobil in the blending programme and then worked 50/50 for Mobil and AIC in the independent inspection and testing. Mr Lucas explained “if one was looking at RVP being measured and the blender making decisions about what extra components to put in as the hours go by, you would have a breadcrumb trail of RVP testing which would be a nice smooth curve up to the target point he was looking for. That would have told me a volume of information about how reliable that sample would have been.” Mr Lucas said that on 17 April 1996 he thought that Mr Mailey was involved in the blending exercise. If in fact Mr Lucas was mistaken as to Mr Mailey’s role in April 1996 he cannot have made proper enquiries.”</p>

I did not think you could analyse RVP 15 days later because the samples are unstable. The logic being they would not be representative of the same period after 15 days.” The Swiss courts did not know that the Cooper re-tests had been carried out by ITS. It was suggested to Mr Lucas that his answer for the purposes of the Swiss proceedings was misleading because no mention was made by him of the Cooper re-tests.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is a third element to his findings about Mr Lucas which is very much connected with Mr Chalmers and that is his findings related to Mr Lucas’s failure to mention in the telephone conversation, and their deliberate decision thereafter, not to disclose the Cooper retest and results to AIC and Mobil. I will deal with that separately below, after considering Mr Chalmers’ evidence. The judge’s views in this respect are based on his findings that Mr Lucas was told of the Cooper retest results by Mr Rackham prior to his telephone conversation with Mr Whitaker, and that, even if he did not then know of them, he and Mr Chalmers were aware of them very shortly thereafter (para 269). His views proceed, however, also on the basis that Mr Lucas and Mr Chalmers had a duty to disclose these retests to AIC (and Mobil), and knew that they did so (at paras 311/312). This is particularly relevant to the second main issue in the appeal, that of section 32 and deliberate concealment (the context of paras 311/312). Thus his findings in this respect cannot be separated from his views as to ITS’s legal obligations.</p>

As expressed in his judgment, Mr Lucas’s deceit consisted in what he had said, not in what he had failed to say. On the other hand, submissions on this appeal have indicated that there is an element of ambiguity or opacity in this connection. It is connected with the judge’s express finding that Mr Lucas had been deceitful because he had been “reckless as to the truth of this representation” (not that he had been knowingly deceitful). The judge does not explain this finding further, and Mr Gaisman submits that the judge, in that silence, had erred in adopting an essentially negligence test rather than a test of dishonesty.

He stamped the copy of Mr Rackham’s 17 April email which has “VNL” written on it in manuscript with his personal stamp on Sunday 21 April: showing that he was then working at home catching up with correspondence. That was the email which referred to the Cooper retest and the figure of 9.33. He accepted that the “VNL” looked like his handwriting. He was at no time in contact with AIC or Mobil.</p>

In his witness statement, Mr Chalmers said in general that he did not recall events clearly, and he did not remember the 1333 conversation. He did not think that “harass” was a word that he would use. He thought that “UK” was a reference to West Thurrock. He repudiated any suggestion that he would put pressure on a chemist for any particular result. He suggested the possible interpretation of Mr Rackham’s note that it referred to pressure on ITS from AIC, who did need to be able to justify a low RVP, but that could only be speculation.</p>

He pointed out that the Cooper samples were not “retained samples”, which was a term of art, but the residues or “slops” of samples taken originally for the purpose not of retention but of testing. After their original testing, they were kept, but ultimately only for disposal. He had never come across another case in which residues had been retested for vapour pressure, and such testing was invalid under all tests for vapour pressure. He said that the normal thing to do when there is a dispute is to draw fresh samples or, where appropriate, use the retained samples, and have them tested by an independent laboratory in the presence of representatives of both or all parties to the dispute, something called “referee testing”.</p>

On the other hand, the tests conducted at the discharge port did show that something was wrong with the original result, because that was the one result that was out of line.

He was neither a sampler nor an analyst, but his understanding was they were relied on because they were in the original condition with no danger of contamination. As for testing samples, they might very often be kept, but not for RVP because that test could never be repeated on the same sample. As for an RVP testing sample, that was spent, a slop, exhausted for the purpose it was drawn for, it could not be re-used, it was rubbish, a waste sample.

It is possible to infer that the judge had reservations, in the light of his findings concerning the “Harass UK” telephone call, about Mr Chalmers’ evidence concerning that and the value of the Cooper retest. The judge expressly contrasts the log entry with that evidence. It is not easy, however, to see what reservations the judge could have had about the other extracts from Mr Chalmers’ evidence highlighted in the above citations. (2) Those citations could leave a reader of that part of the judgment with the impression that Mr Chalmers was accepting that it was the Cooper retest RVP result which caused Mr Chalmers to be recognising that ITS should have written a letter saying it could no longer stand by the certificate. However, a fuller reading of the relevant parts of Mr Chalmers’ evidence (set out in the preceding section), given in answer to the judge’s own questions, shows that Mr Chalmers is considering, at trial, the consequences of a certificate which had been based on the wrong test method and of the discordance of disport results with “the result we have here”… “The RVP result…” … “In this certificate” (see para 241 above and the critically partial citation by the judge reproduced at para 247 above).</p>

(ii) In finding, on the basis of Mr Revell’s expert evidence, that the cargo would on the balance of probabilities have been off-specification if tested at loading by D5191 and that the certificate’s D323 result was probably wrong, the judge also concluded, without further elaboration, that Mr Chalmers, as well as Mr Lucas, “knew, understood and appreciated” these matters (at paras 198/203). (iii) In repeating that finding (at paras 204/205), the judge added a reference to Mr Chalmers’ acceptance that it was very unfortunate that Mr Lucas had said that ITS “will be standing by that certificate”, without commenting further on the context of that acceptance.

Its falsity, and the honesty of the representor, cannot begin to be considered until the representation in question has been identified. In the case of a written document, the representation can usually be pinpointed (unless questions of implication arise), but of course context remains everything. In the case of an oral representation, the identification may be a more difficult process, involving disputed testimony, but again context remains everything. In the present case, the oral conversation in question was recorded, so that evidential disputes as to what was said have not in practice arisen, despite the great length of time between the April 1996 telephone conversation and trial. However, two factors remain important. The first arises because the representation found by the judge, although based on express words (“We will be standing by that certificate”), was derived by implication as a matter of “overall impression” (judgment, para 283). The second is a general point relating to human conversation: although it is of course possible to be more or less deliberate about one’s speech, nevertheless the natural ebb and flow of conversation as part of an essentially interactive process means that it differs significantly from a written document. It does not necessarily have a single writer’s logic, it is not composed, and it cannot be read as a whole before its communication. For both these reasons, evidence of contemporary views of what the parties to the relevant conversation understood themselves to be saying or hearing may be of special importance.</p>

The pleaded representations (para 23A of the re-re-amended particulars of claim) are complex and various. I will attempt to simplify, for the purposes of this appeal. AIC pleaded in the first instance that the certificate (not the telephone conversation) contained a false representation in saying that “Fuel Meets Specification”. Next, as to the 17 April conversation, AIC pleaded that Mr Lucas expressly or impliedly repeated <span style="font-style:italic">that</span> representation “by refusing to accept that the Certificates were inaccurate and by stating that they would be standing by the Certificates”. I would understand that pleading as essentially putting forward the certificate’s “Fuel Meets Specification” as the critical representation, implicitly repeated in the telephone conversation by means of the matters just quoted. There was no pleading of a representation, express or implied, made in the telephone conversation, that the certificate was good, valid or reliable.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, how was AIC’s case on representation put at trial, as reflected in the judgment? The judge set out AIC’s case at paras 73/86 of his judgment. A case on negligent misrepresentation is referred to (at para 78) by reference to 17 April, that “ITS continued to represent that the fuel met specification and that Mr Mailey’s results were reliable”. That is, I think, the first reference to a representation as to the reliability of the certificated results. (Previously, AIC had merely pleaded, in support of its case that the critical representation was that made through the certificate’s statement that “Fuel meets Specification”, that in the telephone conversation Mr Lucas had “refus[ed] to accept that the Certificates were inaccurate”.) Thus the judge summarised AIC’s case on deceit at para 81 as follows: “Mr Lucas was at the very least reckless in maintaining that the fuel met specification and that the RVP result of 8.22 psi was reliable”. That seems to parallel, as one would expect, the case on negligent misrepresentation.</p>

That reflects the way in which Mr Hamblen seems to have put his case at trial. However, the judge went on (at para 284) to speak of a representation in different terms, saying that “The representation that the certificate (which stated ‘Fuel meets Specification’) was and remained a good and valid certificate” was false. And (at para 288) he referred again to “the representation that the certificate (which stated ‘Fuel meets Specification’) was and remained a good and valid certificate”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">(1) The representation found was imprecise and, in an action in deceit, unfairly so. As ultimately stated, the representation found was that the certificate “was and remained a good and valid certificate”. But along the way the submission that was said to be accepted was that the representation was that “the certificate was and remained a good and reliable certificate”. In either event, the representation was not, and could not be said to have been, expressly made, nor was it even said to have been implied, but it was derived as a matter of “overall impression”. For that reason it may therefore not be altogether surprising that the representation vacillated between the “good and reliable” and the “good and valid” forms. It has to be observed, however, that in this context “reliable” and “valid” are not prima facie co-terminous. (The polymorphous word “good” adds nothing and has to take its shade of meaning from either “reliable” or “valid”.) The certificate was undoubtedly invalid, not valid, because the wrong test had been used (<span style="font-style:italic">Veba Oil)</span>, but that of course was not the complaint made on AIC’s case in deceit. AIC knew that the wrong test had been used. It was not deceived in any way as to this aspect of the facts. If that had been the representation alleged (it was nowhere pleaded), the case in deceit would have been bound to fail, for, although a statement that the certificate was valid would have been incorrect (if one likes, false, but it seems better to say incorrect), that was a statement of law, not fact, and in any event, rightly or wrongly, Mr Lucas seems to have thought (but it is not entirely clear) that the use of the wrong test did not in itself invalidate the certificate. At any rate it was never suggested that Mr Lucas was dishonest in thinking, if he did, that the certificate survived invalidity despite the use of an admittedly wrong test. Moreover, it was AIC’s case, accepted by the judge in the face of <span style="font-style:italic">Veba Oil</span>, that the invalidity of the certificate for present purposes was irrelevant (Mr Hamblen’s reply submissions at Day 11.134).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As for “reliable”, however, what does it mean to speak of a reliable certificate? The judge has not explained this, nor has AIC on this appeal. Were it to mean a valid certificate, one that is reliable to work its effect in the contractual context, then its meaning parallels that of “valid”. The fact that the judge appears to have used the words “reliable” and “valid” as synonyms suggests that that was how he regarded the words, as being without distinction. Alternatively, and perhaps more literally, “reliable” could mean a certificate that was safe to rely on, in the sense that it was a certificate which could be used in the trade for the purpose for which it was intended without any reasonable doubt as to its effectiveness. The whole purpose of such certificates is to enable international traders to buy and sell certificated goods as being the goods so certificated. If a question mark opens up about a certificate, then those that deal in it may find themselves involved in a dispute, which is exactly what the certificate is designed to avoid. If that is the word’s meaning, however, then the situation remains the same as above. The certificate was not reliable. The wrong test had been performed. The certificate spoke only to that test and no other. No one knew, <span style="font-style:italic">by reference to the certificate</span>, what result would be produced by a different test. And in any event the required specification test had not been performed. But, of course, the fact that such a question-mark had opened up about the certificate was in the open. That was not AIC’s complaint in deceit.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A further alternative, and what I think Mr Hamblen perhaps had in mind in shifting AIC’s ground from that pleaded to a representation about reliability, whatever the judge may have thought, is that “reliable” was being used in the sense of “accurate”. Thus the positive representation, that the certificate was reliable, was substituted at trial for the pleaded representation, that fuel meets specification, to be derived from Mr Lucas’s refusal to accept that the certificate was inaccurate. The complaint was that Mr Lucas, by saying that ITS would be standing by a certificate which itself recorded that “Fuel meets Specification” was implicitly misstating the facts, since the fuel did not meet specification and the certified RVP result of 8.22 was materially wrong, in that it should have been over 9. That would at least be consistent with the case made by AIC on dishonesty, accepted by the judge, that Mr Lucas was fraudulent by reason of his <span style="font-style:italic">knowledge</span> that, if retested by D5191, a result of over 9 would probably have been obtained and that therefore the certified result of 8.22 by D323 was “probably wrong” (since Mr Lucas also knew that the tests were comparable): see at para 283 of the judgment).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">(2) When raising the question of what could be involved or implied in the remark that “we will be standing by that certificate”, or how the “overall impression” given by the telephone conversation might be encapsulated, consideration needs to be given, as the judge himself said, to the conversation as a whole. But a review of the conversation as a whole demonstrates a number of significant matters. First, it was common ground that the wrong test had been performed. Secondly, it was known and discussed that tests at New York had shown the fuel to be out of specification. Thirdly, there were demands by Mr Whitaker for a further certificate or statement that the fuel was out of specification; and in any event for compensation. Fourthly, the consequences of those factors were recognised as something on which AIC might well wish to be advised by lawyers, and Mr Lucas himself suggested as much to Mr Whitaker and offered to assist Mr Whitaker in obtaining such advice (see para 116 above). Fifthly, Mr Lucas said that he did not know whether there was any correlation between the two tests (in response to Mr Whitaker’s statement that D5191 would produce a higher reading than D323), and (although the judge was to find that Mr Lucas did know that the tests were comparable) there was no pleading of misrepresentation in this regard. Sixthly, and of particular importance, in answer to Mr Whitaker’s direct probing as to the inaccuracy of the D323 test, Mr Lucas repeatedly said he did not know and could not comment (see paras 111/112 above: “Well I can’t comment on that over the telephone. I really don’t know…I can’t say that. I don’t know…I can’t comment on that. I can’t say whether it is inaccurate or not”). None of those statements were the subject matter of complaint as being a false representation of Mr Lucas’s thinking. Seventhly, and also of importance, given the stress placed by AIC on the circumstance that the certificate stated “Fuel meets Specification”, is the fact that when Mr Whitaker put to Mr Lucas that he had a certificate saying “that it meets colonial specification” (the nearest that the conversation comes to dealing expressly with the certificate’s wording), Mr Lucas replied “You have a certificate from us. I can’t recall what it says” (in fact the certificate did not say that the fuel met colonial specification).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Pausing there, I would comment as follows. If one is seeking the “overall impression” of this conversation, in my judgment one would be bound to conclude that, whatever “We will be standing by that certificate” may mean or have been intended to mean, Mr Lucas was making it plain that he did not know whether or not the certificate was accurate or not (that was on the D323 test), and that he did not know how the two tests correlated. In those circumstances, he was expressly saying that he did not know whether or not, whatever the certificate said, the fuel had been within specification or would have been shown to have been within specification if tested by the right test. If that is what Mr Lucas was saying expressly, then it seems to me to be impossible to derive, from any combination of what Mr Lucas said about standing by the certificate and what the certificate said about fuel meeting specification and any overall impression of the conversation, an implied or derived representation that the certificate was good and reliable or good and valid in any meaning of those terms relevant to AIC’s complaint in deceit. This factor is highlighted by AIC’s pleading that the critical misrepresentation (that fuel meets specification) was to be derived from Mr Lucas’s refusal to accept that the certificates were inaccurate. He did not refuse to accept that the certificate was inaccurate so much as state his personal agnosticism.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Of course, given the judge’s ultimate findings about Mr Lucas’s knowledge, AIC might possibly have made a case in deceit to complain about Mr Lucas’s representations that he did not know whether or not the certificate was inaccurate and that he did not know how a D5191 test would correlate with a D323 test. Or AIC might have complained that the crucial representation to be derived from the conversation was that Mr Lucas knew nothing to suggest that a D5191 test would have produced a result out of specification. But that was not the case that was made. If it had been, it might have led to a more detailed examination of Mr Lucas’s knowledge (as to which see below) than the basic trial inquiry as to whether he knew about the Cooper retest results. It might also have led to a critical examination (which never appears to have taken place) as to why the Cooper retest on broached and unsealed samples was of greater or particular importance given what was already known by all parties about the formally retained and tested samples which travelled with the ship. Or an entirely different case in deceit might have been developed (somewhat analogous to the subsidiary case on continuing duties which AIC made on the hypothesis that Mr Lucas, and Mr Chalmers, had only learned the Cooper retest results after the telephone conversation, as to which see below), to the effect that there was a positive duty on ITS to disclose to AIC the Cooper retest results: so that Mr Lucas’s deliberate failure to disclose the results in some way amounted to a dishonest misrepresentation or other fraudulent conduct in itself.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">(3) Given the difficulty of identifying with the necessary precision the representation upon which Mr Lucas has been found guilty of deceit and the possible ambiguities of the situation, I judge it to be particularly important to consider the contemporaneous communications between the parties immediately following the conversation in question, to see whether they throw any light on the above matters. What did Mr Whitaker take away with him as his understanding or overall impression of the conversation? What did Mr Lucas think that he had been saying to Mr Whitaker? I refer to paras 123/129 above. It is clear from those communications that the critical question for both parties was Mr Whitaker’s request for a further or amended certificate (or other statement) to the effect that the fuel was out of specification. Mr Whitaker had regarded that as his right (for otherwise litigation was threatened) because he knew that the wrong test had been performed by ITS, considered that that threw a question mark over the validity of the existing certificate, and also considered that the New York tests had shown the cargo to be non-contractual. Mr Lucas was put out, even outraged, by the request for an amended certificate. But for present purposes perhaps the most significant passages in the exchange are these. Mr Whitaker said:</p>

Given the imprecision of a lengthy telephone conversation, and Mr Whitaker’s own précis of it in his telex, I would think that if a case of deceit was to be made it would have to be made on those written documents, which are intended to sum up the parties’ respective positions. AIC’s and the judge’s virtual disregard of these communications in my judgment shows the difficulty of the judge’s finding of the representation upon which he has founded liability in deceit. No one has suggested that, whatever errors may have led to ITS’s certifying an RVP of 8.22, that result was not honestly made. Ultimately, all that Mr Lucas was saying, as a matter of overall impression, was: these are our findings, made by the wrong test, we cannot rewrite them; we do not know whether the fuel meets specification by the right test; you say you will sue us, but we do not admit liability.</p>

It is a case where the dictum of Cotton LJ which I have cited (at para 255) above from <span style="font-style:italic">Arkwright v. Newbold</span> is wholly apposite. In my judgment, the judge’s finding of a misrepresentation on which to found a case in deceit is an impossible one; alternatively, it is a case in which he has plainly erred. In any event, on this aspect of the matter, nothing in particular turns on oral evidence.</p>

That evidence, however, cannot affect what it was that Mr Lucas said to Mr Whitaker, for which we have the contemporary transcript; and it is certainly not evidence on which any case of dishonesty can be built. It would be unfair to regard that answer as being something that Mr Lucas was maintaining at the time, especially given his overall evidence and the terms of the transcript. Moreover, it is clear from other answers there discussed that Mr Lucas’s views in this context are involved with questions of law and opinion.</p>

Mr Lucas did not make the representation which the judge has found that he made; and in any event, the judge has not found with sufficient clarity a representation of fact which was false in a sense which AIC sought to make the basis of its claim in deceit. That in my judgment is an end to the case in fraud. But I would go on briefly to express my grave concerns about the judge’s finding of dishonesty. I do so, on the hypothesis of the representation that he has found, and on the further hypothesis that “good and valid” involves a representation of fact of a kind which in some way was undermined by the Cooper retest results. I confess that there is artificiality in those assumptions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The <span style="font-style:italic">first</span> question which arises under this heading is whether Mr Lucas was told of the Cooper retest and its results. Despite the evidence of both Mr Rackham and Mr Lucas to the contrary, I would not disagree with the judge’s conclusion, if indeed it was open to me to do so, that the former did brief the latter, prior to the telephone conversation, about the Cooper retest and the resultant figure of 9.33. That is essentially because of the probabilities of the thing. It was Mr Rackham himself who had instituted the Cooper retest. And it was Mr Rackham himself who had calculated the final figure of 9.33 (albeit inaccurately). I would also agree with the judge that the better construction of the entry in Mr Rackham’s log at 1333 on 16 April (the “Harass U.K.” entry) was that it was a note of Mr Chalmers’ reaction on hearing of the <span style="font-style:italic">Kriti Palm</span> problem and the Cooper retest (at a time, I would however emphasise, when it was expected that the retest would confirm an RVP figure under 9). In those circumstances, it would be probable that Mr Rackham would tell Mr Lucas about the Cooper retest. Although Mr Rackham said in evidence that he did not tell Mr Lucas, he accepts that he sought to give him as good a briefing as possible. Nearly ten years after the event, it would be very difficult for any witness to be clear in his own mind on such a matter: and Mr Rackham’s memory was obviously not of the best, because he had even forgotten that it was he who had set up the Cooper retest himself. Mr Rackham was not criticised for these difficulties about his evidence: he was by the time of trial independent of ITS and he had given a witness statement to both sides.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Lucas, of course, also said that he had not been told by Mr Rackham about the Cooper retest. He also said that if he had been told, he would have told Mr Whitaker, and he used that as support for his evidence on this topic. It was perhaps a natural thing to say, despite other, inconsistent, evidence he gave about the “stone wall” technique in responding to notice of a claim. It is a natural thing to say, because it is a kind of bright line test of one’s recollection, when being pressed on a matter as old as this. However, it has the flavour of reconstruction, indeed it is reconstruction. By the time of trial, all the possible implications of these events had no doubt been endlessly replayed in his mind.</p>

Strain</span>) so as to render him potentially dishonest in anything he said. For these purposes, and especially where a representation derived by implication or impression is concerned, a judge must make a careful assessment of all aspects of the situation. If Mr Lucas was told, did he take it in? Did he understand the full implications of what he was told? He would have been given a considerable amount of information in a hurried, urgent, briefing. There were two parcels involved, even if, for the purposes of this litigation, all attention is now concentrated on the regular parcel alone. That was not the position at the time, with complaints being made about both parcels (see paras 130/131 above). There had been a number of D5191 tests on the fuel. Of particular importance, one might have thought, was the test of the retained composite blend sample, ex shore tanks, which had travelled with the ship and had been tested in New York. That was far more a suitable candidate for consideration than anything done internally by ITS alone on a sample which had been used, was broached, had been left unsealed, was open to contamination and could not be properly used for re-certification (as everyone agrees). As for ex ship samples, there was always the uncertainty of contamination, at any rate until such stage (not yet reached) as that could be confidently eliminated. If the uncontractual D323 tests mattered at all, what was the relationship between that and any D5191 test? What in any event was the position where ITS had carried out an uncontractual test? That test may have found what it found, but what was the value or significance of that? Whatever its significance or validity, could it be subsequently falsified by any subsequent test by a different method? And even if it could, could any inference of negligence or responsibility be attached to the original tester?</p>

In such circumstances, if there was any responsibility on the part of ITS, its managers could not hope to evade it.

It was initiated by Mr Rackham, and, on the basis of “Harass U.K.” (but that alone), Mr Chalmers showed interest in it. Mr Lucas, however, had not been involved in it at all. Moreover, it is one thing to show interest in a different D5191 test which would confirm a low reading (under 9) by a D323 test, at a time when that was the expected result (as Mr Chalmers appears to have done), and another thing to have a test result consistent with the high reading of the D5191 tests conducted in New York. ITS might feel comforted by the former, and disappointed by the latter. But in either event, there were discordances which could not immediately be explained. And if a new D5191 test was relevant, then for the reasons explained above there were other samples of more significance than those tested by Mr Cooper. None of this seems to me to say anything about what ITS’s obligations, if any, in respect of the Cooper retest were (but see below). The judge described the Cooper retest results as a “key piece of evidence, highly relevant to the conclusion” and regarded as such by Mr Lucas. It is not apparent why the Cooper retest was “key” in a sense beyond the more formal tests conducted at New York, or which could have been carried out in the UK. It is not apparent either why the judge found that Mr Lucas then and there concluded, as the judge did after trial, that the Cooper retest results were “key”. It is entirely unclear upon what basis the judge so found. Even upon the reconstructed hypothesis that he had known (ie in the important sense of the word) about the Cooper retest, Mr Lucas in his evidence had repeatedly stated the very limited matters which could be derived from it and its unreliability (in its proper sense and in the sense of not being certifiable); and Mr Chalmers gave similar evidence. On the same basis of his hypothetical knowledge, Mr Lucas was prepared to accept that his conversation would be misleading without raising the matter of the Cooper retest, but that tells one nothing about his true knowledge and understanding at the time.</p>

I have pointed out above that the judge’s findings both as to Mr Lucas’s knowledge and as to his dishonesty are dealt with in a single passage at paras 276ff and essentially at paras 283/289. His findings as to <span style="font-style:italic">knowledge</span> are, to my mind, seriously undermined by the fact that they essentially reproduce his conclusions on the balance of probabilities as to the facts relating to the cargo, its samples, and the two test methods, having heard expert evidence at trial: see his judgment at paras 198/203 and my judgment at paras 90/95 and 212 above, and also at paras 164/168. At paras 198/203 he proceeds directly from his conclusions on the expert evidence to his brief finding (at para 203) that Mr Lucas and Mr Chalmers “knew, understood and appreciated the matters set out in the last four paragraphs”, but does so without any explanation or reasons at all. In effect he does the same at para 283 (d) to (g), where he repeats his findings at paras 198/202, again ascribing this knowledge to Mr Lucas and Mr Chalmers as of 17 April, but again without any reasons; and on this basis extending his findings to the matters in para 283 (h) and (i) as well. In effect, this is mere recapitulation. I repeat what I have just said about the judge’s finding that Mr Lucas regarded the Cooper retest results as “key”. His findings as to <span style="font-style:italic">dishonesty</span>, moreover, are essentially non-existent: for he proceeds directly from his recapitulation of Mr Lucas’s knowledge to his conclusion that Mr Lucas was reckless as to the truth, ie was dishonest (at para 284). In doing so, he discusses none of the issues raised above. In effect, he derives both knowledge and dishonesty of the protagonist of the telephone conversation of 17 April 1996 directly from his own preference for one expert over another at trial in 2005, essentially without further reasoning. Moreover, he does not explain why his finding of dishonesty is expressed in terms of recklessness rather than knowledge, which raises a concern that negligence rather than dishonesty might have intruded into his thinking.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At paras 285/7 of his judgment, having already come to his conclusion as to dishonesty, the judge cited some extracts from Mr Lucas’s cross-examination as serving to confirm that conclusion (see at para 213 above). The essence of those passages, however, is that Mr Lucas was there accepting, on the hypothesis of his knowledge of the Cooper retest results, that his conversation would have been misleading without some, albeit highly qualified, reference to them. However, I am unable to understand how the mere citation of such passages explains Mr Lucas’s knowledge or dishonesty. In effect, neither his knowledge nor his honesty were being challenged in these passages: as the judge himself accepted towards the end of the cross-examination when Mr Mildon laid down his marker about the absence of such challenge. The judge had previously said that he had “marked reservations about important parts of his evidence” (at para 105), but he never identified what those parts were. It might be inferred that it was those parts of his evidence where Mr Lucas did not accept that he had been told of the Cooper retest, for the judge found that he had been told and had understood its full ramifications, as the judge had found them to be at trial. However, the judge never states that he considered Mr Lucas had lied to him, and the language of unidentified “marked reservations” falls a long way short of a finding that he had lied on such a central point.</p>

(It is inappropriate, if it matters, to regard him as being back in the office almost immediately after the telephone conversation.) He was also accused by AIC of deceit, on the basis of a continuing duty to correct the false representation made by Mr Lucas on the telephone. Although the judge does not appear to have gone so far as accepting that case against Mr Chalmers, nevertheless the case in deceit against Mr Lucas cannot be dealt with isolated from the evidence of Mr Chalmers. As it is, the judge made the same findings of knowledge against Mr Chalmers, equally unreasoned, for the findings were made in the same passages highlighted above, and also spoke of marked reservations about his evidence as well, again without identifying the passages in question.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I would refer to paras 219/249 hereof above, where I deal with Mr Chalmers’ evidence and the judge’s findings in reaction to it. In my judgment, I can find very little, if anything, in that evidence to begin to support a view of Mr Lucas as having been dishonest in his telephone conversation, or of what amounts to the alleged complicit climate of dishonesty existing between those two executives. Time may have led to a process of reconstruction in places in Mr Chalmers’ thoughts about the subject, but on the whole I find it difficult to read his evidence without being struck by Mr Chalmers’ moderate (and to me persuasive) objectivity about the problem. He said that, in the context of the issue with Mr Whitaker and his demand or request for a new certificate, the Cooper retest was inappropriate and its results were of no value. He accepted the hypothesis, in the context of the analysis exposed by the litigation, that if ITS <span style="font-style:italic">knew </span>that a certified result was <span style="font-style:italic">wrong</span> (my emphasis: Mr Chalmers accepted neither hypothesis), then it would not be <span style="font-style:italic">acceptable</span> for ITS to say that it was standing by its certificate (see para 233 above). Given what I have said above about the issue of knowledge, however, that hypothesis is hardly a basis for any findings of dishonesty (compare Mr Chalmers’ answer to the sole question in which his honesty was challenged, at para 235 above): and particularly because in context the whole problem was overlaid with Mr Chalmers’ attempts to see his way towards an analysis of the situation in terms of the problem that was obvious, that of the wrong test having been performed: see paras 234, 240/244. In my judgment, it is of no assistance in the prosecution of a case in deceit, to talk merely in terms of what might be “commercially appropriate” (see para 240 above) or of what “should” (with hindsight) have been done (see para 241 above): both in principle, because what one needs is a contemporaneously guilty mind, and above all because, in this context, the underlying problem which colours everything is the performance of the uncontractual test. However that problem was analysed at the time or in retrospect, it was always there as uncontractual conduct which went to the heart of the certificate and draws the disquiet of disease over the situation. Of course it would be inappropriate or wrong in some sense of those words to insist on a certificate which, because it was based on an uncontractual test, was in truth invalid and therefore, however viewed, raised an issue. However, as stated above, the disease was patent, as were the discordant results in New York, and that is not what the case in deceit was concerned with. There are remedies enough for such an uncontractual certificate.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In all these circumstances, if there had been clarity as to the fraudulent representation alleged, I would have had such serious concerns as to the finding of dishonesty, ie dishonest knowledge or recklessness, in the absence of adequate reasoning, as to be deeply troubled as to whether the finding of dishonesty could stand on appeal: despite the authorities which remind the court of appeal of its limited role in reviewing such findings of a trial judge, of which I have at all times been conscious. As it is, given the view I have taken of the inadequacy of any proper identification of the underlying representation, the finding of deceit cannot stand in any event. It therefore seems to me to be all the more difficult to state a definitive position in connection with a finding of dishonesty in respect of a hypothetical misrepresentation which has not been identified or proved. In effect, without a relevant misrepresentation, dishonesty cannot be asserted let alone proved. Ultimately, in the absence of a properly reasoned finding of deceit, it seems to me that the judge’s conclusion cannot stand. My own judgment would have been that there was no deceit: more muddle and fallibility than fraud. In these circumstances Mr Lucas and Mr Chalmers are in any event fully entitled to consider themselves acquitted of any shadow of a finding of any dishonesty on their parts.</p>

In the absence of any representation by him, he could not be guilty of deceit. It is true that a false representation, honestly made at the time of its making, but subsequently discovered to be false, may impose the obligation on its maker to correct the falsehood, if it is still timely to do so: see <span style="font-style:italic">Chitty on Contracts</span>, 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> ed, 2004, at para 6-017, <span style="font-style:italic">Clerk &amp; Lindsell</span> at para 18-21. But that only applies to the representor. That obligation will need to be considered in the case of Mr Lucas. Mr Hamblen may also possibly rely in this context on his submission, accepted by the judge, of a duty on the part of ITS to inform AIC of the Cooper retest. However, even if such a duty was owed, so that there was a duty to speak, that could not in my judgment impose on Mr Chalmers, who had said nothing and had no contact with AIC, a duty to correct Mr Lucas’s statements.</p>

It would be necessary for him to have been conscious of the representation in question, and conscious of or at any rate reckless about its falsity. All this in circumstances where his conversation had been overtaken by the exchange of written communications between him and Mr Whitaker.

Whether or not the legal consequences of that fact were also immediately apparent to the parties, they were certainly capable of being so, and at that time. In truth, the certificate was invalid, the fuel was uncertificated, whether or not it met its specification had yet to be established, and ITS was therefore in breach of contract and had conducted itself negligently. AIC knew everything it needed to bring its claim. AIC had six years to bring that claim, to which there was, as it seems to me, no adequate defence.</p>

Nevertheless I add the following for completeness.”); and perhaps for that very reason he did not consider it upon any alternative hypothetical factual basis, eg that he had been wrong to make a finding of deceit. It follows that he was approaching the issue of deliberate concealment on the basis that Mr Lucas had been dishonest.

This is important because the purpose of section 32(1)(b) appears to be designed to cater for the case where, because of deliberate concealment, the claimant lacks sufficient information to plead a complete cause of action (the so-called “statement of claim” test). It is therefore important to consider the facts relating to an allegation of deliberate concealment vis a vis a claimant’s pleaded case.

It appears that this assertion may be involved in the judge’s mind with the idea that in 1996 AIC believed that the D5191 test might have given a higher reading than the D323 test and thus that D5191 results did not by themselves invalidate the certificated D323 results as such. If so, this is irrelevant, since the Cooper retest, like the disport retests, were by D5191 and thus were neutral on that question. In any event, AIC was able to plead, and did plead prior to learning of the Cooper retest, that the certificated results were probably wrong, eg (at para 22 of the amended particulars of claim dated 1 August 2003) that “In breach of duty the Defendant failed to exercise reasonable care in carrying out the analysis and in issuing the Certificates in respect of the cargo…Further, had the RVP been tested in accordance with ASTM D5191 it would have shown a result in excess of the contractual maximum of 9.0 psi”.

Of course, I quite see that, on the finding of dishonest knowledge against Mr Lucas for the purpose of his reckless fraud, and a finding of complicit knowledge against Mr Chalmers, it is an understandable and perhaps easy progression, even if the detail of it was never spelled out, to infer that, if the Cooper retest was not subsequently disclosed, then that was due to a conscious and deliberate decision not to do so. If, however, as I have sought to explain above, the findings of conscious knowledge and dishonesty can not be supported, the basis of that inference goes. Even so, the inference would struggle against the circumstances relating to the decision taken in April 1997 with Mr Pople’s assistance and on his advice that the matters relating to the Cooper retest were privileged from disclosure (see paras 155/156 above).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As it is, how did the judge put his finding of deliberate concealment? Earlier in his judgment the judge had held that ITS owed a (legal) duty to AIC to inform it about the fact of the Cooper retest and its results: at paras 260/269, in answer to trial issues 21 and 22 (<span style="font-style:italic">Should ITS have informed AIC and Mobil about the fact of the re-tests and the results thereof and was ITS in breach of duty in failing to do so? Should ITS have informed AIC about the fact of the re-tests and the results thereof in the telcon on 17 April 1996, and/or subsequent to the telcon, and was ITS in breach of duty in failing to do so?)</span>, he said that such a duty existed and had been breached. He repeated (at para 263) that the results of the Cooper retest were “a key piece of evidence”, highly relevant to his trial conclusions about the RVP quality of the fuel, and that “Mr Lucas and Mr Chalmers knew, understood and appreciated” such matters. His finding of the duty and its breach appears to have been premised on such knowledge, for he only finds that Mr Lucas and Mr Chalmers “should have informed” AIC and Mobil, and therefore breached that duty, as from the time of that knowledge, whether that was during the telephone conversation of 17 April or “as soon as they became aware of the results” (at para 269). He also found that both Mr Lucas and Mr Chalmers were aware of the retest and its results at latest “very shortly” after the telephone conversation (<span style="font-style:italic">ibid</span>).</p>

The suggestion of these findings appears to be that, irrespective of any decision taken by Mr Lucas personally during his telephone conversation with Mr Whitaker, thereafter the decision not to inform AIC, or rather the decision to conceal the relevant information from AIC, was the joint complicit decision of both Mr Lucas and Mr Chalmers. Other than the fact of the absence of disclosure to AIC in the light of the knowledge found, I am left wholly uncertain of the basis of the judge’s finding of such complicit deliberate concealment on the part of Mr Lucas and Mr Chalmers.</p>

The judge’s treatment of this issue (see above) speaks of the Cooper retest results as “evidence”: also as “a key piece of evidence”, and as confirming when viewed together with the disport tests that the fuel was off-specification, and as also highly relevant to the conclusion that the D323 tests were probably “wrong” or “incorrect” or understated the RVP. All of this suggests that the judge was reading the statutory test as being a very wide one simply referring to any fact evidentially probative (or at any rate significantly so) to AIC’s right of action. In only one sentence (at para 324) did the judge speak of AIC’s pleadings, to say that in 1996 AIC was “unable to plead” that the D323 test results were probably wrong (“and other matters referred to below”). In context, however, even that reference to AIC’s pleadings was simply to one particular of inaccuracy among others and indicated no particular legal approach to the significance of any pleadable factual assertion. Of course, the importance of the certificate and its results was not that the D323 test gave rise to inaccurate results, but that the D323 test was the wrong test and that the fuel was in truth out of specification (on the right test).</p>

Thus in <span style="font-style:italic">Johnson v. Chief Constable of Surrey</span> (CA, unreported, 19 October 1992), where the claim was in false imprisonment and the police had deliberately concealed facts relevant to the absence of reasonable cause, this court accepted the defendant’s submission that “the relevant fact must be a fact without which the cause of action is incomplete”, contrasting a fact relevant to an action and to a <span style="font-style:italic">right</span> of action (5A, 6C). Thus Rose LJ said “Facts which improve prospects of success are not, it seems to me, facts relevant to his right of action” (at 6E). He accepted that the interpretation was a narrow one (at 6G). Russell LJ agreed, saying (at 7E): “Accordingly, whilst I acknowledge that the new facts might make the plaintiff’s case stronger or his right to damages more readily capable of proof they do not in my view bite upon the “right of action” itself. And Neill LJ emphasised that although absence of reasonable cause was an element in the tort of false imprisonment, the “gist of the action” is in the imprisonment itself, which establishes a prima facie case and puts the burden of proving justification on the defendant. Therefore the statutory words “must mean any fact which the plaintiff has to prove to establish a prima facie case” (at 8E/H).</p>

The process is governed by contract. Duties of care are implied in that contract, but, as a matter of classical legal analysis, will go no wider than is required by law or business necessity.

Intuitively and commercially, I am sceptical of a duty expressed in the judge’s wide and unqualified terms, viz that “where a complaint or any other circumstance raised doubt concerning the quality of the tests, to ensure that the relevant work/tests were promptly audited/reviewed. Where the audit/review cast doubt on the correctness or validity of the test results such as to necessitate a Supplement to the certificate, to write to Mobil and AIC immediately enclosing the Supplement…” (para 192(viii)). As I have said above, that sounds to me like legislation rather than a process of implication. If a complaint or any other circumstance raising doubt could require a fresh review and a supplement to the certificate, then a certificate intended, as it so commonly is, to be final and binding save for fraud or <span style="font-style:italic">manifest error</span>, would be in practical terms worthless. There would be endless disputes.</p>

The contract contemplates that, if a query is raised, then further testing will be done by mutual agreement upon the formally sealed and retained samples, and probably by an independent referee. It may be concluded that the certificate is arguably or probably inaccurate, and possibly even negligently so. Nevertheless the certificate will bind, where it is expressed to be final and binding, in the absence of fraud or manifest error. If the certificate is not expressed to be final and binding, then the matter will probably be resolved on a testing of the formally retained samples.

If there was a duty to disclose that the wrong test had been performed (if that had not been patent and known), as there very well might be, since it fatally destroyed the validity of the certificate and also in my judgment amounted to manifest error, then there was no breach of that duty.

Whether withdrawn or not, the certificate is invalid. The certifier is in breach, irremediable breach, actual repudiatory breach. There may be remedies, but the time for performance is past. The sale contract which had been intended to be governed by a binding certificate of quality obtained at loading (in the present case at a pre-loading stage, for the certificate was to be on the fuel ex shore tanks), becomes uncertificated. The buyer is entitled to reject the documents, for he has bought inter alia a certificate. The goods may or may not be within specification, but the buyer has not only agreed to buy goods of a certain specification, but goods certified to be of a certain specification.

This has not been advanced by AIC as the explanation, and yet <span style="font-style:italic">sub silentio</span> it appears to lie at the root, or at any rate to be a necessary foundation, for its, and the judge’s ultimate position. It is some such idea that was behind the thought (eg of Mr Whitaker, but also perhaps of the judge’s broad implied term) that there was still time to issue a new certificate, or an amended or supplementary certificate. (I accept, of course, that anything can be done by fresh agreement of the parties; but that is a different matter.) Since the argument has not been made expressly, it is difficult to know what would be said in support of it. Mr Hamblen on the contrary accepted that the Cooper retest could not be made the basis of a fresh certificate, and that a test on such broached samples was not a legitimate, publicly reliable, basis for certifiable results. In my judgment, however, in any event the contract is not a continuing one to provide advice or ongoing evidence of the quality of the goods, but to certify it on or before loading. A valid certificate, even if erroneous, cannot be withdrawn (save by consent of all the parties) in the absence of fraud or manifest error; and an invalid certificate, whether withdrawn or not, is ineffective. It is too late to adjust the position after time for the certification has passed.</p>

Even though the original certificate, if valid, cannot be withdrawn, amended or substituted, nevertheless the danger of inaccuracy or negligence requires the certifier at least to issue a sort of health warning about it, if he cannot confirm its accuracy in full measure. Since the investigation is required for the purpose of a further report, it follows that there must be disclosure of any investigation; indeed, there must be further investigation. That is in one respect what the judge has found by his implied term, although to my mind he has done so in the belief that the purpose of the further investigation and report is the fulfilment of the contract, about which I have already stated my scepticism above.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This is an important argument. It is floating, silently, in the background, but has not been clearly articulated: for the term which the judge has derived has been obtained from the international and internal guidelines, and/or from evidence from the witnesses as to what “should” be done, without any particular analysis. Nevertheless, Lord Justice Buxton in a powerful passage in his judgment (centred at para 439 below) has, I think, adopted it, stating that the converse challenges reality. It is important because, if it is correct, it is in theory applicable to every conceivable kind of contract. The issue would be: if the provider of goods or services under contract suspects or has reason to think that the service or goods which he has provided has some defect or flaw in it, does he have an ongoing obligation, and if so, of what kind, to disclose his suspicion or concern, or to investigate it, and to report? There are of course standard remedies for standard causes of action: for breach of contract, for fraud, for negligence including negligent misstatement. If there is a danger of future harm, investigation and/or disclosure may avert it, and thus contingent liabilities may be entirely averted. If not averted, the remedies on underlying causes of action remain. But is there a <span style="font-style:italic">separate</span> continuing duty to investigate and/or disclose? The argument has not been articulated. No authority has been cited for it. As far as I know, authority is against it: see <span style="font-style:italic">Bell v. Lever Bros Ltd </span>[1932] AC 161. Thus there is no general principle of disclosure. A party must not deceive; but in the absence of a rare duty of disclosure (as exists in the case of contracts <span style="font-style:italic">uberrimae fidei</span>, or within litigation), may remain silent. Of course, if he speaks, he may become liable in misrepresentation or <span style="font-style:italic">Hedley Byrne </span>negligence: but that is another question. There is no general principle that the wrongdoer comes under an additional obligation to disclose his wrongdoing.

No such traditional analysis was performed by the judge. In the present context, it seems to me that, for reasons already discussed above, such an implied term would be destructive of the utility of such certificates in international trade. Therefore it is both unreasonable and contrary to business efficacy.  Nor is such a term necessary to meet this case, for in truth the certificate was invalid, because of use of the wrong test, and ought to have been recognised as such. Therefore, ITS could not escape such liability as might be brought home to it for its uncontractual and possibly negligent issue of an invalid certificate. That would concentrate the mind on matters which were directly relevant to all aspects of the breach. Since the error was manifest, this approach would also concentrate attention on aspects of causation and remoteness. And since the certificate was invalid and manifestly so, it matters not a jot whether the D323 test was performed incorrectly, or negligently, or not. That is a will of the wisp. The contract specified D5191 because only that test could satisfy the requirements of the Colonial Pipeline Specification, since in the USA all gasoline has, according to its grade, to be fungible for the purpose of transport through pipelines.</p>

The provision and existence of those samples to my mind excludes other surviving material such as the broached testing samples as being subject to the same contractual significance. Contractually contemplated tests, carried out mutually and supervised independently had been performed at the discharge port, and similar tests were contemplated (and discussed between AIC and Mobil, see paras 142/143 above) on samples retained in the UK: but unaccountably those tests were never carried out. If the certifier in addition conducts private tests, I see no need to imply a parasitic duty to reduplicate the underlying duty to take care to provide a valid and accurate certificate. In any event, the certifier should be entitled to investigate its potential liability for itself, a fortiori in circumstances where its client has made a claim against it.

Such evidence in any event has to be seen in the context of the evidence as a whole. In general, the witnesses did not accept that they had acted in breach of any duty, let alone consciously so. There was, nevertheless, as it seems to me, a natural sensitivity, which could be played on in cross-examination, as to the consequences of the provision of a certificate which, whatever the analysis, had been produced on the basis of the wrong test.

The judge accepted the alternative formulation of this argument (see his para 252, and my para 188 above), saying nothing about the property aspect. In my judgment, however, the submission does not support the implied term in either formulation. The testing samples were provided to ITS by Mobil for ITS’s purposes. They were never placed on board the vessel, so that title never passed to AIC. I accept Mr Gaisman’s submission that the testing samples were not contractually retained samples. In my judgment they had become ITS’s property, for the purpose of their tests. They could have been thrown away. Since they survived, they might have been kept and were at most “potentially important” as reference evidence, although they could not have been made the subject matter of certifiable tests or even of so-called “referee testing”, and there were more important contractually retained samples: see inter alia paras 214/215 and 237 above. The judge found that ITS was “in breach of a duty to take reasonable care” in failing to seek permission to perform the Cooper retest. In my judgment no permission was needed, and the status of the Cooper retest is that of an internal test on ITS’s own property. Although the judge was not attracted by Mr Rackham’s suggestion that the Cooper retest results might have been divulged if they had come in under 9, it must often be the case that parties drawn into dispute may make their own tests or seek their own evidence, and that disclosure, where such material is not privileged, comes into effect only in the context of litigation.</p>

In effect, AIC has pleaded such parasitic implied duties in a number of different ways, in essence because it was conscious that breach of the underlying causes of action were or were in danger of being time barred in the absence of deceit or fraudulent suppression. It therefore sought to present its claim not only or so much on the straightforward bases of an invalid or inaccurate or negligently produced or misstating certificate, but rather or also on the basis of subsequent and parasitic breaches of a duty of disclosure, variously described (see below). But, in truth, there was no shortage of remedies available to AIC under the contract. Primarily, there was the provision of an invalid certificate (<span style="font-style:italic">Veba Oil</span>). But even if the answer lay in proving negligent testing or inaccurate certifying, the remedies lay at hand. However, AIC allowed six years to go by. The complications of the case are entirely created by that simple fact. That is the “necessity” which has bedevilled the case and caused fraud and deliberate concealment to be pleaded.

The certificate had indeed been negligently issued since it used a D323 test. The Cooper retest for its part was a D5191 test, not a D323 test. At best, the Cooper retest was simply a further test, more evidence, that something had gone wrong in the issue of the certificate.

But even if they had, it seems to me that Mr Gaisman is correct to submit that section 32(1)(b) is not fulfilled by the pleading of causes of action which are artificially designed to attempt to turn a parasitic question of knowledge of further evidence into an essential basis of the claimant’s right of action. The Cooper retest was simply further evidence that the goods were out of specification and that something had gone wrong in the original test and resultant certificate.</p>

AIC said, twice, that it was “not in a position to say precisely what went wrong”, but that errors were to be inferred from a comparison between the original test results and later retests, citing “the Cooper retests and as further borne out by (1) the various pressure results obtained by analysis of samples at the discharge port and (2) the lack of any evidence of contamination on the vessel”. In other words the Cooper retest results were simply further evidence.</p>

In my judgment, there was no such implied term – on the contrary the contract expressly contemplated officially retained samples – but in any event the complaint is merely an indirect route back to the position obtaining in the previous paragraph.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">What, at the end of the day, did the Cooper retest and its results add to the pleadable case? In my judgment, nothing save a modicum of further evidence: see in this connection Mr Revell’s opinion summarised at para 167(1) above. AIC already knew that the disport results showed the fuel to have an RVP in excess of 9 psi by the right test, D5191. It knew that there was no contamination during the voyage. In particular, it knew that the official, sealed, composite sample of the fuel loaded ex shore tanks and carried with the vessel, tested by D5191, was over 9. That test, being carried out on a loading sample, likewise excluded the possibility of contamination. The Cooper retest results, 9.1 as properly calculated, but not on a contractually retained sample but on a broached and used testing sample, and not independently reviewed, was at best simply in line with the disport results. It is and always was simply a matter of inference that the D323 tests were inaccurately and/or improperly performed (or some of them were: the premium cargo D323 tests appear to have been spot on). If AIC at one time believed that the D5191 test would give a higher reading than the D323 test, rather than an essentially identical (or “comparable”) reading, that belief was not induced by anything said on behalf of ITS. At all times AIC had access to legal or expert advice. The Cooper retest said nothing, and is not alleged to have said anything, about the comparability of D323 and D5191. The D323 tests are ultimately uncontractual and irrelevant. AIC knew that that was so or had the means of knowing it, or ought to have known it. It knew that D323 had been the test used, and that it was an uncontractual test. The Cooper retest results produced no falling of scales from AIC’s eyes. The incompetent use of a comparable test (D323) could always have been pleaded, but in truth was irrelevant. The Cooper retest was just another D5191 test, and on a sub-standard, broached, unsealed, uncontractual sample, which the relevant tests stated could not be used for testing.</p>

If I am wrong about that and the issue of deliberate concealment generally, it will be necessary ultimately to identify the relevant cause or causes of action in respect of which section 32(1)(b) operates to extend the limitation period.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, for the reasons discussed under the heading of deceit and again referred to at the beginning of my discussion under the issue of deliberate concealment, the judge’s assertions of a consciousness of a duty to disclose and of a deliberate decision to conceal are not adequate to sustain his findings. They are based on his view of Mr Lucas as deceitful and dishonest, and of Mr Chalmers sharing a form of unarticulated complicity with him, even if not himself responsible for the telephone conversation to which he was not of course a party. The assertions are based on findings of knowledge on their part which, as reasoned, are a repetition of findings which the judge derived after trial with the assistance of experts and on the balance of probability (without reference to the especial care needed in the context of allegedly unconscionable conduct). And if there was no deceit in the context of the 17 April conversation, there is no explanation of how or when Mr Lucas and Mr Chalmers took their apparently joint and complicit decision to conceal the Cooper retest results in consciousness of ITS’s duty to disclose them: and that remains the case even if one considers that each of them knew of the Cooper retest results on 17 April or shortly thereafter. The transcript of the conversation was immediately provided to ITS’s lawyer, Mr Pople. This is because the parties were then and there in an adversarial legal situation, with lawyers appointed on both sides. When in 1997 Galaxy commenced its English proceedings against AIC and ITS, Mr Pople considered the Cooper retest papers for the purposes of disclosure in that litigation. In his view they were privileged; and even though it is now accepted by ITS that that was an erroneous decision, there has been no suggestion by AIC that that amounted to deliberate concealment on anyone’s part. It is not easy to see how Mr Lucas and Mr Chalmers took a deliberate decision to conceal the Cooper retest from AIC in consciousness of their duty to reveal it, when the whole matter was put before Mr Pople for his decision in 1997. Both Mr Lucas and Mr Chalmers denied any decision deliberately to conceal the information. If such a decision had been taken, it would be highly likely that some positive trace of it would survive in documentary disclosure. At any rate one might have expected such matters to be discussed by the judge.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, however, the relationship was not a continuing one, nor was there any breach of a continuing duty. I have pointed out above that the inspection and certifying contract was not a continuing relationship, such as that (subject to the extent of a retainer) of a solicitor and client. ITS had no responsibility as AIC’s adviser. It was not like a tenant, with its continuing obligation to keep in repair (an example given by <span style="font-style:italic">Chitty</span>). Contractual samples were to be retained for 90 days, but the Cooper retest was not performed on those samples; the samples retained on the vessel were tested early on at the discharge port, and there was never any request for referee testing of the UK retained samples. AIC paid for the fuel on 18 April 1996. Any cause of action was complete and final on the issue of the certificate, or at latest on or immediately after 17 April. The certificate spoke only to a particular test at a particular time. In any event, it seems to me that the relationship had ended at latest when, immediately on or after 17 April, the parties told each other that they were instructing their respective lawyers. Moreover, even in the case of a relationship such as that of solicitor and client, a failure to do something is not a continuing breach which constantly refreshes the limitation period: see <span style="font-style:italic"> Bell v.

Grounds of Appeal, supported by a 42 page skeleton argument drawn by leading and junior counsel who had acted at the trial, were served on 11 November 2005, and met by a respondents’ skeleton argument dated 16 December 2005.   It was agreed between the parties that three days would be required for the hearing of the appeal.    The Lord Justice supervising commercial appeals, appreciating from the documents and skeletons that the appeal was likely to be burdensome, ordered that in addition to those three days there should be allocated to the constitution hearing it two days of prior reading time, and three days at the close of the appeal for consideration of the judgment.   The appeal was duly listed under those arrangements for hearing on 16-18 May 2006.</p>

The court (and, we understand, those advising AIC) first heard of this when Mr Gaisman wrote to the Civil Appeals Office on 6 April 2006 announcing that he needed to express the points arising on the appeal in his own way, and that therefore he would be serving a new skeleton argument in substitution for that previously served.   There would be no need to amend the notice of appeal.</p>

Second, CPR 52PD 15.11A, which provides for the service of a supplementary skeleton argument by the appellant 14 days before the hearing, does not permit, or envisage, anything remotely like what happened in this case.   “Supplementary” means what it says.  The rule is designed to provide for lately decided or, within limits, discovered authority; changes of underlying factual circumstances; or the brief answering of points in the other side’s argument that genuinely do not arise out of the original grounds of appeal.  It does not permit the wholesale revision of the original case, particularly at three times the length of that original.   Third, we were exercised as to whether we should admit the new skeleton at all, as opposed to making the appellants stand on their original document.   It was principally the fact that Mr Gaisman’s clients stood convicted of fraud that persuaded us to extend the latitude that we did.</p>

Any such approach should make entirely clear what is wanted and why it is wanted.  That will enable the matter to be placed promptly before a Deputy Master or, in appropriate cases, Lord Justice, and avoid the unseemly scramble that was the precursor to this appeal.</p>

The first was that in the conversation of 17 April 1996 ITS, through Mr Lucas, committed the tort of deceit.  By a respondent’s notice in this court that claim was added to by a separate assertion that, even if Mr Lucas was not deceitful in that conversation, shortly thereafter both he and Mr Chalmers acquired sufficient knowledge to make ITS guilty of deceit when they failed to correct the statements that had been made in that conversation.  The second was that the limitation difficulties attaching to its claims in negligence and breach of contract, described in §15 above, could be cured by the fact that both Mr Lucas and Mr Chalmers had deliberately concealed facts relevant to those causes of action, so as to attract section 32(1)(b) of the Limitation Act.</p>

Although I have treated the second and third as distinct cases, I think the third is but an instance of the second, for one who makes a statement under such circumstances can have no real belief in the truth of what he states.  To prevent a false statement from being fraudulent, there must, I think, always be an honest belief in its truth.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">That diffidence must be contrasted with the court’s role assessing the conclusions drawn by the judge from the facts that he does find, or from sources, usually documents, that are equally accessible to this court as they are to the trial judge.  Those principles can be illustrated from the issue, crucial in the present case, of whether Mr Lucas, on the assumption that he then knew about the Cooper re-tests, consciously made a false representation in the conversation of 17 April 1996.  Where, as in the present case, the representation alleged is not in the form of a verbatim statement, but of an “overall impression” (see § 400(i) above), then that conclusion has to be drawn from the primary facts, and the judge’s view on it, though of course very valuable, cannot be dispositive.  And further, as to the speaker’s state of mind, and motives, although the judge will have had a great advantage in seeing and hearing the witness in assessing the validity of his denial of dishonesty, in many cases, of which this is one, that will not be the only or even the primary source on which the judge bases his conclusion.  Rather, the judge will base himself on the logical consistency and plausibility of the witnesses’ claims in the context of the primary facts.   This court, though again finding the judge’s conclusion of great value, will not be inhibited from subjecting that process of logic and deduction to logical scrutiny.  That is particularly so in that serious category of cases where the judge has made findings of fraud.   Where a charge of fraud against a witness whom the judge has seen and heard has been rejected it is unlikely that this court would feel able to reinstate the charge; but the converse does not follow.</p>

Accordingly, not only must the representor have been aware that he was saying what the court finds him to have said, but also he must have been aware that in saying that he was not telling the truth.   The principal complaints made by ITS of the judge’s approach were:  (i) it was, if not plainly wrong, then at least hazardous to identify a representation that is subject to the foregoing rules on the basis of “general impression”;  (ii) that approach made it the more difficult to conclude, with the required degree of certainty, that Mr Lucas knew that he was making <span style="font-style:italic">that particular</span> representation; (iii) the facts strongly militated against Mr Lucas having created the impression found by the judge.</p>

However, I also remember Mobil insisting that the cargo was on-spec and ITS saying they would stand by the certificates of quality.  ITS even accused Tom Whitaker of asking them to commit fraud, just because he asked them to correct the certificates of quality if they were not accurate … in the circumstances, despite Galaxy’s complaints, we had no choice but to pay Mobil.  Mr Hatcher and Mr Whitaker took that decision, but I would not have acted differently.  A company like AIC does not refuse to pay an oil major without a very good reason, and certainly not when it is being told by the oil major that there is nothing wrong with a cargo and cargo inspectors are standing by certificates of quality that are to be final and binding.</p>

On the facts well-known to AIC, the wrong test had been used, and therefore (leaving aside entirely the Cooper re-tests or even any question as to what the proper test would actually show as to RVP) the certificate was invalid: see the exposition of the <span style="font-style:italic">Veba Oil</span> issue in §§ 29-44 above.  So if Mr Lucas said that the certificate was good and valid, that was untrue; and if, as they did, AIC relied on the certificate in their dealings with Mobil and Galaxy, they did so under a mistake of law of their own making.  However, not only AIC itself, but also its lawyers at trial had failed to grasp the implications of the errors in the certificate: see §39 above.  And the parties in this appeal were so far from thinking that <span style="font-style:italic">Veba Oil</span> had any relevance to the issues before us that they did not include the case in their joint bundle of authorities: a compilation that, whatever else might be said about it, revealed no diffidence about putting before the court anything that might even remotely bear on the issues in the appeal.  Although the position may not be entirely satisfactory, the only possible course for this court is to proceed on the basis adopted by the parties in their actual dealings, that as between them the use of the wrong test did not in itself destroy the certificate.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The course of the conversation between Mr Lucas and Mr Whitaker is described in detail in §§ 104-118 above.  What the judge regarded as the critical statement is recorded in §110: “we will be standing by that certificate”.  If that statement alone stood, I would regard it as validating the judge’s construction of the conversation.  The whole context of the conversation was that Mr Whitaker wanted to know whether he could rely on the certificate, and rely on ITS as certificator.  However little Mr Lucas knew about the history of this particular dispute, as a senior executive of a testing house he must have known of the role that certificates would play in his client’s affairs.  Arguments such as those pursued before us that all that this statement meant was that the readings on the certificate would not be altered pay insufficient respect to the context in which the statement was made.  Taken on its own, this statement did give the comfort that AIC drew from it and to their reliance on it: see §406 above.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">But the statement did not stand on its own.  When Mr Whitaker pressed Mr Lucas as to whether or not the actual values in the certificate were correct, Mr Lucas was notably reluctant to commit himself: see §§ 111-112 above.  That attitude may not have been very attractive, and might cause ITS difficulty in a contractual or negligence claim, but it plainly was not a positive assertion of the kind, or in the terms, that the judge construed out of the conversation.  And it was the values that mattered, not only to Mr Whitaker, but also in the context of the present claim; because the foundation of the case against Mr Lucas is that when he spoke he knew of the Cooper re-tests, whose importance is as to the light they cast on the accuracy of the values: see § 400(iii) above.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The position that Mr Lucas took in the conversation as to the values in the certificate in my view makes it impossible to read the conversation taken as a whole as containing the assertion found by the judge.  And I agree that that is borne out by Mr Whitaker’s understanding expressed on the following day: see §125 above.  Others in AIC may have taken comfort from ITS’s position, including its decision not to withdraw the certificate, and might well be able to complain of the damage that they suffered in trying to escape from the dilemma into which ITS’s attitude placed them.  But that does not lead to a conclusion that in the conversation itself Mr Lucas made the assertion that the judge found.</p>

That is also the conclusion reached by Rix LJ in §280 above.  However, like my Lord, I will go on and review the other elements in the judge’s finding of deceit, not least because some parts of that enquiry are also relevant to the second part of the case relating to deliberate concealment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The judge made findings as to the knowledge of Mr Lucas (and of Mr Chalmers) at two places in his judgment.  The first was in his §§ 198-203, the passage set out in §90 above.  As indicated in §91 above, that passage is open to criticism, because it indicates or might indicate that the judge was attributing to Messrs Lucas and Chalmers in 1996 knowledge and understanding that had only been exposed before him after elaborate expert evidence at a trial in 2005.  I think that there is some force in that complaint.  It should perhaps be remembered that in that passage the judge was answering the question posed for him by the parties as to whether the RVP results in the certificate were accurate.  His observation in his §203, after he had answered that question, that Messrs Lucas and Chalmers knew the matters set out in his answer, could perhaps at that stage of the judgment be characterised as gratuitous.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, the judge returned to that issue in his §283, when answering the specific question: Was Mr Lucas dishonest in what he said and did not say during the telecon on 17 April 1996?  The answer that he gave to that question is set out in §93 above.  In that part of the judgment there is no direct reference, and almost no inferential reference, to the view of the experts.  Almost the whole of the judge’s emphasis is on Mr Lucas’s knowledge of the Cooper re-tests and of their importance.  To those subjects I now turn.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At the trial ITS gave evidence, particularly through Mr Chalmers, that the Cooper retests had been an inappropriate step, involving the plainly unreliable testing of residues or “slops”; they were a private initiative of Mr Rackham; and Mr Chalmers if he had known about them would have rebuked Mr Rackham in forceful terms for engaging in that operation.  That evidence is summarised in §§ 222-226 above.  If reliable, it lends credibility to the claim that, contrary to the judge’s findings, ITS through Mr Lucas did not appreciate that the Cooper retests cast serious doubt on the values stated in the certificate.  The judge did not accept Mr Chalmers’ evidence on this issue.  I understand from §§ 291-293 above that Rix LJ considers that the judge was wrong in so holding.  I cannot, with deference, accept that that position is open to us in the light of the principles set out at the start of this judgment.  However, if that seems too simplistic a way of addressing this point I would mention a number of matters that support the judge’s conclusion.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First, Mr Rackham regarded the step that he took as appropriate and important.  In his early morning e-mail of 17 April he reported the findings of the Cooper retests, which were detrimental to ITS, not only to Mr Chalmers but also to Mr Loughead, who was the senior manager of all the people involved in this matter: see §§ 83-84 above.  Second, on the previous day Mr Rackham had had his 1333 conversation with Mr Chalmers, noted by the enigmatic “JC re Kriti Palm.  Harass UK.  Need low RVP”.  The parties’ cases as to this note, and the judge’s conclusions not only as to the facts but also as to their implications, are set out in §§ 74-76 above.  I am afraid that I found ITS’s construction, which does not appear to have been advanced at the trial, completely unconvincing.  The note is simply not what Mr Rackham would have written if reporting a complaint by him to Mr Chalmers of AIC’s aggressiveness, nor did Mr Rackham suggest that it was.  And if that had been Mr Rackham’s objective it is inconceivable that he would not at the same time at least have mentioned to Mr Chalmers how he had reacted, by commissioning the Cooper retests: at which stage Mr Chalmers, according to his evidence at the trial about his view of the Cooper retests, would have blown up all over the telephone.</p>

The judge is criticised by ITS for not expanding on those reservations, and I agree that it would have been better, in a case such as the present, if he had said more on the subject.  I however remind myself of what Lord Hoffmann said in <span style="font-style:italic">Biogen</span>, §401 above.  And the difficulty already explained of reconciling Mr Chalmers’s claims in evidence with the contemporary documents, such as they were, only serves to reinforce the judge’s unease.</p>

Just as with the judge’s findings in respect of the knowledge of Mr Chalmers, so in the case of Mr Lucas it is very difficult for this court to intervene; and, as in that earlier case, there are a number of commonsense considerations that support the judge’s conclusion in any event.  Central to investigation of what Mr Rackham told Mr Lucas must be Mr Rackham’s reasons for commissioning the Cooper retests, and the weight that he placed on them.  We have already explored that issue.  It is really very implausible that when he briefed his superior about how he had been holding the fort in his absence he would have told Mr Lucas what the problem was, but not what he had done to try to meet that problem; and almost equally implausible that if he had omitted that last stage, Mr Lucas would not have pressed him on it.</p>

We have already noted the nature of the knowledge that is required to establish a case of deceit: see the observation of Devlin J in <span style="font-style:italic">Armstrong v Strain</span> cited in §399(iii) above.  Even if (which for the reasons set out above I do not accept) Mr Lucas can be construed as having in the conversation made the representation found by the judge, it does not follow from his simple knowledge of the Cooper retests that he must have realised, with the degree of immediacy and certainty necessary for a finding of deceit, that what he was saying about the certificate was falsified by the Cooper retests.  The points as to the circumstances of the conversation, Mr Lucas’s lack of preparation for it, and his reaction after it, listed in §420 above, and the further considerations set out by Rix LJ in §285 above, are directly relevant to that issue, even though they are not dispositive on the prior issue of whether Mr Lucas was told about the Cooper retests.</p>

An account of these exchanges is given in §§ 169-192 above.

It is, however, relevant to observe that the judge was led into this enquiry by its being included in the question paper set for him by the parties: which perhaps here, as elsewhere, he over-indulgently allowed to dictate the shape of his judgment.

The issue there, and in this case, is not whether ITS acted in an “advisory capacity” to Mobil and AIC, because plainly, apart from its obligations as certifier, it did not do so.  Nor is the question of whether in the terms of the Act ITS had a duty to reveal the Cooper re-tests necessarily determined by reference to ITS’s <span style="font-style:italic">contractual</span> duties.  However, that question having been posed, ITS answered it by saying that once the inspector had issued his certificate he was functus officio in the same way as an arbitrator after the publication of an award.  If the inspector subsequently discovered that he had not performed or had wrongly expressed his mandate (for instance, if he had used the wrong samples; or the certificate misstated the test that had been used), then he should issue a corrective letter to both parties.  But if information comes to hand after the giving of the certificate that simply might cause the certifier to alter an opinion as to the values set out in the certificate (a category into which the Cooper retests would appear to fall) there was no obligation to correct the certificate, provided that the opinion expressed in it, in this case by Mr Mailey, had originally been honestly held.</p>

The judge was however taken aback by ITS’s extension of that principle to a claim that even in circumstances such as those of the Cooper re-tests there was no question of ITS having to do anything.  It was apparently he who required to see ITS’s internal documents, having heard expert evidence about international standards that was difficult to reconcile with ITS’s approach: see the Judgment at §152, and also §180 above.  It is therefore hardly surprising that the judge took his guidance as to the process required from an inspection agency from what he understood was this agency’s own internal procedure.</p>

And that the judge had used the wrong internal guidance was so far from the mind of the executives actually running ITS that the point did not feature either in the Grounds of Appeal or even in the 168 page skeleton on the basis of which the appeal was opened before us, but only emerged on something like the second day of the hearing.  AIC were justified in complaining that by then the point could not in any event be open to ITS, and I regret that I did not take that complaint more seriously.   However, the practical effect of that history is to cast the greatest doubt on whether the relevant ITS executives thought the detail of the various manuals to be relevant to their duty to their client.  As AIC pointed out, Mr Chalmers was in court throughout the trial and was aware of the judge’s wish to identify all relevant standards and procedures.  If the inspection manual now asserted to be the sole source of ITS’s duty had been seen by ITS as significant as a matter of commercial reality it would certainly have been relied on before the judge; and even if overlooked then would have emerged much earlier in what has clearly been the most detailed and anxious preparation of the appeal.</p>

That evidence, not only from Mr Lucas and (to a lesser extent) from Mr Chalmers, but also from their superior Mr Loughead, was given in the context of claims that neither Mr Lucas nor Mr Chalmers knew of the Cooper retests at any relevant time, and that in any event the Cooper retests if known to them would have been discarded as useless.  As we have seen, the judge rejected all of those claims, in terms that are not open to challenge in this court; but the evidence with which we are concerned was not contingent on those assumptions, and the judge’s findings on them cannot affect, and was not suggested to affect, the validity (or the integrity) of the answers that were given.</p>

He dealt with the matter by saying that even if he had known about the Cooper retests, which he did not, he would not have contemplated telling AIC about them.  That was not because of any lack of duty to AIC to disclose relevant information, a position that he could not have maintained in the light of his answers recorded at §§ 225 and 233 above; but because if told about the Cooper retests he would have thought them to be worthless.  In that he differed from the view of Mr Loughead, §435 above, a position in which Mr Chalmers said he often found himself.  And, more pressingly, this part of Mr Chalmers’s evidence was rejected by the Judge, in terms with which this court cannot interfere: see §§ 417-419 above.  The upshot is that Mr Chalmers gave no evidence that ITS can put against Mr Lucas’s acceptance that if the Cooper retests were known about they should have been disclosed to AIC, albeit with whatever “health warning” ITS thought it appropriate to attach to the work of Mr Rackham and of Mr Cooper.</p>

We have seen the unchallenged evidence of AIC as to the importance to them of the accuracy of the statements of quality on the certificate: see §406 above.  The judge also stressed, and no-one has suggested that he was wrong, the importance of the accuracy of a certificate to buyers and sub-buyers: Judgment, §183.  Not only as a matter of law, but also commercially, it really challenges reality to think that a certifier, armed with tests that suggested that the tests used to complete the certificate had or might have produced incorrect results, could nonetheless simply do nothing about it; and in particular could properly say nothing about those tests to those who had employed him to certify.</p>

It is for the holder of the certificate to decide what he does with the information once he receives it.   What I cannot accept is that considerations of certainty empower the <span style="font-style:italic">certifier</span> to take that decision for the holder by withholding relevant information from him.  Nor does such a duty create a continuing duty of review and disclosure under every conceivable kind of contract: Cf §351 above.  This is the specific case of a certificate, where the certifier was in possession of material of his own creation that cast doubt on the certificate that he had given.  To hold, as I would, that he was under a duty in Limitation Act terms to reveal that material does not open any floodgate in any other sort of relationship.</p>

When pressed in cross-examination about when he first knew of the Cooper retests, and why on the assumption that he knew of them during his exchanges with Mr Whitaker he did not mention them, Mr Lucas said that in any event it was ITS’s policy to adopt a “stone wall” once a claim was notified:  see the evidence summarised at §197 above.  It was only faintly suggested to us that the existence of a claim would justify non-disclosure, in the sense of taking outside the ambit of section 32 what otherwise would be a relevant breach of duty; but I address the point nonetheless.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First, I cannot accept the argument as a matter of law.  If ITS did have a duty to tell AIC about the Cooper retests, it cannot exempt ITS from discharging that duty that AIC are threatening to sue ITS on a basis that, by definition, does not embrace the Cooper retests.  How ITS protects itself in litigation is its own business, but it cannot use that protection to place its own interests in front of its duty to its client.  Second, Mr Lucas could not on his own evidence assert that this was the reason for his decision, because on that evidence he knew nothing of the Cooper retests, and therefore the issue could not have arisen.  Third, although in the conversation Mr Whitaker certainly suggested that he might be forced to bring proceedings, it was not the case that during or immediately after that conversation things had reached the stage of a formal “claim”, so as to excite the ITS policy referred to by Mr Lucas; nor did Mr Lucas ever break off relations with Mr Whitaker in the way that would apparently have been required by ITS’s stone-wall policy had he perceived himself to be “under notice of claim”.</p>

That would have been the case irrespective of whether or not Mr Lucas told AIC about the Cooper retests.  That is quite different from a complaint that is limited to saying that Mr Lucas should have told AIC about the Cooper retests so that AIC could make up its own mind as to the course that it should take.  I appreciate that Rix LJ does not take that view, and concludes in his §§ 314 and 366 that the rejection of the judge’s conclusion in relation to deceit leads to the rejection of his conclusion as to deliberate concealment.  For the reasons set out earlier in this paragraph I am with deference unable to agree.</p>

It is not enough that evidence that might enhance the claim is concealed, provided that the claim can be properly pleaded without it.  The court therefore has to look for the gist of the cause of action that is asserted, to see if that was available to the claimant without knowledge of the concealed material.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Johnson</span> the plaintiff sought to bring a claim of false imprisonment against the police, and discovered more than six years after his arrest that the police had, allegedly, concealed from him material that demonstrated that they had had no genuine belief in his guilt.

AIC’s pleading, in §§ 21-23B3 of its heavily re-amended Particulars of Claim, is a complex document, difficult to summarise.  No criticism is however to be made of the pleader, because he had to work in the context of the serial disclosures as to the relevant events that emerged from ITS in the course of the proceedings.  However, in the hope of being able legitimately to shorten consideration of this point I append those paragraphs to this judgment.   It should be noted that the pleading includes, without any very clear demarcation, the allegations of deceit that I have rejected earlier in this judgment.</p>

He of course contended that there was no duty to reveal the Cooper retests, a contention that in company with the judge I have rejected.  But Mr Gaisman in effect said that it was an abuse of section 32(1)(b) to apply it to such a case.  The claim was parasitic on the other claims; added nothing to them by way of loss or damage suffered by AIC; and was simply a device to get some sort of complaint about the concealment of the Cooper retests on its feet.  I see the force of those contentions, but no authority was cited for the suggestion that they suffice to exclude the application of section 32 <span style="font-style:italic">in limine</span>, and such a rule would seem inappropriate if applied to causes of action that are not suggested to be abusive <span style="font-style:italic">per se</span>.

I did not understand a view as fundamental as that to be pursued before us.  Rather, it was contended that, looking in more detail at the claims now sought to be made, AIC had been able, before it had access to the Cooper retests, to plead, first that the wrong test, D323 rather than D5191, had been used; and second, on the basis of the disport tests (see §61 above) would if so minded have been able to plead that, contrary to the certificate, the cargo was or might be off-specification.  The Cooper retests were irrelevant to the first of those claims, and in respect of the second of them only added further evidence.</p>

A party may fail to perform his duty, whether in contract or in negligence, in a variety of different ways.  In the present instance, the certifier may breach his duty by negligently reaching a wrong result; or by misinforming his client about some material fact; or by failing to reveal some matter that is relevant to the client’s reliance on the certificate.  Although each of those complaints relates to a failure of the certifier to perform his duties, the breaches relate to different aspects or heads of those duties, and generate different causes of action: even though all of them are causes of action in negligence, and all of them complain of the certifier’s performance of his duties.</p>

Before the Cooper retests were available, that claim could be pleaded only in terms of failure to communicate what ITS would or should have known would be the case if the cargo had been tested accurately and by D5191.  A breach of duty in terms of failure to communicate what the certifier ought to have known is a different complaint, and asserts a different cause of action, from a breach of duty in terms of failure to communicate what the certifier did actually know, the result of the Cooper retests, which latter breach is pleaded by amendment in § 23A2.</p>

Before the Cooper retests had been revealed, that claim of negligence had to be limited to failure by ITS to take into account what it should have known in general terms.  Once the Cooper retests were available to AIC, it was able to plead for the first time that ITS was negligent by failing to give proper weight to the results of the Cooper retests.  A cause of action in negligent representation is completed by asserting first the representation; second that it was false; and third the negligent fault on the part of the representor that caused the falsity.  Where there are different respects in which the representor was negligent, those different respects generate different causes of action, even though the first and second items listed above are common to all of them.  This is such a case.  The cause of action that complains that the representation was false because of failure on ITS’s part to act on the Cooper retests is different from the cause of action in negligent representation that was pleaded before the Cooper retests were known about.</p>

The complaint then of the use of D323 was that ITS knew that the two tests would give different results, with D323 showing a lower reading that incorrectly made the cargo appear to be within specification, but did not reveal that to AIC.  Mr Gaisman argued in his closing submissions that on the assumption that AIC were wrong, and the two tests would in fact give comparable results, then AIC could have used the disport tests, conducted according to D5191, to plead that Mr Mailey’s test, using D323, must have been conducted incompetently.</p>

The Judge indeed held, on the basis of the expert evidence at the trial, that D323 would produce results comparable to those produced by D5191.  ITS however complained strongly that it had been unfair of the Judge to rely on that finding in the face of very strong evidence that not only AIC but also ITS itself thought otherwise at the time of the events complained of.  It is not necessary to set out ITS’s evidence to that effect, which is summarised at §§ 109-110 of ITS’s opening skeleton in this court.  But if that was the general view at the time, AIC can hardly be criticised for not realising, and certainly cannot be criticised for not pleading, that the results of the disport tests in themselves demonstrated that Mr Mailey’s D323 tests had very likely been conducted incorrectly.  Scales fell from eyes only with the revelation of the Cooper retests, which enabled AIC to plead for the first time not the competent use of a non-comparable test, but the incompetent use of a comparable test.</p>
