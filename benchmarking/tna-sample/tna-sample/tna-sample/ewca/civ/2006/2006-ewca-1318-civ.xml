	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This is the judgment of the court, to which all its members have contributed.  The judgment relates to appeals arising out of two distinct investigations by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) under the Competition Act 1998 (the 1998 Act, or the Act).  One, referred to at the hearing as Toys and Games, was into agreements between Hasbro UK Ltd, Argos Ltd and Littlewoods Ltd fixing the price of Hasbro toys and games.  The OFT’s amended decision, number CA98/8/2003, was issued on 21 November 2003.  It found that Hasbro, Argos and Littlewoods had been parties to an agreement in breach of the Chapter I prohibition under the 1998 Act.  It imposed substantial penalties on Argos and Littlewoods, but not on Hasbro because of a leniency agreement in relation to that party.  Argos and Littlewoods both appealed to the Competition Appeal Tribunal (the Tribunal) against the finding of breach of the Act and against the penalty imposed.  The Tribunal rejected the appeal on liability though it reduced the penalties on each appellant.  Each of Argos and Littlewoods appeals to this court, with the permission of Jonathan Parker LJ, on both liability and penalty.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The other investigation, known as Football Shirts, was into price-fixing of replica football kit.  The OFT’s decision, CA98/06/2003, was issued on 1 August 2003.  It found that price-fixing agreements in breach of the Chapter I prohibition had been entered into by the Football Association, Manchester United plc, Umbro Holdings Ltd and a number of retailers including JJB Sports plc (JJB), Sports Soccer Ltd and Allsports Ltd in 2000 and 2001.  It imposed penalties on the parties, apart from one which was by then in administration.  JJB and Allsports appealed to the Tribunal against the finding of infringement and the penalty; Umbro and Manchester United appealed only on the amount of the penalty.  On liability the Tribunal held that JJB had infringed the Chapter I prohibition, but not in all the respects in which the OFT had found, so that appeal was allowed in part.  Allsports’ appeal on liability was dismissed.  On the appeals on penalty, the amount of each penalty was varied, in the case of JJB by a significant reduction.  Only JJB appeals to this court, on liability and penalty, again with permission granted by Jonathan Parker LJ.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The facts of the Toys and Games appeal on the one hand and the Football Shirts appeal on the other are different and unconnected.  However, the appeals on liability are only on points of law, and similar points arise on liability and also to some extent on penalty in each appeal.  These appeals are the first to the Court of Appeal arising from these provisions of the 1998 Act.  Accordingly, the appeals were directed to be heard in succession, by the same court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The judgment which follows is regrettably long.  The judgments under appeal were themselves very long, as were the decisions of the OFT against which the appeals to the Tribunal were brought.  The length of the Tribunal’s judgments reflects a number of factors, not the least being the conscientious attention to detail applied by the Tribunal to the process of deciding the cases before it, and explaining its reasoning.  The cases were hard fought before the Tribunal, and a great deal was at stake.  The sheer size of the judgments, especially those on liability, makes them quite difficult to manage, as the Tribunal itself no doubt found when composing them.  The method adopted by the Tribunal of dealing with different aspects of the fact-finding process in different parts of the text allowed the judgments, perhaps inevitably, to be exposed to a close textual analysis by Counsel by reference to the use of different words or phrases in different passages, which may well have been intended to refer to the same things with no difference of meaning, submitting that different meanings must have been intended by the use of different words.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Complicated as appeals of this kind to the Tribunal are often likely to be, it may be that the Tribunal will, over time, find it possible to deal with such appeals in judgments which are not so long as those under appeal in the present cases.  A decision of the Tribunal such as those with which we are concerned is no different in principle from a decision of any other tribunal or a court after a trial involving disputed issues of fact, and maybe law.  The reasoning of Griffiths LJ (as he then was) in <span style="font-style:italic">Eagil Trust Co Ltd v.

Nor is it always necessary for the Tribunal to set out each party’s submissions in detail before explaining its reasons for deciding the case.  We therefore express the hope that, in future, it will be possible for the Tribunal to express its findings of fact and its reasoning in more succinct form.  Its efforts to do so will have the support of this court, provided always that the essential tasks identified by Griffiths LJ have been fulfilled.</p>

After setting out the statutory provisions and discussing points of general application, we will deal with the Football Shirts appeal and then the Toys and Games appeals in turn on liability, and then turn to the penalty appeals, first setting out matters of general relevance, and then discussing the Football Shirts appeal and the Toys and Games appeals on penalty successively.</p>

It is not legally necessary to distinguish between agreements and concerted practices, and references by the Tribunal in its judgments to agreements included concerted practices.  We will differentiate between them only so far as seems necessary or appropriate.  The Tribunal set out a summary of the relevant law which, in itself, is not controversial at paragraphs 150 to 163 of its judgment in the Football Shirts appeals and similarly at paragraphs 145 to 156 of its judgment in the Toys and Games appeals, drawing in each case on judgments of the European Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance.

A concerted practice does not have all the elements of an agreement but may arise out of co-ordination which becomes apparent from the behaviour of the participants.  Parallel behaviour may amount to strong evidence of a concerted practice if it leads to conditions of competition which do not correspond to the normal conditions of the market: <span style="font-style:italic">ICI v Commission</span> [1972] ECR 619 (“<span style="font-style:italic">Dyestuffs</span>”).</p>

The Tribunal, in its judgment on liability, [2004] CAT 17, found that JJB was not a party to the England Direct agreement, and that although it was a party to an agreement relating to the MU Centenary Shirt, it was not a party to a continuing agreement from mid-2000 until July 2001.  Accordingly, the Tribunal found established JJB’s participation in the England Agreement, the MU Agreement and the MU Centenary Shirt Agreement.  All of these were found to be trilateral agreements.  Only in relation to the England Agreement does JJB appeal, and the terms of its Appellant’s Notice do not challenge the finding of a bilateral vertical agreement between itself and Umbro in relation to the England shirt for the Euro 2000 competition.  It is only the horizontal, trilateral aspect of the England Agreement which is at issue on the appeal.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Umbro’s policy was selective as regards replica kit, limiting supplies to those regarded as authentic sports retailers and, for example, refusing to supply supermarkets.  It was Umbro’s practice (as it was also of other suppliers such as Nike) to publish recommended resale prices for replica kit.  In 2000 it recommended £42.99 for an adult replica shirt and £32.99 for the junior equivalent.  However, in 1998 at the time of the World Cup JJB had said that it would not sell an adult shirt for more than £40, and £39.99 became an effective ceiling price, referred to as the High Street price.  Umbro and other suppliers of replica kit were hostile to discounting below the High Street price.  The advent of Sports Soccer in 1999, as a substantial and active discounter in this market, generated a good deal of tension on the part of others involved in the market at all levels: other retailers, suppliers such as Umbro and licensors such as MU.  In late 1999 and the early part of 2000 JJB met this challenge by substantial discounting in strategic outlets which were near a Sports Soccer shop.  In February 2000 Sports Soccer indicated to Umbro that it intended to charge £32 for an adult England shirt and £24 for the junior shirt.</p>

It was the OFT’s contention, as a result of its investigation, that this led Umbro to take steps aimed at ensuring that the principal kit retailers did not discount the prices of Umbro replica kit in the key selling periods, namely a period after launch for the new club kits, and the period just before and during the Euro 2000 competition for the England kit, and, at the same time, MU sought to ensure that retailers maintained the price of MU replica kit, and JJB also brought pressure to bear with a view to seeing that other retailers did not discount the price of replica kit.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">So far as the England kit is concerned, the main objective of the relevant efforts was to see that Sports Soccer would not discount sales from shortly before the competition and during the competition (at least for as long as England remained a participant).  The kit was already on sale, and Sports Soccer was selling it at a discounted price, between £32 and £34 for the adult product.  It is not now in dispute that Sports Soccer agreed with Umbro to raise its prices for the England replica kit, on the basis of assurances that the other major retailers would not discount, and that it did raise its prices on 3 June, and maintained them until 21 June when England was knocked out of the tournament.  The Tribunal reviewed in some detail the relationship between Umbro and Sports Soccer.  Sports Soccer was very reluctant to agree not to discount prices, and even when it did agree, it did not always keep strictly to the agreement.  Umbro was able to and did exert considerable pressure on Sports Soccer to persuade it to agree not to discount, by threatening that it might not otherwise receive a full allocation of the replica kits, and perhaps also of other Umbro products.  Sports Soccer could not afford to run the risk of not having adequate supplies of the “must have” England and MU replica shirts during peak selling periods.  For that reason, Sports Soccer did agree to raise its prices for England kit late in May 2000, as well as agreeing to maintain High Street prices on replica kit for 60 days from launch, and, under further pressure from Umbro on 2 June, did in fact raise its prices for the England shirt the following day.</p>

The question for this court is whether the Tribunal was right to accept that JJB was a party.  JJB does not deny that it told Umbro that it would not discount, but it disputes that this made it a party to an agreement or concerted practice with anyone other than Umbro.</p>

On behalf of Umbro and Sports Soccer, the evidence given to the Tribunal was that, if Sports Soccer had discounted the England shirt during the Euro 2000 competition, JJB would have done so as well.  Of course it was not for their witnesses to say what JJB would have done, but that was what they had expected would have happened, in the light of the price war which had occurred, even though by the beginning of May 2000 it had been, at least, suspended by JJB.</p>

Given the size of its share of the market in sportswear, JJB had considerable market power, which enabled it, for example, to impose a ceiling price of £39.99 for adult replica shirts.  The size of its orders from Umbro was such that it also had considerable bargaining power in relation to Umbro.  Some of Umbro’s replica kit were essential items for any sportswear retailer, including JJB, but Umbro was over dependent, as regards branded products, on its sales to JJB.  In 2000 JJB spent £10.3 million buying replica kit from Umbro, but £20.5 million in buying Umbro’s branded products.  It could have caused Umbro real difficulties by switching some or all of its branded product purchases to a rival such as Nike.  Umbro therefore felt under pressure in early 2000 to do whatever it could to assuage any commercial concerns expressed to it by JJB.</p>

The price competition that had taken place up to April 2000 must have had an adverse effect on JJB’s margins.  If Sports Soccer had discounted the England shirt during Euro 2000 JJB must, or at least might well, have done the same, which would have caused further damage to JJB’s margins.  JJB did not wish to see discounting on leading replica shirts, including the England shirt during Euro 2000, and expected Umbro to do something to see that discounting did not happen.</p>

We find it difficult to accept that Mr. Russell’s sole purpose in complaining to Mr. Bryan about discounting by Sports Soccer was “to get better terms for JJB”.  In our view, an able and experienced replica buyer such as Mr. Russell would have realised that Umbro might very well respond to complaints by a powerful customer such as JJB by looking for ways to curtail Sports Soccer’s discounting.  Mr. Guest of Allsports realised that (Day 11, p. 69) and it would be surprising if Mr. Russell did not.  We therefore find it difficult to believe that Mr. Russell realised this only “with the benefit of hindsight”, or that Mr. Russell did not realise that one option open to Umbro was to limit, or threaten to limit, supplies of replica kit to Sports Soccer.</p>

In our view that was one of the principal purposes, or at least the reasonably foreseeable effect, behind the conversations about Sports Soccer’s discounting that took place in the relevant period between Mr. Whelan and Mr. McGuigan, Mr. Whelan and Mr. Ronnie, Mr. Russell and Mr. Fellone, and Mr. Russell and Mr. Bryan. “Getting better terms for JJB” does not seem to us to be an adequate explanation and there is no evidence of any discussion of “better terms” in the period prior to Euro 2000.  In this case, in our view, JJB was making complaints and using its bargaining power with a view to affecting the discounting activities of a competitor.  The fact that there is no written record of such conversations is immaterial given the evidence before the Tribunal that such conversations took place.”</p>

Nevertheless it held that JJB’s complaints were a significant and material factor in inducing Umbro to persuade Sports Soccer to raise its prices for the England shirt for Euro 2000 (paragraph 429).  It seems to us that the Tribunal was right to regard this as an important part of the context for the communications between JJB and Umbro about JJB’s pricing policy at the end of May 2000.  JJB made it clear to Umbro that it wanted Sports Soccer to charge the High Street price, so that it would not have to discount its own prices, and it wanted Umbro to see that this happened.</p>

Umbro gave it those assurances, relating to JJB above all, being not only the principal retailer but also the party with whom Sports Soccer had been engaged in a price war for some 6 months up to April.</p>

Whatever the precise sequence, it is in our view established that in the course of Mr. Ronnie’s telephone conversations Mr. Sharpe of JJB gave Umbro an assurance, or at least an indication, that JJB would maintain the £39.99 price point if other retailers did not discount.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">One of JJB’s arguments was that there was no reason for Umbro to speak to JJB in order to find out what JJB’s pricing intentions were, because it was well known that JJB did not discount except in response to competitors, and would not have discounted a major product such as the England shirt during the Euro 2000.  The Tribunal rejected that, both because it had heard and accepted evidence that there were conversations on the point, and because JJB’s own witnesses had said that the market could not be certain at what price JJB would sell.  JJB’s prices were highly confidential and its price on a launch was only decided a few days in advance.  The England shirt was not a new launch, and JJB was already selling the England shirt at £39.99, but coming up to a critical selling period, during Euro 2000, JJB might have needed to take a new decision about pricing policy, and if Sports Soccer had gone on discounting JJB might have had to do the same.  Umbro could not safely have assumed that JJB would continue to sell at £39.99 absent a specific assurance to that effect.  For these reasons, as explained in its judgment, the Tribunal accepted that JJB did tell Umbro what its pricing intentions were in relation to the England replica kit in advance of the Euro 2000 competition.</p>

In principle that is also the case, but the finding is that he did confirm it to JJB, and it seems to us that the correctness of the finding of an agreement or concerted practice on a trilateral basis involving JJB, Sports Soccer and Umbro is to be tested by reference to the facts which the Tribunal did find.  We have cited at paragraph [32] above what the Tribunal said at paragraph 659, which relates to the consequences if there were communication by JJB to Umbro and then by Umbro to Sports Soccer, but not any further communication by Umbro to JJB.

It seems to us that it would be unfair to criticise the Tribunal for having divided up its treatment of the material before it into different sections in the way it did.  While it would be desirable to achieve a precise and consistent use of wording throughout a long judgment, it would be unreasonable to pick on slight differences of language here or there in relation to the same or similar subject matter, in order to cast doubt on the nature of the Tribunal’s finding on a point.  We do not propose to refer to more than a few of Mr Lasok’s textual points on the judgment, but we have examined them all in preparing this judgment.  </p>

It seems to us that Mr Lasok’s submissions did sometimes tend to isolate some passages in which findings of fact are set out rather than to take account of the context as appearing from other passages, perhaps in a different section of the judgment.</p>

As a matter of general principle that is a fair point.  The first question, however, is whether on a fair reading of the judgment as a whole there is any such doubt.  In the particular case we are satisfied that there is no such doubt which would need to be resolved in favour of JJB.</p>

Of course there is and could be no general rule on the point.  There can be complaints of all sorts, by no means all of which are made in the expectation that anything will be done about the matter complained about, still less something that might amount to a breach of the Chapter I prohibition.  In the present case, however, as the Tribunal pointed out at paragraph 667, the complaints were vigorous and repeated, they were made at the highest levels, and they were backed up by an implicit threat arising from the strength of JJB’s commercial position in relation to Umbro.</p>

Among Hasselblad’s authorised distributors in the UK, for a time, was a company based in London called Camera Care (CC), but it ceased to be authorised after complaints by HGB about its advertising.  The market for VH’s products was such that there was price competition within the EEC, giving rise to a degree of parallel imports.  HGB suffered from this phenomenon and complained to VH, which was able to identify to which of its national sole distributors a particular camera had been supplied.  Through sample purchases from CC, VH was able to ascertain that its supplies had come from Ilford.  It was then found that these had been bought from Ilford by a dealer based in Belfast, who had sold on to CC.  In response to pressure from VH, prompted by HGB, Ilford agreed not to sell to any purchaser based in the UK.  CC also bought products from Têlos, and despite agreeing not to resell them in the EEC, in fact sold to retail purchasers in England.  Eventually Têlos refused to supply any more VH cameras to CC.  There were also similar problems arising from sales by the Belgian sole distributor, Prolux, to another dealer based in France, about which Têlos complained.  The Commission noted that it was a regular practice of VH and its sole distributors to provide each other with their respective price lists and terms of business applicable in each Member State.</p>

However, Victor Hasselblad used the information it received to inform its sole distributors.  As can be seen from Victor Hasselblad’s letters of 18 June 1974 and 13 October 1978 to Têlos and to Hasselblad (GB) respectively, this exchange of information was designed precisely to prevent exports (‘pirate exports’) or to remove the incentive for them.”</p>

He also pointed out that, in that case, there were complaints direct by one supplier (HGB) to another (Ilford and Têlos) as well as complaints by HGB to the manufacturer, VH, and that the complaints were specifically and expressly aimed at ensuring that Ilford and Têlos did not supply customers from outside their territories.  In the present case, by contrast, the complaints were only from JJB to Umbro, not direct to Sports Soccer, and they were not in specific terms as to how the matter complained of (Sports Soccer’s discounting of England shirts) should be addressed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Certainly there are factual differences between this case and the <span style="font-style:italic">Hasselblad</span> case.  In principle it does not matter whether the origin of an alleged concerted practice is said to be a complaint by one undertaking, such as HGB or JJB, about the practices of another (Ilford or Têlos, or Sports Soccer), aimed at getting those practices changed, or a less confrontational proposal (as in the Toys and Games cases).  What matters is the end result.  If the complaints are addressed directly by one undertaking to that whose conduct is the subject of the complaint, then it would be difficult for the first to contend that, if the subject of the complaint changes its conduct so as to remove the cause for the complaint, that was not what was aimed at, so that the end result does not amount to a concerted practice for lack of consensus.  It is only because, in the present case, the complaints were addressed indirectly, by JJB to Umbro, that it is necessary to examine JJB’s state of mind in making the complaints in order to assess the submission that, although Umbro achieved the result that JJB said it wanted Umbro to arrange, it did not amount to a concerted practice involving JJB because of the absence of any subjective consensus on the part of JJB.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A further point of distinction which Mr Lasok sought to draw is that, in <span style="font-style:italic">Hasselblad,</span> the pressure was specifically directed towards an anti-competitive goal, namely to prevent sales to purchasers outside the particular distributor’s territory, whereas in the present case, he submitted, JJB’s complaints did not require that anything unlawful be done, and the cause for complaint could have been satisfied in a lawful manner.  He pointed out that a complaint by one wholesale customer of a manufacturer to that manufacturer about the pricing policy of another such customer could be satisfied (if it was to be at all) by the manufacturer reducing the prices it charged to the complaining customer, or by discontinuing supplies to the other, neither of which (he said) would infringe the Chapter I prohibition nor, unless the withdrawal of supplies amounted to an abuse of a dominant position, the Chapter II prohibition.  Thus, taken at its highest, JJB’s demand that Umbro “do something” about Sports Soccer’s discounting could not be understood as requiring Umbro to act unlawfully.  Accordingly, if Umbro did act unlawfully, by coming to a price-fixing agreement with Sports Soccer, that was a matter of its choice, for which JJB should not be made responsible by treating it as a party to an agreement or concerted practice.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">He also pointed out that on one occasion in 2001 when JJB did cancel an order of shirts from Umbro (MU Centenary shirts) in response to Sports Soccer selling MU home shirts at heavily discounted wholesale prices, JJB’s motive was to put pressure on Umbro to sell MU home shirts to it at lower prices.  That is true, but it was in a quite different situation, where JJB’s complaint was that Umbro had sold to Sports Soccer at low clearance prices, and had not offered the same price to JJB as well as (or instead of) to Sports Soccer.  While it is therefore factually correct to observe that Umbro could have reduced its wholesale prices to JJB for the England shirt at the time of the Euro 2000 competition, it does not seem to us that anyone could have supposed that it would do so.  Umbro did not in fact offer to do so, nor is it said that JJB asked for this to be done.  Equally, given the “must have” status of the product for any sportswear retailer, it could not have been expected that Umbro would refuse to supply the England shirt to Sports Soccer altogether, though it might use a threat of that, or more likely of a reduction in the quantities supplied, to persuade Sports Soccer to raise its prices.  It seems to us that Mr Sharpe would have been astonished if, when Mr Ronnie telephoned him after 24 May, he had been told that Sports Soccer would not be selling the England shirt at all (after its current stocks had been exhausted) rather than (as he did say) that Sports Soccer would be selling at High Street prices.  Accordingly it seems to us that, when Mr Whelan and others at JJB told Umbro to “do something” about Sports Soccer’s discounting of England shirts, meaning that they should see that the discounting stopped, they must be taken to have foreseen and intended that Umbro would at least try to get Sports Soccer to raise its prices, rather than that Umbro would do anything else to resolve the problem.</p>

If that case is made good on the facts as found, then it seems to us that JJB should not be absolved from responsibility by saying that it was for Umbro to choose what to do, and that JJB had no responsibility for it, and could not be regarded as willing the result, so as to be dissociated from any agreement or concerted practice between Umbro and Sports Soccer.</p>

They were not the sole reason but they were a significant factor.  It seems to us that the level and extent of the pressure described by the Tribunal in the relevant part of its judgment (the analysis is in paragraphs 414 to 429, following a long review of the relevant evidence from paragraph 400) was such that JJB plainly did expect Umbro to do something in response, vis-à-vis Sports Soccer.  At paragraph 416 the Tribunal referred to Mr Whelan’s evidence in terms summarised at paragraph [51] above, and in the following paragraph they made the comment also quoted in paragraph [51].  Mr Ronnie gave evidence (see paragraph 418) that Mr Whelan or Mr Sharpe used words to the effect of “this is getting out of hand, get it sorted”.  Mr Fellone of Umbro said (see paragraph 419) that Mr Sharpe or Mr Russell of JJB would ring him, identify discounting retailers and “ask us to do something about it”.  The Tribunal did not accept the evidence of Mr Russell of JJB that he was only concerned to get better terms for JJB: see paragraph 421 quoted above.  From that passage it is clear that the Tribunal believed that Mr Russell realised that Umbro might very well respond by finding ways to curtail Sports Soccer’s discounting and that a limit, or threatened limit, of supplies was one option that might be used.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In paragraph 422 (also quoted above, at paragraph [54]) the Tribunal referred to what Mr Whelan would have realised.  Towards the end of that paragraph it said that JJB was making complaints and using its bargaining power “with a view to affecting the discounting practices of a competitor”, that is to say, in order to see that Umbro did something to prevent Sports Soccer from discounting, or persuade it not to discount.  In the middle of the paragraph the Tribunal said that leading Umbro to consider ways of limiting discounting by Sports Soccer was “one of the principal purposes, or at least the reasonably foreseeable effect” of the conversations in which JJB complained about Sports Soccer’s discounting.  That is reflected later in paragraph 596: “Those complaints were intended, or had the reasonably foreseeable effect, of putting commercial pressure on Umbro to do something about discounting”.  Given the terms of the complaints and the strength of Mr Whelan’s views, not to mention his evident commercial acumen and experience, we do not understand the basis for the Tribunal’s apparent hesitation in concluding, in these paragraphs, that the complaints were intended to have the result of forcing Umbro to tackle the question of Sports Soccer’s discounting.  It is another question whether JJB did expect or should have expected that Umbro would threaten to limit Sports Soccer’s supplies in order to persuade Sports Soccer to agree to raise its prices.  But all the evidence reviewed in the passage from paragraph 400 onwards about the pressure which JJB did bring to bear on Umbro seems to us to lead to the conclusion that it was intended to make Umbro face up to the issue of Sports Soccer’s discounting, rather than that this was no more than a reasonably foreseeable consequence which, subjectively, those who voiced the complaints on behalf of JJB may not in fact have foreseen.  Nothing that the Tribunal said about Mr Whelan suggests that he is someone who would not realise the reasonably foreseeable consequences of something said by him in this sort of commercial context.  Accordingly it seems to us that the pressure applied by JJB to Umbro should be seen, as the Tribunal described it later in paragraph 422, as imposed “with a view to affecting the discounting activities of a competitor”.  For reasons set out above, it also seems to us that JJB cannot escape responsibility by saying that, for all it knew, Umbro might satisfy its demand in a lawful way.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">That being so, we do not need to decide, in the context of the Football Shirts appeal, whether Mr Lasok’s criticism of paragraph 659 of the Tribunal’s judgment, referred to at paragraph [32] above, is justified.  But it does seem to us that the Tribunal may have gone too far, in that paragraph, insofar as it suggests that if one retailer (A) privately discloses to a supplier (B) its future pricing intentions “in circumstances where it is reasonably foreseeable that B might make use of that information to influence market conditions” and B then passes that pricing information on to a competing retailer (C) then A, B and C are all to be regarded as parties to a concerted practice having as its object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition.  The Tribunal may have gone too far if it intended that suggestion to extend to cases in which A did not, in fact, foresee that B would make use of the pricing information to influence market conditions or in which C did not, in fact, appreciate that the information was being passed to him with A’s concurrence.  This is not such a case on the facts.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus, the starting point for an analysis of the communications between Mr Ronnie and Mr Sharpe is not that Mr Ronnie, unprompted, called Mr Sharpe to ask about JJB’s pricing intentions as regards England replica kit during Euro 2000.  Rather the starting point is that JJB had been badgering Umbro for some time to do something about the fact that Sports Soccer was already selling England replica kit at a discount, and that a crucial selling period was approaching during which it would be particularly important for JJB that it should not have to face or engage in a price war, such as it had been engaged in with Sports Soccer for some 6 months until April 2000, and that JJB’s commercial strength as against Umbro was such that Umbro had to try to do something to satisfy JJB’s concerns.  Furthermore, Mr Ronnie knew, from speaking to Mr Ashley of Sports Soccer, that if he was to have any chance of persuading Sports Soccer to agree to raise its prices, he would have to be able to assure Mr Ashley that other retailers, including JJB, would not discount themselves.  That was the context in which Mr Ronnie spoke to Mr Sharpe and was told that JJB would not discount.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At that time JJB was selling the England shirt at the High Street price, and had made it clear to Umbro that it wanted to be able to go on doing so.  Sports Soccer, on the other hand, was selling at a discount.  There had been a price war between JJB and Sports Soccer although it had come to an end in April when JJB stopped discounting as a general policy as against Sports Soccer.  JJB’s detailed pricing policy, certainly as regards the launch of a new product, was confidential and was decided only a few days in advance (see paragraph 628), so that other parties could not safely assume that they knew what JJB would do in terms of pricing.</p>

Mr Lasok submitted that there was no finding, and no basis for a finding, that Mr Sharpe knew that this information would go any further than Umbro, and certainly not that it would be passed to Sports Soccer.  We disagree.  It seems to us that it must have been apparent to Mr Sharpe, even if there was no express reference to Sports Soccer, that Mr Ronnie wanted the information in the context of taking steps to guard against discounting.  Mr Sharpe was among those who had spoke to Umbro staff about the Sports Soccer discounting policy.  It would be extraordinary to suppose that, when Mr Ronnie asked him about JJB’s own attitude to pricing England replica kit during Euro 2000, it did not occur to Mr Sharpe that this was connected with the question of discounting by Sports Soccer and attempts to prevent it occurring, which Mr Sharpe and others at JJB had been asking for over some time past.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:0.50in">“In the present case there is no evidence that JJB disclosed its future pricing intentions to Umbro for some legitimate purpose.”</p>

On the face of that sentence alone, that criticism could be justified. However, in the context of the other material which was before the Tribunal, the matter is to be seen quite differently.  There was ample evidence, especially from the pressure brought to bear by JJB on Umbro, that the purpose of the disclosure was anti-competitive.  Absent any basis for a suggestion that there was some different and legitimate purpose to the disclosure, the OFT’s burden of proof had been discharged.  The Tribunal’s reference is therefore to the absence of any such material.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second stage in the process was Mr Ronnie’s call to Mr Ashley, to persuade him that he should raise Sports Soccer’s prices for the England shirt.  It is evident that Mr Ashley was very reluctant to do so.  It required pressure from Umbro by way of veiled or not so veiled threats as regards supplies.  It also required an assurance that other retailers would not be discounting the shirts.  Mr Ronnie gave him that assurance.  He did not mention any retailer by name, but because JJB was so dominant in the field, any assurance as to retailers must have been taken, and intended to be taken, as including JJB.  Mr Ashley agreed to raise Sports Soccer’s prices on that basis, conditionally on the others also raising or maintaining their prices to or at the same level.  It seems to us that, in turn, he must have recognised that others concerned would be told of his agreement.  He knew, from what Mr Ronnie told him about other retailers, that Umbro had been in touch with the other retailers about their pricing intentions, and that these had been passed on to him.  He must have realised that what he told Mr Ronnie about Sports Soccer’s intentions would, correspondingly, be passed back to the others, including, necessarily, JJB.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Then at the third stage, Mr Ronnie telephoned Mr Sharpe again and told him that Sports Soccer had agreed to raise their prices and to sell at High Street prices.  He did so in order to make it known to JJB that Umbro had, as asked, “done something” about Sports Soccer’s discounting, by securing an agreement that it would come to an end as regards this product.  He also needed to make sure that JJB knew of this because of Mr Sharpe having mentioned that JJB might discount if others did, so that JJB should be aware that, at any rate if Sports Soccer kept to their agreement, JJB would not need to discount.  Because Sports Soccer was still selling at a discount at that time, JJB could not be sure what Sports Soccer’s intentions were unless informed of them by Umbro.  But for being told that Sports Soccer had agreed to raise its prices, it might not have been willing to wait until 3 June to see whether Sports Soccer did in fact come into line.  There may therefore have been a risk that, if the information as to Sports Soccer’s intentions was not passed on to JJB, the latter would respond to Sports Soccer’s still discounted price by discounting itself, which would certainly have led to Sports Soccer not raising its prices.  It does not seem to us that, in this context, Mr Sharpe could have been surprised to receive this telephone call.  Mr Lasok in his written material described the call as coming “out of the blue”.  We do not think that can be right.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Lasok submitted that, when Mr Sharpe told Mr Ronnie of JJB’s pricing intentions at the first stage, he was doing nothing which could be regarded as anti-competitive, and he referred to the second sentence of paragraph 49 of the Commission’s decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Hasselblad</span>, quoted above.  It does not seem to us that this is correct.  It is one thing for a manufacturer to ask its distributors, as a matter of routine, to inform it of the prices at which and the terms on which they sell its products, which it may wish or need to be aware of for its own commercial purposes and in the context of the ongoing relationship with each distributor separately.  It is quite another (as it was found to be in the <span style="font-style:italic">Hasselblad</span> case itself) where the information is obtained in order to be shared with other customers of the same manufacturer.  It is all the more another thing if the information is given to the manufacturer in the context of pressure by the party supplying the information, brought to bear on the manufacturer, in order to get another customer into line as regards prices, expecting that the information may be used by the manufacturer in relation to the other customer to persuade it to raise its prices.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Another submission by Mr Lasok on this point was that Mr Ronnie’s call to Mr Sharpe did not affect JJB’s conduct on the market, because JJB was already selling at High Street prices, and this did not change.  That ignores the fact that, if Sports Soccer had not raised its prices, JJB might itself have discounted.  On being told by Mr Ronnie of Sports Soccer’s agreement, JJB knew that, assuming that Sports Soccer complied with their agreement and that no other major retailer broke ranks and discounted, JJB would be able to maintain its prices at their current level.  A decision not to discount, in such circumstances, is just as much conduct on the market as a decision to discount would be.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Putting his same point in different terms, Mr Lasok borrowed from the words of the ECJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Bayer</span> (see paragraph [26] above) and submitted that Mr Ronnie did not, by his call back to Mr Sharpe, “invite” JJB to fulfil an anti-competitive goal jointly with Umbro and Sports Soccer.  We disagree, though we can see that this is not the language that the parties would have used at the time.  The context was that JJB had started the process by issuing what could, in a sense, be called an “invitation” to Umbro, by way of its pressure to do something about Sports Soccer’s discounting.  That invitation involved bringing Sports Soccer in as well, in order to achieve the anti-competitive aim of stabilising prices at the High Street price level and avoiding a price-cutting war.  In that context, when Mr Ronnie spoke again to Mr Sharpe, it was not only to tell him that Sports Soccer had agreed, but also to make sure that JJB was aware that Sports Soccer would be raising its prices, and JJB need not consider discounting on its own part.  Of course, it was known that JJB wanted prices raised and it was therefore easy to see that JJB would accede to Mr Ronnie’s “invitation” to maintain JJB’s prices.  If it seems unnatural to speak, in these circumstances, of Umbro inviting JJB to fulfil an anti-competitive goal jointly with Umbro and Sports Soccer, the main reason is that JJB had taken the original initiative towards the anti-competitive arrangement, by putting pressure on Umbro in the first place.  Umbro would not have regarded JJB’s pressure on it as an “invitation”, but in terms of the language of the ECJ, it could be regarded as such.  </p>

Each of JJB and Sports Soccer knew that it was giving Umbro an intimation of its intended pricing.  He submitted that the use of the word meant no more than that.  But that cannot be right.  It is not a case of an unconscious disclosure of pricing intentions, for example by someone talking in his sleep.  It seems to us plain that “knowingly” must, in context, refer to the knowledge of JJB and Sports Soccer respectively that their pricing intentions would be passed on by Umbro to the other.

Whatever may be meant by those words, we disagree with Mr Lasok’s submission.  It seems to us that the facts as found do plainly justify a finding of a trilateral concerted practice.  We also consider that, even if that were wrong, so that there were two separate agreements or concerted practices between JJB and Umbro, on the one hand, and Umbro and Sports Soccer, on the other, the respective parties’ knowledge of what was going on as regards the other agreement or concerted practice, and the interdependent relationship between the two, would mean that each of the vertical concerted practices was capable of being regarded as being as serious a breach as if there had been a trilateral concerted practice with horizontal operation, and certainly far more serious than two unrelated vertical concerted practices, the customer party in each case being unaware of the fact or circumstances of the other.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Lasok submitted that the Tribunal’s decision in the Football Shirts case has caused uncertainty in commercial circles, casting doubt on freedom of discussion on a vertical basis, above all between manufacturers and their principal customers, in relation to matters which both parties need reasonably to be able to discuss, including actual or likely retail prices, profit margins and wholesale prices or terms of sale.  It seems to us that the present decision, and that of the Tribunal, ought not to be seen as casting any cloud of illegality over such discussions, so long as they are conducted on a bilateral basis and limited to discussions of the nature described.  As the Tribunal said, there is a risk that discussions about possible prices, or about historic prices, can tend towards discussion of future prices, and agreement as to what they should be.  Any party to such discussions on a vertical basis needs to be aware of that risk and to avoid it.  But this case is not about such discussions at all.  Nor does it outlaw complaints by a wholesale customer to its supplier in general, especially if they are directed at getting better terms for the business between those two parties.  In the present case the complaints did not have that aim, and the discussions between manufacturer and customer had a strong and unusual context which makes it clear that there was a horizontal element in the subject of discussion.  That is what makes what happened in the present case a breach of the Chapter I prohibition.  In our judgment the Tribunal was right to hold that there had been such a breach consisting of a trilateral concerted practice involving JJB, Umbro and Sports Soccer.

Nevertheless, in the circumstances that the Tribunal’s conclusion that a trilateral concerted practice had been established is based on its view that the two vertical bilateral agreements were intended to operate “in parallel” – in the sense that each was made with the intent that the other should be observed – it is necessary to have regard, also, to section XII (Summary of Findings as to a bilateral agreement or concerted practice between Hasbro and Littlewoods).</p>

Prices for the products to be listed in the catalogues need to be established at a relatively early stage in advance of publication.  Prices for the autumn/winter catalogue (published in late July) will be fixed in May: prices for the spring/summer catalogue (published in January) will be fixed in November.  Once set, the prices in the catalogue are essentially fixed during the season for which the relevant catalogue is current, though it may be possible to publicise special offers or price variations by supplementary leaflets.  Catalogue retailers must go to the market with prices which are as keen as possible; all the more so, if their business is based upon discounting from suppliers’ recommended retail prices (RRPs).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In 1998 retailers were thought by Hasbro management to be unhappy with the margins they were receiving on Hasbro’s branded products.  Hasbro responded to this situation by approaching Argos and Littlewoods to seek their adherence to two marketing initiatives: described as a “pricing initiative” and a “listing initiative”.  The pricing initiative sought to maintain retail margins on Hasbro’s toys and games by persuading retailers to retail Hasbro products at Hasbro’s RRPs.   The initiative was initially limited to the Core Games and Action Man ranges.  These were the products in respect of which price-cutting had been most intense.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Hasbro regarded the participation of Argos and Littlewoods as necessary for the success of its pricing initiative.  Argos was generally accepted as the price-setter.  But Argos would have been unlikely to make any commitment to follow Hasbro’s RRPs unless it were reassured that, in doing so, its catalogue prices would not be undercut by those in the Littlewoods catalogue.  It was therefore necessary for the success of the pricing initiative for Hasbro to be in a position to reassure Argos that Littlewoods would also be committed to follow the same prices.  It was with that in mind that, towards the end of 1998 and at the beginning of 1999, discussions took place between Hasbro’s sales team and the relevant buyers for Argos; and discussions took place between Hasbro’s sales team and the relevant buyers for Littlewoods.  There was no evidence of direct contact between Argos and Littlewoods.  But there was, thereafter, an assimilation of the prices in the Argos’ catalogues and the Littlewoods’ catalogues for the products subject to the pricing initiative – Core Games and Action Man.  That price similarity could be seen in the spring/summer 1999 catalogues; it was apparent in the autumn/winter 1999 and the spring/summer 2000 catalogues; and it was continued (and extended to other product lines) in the autumn/winter 2000 and spring/summer 2001 catalogues.  </p>

On the basis of detailed witness statements from three of those Hasbro employees – Mr Bottomley, Mr Wilson and Mr Thomson - and contemporary documents, the OFT found that Hasbro’s pricing initiative had led directly to an overall infringing agreement or concerted practice between Hasbro, Argos and Littlewoods.  In particular, the OFT were satisfied that the discussions had led to bilateral agreements or concerted practices between Hasbro and Argos, on the one hand,  and between Hasbro and Littlewoods, on the other hand which were contingent on each other and which formed part of a pattern of continuous conduct with a common objective.  The parallel bilateral agreements or concerted practices, thus linked, were to be read together as one agreement or concerted practice between the three companies. </p>

This was because they were the largest catalogue retailers, directly competing with each other, and because their retailing formats meant that they both had to commit themselves to a price for a forthcoming season without knowledge of the other’s intention except for the previous catalogue which was, by definition, out of date.  Further, unlike with ordinary retailers where an agreement to price at X could be given public effect on the next day or within a very short space of time, any “agreement” or “understanding” that the other catalogue retailer would price at an agreed price (say RRP) would not be seen to be implemented until much later when it would be too late to change one’s own catalogue.”</p>

That description was not challenged in cross-examination.  In our judgment, ‘gentleman’s agreement’ is an appropriate expression to convey what the evidence shows.  Argos told Hasbro what its pricing intentions were, namely that it was intending to price at RRPs in the next catalogue.  Those pricing intentions are highly confidential.  Argos may not have communicated its intentions product by product, by going through a list, but there was no doubt that the stated intention applied to Action Man and Core Games.  It is true that there was no certainty, and no guarantee that Argos would price at RRPs, and certainly no legally enforceable agreement.  There may also from time to time have been some exceptions where Argos did not price at the price it had previously indicated.  However, it seems to us implicit in the arrangements as described, unchallenged, by Mr. Wilson, that Hasbro had aroused in Argos an expectation that it would not be undercut if it sold at RRPs, and that Argos had indicated to Hasbro that it would go out at Hasbro’s RRPs on the products in question in the next relevant catalogue.  In our judgment, the above evidence establishes that there was an express or implied agreement, albeit verbal and with no guarantee, that Argos would sell at Hasbro’s RRPs, at least to a material extent, on Action Man and Core Games in the A/ W 1999 and S/ S 2000 catalogues.”</p>

There was ‘verbal agreement to say, yes, we will go along with you, we will go out at those prices’ (Day 1, pp. 145-146), ‘there was agreement to do it’, although no guarantee that the agreement would be adhered to (p. 176).  Mr. Burgess would say to Mr. Thomson words to the effect ‘Ian, I will go along with you, but are you sure this is going to happen?’ and Mr. Thomson would say words to the effect ‘Yes, trust me, I will go back and talk to people to ensure that this happens’.”</p>

Again, there was no guarantee that Littlewoods would do so, and no certainty, and there may have been occasional exceptions although few, if any, have been identified in the evidence.  It also seems to us on the evidence that Hasbro had aroused in Littlewoods an expectation that Littlewoods would not be undercut by Argos if they priced at RRPs, and Littlewoods had indicated to Hasbro that it was willing to sell at Hasbro’s RRPs in the next relevant catalogue.  On the above evidence, it seems to us to be established that there was an express or implied agreement, albeit verbal and with no guarantee, that Littlewoods would sell at Hasbro’s RRPs, at least to a material extent on Action Man and Core Games in the A/ W 1999 and S/ S 2000 catalogues.”</p>

There was no absolute certainty that Argos and Littlewoods would do this and there was no sanction against a ‘defaulter’.  However, the obvious advantages that flowed from higher margins and the absence of a threat of undercutting by rivals were sufficient incentives to ensure that retailers stuck with the initiative.  Also, the consumer benefited from lower prices for games as a result of lower cost prices. … The listing and pricing initiatives came about as a result of low margins that were a concern across the entire industry and shared by Argos and Littlewoods.  Argos was sympathetic to both initiatives and was actively involved in discussions on pricing.  Littlewoods followed Argos’s lead, but was also involved in discussions with Hasbro about pricing in the manner I described above.’  (Bottomley, 47-48).</p>

The Tribunal accepted that the agreement – which was informal, legally unenforceable and never reduced to writing - did not result in any guarantee that Argos would follow Hasbro’s RRPs; and that there were cases in which it did not do so.  The evidence upon which that conclusion is based is then set out, in summary but at some length, at paragraphs 673 to 699.  The summary of evidence reflects the findings of fact made by the Tribunal in section X of its judgment.  It is not, we think, necessary to rehearse that evidence in this judgment.

The principle is that each ‘economic operator must determine independently the policy which it intends to adopt’ on the market.  That principle precludes ‘direct or indirect contact’ between economic operators, ‘the object or effect whereof is either to influence the conduct on the market of an actual or potential competitor or to disclose to such a competitor the course of conduct which they themselves have decided to adopt or contemplate adopting on the market’.  A key concept in the idea of a concerted practice is that of ‘removing in advance any uncertainty as to the future conduct of … competitors’, as a result of ‘reciprocal contacts’ having that object or effect.</p>

In the present case Argos disclosed its pricing intentions to its supplier, Hasbro.  Those pricing intentions are highly confidential matters which would not in normal circumstances be disclosed in advance.  Argos was told by Mr. Wilson what Hasbro expected retail prices to be, based on Hasbro’s conversations with other retailers.  Argos must have known or could reasonably have foreseen that its discussion with Hasbro reflected Hasbro’s discussions with other retailers.  In our view such conduct was a ‘form of practical coordination’ which knowingly substituted practical cooperation for the risks of competition.  In particular, those reciprocal contacts reduced uncertainty on Argos’ part as to what other retailers’ pricing intentions were, and reduced uncertainty on Hasbro’s part on what Argos’ prices would be.  That, in turn, facilitated Hasbro’s conversations with other retailers especially Littlewoods, with a view to ensuring that they too priced at RRPs.</p>

It observed that “In those circumstances it does not seem to us to make much difference whether the correct analysis is that there was, in addition, a tripartite agreement or concerted practice having the same object or effect”; but that “In our judgment, this aspect of the case is most conveniently analysed in the light of the case law on concerted practices”. </p>

Thus the evidence shows, for example (i) Mr. McCulloch told Mr. McMahon at the Liverpool meeting of his discussions with Argos, to the effect that Argos was prepared to go to RRPs on Action Man and Core Games if it was reassured about not being undercut.  (ii) Mr. Thomson subsequently went back to Mr. Burgess and informed him that a deal had been struck whereby Argos agreed to raise its prices to RRPs.  (iii) In his discussions with Mr. Burgess during 1999, Mr. Thomson frequently reassured the latter that Argos was proposing to price at Hasbro’s RRPs, and that Littlewoods would not be undercut if it did the same.  (iv) Mr. Cowley’s conversation with Mr. McMahon in late 1999 indicates that the latter was still aware of his conversations with Mr. McCulloch about Argos’ pricing intentions and took those conversations into account in saying to Mr. Cowley that he should price the Tweenies doll at Hasbro’s RRP.  (v) Similar discussions took place between Mr. Thomson and Mr. Burgess in relation to the S/S 2000 catalogue.  (vi) Littlewoods through Mr. Burgess in his conversations with Mr. Thomson informed the latter of Littlewoods’ intention to price at RRPs.  (vii) Mr. Burgess at all material times knew, because Mr. [Thomson] told him, that parallel discussions were going on with Argos, and that Mr. Thomson was passing back to Mr. Wilson the gist of his conversations with Mr. Burgess.  (viii) Littlewoods priced at or near RRPs on Action Man and Core Games for the A/W 1999 and S/S 2000 catalogues, and in our judgment cannot have failed to take the foregoing into account in  reaching its pricing decisions (see also Case T1/89 <span style="font-style:italic">Rhone Poulenc v Commission</span> [1991] ECR II- 867, paragraphs 122 and 123).</p>

In our view such a concerted practice constituted <span style="font-style:italic">indirect</span> contact between economic operators (Argos and Littlewoods) the object and effect of which was either to influence future conduct on the market, or to disclose future pricing intentions, within the principles of <span style="font-style:italic">Suiker</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Unie </span>and other cases cited above.</p>

The evidence shows that Mr. Thomson had extensive discussions with Mr. Burgess and the other Littlewoods buyers on extending the pricing arrangement to other products.  Littlewoods was then expressly informed, in the email of 18 May 2000, of ‘the prices that Argos has committed to’ in respect of a list of further products.  That email also shows Littlewoods being expressly informed that the prices of Action Man and Core Games will be ‘adhered to’ which in the context can only mean that Argos intended to continue to price at RRPs on those products.  Again, that in our judgment amounts to indirect contact between economic operators, the object or effect of which was to influence conduct on the market or reveal future pricing intentions.  In fact Littlewoods priced at RRPs on the products in question.  The contacts over Interactive Pikachu about 25 May 2000 are further evidence of that concerted practice.  </p>

In the course of these conversations Argos was informed of Hasbro’s retail pricing strategy to the effect that Hasbro was making a coordinated effort to persuade all retailers to price at RRPs on Action Man and Core Games.  At some point Sue Porritt informed Hasbro (Mr. McCulloch or Mr. Brighty) that Argos was in principle prepared to price at RRPs on Action Man and Core Games, which information was passed within Hasbro to Mr. Thomson, who duly passed the information on to Mr. Burgess at Littlewoods.</p>

We also assume that there was not necessarily a detailed discussion between Mr. Needham and Mr. Wilson about the specific prices of approximately 30 products in the Action Man and Core Games ranges.  Nonetheless, the upshot of the conversations was that Mr. Wilson knew that it was Argos’ intention to price at RRPs on these products, and Argos knew that other retailers were likely to be at RRPs. </p>

Since Argos was receiving from Mr. Wilson information which Argos knew was based on information Hasbro had received from other retailers, Argos must have known that Hasbro would have been engaged in similar conversations with other retailers, based on the information which Hasbro had received from Argos.  In these circumstances it seems to us that Argos also participated in <span style="font-style:italic">indirect</span> contacts with other economic operators the object or effect of which was to influence conduct in the market or to disclose future pricing intentions.  The element of reciprocity is to be found notably in the fact that Argos was conveying its future pricing intentions and Mr. Wilson was conveying back to Argos information about other [retailers’] pricing intentions.</p>

Argos through Mr. Needham must have known that Hasbro’s conversation with other retailers would have included Littlewoods, and could have reasonably foreseen that, when Mr. Wilson indicated other retailers’ pricing intentions, that information must have been based in particular on information coming from Littlewoods.  In our judgment undercutting by Littlewoods, the principal rival catalogue retailer, would have been of considerable concern to Mr. Needham (see e.g. Wilson, paragraph 30).  </p>

In disclosing its expected pricing intentions on the products mentioned in the emails of 18 May 2000, and confirming, expressly or by implication, its adherence to RRPs on Action Man and Core Games, Argos in our judgment at the least supported Hasbro’s efforts to ensure that other retailers, and in particular Littlewoods, observed RRPs and did not engage in undercutting.  The contents of the emails of 18 May 2000, discussed at length above, fully confirm that conclusion.  That conclusion also applies to the other incidents involving the Interactive Pikachu and the Ferris Wheel.</p>

The object or effect of that concerted practice was to prevent, restrict or distort competition, within the meaning of the Chapter I prohibition.

Littlewoods had appeared to advance a similar (two-part) challenge in its appellant’s notice; but, as its case was developed in written and oral argument, it was accepted that a challenge to the conclusion that it had been party to a bilateral agreement could not be sustained.  As it was put in Littlewood’s revised skeleton argument: “Littlewoods disagrees with the CAT’s finding of a bilateral agreement between itself and Hasbro but recognises that the Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction to interfere with the findings of fact made by the CAT”. </p>

It is said that, in law, there is a distinction between a price fixing agreement and a price information exchange; that the evidence as found by the Tribunal did not support a finding of price fixing; and that the evidence was capable only of supporting (but did not support) a price information exchange.  And, it is said (on behalf of Littlewoods) that the Tribunal was wrong, on the evidence, to characterise the bilateral agreement between Hasbro and Littlewoods as a price fixing agreement when “at its highest, the evidence could only in law support a finding of a price information exchange”.  </p>

But the challenge was not abandoned.  Given that an appeal to this Court from a finding of liability made by the Tribunal lies only on a point of law, we are satisfied that the challenge cannot be sustained.  The Tribunal set out, at length, the evidence on which it made the findings of fact that it did.  We have referred to that evidence earlier in this judgment: it is unnecessary to rehearse it again.  It is enough to say that the evidence is detailed, specific and was (as the Tribunal found) largely unchallenged.  The Tribunal was entitled to accept that evidence; and, having accepted that evidence, the Tribunal was entitled to reach the conclusion that it did. </p>

On the findings of fact made by the Tribunal, the assurances given by Argos to Hasbro went beyond the exchange of price information.  The submission overlooks, as it seems to us, the finding at paragraph 516 of the Tribunal’s judgment that, although “It is true that there was no certainty, and no guarantee that Argos would price at RRPs, and certainly no legally enforceable agreement”, it was implicit, in the arrangements as described, unchallenged, by Mr. Wilson, that “Hasbro had aroused in Argos an expectation that it would not be undercut if it sold at RRPs, and that Argos had indicated to Hasbro that it would go out at Hasbro’s RRPs on the products in question in the next relevant catalogue”.

In cases such as the present where there is no direct contact between two undertakings (viz Littlewoods and Argos), it is particularly important to analyse the evidence carefully in order to establish whether . . . the subjective consensus requirement has been met.  The CAT failed to do this and did not make any sufficient findings of fact on this point.  The judgment is therefore defective as a matter of law as it did not deal with the essential element of the infringement i.e. the subjective consensus between the parties.”</p>

Mr Needham “must have known” that his conversations with Mr Wilson were taking place in a context where Hasbro was talking to Argos and its principal competitors “with a view to achieving a situation in which Argos, Littlewoods and other retailers were all pricing at Hasbro’s RRPs” – paragraph 512(viii).

The appeals also raise a number of points on the application of that Guidance by the OFT and, insofar as it did apply it, by the Tribunal; one of these points, about the “relevant product market”, is common to all the appeals.  Another point, about non-discrimination, is raised in all the appeals, but it is more important in the Toys and Games appeal.  We will start by setting out the relevant parts of the Guidance issued under section 38, and dealing with the point of principle as to the relevance of the Guidance, and then refer to the position on the other general points, before dealing with the facts of the penalty appeals in turn.</p>

The “relevant turnover” is the turnover of the undertaking in the relevant product market and relevant geographical market<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">7</span> affected by the infringement in the last financial year.

The more serious the infringement, the higher the percentage rate is likely to be.  Price-fixing or market-sharing agreements and other cartel activities are among the most serious infringements caught under the Chapter I prohibition.  Conduct which infringes the Chapter II prohibition and which by virtue of the undertaking’s dominant position and the nature of the conduct has, or is likely to have, a particularly serious effect on competition, for example, predatory pricing, is also one of the most serious infringements under the Act.  The starting point for such activities and conduct will be calculated by applying a percentage likely to be at or near 10% of the “relevant turnover” of the infringing undertakings.</p>

The policy objectives of the Act will not be achieved unless this Tribunal is prepared to uphold severe penalties for serious infringements.  As the Guidance makes clear, the achievement of the necessary deterrent may well involve penalties above, often well above, 10 per cent of turnover in the products directly concerned by the infringement, subject only to the overall ‘cap’ imposed by the Maximum Penalties Order.  The position in this respect is no different in principle under Article 15(2) of Council Regulation no. 17, albeit that the applicable maximum penalty under that provision is differently calculated.”</p>

The OFT rejected that contention, and the Tribunal upheld that position.  For the OFT it was submitted to us that it cannot be a necessary requirement to undertake such an analysis in a Chapter I case, because to do so is unnecessary for any other purpose, and it could be a very expensive and time-consuming exercise, depending on economic expertise as applied to detailed statistical facts as to what may be relevant sales.  In particular it could not be necessary for such an analysis to be undertaken at the stage of an appeal on penalty to the Tribunal, if there is any difference between the facts as to liability found by the Tribunal and those on which the OFT proceeded.  The Tribunal could not conduct the analysis itself, and to require it to be carried out on a contested basis before the Tribunal would make the penalty hearing very much longer and more expensive.</p>

It said at paragraph 112 that the OFT had to have a reasonable basis for identifying the particular market which it took as the relevant product market for this purpose.  It pointed out that the market which has to be considered is the relevant product market “affected by the infringement”, and that the link between the infringement and its effect on the market concerned may be rather arbitrary, because of the mismatch of dates in a short-term infringement resulting from the use of the last financial year’s figures: paragraphs 113 and 114.  Following from this, it said at paragraph 115 that the calculation of the turnover for the relevant product market might include elements which were arbitrary, so long as the overall penalty was appropriate to the infringement in question.  It also said that the OFT could properly take account of turnover not only in products directly affected by the infringement, but also that in neighbouring products which may reasonably be considered to have been affected by the infringement: paragraph 116.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Lasok submitted that, as elsewhere, when using the words “technically speaking”, the Tribunal meant “on a correct legal analysis” (see paragraph [105] above), and he submitted that it is not legitimate to bring such related or neighbouring markets into account under step 1 of the Guidance.  We will come to that point on the facts in due course.  He also submitted that to bring into account as part of the relevant product market in this context something which is properly to be regarded as a distinct but related or neighbouring market was to apply paragraph 2.8 of the Guidance, which is relevant at step 3, but to do so in the wrong context.  We agree that paragraph 2.8 does show that a neighbouring market in which the infringing undertaking makes consequential profits may be relevant to be brought into account at step 3, in deciding on the relevant multiplier.  The OFT will be aware of this in making its calculations.  It is appropriate that the OFT should be clear as to the basis on which it considers, at step 1, turnover in products which could be said to form part of such a related market, and to be sure that, if paragraph 2.8 is invoked, there is no element of double-counting.  It does not seem to us, however, that this passage shows that “relevant product market” needs to be applied as a term of art in relation to penalty in a Chapter I case, on the basis suggested by Mr Lasok, or so as to exclude the approach actually adopted by the OFT and approved by the Tribunal in these cases.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As a matter of principle, we agree with what the Tribunal said about the correct approach for the OFT to the question of relevant product market, as summarised in paragraph [171] above.  There is inevitably an arbitrary element in the calculation, in the sense there described.  Inevitably also, in the absence of a formal market analysis, the market as ascertained may be other than that which would be established, in a Chapter II case, by the formal analysis which would have been carried out in such a case.  The purpose of the identification of the relevant product market in relation to penalty is quite different, and it is not necessary or appropriate to be so exact as when ascertaining a market for the purpose of seeing whether an undertaking has a dominant position in a relevant market, before deciding whether that position, if it exists, has been abused.  Thus, as it seems to us, the reason why it is not necessary, at any rate in a Chapter I case involving price-fixing, to conduct a formal market analysis is the same as the reason why the market which is taken for calculation of the turnover relevant for Step 1 on a penalty assessment may properly be assessed on a broad view of the particular trade which has been affected by the proved infringement, rather than by a relatively exact application of principles that would be relevant for a formal analysis, such as substitutability or, on the other hand, by limiting the turnover in question to sales of the very products or services which were the direct subject of the price-fixing arrangement or other anti-competitive practice.  </p>

The abovementioned unequal treatment does not relate to the proportionally over-severe fine imposed on the Japanese producers, the method of calculation adopted by the Commission in setting their fines having been held to be perfectly lawful in itself (see paragraphs 531 to 558 above), but, on the contrary, relates to the fact that the gravity of the offending conduct of the European producers, appraised as a whole, was under-evaluated by comparison with the unlawful conduct of the Japanese producers. </p>

The England Direct Agreements went wider than this and extended to other FA Licensed Merchandise.  In each case, sales of Replica Shirts are the most important item of Replica Kit and drive sales of replica shorts and socks.  Therefore, whilst a Replica Kit is comprised of several products (adult and junior shirt, shorts, socks and infant kits) which are sold separately and whilst a fan who wants to wear a pair of shorts cannot substitute this for a Replica Shirt, this does not necessarily mean that each kind of product is a distinct relevant product market.  A Replica Kit is designed and marketed at launch as a single product and with the same purpose of showing visible support for a particular club or team by distinguishing itself from the Replica Kits of other clubs or teams.  The home, away, third and goalkeeper’s Replica Kits have the same characteristics, prices and intended use as each other.</p>

It is articulated on a reasonable and properly reasoned basis.  It does not matter that the market is not the same as would have been relevant if a Chapter II infringement had had to be considered and a formal analysis made of the market for that purpose.

JJB submitted that its involvement in breaches of the Chapter I prohibition should be regarded as far removed from the most serious, persistent and long-term breaches, and that accordingly it is quite wrong that a figure as close to the top of the range (10%) as the OFT did choose should be taken as the starting point under step 1, all the more so since the OFT proceeded on a basis of liability which was partly discharged on appeal.</p>

JJB was not by any means the only promoter of arrangements in breach of the prohibition: the FA, MU, Umbro and Allsports all had their own reasons for disliking discounting and wanting to see it reduced.  Nevertheless JJB was a very important participant in the market, and it exercised its influence, for example in relation to Umbro, in ways which wholly disregarded the constraints of competition law.  It is also true that JJB was not a party to the non-statutory assurances given in 1999, but the OFT and the Tribunal (see paragraph 172 of the penalty judgment) rightly proceeded on the basis that JJB must have been aware that price-fixing was against the law.</p>

The participants in the market needed to, and did, respond to a situation such as this quickly and on a short term basis.  It does not seem to us that, in those circumstances, it is any mitigation at all for JJB to show that the agreements or concerted practices in question did not apply for a long time.  They applied for as long as they needed to apply, and they affected items of high retail customer demand, at the time of a peak in that demand.</p>

So far as the England Agreement is concerned, the reasons which we have given above for holding that JJB was party to a concerted practice in breach of the Chapter I prohibition in that respect show that JJB was using its influence in the market, and in particular in relation to Umbro, in order to achieve the unlawful purpose which it desired, and did so in a determined and assertive manner, by way of a vigorous campaign of complaints to Umbro about Sports Soccer’s discounting.  So far as the other two agreements are concerned, Mr Lasok submitted that JJB did very little at all, and almost became involved by accident.  He may well be right that JJB did not do a lot, but it did not have to.  In the case of the MU agreement, this took place at a “horizontal” meeting between competitors.  Very little needs to be said in such a context to give rise to an agreement or concerted practice, and this is particularly true of a participant in the market as important as JJB.</p>

We have also found, in the Liability Judgment, that there was a culture of resale price maintenance in the industry despite the 1999 assurances:  see paragraphs 369 to 372 of that Judgment.  In all those circumstances, we see nothing unreasonable in the OFT selecting a percentage of 9% as the percentage of relevant turnover to be applied as the starting point in this case of price fixing.

He accepted that a breach consisting of a horizontal agreement or concerted practice is more serious than one which is purely vertical, but suggested that, even so, the possible variety of horizontal breaches, in terms of scope, seriousness and otherwise, is such that it would be fair to regard the band of potentially appropriate percentages as ranging from, say, 6% up to 10%.  On that footing he suggested that JJB’s part in the three agreements or concerted practices in question should be rated as near the lower end of the band, so that a percentage of 6% or at most 7% would be appropriate, rather than 9% which should be reserved for something near to the most serious breaches.</p>

No conclusive information was provided on this during the hearing, not surprisingly because the point appears to have been raised for the first time by Mr Lasok in the course of his submissions.  In correspondence since the hearing, which has been copied to us, the OFT stated that it does not use bands, but approaches each case individually on its own facts and merits in accordance with the Guidance.  In those circumstances, Mr Lasok was left with the submission that 9% must be too high, and at any rate that the change in the basis of liability as a result of the partial success of the appeal to the Tribunal on liability shows that the percentage should be reduced from 9%.</p>

We note that the OFT adopted, and the Tribunal approved, 9% as the starting point for Allsports, against which only two infringements were alleged and proved (the England Agreement and the MU Agreement), and for MU, as regards which only one agreement was alleged and proved.  The Tribunal observed that, although it did not consider that JJB was a party to the Continuation Agreement as such, it was a party to the most serious individual exercise in price-fixing which was the subject of that agreement, namely the MU Centenary Agreement.  It also took the view that the England Direct agreement, which it found JJB was not a party to, was the least serious of the four agreements under consideration.  We can find no error in the Tribunal’s approach on this aspect of the process of reviewing the penalty for JJB.  It did reduce the penalty on JJB in order to reflect the partial success of the appeal on liability (see paragraph 200).</p>

The fact that Allsports sought to do the same, and that Umbro had its own reasons for doing so as well, does not mean that JJB was not an active party and entitled to be regarded by the Tribunal as an instigator.</p>

Otherwise, he said, the FA, which did give the non-statutory assurances in 1999 and nevertheless went on to flout them in 2000, would not be deterred from repeating such breaches of the Chapter I prohibition.</p>

Nevertheless, the circumstances of the FA are quite different from those of JJB and the other commercial undertakings which were involved in the various infringements found by the OFT to have occurred.  For this reason, and because of the need to consider the rule about equal treatment in relation to the penalties as imposed overall, rather than in relation to particular elements in the calculation, it does not seem to us that Mr Lasok is justified in criticising the OFT for the use of a different multiplier from that applied to JJB, nor the Tribunal for approving it.</p>

The Tribunal did express the view that the pressure brought to bear by JJB on Umbro was greater than the OFT had allowed for (paragraphs 197 and 203).  It took that factor into account in its overall consideration of the penalty, but not by applying any particular percentage or multiplier in the calculation (see paragraph 197).  What it did say, when conducting the cross-check by reference to the application of the Guidance, was that the OFT could have applied an uplift factor of 20% rather than 10% on the grounds of JJB’s pressure on Umbro, and therefore its role as an instigator of the infringement (see paragraph 203).  It also said, in the same context, that the OFT could have increased the penalty otherwise arrived at by 20% to take account of the fact that, though JJB was not a party to the Continuation Agreement, it was a party to the MU Centenary Agreement which, on that basis, was a separate and new agreement entered into in 2001 (see paragraphs 204-5).  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Lasok is entitled to say that a significant element in the Tribunal’s reasoning on penalty was the view that the evidence at the hearing before the Tribunal justified a view that JJB had put greater pressure on Umbro than the OFT had considered.  However, it seems to us that this view on the part of the Tribunal is well supported by a comparison of paragraphs 412 to 437 of the OFT decision with the Tribunal’s own treatment of the pressure brought to bear on Umbro by JJB at section XI of the judgment on liability.  The Tribunal was able to form a better view of the facts as a result of the process of oral evidence and cross-examination at the hearing, and it was therefore able to find that important features of the written evidence on behalf of JJB were inaccurate, in the light of answers in cross-examination.  The OFT may not have been able to (and certainly did not) reach such conclusions after its administrative investigation.  Mr Lasok compared some passages in each of the two documents, suggesting that there was little difference between the conclusions reached by each, and that, if anything, the OFT had thought that JJB had behaved worse, by using explicit threats.  It does not seem to us that these selected quotations can properly be taken on their own.  Having compared the respective passages in the OFT decision and the Tribunal’s liability judgment in which each dealt with the point at length, it seems to us that the Tribunal’s comment in the penalty judgment on this point is fully justified.</p>

JJB does not appeal against the finding that it was a party to this agreement.  It is a logical consequence of the success of the appeal in respect of the Continuation Agreement that the duration of the 2000 Agreements (taking the England Agreement and the MU Agreement together because of their closeness in time as well as subject-matter) was no more than a year, and a multiplier of 1.5 could not be applied, as the OFT had applied it.

The Tribunal could have taken the view that, however serious it was, it should be approached as an entirely separate infringement for penalty purposes, attracting a separate penalty, which might very well have produced a higher figure than adding 20% to the calculation arrived at otherwise in respect of the 2000 infringements, especially if an uplift were applied to that, as it legitimately could have been, for the fact that it was a repeated infringement.</p>

The first step is to calculate the starting point by applying a percentage, determined by the nature of the infringement, to the “relevant turnover” of the undertaking.  “Relevant turnover” in that context is the turnover in the relevant product market and the relevant geographic market in the last financial year – paragraph 2.3.</p>

In such a Chapter I case it was sufficient for the OFT to show that there was a reasonable basis for choosing to identify the relevant product market as it had.

As the Tribunal observed, the OFT’s approach had been to identify broad categories of toys and games, without investigating whether, within those categories, there were relevant sub-markets.  No challenge was made by Argos to the broad categories: but it was said that it could not be assumed that all the toys within each broad category necessarily constituted a relevant market in the sense required by the Guidance in a Chapter II case.

It held that it had been unnecessary, for the purpose of the calculation of the starting point in the present case, for the OFT to have broken down the broad categories into relevant sub-markets; whether by reference to a SSNIP test or otherwise.  To attempt to do so “would have been quite unrealistic and a massive waste of resources”.

But the extension of the infringing agreements to include the products listed in the e-mail of 18 May 2000 brought other categories - girls’ toys, infant and pre-school, creative, plush and hand-held electronic games - into the calculation.  The OFT had brought into account, in calculating the starting point in respect of each party, the whole of that party’s turnover in each category.  The Tribunal accepted that that was a reasonable approach in relation to boys’ toys, games and puzzles and plush.  But the Tribunal took a different view in relation to the girls’ toys, infant and pre-school, creative and hand-held electronic games sectors – for the reasons which it explained at paragraphs 202 to 206 of its penalty judgment.  It held that, insofar as the OFT had brought into account the whole of the turnover for the girls’ toys, infant and pre-school, creative and hand-held electronic games sectors, “the OFT’s approach is insufficiently supported by evidence or analysis”.  Nevertheless, “a proportion of that turnover should be included, since infringements relating to products in that sector did occur”.  </p>

It explained, at paragraph 207, that, in its original calculation, the OFT had not applied a multiplier for deterrence under step 3.  It observed that “If the turnover base used under Steps 1 and 2 were to be reduced, in our view the question whether the resulting penalty was sufficiently high to have the necessary deterrent effect would have to be re-examined.”  It illustrated that point, at paragraph 208, by a calculation based upon the allocation of what it described as “an arbitrary 5 per cent of turnover” to girls’ toys, infant and pre-school, creative and hand-held electronic games.  Without adjustment for deterrence the figures arising from that calculation would have led to the imposition of a penalty of £8.18 million on Argos and a penalty of £2.358 million on Littlewoods.  But the Tribunal took the view, as it said at paragraph 209, that “penalties of that order would not have a sufficient deterrent effect in the circumstances of this case, and would have called for an adjustment by the OFT under Step 3”.  Had the OFT  applied to those figures a multiplier of 2.5 under step 3 – which, as the Tribunal thought, would have been fully justified to ensure deterrence - the resulting figures of £20.45 million (Argos) and £5.90 million (Littlewoods) would have been very close to the step 3 figures at which the OFT did, in fact, arrive.</p>

Price competition on the products covered by the infringing agreements had been “effectively stifled for a period of some fourteen months throughout an important sector of the retail trade”.  In addition, there would have been an effect on competing products, especially where Hasbro had a strong market position.  Argos and Littlewoods were the two principal catalogue retailers.  They had built up their respective businesses largely on the basis of a reputation for being competitive on price.  But, on the facts found by the Tribunal, they had “engaged in agreements and concerted practices inimical to price competition in the toys and games in question, to the detriment of their customers.”  Substantial penalties were appropriate for the infringements in question.  There was a need for a clear message that discussions between supplier and retailer leading to infringements of the Chapter I prohibition, such as those which had been found to have taken place in the present case, risked heavy sanctions under the Act.</p>

Although it had already observed that the OFT would have been “fully justified” in applying a multiplier of 2.5 to those figures for the purposes of adjustment under step 3, the Tribunal asked itself what “the lowest multiplier that could reasonably be applied” would be.  It thought that it would be wrong to go below a multiplier of 2.0.  Applying that multiplier at step 3, and then reducing the resulting figures by the 10% actually applied by the OFT at step 4, would give rise to penalties for Argos of £14.76 million and for Littlewoods of £4.32 million.

We also bear in mind that, in this case, the infringements affected not just the prices and turnover of Argos and Littlewoods but the prices and hence the turnover of other retailers which is not reflected in the calculations at all.  In those circumstances a small rounding up of the above figures is in our view fully justified.  The above approach gives rise to an average reduction of around 15 per cent in the penalties compared with the penalties imposed by the OFT.  In percentage terms the reduction is slightly more for Littlewoods and slightly less for Argos as a result of the different “mix” within the relevant turnovers of the two companies.  Nonetheless the overall result is in our view fair to both Argos and Littlewoods.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The principal ground advanced by Argos in support of its appeal from the Tribunal’s decision as to penalty is that both the OFT and the Tribunal “failed to have regard to the guidance for the time being in force” – that is to say, failed to have regard to the Guidance published pursuant to section 38(8) of the 1998 Act. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In particular, it is said that the OFT failed to conduct the analysis of market definition required by paragraph 2.3 of the Guidance.  As we have held, earlier in this judgment, that criticism is misconceived.  It is not necessary, at least in a Chapter I case involving price-fixing, to carry out the formal analysis of the product market – by, for example, applying a SSNIP test – that would be required in a Chapter II case.  All that is needed is that the OFT be satisfied on a reasonable and properly reasoned basis, that it can identify the relevant product market affected by the infringement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On the basis that that is all that is needed in a price-fixing case under Chapter I, Argos submits that, nevertheless, the OFT’s approach to market definition in the present case was “wholly inadequate”.  It is said that, having concluded that there was not much scope for substitutability between the broad categories which it had identified – boys’ toys, games and puzzles, girls’ toys, etc. – the OFT ought to have gone on to consider whether there was substitutability within each category.  That is to say, the OFT ought to have considered (for example) whether there were sub-markets within the category of boys’ toys.  Littlewoods adopts those submissions. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">That criticism is met, as it seems to us, by the findings of the Tribunal.  As we have explained, the Tribunal noted that the categorisation adopted by the OFT was, in fact, the categorisation used internally both by Hasbro and by Argos’ buying department.  The Tribunal concluded that, “from a business point of view”, there were recognised market sectors within the toys industry which corresponded to the broad categories identified by the OFT.  It noted, also, that there had been no challenge by any of the three parties (Hasbro, Argos and Littlewoods), in their rule 14 notices, to the approach to categorisation which the OFT adopted.  In particular, as the Tribunal observed at paragraph 189 of its penalty judgment: “The fact that Hasbro, one of the largest toy manufacturers in the world, did not challenge the OFT’s market categories, but only which toy belonged to which, strongly suggests to us that Hasbro saw the sense of the market categories relied on by the OFT”.  The Tribunal was not prepared to hold that the OFT’s approach to market categorisation had been unreasonable.  For the reasons which we have already explained, we should recognise and respect the Tribunal’s expertise on an appeal from that finding.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A second answer to the criticism of the OFT’s approach to categorisation is that the appeal to this Court on penalty is not an appeal from the OFT’s decision: it is an appeal from the penalty imposed by the Tribunal exercising its own judgment.  It is important to keep in mind that the Tribunal set aside the penalty imposed by the OFT and substituted the reduced penalty which it thought was proportionate to the infringements which it found to have been committed.  </p>

As we have said, we agree with that view.  The question in this Court – in a case where the Tribunal’s findings of infringement are upheld – is whether the Tribunal was wrong to impose the penalty which it did.  In addressing that question, the Court must have regard to the reasoning of the Tribunal.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Tribunal set out the reasons which had led it to impose the penalties which it did in a full and careful judgment.  It explained why it thought that the broad categories identified by the OFT provided a basis for the calculation of the starting point – by reference to “relevant turnover” – which was “not unreasonable”.  It accepted that calculation on that basis might introduce “an arbitrary element”; but explained why that was, itself, acceptable.  There was the overriding safeguard that “the overall figure resulting from the totality of the calculation is appropriate to the infringement in question”.  It accepted that the OFT should not have brought into account the whole of the turnover attributable to four of the market sectors which the OFT had identified: girls’ toys, infant and pre-school, creative and hand-held electronic games.  It recognised that the effect of that methodology might be that the penalties imposed had “inadvertently become inflated above the level necessary for deterrence” and that “the OFT’s method of calculation may have given rise to penalties that are slightly too high”.  It took the view that that justified the Tribunal in making its own assessment of penalty; which it did “on the basis of assumptions which seem to us both realistic and conservative” and “in the context of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to make a broad assessment”.  In our view, none of those steps in the reasoning of the Tribunal can be faulted.  Its own assessment of penalty - at £15.0 million for Argos and £4.5 million for Littlewoods – was “the lowest penalty that could reasonably be justified in the circumstances, to meet the gravity of the case and to have an appropriate deterrent effect”.  As we have said, this Court should recognise that the Tribunal is an expert and specialised body: this Court should hesitate before interfering with its assessment of the penalty needed to mark the gravity of the infringement which has occurred and to deter future infringers.  We are not persuaded that we should do so in this case.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Argos and Littlewoods took a distinct point on penalty, arising from the fact that the OFT remitted the whole of the penalty of £15.59 million which it would otherwise have imposed on Hasbro, and did so under the leniency regime.  They submitted that, on the OFT’s own findings, with which the Tribunal’s findings were consistent, a correct application of that regime could not have permitted more than a reduction of 50% in the penalty which was otherwise appropriate to be imposed on Hasbro, because Hasbro was the instigator of the cartel activity.  They argued that the principle of non-discrimination, discussed above in general terms, requires that Argos and Littlewoods should be treated with equal favour.  If, to take an example for purposes of illustration, the right approach would have been to remit 40% of the penalty which would otherwise have been imposed on Hasbro, then Hasbro has been favoured to the extent of 60%.  Argos and Littlewoods could then contend that the penalty imposed on each of them ought to be reduced by 60% in order to reflect the principle that comparable acts should be treated in a comparable way.  </p>

It is evident, for reasons to be explained later, that if the OFT had not given Hasbro complete immunity, it would have reduced its penalty by 50% on grounds which could not have led to any complaint of unequal treatment on the part of Argos and Littlewoods.  Accordingly if, as Argos and Littlewoods argued for, their penalties were reduced to nil, each of them would receive twice as much favour as Hasbro.  The most that Argos and Littlewoods can claim is a reduction of penalty corresponding to the 50% to which Hasbro was, on their submissions, not entitled.  For reasons mentioned later, their maximum reduction would in fact be slightly less than 50%.</p>

It said that, strictly speaking, it was not open to it to enquire into Hasbro’s conduct and as to whether the complete remission of its penalty was appropriate, Hasbro not being before it.  Nevertheless, having considered Hasbro’s conduct and the circumstances in which leniency was extended to it, it said that there was in fact no breach of the equal treatment principle, because Argos and Littlewoods were not properly comparable to Hasbro, since they had not, unlike Hasbro, applied for leniency.  It further held that the OFT’s treatment of Hasbro did not fall outside a reasonable application of the Guidance, given the margin of appreciation to be allowed to the OFT in that regard.</p>

Some of this is drawn from material which was supplied to the court at the end of the hearing.  This was before the Tribunal and is referred to in paragraphs 51 to 58 and 125 to 127 of the penalty judgment.  The OFT had commenced an investigation into dealings between Hasbro and its distributors.  Hasbro’s solicitors, retained in relation to this investigation, examined documents held by Hasbro for that purpose.  In the course of doing so they found some material which suggested that there may have been dealings with Argos and Littlewoods which involved separate breaches of the Chapter I prohibition.  Mindful of the leniency regime, Hasbro disclosed this material to the OFT.  Hasbro’s solicitors wrote to the OFT on 14 September 2001 applying for immunity under paragraph 3.6 of the Guidance, or in the alternative a reduction under paragraph 3.8.  On 18 September 2001 the OFT and Hasbro came to an immunity agreement under which the OFT granted Hasbro total immunity, conditional on Hasbro complying with relevant conditions including as to future co-operation.  The conditions also included that required by item (c) under paragraph 3.4 of the Guidance, relevantly that Hasbro had not acted as the instigator or played the leading role in the cartel.</p>

We have seen it in the form in which it is available on the OFT’s website, somewhat redacted on grounds of commercial confidentiality.  It was later superseded by an amended decision, to which we were referred during the hearing of the appeal.  That came to be made because, once Argos and Littlewoods had appealed against the original decision, an issue arose from the OFT’s wish to use, in opposition to that appeal, witness statements from three former Hasbro employees which had not been relied on in the administrative procedure before the OFT, and on which Argos and Littlewoods had therefore not been able to comment.  The Tribunal decided on 30 July 2003 (see [2003] CAT 16) to refer the matter back to the OFT so that the witness statements could be considered under the administrative procedure.  It was this renewal of the administrative process that led, in due course, to the amended decision, effectively against Argos and Littlewoods only, though it included passages dealing with Hasbro’s involvement.  The text dealing with Hasbro’s involvement is essentially the same as that of the original decision.  (When referring hereafter to passages in the original decision, we will add, in italics, a reference to the corresponding paragraph number in the amended decision, for comparison purposes.)  It was not open to the OFT to revisit the question of Hasbro’s immunity, having granted that at the stage of the original decision.  In due course Argos and Littlewoods appealed against the amended decision as well, and that became the effective appeal to the Tribunal.</p>

There is no confusion between the two: the one led to the other.  There is ample evidence, both documentary and in the statements of the Hasbro employees, that it was a vital part of the pricing initiative to persuade (rather than “make”, which the Director accepts Hasbro was not in a position to do) retailers to move towards adhering to RRPs.  There is equally persuasive evidence (see the statements of Mike McCulloch and Lesley Paisley (among others)) that it was indeed Hasbro that took the initiative in proposing a move to RRPs.  The result was the unlawful agreements.  Once the agreements were up and running and being seen to be effective, Hasbro could then properly be regarded as the facilitator in ensuring that the arrangements went on working (and indeed could be extended).  It is difficult on the evidence to infer that this extension, as described in Ian Thomson’s e-mails of 18 May 2000 …, was likely to have been prompted by anyone other than Hasbro.  It is not the Director’s case that the setting of the RRPs was part of the unlawful arrangements; it was agreeing to adhere to them (or, on occasion, to some other price) on the understanding that the other would do so also that was unlawful, irrespective of how the prices in question were set or at what level they were pitched.  It is entirely irrelevant that Hasbro could not coerce retailers into abiding by RRPs – that has never been the Director’s contention.  Nor is it part of the Director’s case that monitoring the market was in itself unlawful.  It is the Director’s view that the evidence of monitoring by Hasbro and the way in which it is described in statements and documents goes towards demonstrating the existence of arrangements that were unlawful.”</p>

In the <span style="font-style:italic">Woodpulp</span> case, the Commission found breaches of Article 81 by 40 out of 115 wood pulp producers (and three of their trade associations), regarding the 40, it seems, as the important suppliers, as compared with the others who sold only small quantities and probably followed the selling prices of the more important suppliers.  It found one relevant infringement (the only one on which its decision was upheld by the Court of Justice on appeal) to have been committed by a number of undertakings which were the subject of the investigation; some of them were subjected to fines but one was not.  Neither the Report for the Hearing (which records at pages I-1407 and 1408 some reasons advanced by the Commission for not imposing fines despite findings of infringement, but not in relation to this particular infringement) nor the Opinion of the Advocate-General discloses the reason for this difference of treatment.  The Court fixed a fine of ECU 20,000 for this infringement as regards those undertakings which had been fined by the Commission in respect of it.  As regards the failure to fine the other undertaking, without alluding to the principle of equal treatment, it dealt with the point shortly, as follows at paragraph 197:</p>

In one case the undertaking not subject to a penalty was said to be “a small undertaking which played a minor and passive role in the infringement at issue”.

It had to do so in order to find whether there had been infringements of the Chapter I prohibition, and it found such infringements established on the part of all three subject undertakings.  It explained fully what it had found to have been done by Hasbro.  It decided what penalty it would otherwise have imposed on Hasbro.  Only then did it apply the leniency agreement which it had reached with Hasbro, and in the result remitted the penalty altogether.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Given that Hasbro emerged from the OFT’s investigation free of penalty, although the subject of a finding of infringement of the Chapter I prohibition, it would have been surprising if it had appealed against the finding of breach.  The conduct in question occurred too early to have been the potential basis for a claim by a third party under section 47A or section 47B of the Act, introduced by the Enterprise Act 2002.  Accordingly, the Tribunal had to deal only with appeals by Argos and Littlewoods.  Nevertheless these were appeals against the OFT’s findings and penalties imposed as a result of a single investigation into the conduct of all three undertakings.  In relation to that investigation, and in particular in imposing penalties, the OFT had to comply with the principle of equal treatment, if and insofar as it was relevant.  Argos and Littlewoods are entitled to contend on appeal that this principle applied but was not followed.  It does not seem to us that, in a case where the conduct of the undertaking to which it is said that undue favour was given was so centrally involved in the activities and in the investigation, and even in the appeal, it could be right to exclude unequal treatment from the available grounds of appeal on the preliminary ground that (because it was so substantially favoured) the favoured undertaking did not itself appeal.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On the Tribunal’s reasoning and the OFT’s argument this ground of appeal would be available if, for example, leniency had been allowed, when arguably it should not have been, by a reduction of 25% under paragraph 3.8, so that the favoured party, being subject to a substantial penalty, itself appealed.  In that case, the other parties could rely on unequal treatment, as the Japanese parties did in <span style="font-style:italic">JFE Engineering</span>.  The favoured undertaking would, on the other hand, have to weigh up (as well as all other relevant factors) the risk that, by bringing such an appeal, it would expose itself to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to increase the penalty imposed on it.  It might therefore decide that, discretion being the better part of valour, it would not challenge the finding of breach or the penalty, for fear of ending up with the same finding of breach and a heavier penalty.  We do not see why the ability of the other parties to rely on unequal treatment as a ground of appeal at all should depend on the decision of the favoured undertaking whether or not to appeal.  If there has been unequal treatment in the imposition of penalty, the OFT has acted in breach of relevant principles of Community law, and therefore of the Act.  That breach ought in principle to be available to the other undertakings as a ground of appeal.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It may well be that the situation arising in the present case is factually unusual but, in our judgment, it was open to Argos and Littlewoods to rely on the unequal treatment ground of appeal, despite the fact that Hasbro was not a party to the appeal to the Tribunal.  The OFT was bound to comply with the principle of equal treatment.  If it did not, then the penalty imposed on Argos and Littlewoods was legally wrong as to its amount, and they should be able to so contend, given that the relevant conduct of Hasbro had been fully investigated, and findings had been made about it, by the OFT, given its central role in the cartel activity, and also given the discrete nature of the point relied on in order to show unequal treatment, namely that, as “the instigator”, Hasbro did not qualify under the Guidance for more than 50% remission of penalty.  We can see that it could well be different if the argument was that the OFT should have regarded one undertaking’s conduct as a whole as being just as serious as that of another, where a judgment would have to be reached as to the relative culpability of two or more undertakings involved in different ways and to different extents in an overall cartel activity.  An example of that kind is provided by the reliance on this rule by JJB in its appeal on penalty: see paragraphs [199] to [205] above.  In the Toys and Games case, however, the OFT made findings on at least some of the points which are relevant to the rightness or otherwise of its approach.  Moreover, although Hasbro was not a party to the appeal, the Tribunal had to consider its conduct, because it had to consider that of each of Argos and Littlewoods vis-à-vis Hasbro.</p>

We do not regard the second and third points, concerning the course of the investigation, as legitimate subjects of an appeal.  It does not seem to us that it could be right for an Appellant to raise issues on appeal which would require the Tribunal to examine the course of the investigation as between the OFT and another party, in respects which do not in themselves affect the position of the Appellant.  The fourth point (not pursued in the Court of Appeal) seems to us to be unjustified.  The reasons given by the OFT and referred to at paragraph [244] above seem to us to be sufficient justification for not expressing its reasons for the grant of immunity or leniency.  The fifth point was not pursued before us and we need say no more about it.  It seems to us that the Tribunal could properly have refrained from dealing with the second point (on which, in effect, nothing turned anyway, since the position under paragraph 3.6 of the Guidance would not have been substantially different from that under paragraph 3.4) which it discussed at paragraphs 140 to 149, and with the third point, covered at paragraphs 150 to 156.</p>

One was that, Hasbro not being a party to the appeal, findings of the kind that would need to be made would adversely affect Hasbro and its employees as regards reputation, and might have other consequences, for example in the context of civil actions for damages.  However, the OFT had itself made findings, which were already public, which could have that effect and potentially those consequences.  It does not seem to us that for these issues to be raised on appeal would make any significant difference in these respects, especially on the basis that, for the reasons which we have mentioned, the issue on appeal is limited to whether Hasbro was not entitled to immunity on the basis that it was “the” instigator.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In some cases this might present a problem.  In the instant case, Argos and Littlewoods contend that Hasbro was not eligible for more than 50% remission.  They do not contend that it was not even eligible for that much remission.  If the OFT had decided that Hasbro was not eligible for immunity, it is clear from its letter of 11 November 2002 that it would have awarded a 50% reduction, from the figure which it determined (£15.59 million), the correctness of which as such was not in issue.  In practice, therefore, this factor does not give rise to any difficulty in this case.  On the facts of this case, if it came to the point, Argos and Littlewoods would be entitled to have their penalties reduced by 50%.  (Strictly, to ensure proper comparability and to avoid double counting, the 10% reduction allowed to each of Argos and Littlewoods at stage 4 under the Guidance ought probably to be added back before the 50% reduction is made, since Hasbro did not have the benefit of such a reduction by reason of its entitlement under the leniency regime.)  If this were a real issue in another case, it may be that the Tribunal would have to consider referring to the OFT (under rule 19(2)(j)) the question what remission the OFT would have accorded to the favoured party if it had treated it as eligible for no more than 50%, and then allowing the penalty appeals to the extent of a reduction corresponding to the excessive favour so quantified.  However, the Tribunal would in any event have to determine what penalty was appropriate to the infringement committed by the appellant party, because that would be the starting point to which the consequences of the principle of equal treatment would have to be applied.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Tribunal rejected the argument about unequal treatment on its merits, saying that Hasbro came forward to the OFT voluntarily with evidence of an infringement of the Chapter I prohibition, whereas Argos and Littlewoods did not.  Thus, it held, like was not being compared with like.  Of course, that difference of fact does justify a difference of treatment.  The question is whether it justifies the difference of treatment which the OFT applied.  Hasbro was eligible for lenient treatment.  Argos and Littlewoods could not have complained if Hasbro’s penalty had been remitted to the extent of up to 50%.  Such a difference of treatment would have been objectively justified.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Apart from the application of the leniency regime, however, and in particular the extent to which any one of them could be said to be an instigator of the concerted practice, the situations of Hasbro, Argos and Littlewoods were all precisely comparable.  Moreover, up to the point at which the OFT considered the leniency regime in relation to Hasbro, it did treat them alike.  The only difference was in the application of that regime, and the only issue that has to be considered under this ground of appeal is whether that regime was correctly applied.  Argos and Littlewoods argued that the Tribunal’s position amounts to saying that the conferring of leniency on Hasbro itself puts Hasbro in a materially different, and not comparable, position to Argos and Littlewoods.  We do not agree with that interpretation of the Tribunal’s judgment, but we would accept the proposition that it is not enough to say that Hasbro did cooperate and did apply for leniency, and that this differentiates its position fundamentally from that of the others.  It only differentiates Hasbro’s position if and insofar as the proper and reasonable application of the Guidance justifies different treatment.  In its skeleton argument on this appeal, amplified by the powerful oral submissions presented to us by Mr Doctor Q.C., the OFT submitted that it, and in turn the Tribunal, treated Hasbro as not being in a similar position to Argos and Littlewoods because Hasbro applied for leniency and complied with the leniency conditions.  If Hasbro did comply with the leniency conditions, then the different treatment could not be called into question.  The issue is whether it did so comply.  It does not seem to us that the Tribunal’s reasoning at paragraphs 102 and 103 of the penalty judgment is sufficient to render an enquiry into whether Hasbro did qualify for complete remission irrelevant on the appeal to the Tribunal.</p>

The OFT came to its decision on that, as we have described, in February 2003, at the time of its original decision in the investigation.  It seems to us that the correctness of that decision has to be assessed by reference to the material available to the OFT at that time.  It would be wrong to argue that the decision can be shown to have been incorrect by reference to material which the OFT did not have at the time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In this context the different nature of appeal proceedings from decisions of the OFT and those from the Commission should be noted.  On appeal from the Commission, now to the CFI, there is no new investigation of facts.  Thus the CFI is necessarily limited to deciding the case by reference to the same facts as those on which any relevant decision of the Commission was taken, as they appear from the Commission’s decision itself.  On an appeal under the Act, by contrast, the Tribunal receives evidence which is not limited to that which was available to the OFT, and decides the case on its merits.  The importance of that factor is what led the Tribunal to refer the matter back to the OFT on the first appeal, as described at paragraph [239] above.  On Argos’ and Littlewoods’ appeals, therefore, the Tribunal had to decide the issues arising as regards liability and penalty on the basis of the Tribunal’s own conclusions from the evidence which it had heard.  This will almost always be different from that which the OFT had to go on, and certainly it was in this case.</p>

It said that any view on that question reached by the Tribunal would not resolve the “quite different question of whether the OFT had remained within its margin of appreciation in deciding, in February 2003, not to withdraw full immunity from Hasbro” (paragraph 135) or “whether it was reasonable for the OFT to take the view it did in February 2003” (paragraph 136).</p>

He submitted that to limit an appeal by one party, even if only on a particular aspect of the case, in such a way that only material before the OFT is allowed to be taken into account, would be inconsistent with that full right of appeal.</p>

It could not be right to hold that the OFT should have decided, in February 2003, that Hasbro was the instigator, and should therefore not have given it full immunity, by reference to evidence which was not available to the OFT at that time.  We agree with what the Tribunal said on this at paragraph 129 of the penalty judgment, and as to the exclusion of later material at paragraph 132.  For our part we do not regard it as “extremely doubtful” that findings of fact by the Tribunal on the basis of the evidence before it could be relevant (see its paragraph 135) but as plain that they are not relevant.</p>

Certainly there are respects in which the application of the Guidance involves exercises of discretion and judgment, with which the Tribunal would be slow to interfere unless it could be shown that the OFT had misdirected itself as to the scope of its discretion, or had erred in principle in some other way.  The statutory obligation imposed on the OFT in relation to the Guidance is to have regard to it.  That does not altogether preclude a departure from it.  In principle the departure should be not only deliberate but also reasoned and justified.  The Tribunal would not be justified in overturning a penalty decision reached in such circumstances if the decision not to follow the Guidance was sufficiently explained, and was rationally based.  In such a case, even if the difference of result as regards the two undertakings in question was sufficient to bring into play the principle of equal treatment, it is likely that the treatment of the more favoured undertaking could be shown to be objectively justifiable, by reference to the factors identified by the OFT in explaining why it did not follow the Guidance in the particular case.  </p>

If it is wrong in law, then the less favoured undertaking is entitled to appeal and to have its penalty reduced to the extent necessary to eliminate the inequality of treatment.

It found facts, some of which are relevant, in its original decision, but it did not explain, in that decision or elsewhere, its reasons for granting immunity.  As explained in a passage from its original decision quoted above (paragraph [244]) this is regarded as a matter of confidentiality: “The desirability for confidentiality does not solely concern the identity of the party which has applied for leniency, but also the OFT’s reasons for granting or refusing leniency.”  It is possible to draw some inferences as to the OFT’s reasons from the original decision and from the correspondence about immunity between the OFT and Hasbro’s solicitors.  But there is a limit to what conclusions can properly be reached on this basis, and the Tribunal would have to be cautious about drawing inferences as to the basis of the OFT’s decision.  This is a further reason for proceeding on a basis analogous to judicial review.</p>

It was said (with a comparison to the published approach of the Department of Justice in US cases) that the withdrawal of immunity needed to be justified by clear and strong information, and that if it was not, then the leniency regime might be discredited so as to appear less attractive in the eyes of business, and would thereby fail to achieve its objective.

It was not sufficient, as against Hasbro, to conclude that Hasbro was an instigator and that no other party was proved to have been one.  Whether, as against Argos, for example, the evidence that it was an instigator was not sufficient for that to be taken into account in imposing a penalty on it was said to be a different question from whether the evidence as a whole showed, as against Hasbro, that Hasbro was the instigator.</p>

We would regard it as fully legitimate for the OFT to have taken this into account, together with any uncertainty that it felt as to whether it was or could be satisfied, as against Hasbro, that Hasbro had failed to satisfy condition (c), and to have resolved its doubts in favour of confirming the immunity, in order not to risk the leniency regime seeming to be less attractive to others in the future.  We do not know whether the OFT did proceed on that basis, and we do not say that it could not reasonably have taken a different approach, such as that the grant of immunity depended not on a policy approach but on the strict application of the Guidance.  However, if, as we think, this was a possible and legitimate approach on the part of the OFT on the material which it had, then it follows that Argos and Littlewoods cannot show that the OFT’s decision was not within the range of decisions legitimately open to it on the available material.  At paragraph 130 of the penalty judgment the Tribunal gave its reasons for coming to the same view.  Those do not include the policy approach, mentioned at paragraph [285(i)] above, but otherwise the reasons there given are much the same as those which have brought us to the same conclusion.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The constraints on any enquiry as to the correctness of a decision about immunity or leniency by the OFT which result from its policy of not expressing its reasons on the point are such that it is unlikely that it would ever be possible to show that the grant of immunity or lesser leniency amounted to unequal treatment as between two or more undertakings involved in the same cartel activities, if the favoured undertaking is not a party to the appeal.  In practice the point will be capable of being maintained only rarely, if ever, where the favoured party chooses the path of discretion and does not appeal.  In the result, the situation may not differ greatly from that which was succinctly stated by the ECJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Woodpulp</span> at paragraph 197, quoted at paragraph [250] above.  In principle, it seems to us that there may be rare cases (of which this might have been one, because of the central role of Hasbro in the infringements alleged) in which the point could be taken by another party which considered itself to have been the victim of unequal treatment.  In practice, the point cannot be made good on the facts in this case, and it must be improbable that such an argument could be made good, in the absence of the favoured party from the proceedings before the Tribunal.</p>
