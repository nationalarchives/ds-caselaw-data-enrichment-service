These are the appeals of fourteen adults all of whom claim to have suffered sexual and/or physical and/or emotional abuse between 1973 and 1991 while children in the care of the first defendant’s children’s homes in North Wales.  In a consolidated action tried by Connell J. in early 2001 they claimed damages in negligence against the first defendant, which had gone into liquidation in 1997.  The respondent, on its own application, was joined as second defendant in the action to enable it to protect its position as the first defendant’s putative insurer.  The claims were primarily for long-term psychiatric or psychological injury.</p>

The Judge held that all the successful claims were out of time and not saved by the “date of knowledge” provisions in sections 11 and 14 of the Limitation Act 1980.  However, in all those claims, he exercised his discretion under section 33 of the 1980 Act to disapply the period of limitation.  He said that he would have done the same in respect of MCK’s claim if she had established a case in negligence.  He awarded all the successful claimants damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenities and some of them for loss of earnings and cost of psychotherapy.</p>

MCK appeals against the Judge’s dismissal of her claim and JS and CD appeal against the Judge’s dismissal of part of their respective claims.  Each of those three appellants also seek to overcome the Judge’s related ruling, in the light of the House of Lords decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Lister &amp; Ors. v. Hesley Hall Limited </span>[2001] 2 WLR 1311, that he had no power under section 33 of the 1980 Act to extend the limitation period to tortious conduct in respect of which the first defendant was vicariously responsible but which was not in itself negligent.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The respondent, with the Judge’s permission, cross-appeals the Judge’s decision to disapply the limitation period under section 33 in the case of the thirteen successful claims in negligence and contingently in the case of MCK in the event of her overturning the Judge’s dismissal of her claim in negligence.  MCK, in her turn, seeks to rely on section 14 of the 1980 Act in the event of losing her contingent entitlement to proceed under section 33.   Connell J. refused the other claimants’ applications for permission to appeal the Judge’s ruling against them on section 14 contingently on this Court upholding the respondent’s cross-appeal on section 33.  They did not renew the application in this Court until a late stage in the hearing of the appeal in circumstances that we describe below.  The Court then granted permission and, accordingly, all the appellants now cross-appeal the Judge’s ruling against them under section 14. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">From about 1969 to 1990 John Allen operated a number of children’s care homes in North Wales which became known, after the name of its first and main home, as “the Bryn Alyn Community”.  Throughout that period he controlled the affairs of the Community, assuming the role of chief executive on its transfer to the first defendant, a private company, in 1972.  Although the Community ended in financial failure on the liquidation of the company in 1997, it operated successfully for over two decades, employing a large number of staff and in the mid eighties earning significant profits. Allen’s stated aim and that of the Community was to provide an alternative to the strict discipline and training regimes of approved schools for children of both sexes who, for various reasons, were vulnerable and/or unruly and in need of care.  He held out the Community as providing a flexible, family type environment, catering for the individual needs of each child.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The vast majority of the Community’s charges were children who had been placed in the care of local authorities.  However, it appears that it offered more in the way of care than it was equipped to provide.  In particular, many of its staff had had little or no experience of residential care work with children before coming to Bryn Alyn or any formal qualifications for the work.  And, as will appear, a number of them, including Allen, sexually and/or violently abused some of the children in their charge.</p>

He and a number of other employees also became the subject of various allegations of abuse, some of which, in 1997 and 1998, were investigated by the Tribunal of Inquiry chaired by Sir Ronald Waterhouse into allegations of child abuse in a number of residential establishments in North Wales between 1974 and 1997 (1999-2001) HC 201.  All but one of the claims the subject of these appeals, that of JS, were first made in 1998 or 1999, in the wake of the publicity given to the allegations investigated by the Tribunal. </p>

The range of delay to issue of proceedings from the last abusive act and from expiry of the limitation period was respectively from about 24 and 20 years in the case of KR to about 8 years and 3 years in the case of CD.

The respondent, through counsel, contested each claim, advancing no positive case, save in the claim of JS (where there were more contemporaneous records than usual), and, save for a few concessions, required each claimant to prove his or her claim.  It was not able to call much evidence of its own.  Some witnesses had died; others had gone abroad or were untraceable; some were in prison; and some, no doubt, were too old or ill or were reluctant to co-operate in connection with allegations of such unpleasant matters so long before.  It called only four former employees of Bryn Alyn, namely Keith Evans, Peter Steen, John Jeffreys and Dafydd Vevar, and otherwise limited itself to medical evidence, which was mostly agreed. Two of the principal players, John Allen and David Stanley, had in the meantime been convicted of serious sexual offences involving children in the Community.  Allen was concerned in seven of the fourteen claims and Stanley in one of them.  Although both men were available to give evidence, neither was called.  </p>

Further difficulties of this sort also flowed from the fact that the first defendant was in liquidation.

By section 38 of the Act, “personal injuries” include “any impairment of a person’s physical or mental condition”.  The regime for personal injuries claims of this type is, on the face of it, more stringent than the general six-year limitation period provided by section 2 of the Act for all other actions founded on tort.  However, the rigour of the shorter period is mitigated, not only by the provision for its extension by reference to the date of knowledge, which is defined in section 14, but also, in the event of a claimant’s failure to bring his action within any such extended period, by section 33, which gives the Court a discretion to disapply the limitation period so as to allow the action to proceed. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The presence of the two provisions, one for extension and the other for disapplication of the limitation period, in personal injury claims has produced the irony that where there are alleged primary and secondary tortfeasors, an employer may be held to account in negligence in respect of his employee’s deliberate assault long after the latter has been able to claim the benefit of his unextendable six years period of limitation.  That is because the courts have construed the words in section 11, “negligence, nuisance or breach of duty” as not including deliberate acts of assault – trespass to the person. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In addition, as this case exemplifies, the relationship of the two provisions for relaxation of the three year period in personal injury claims gives rise to particular difficulties in claims in negligence against care homes and the like in respect of their employees’ child abuse, where the claims are brought long after the event in respect of physical and/or mental injury at the time and also of later mental impairment.  In such cases, as the Law Commission has pointed out in its Report, <span style="font-style:italic">Limitation of Actions</span>, July 2001, Law Com No, 270, at paras. 4.23-4.33, there may well be difficulty in disentangling the immediate injury from long-term psychiatric injury diagnosed very much later.  Each case must, of course, be considered on its own facts.  The immediate physical effects will vary, according to the violence and other circumstances of the abuse, from the mild to the very serious.  Whatever the seriousness of the physical injury, it is likely to be accompanied by some harmful effect on the mind, for example, distress, humiliation and/or shame.  Such effects, depending on the circumstances of the abuse, will vary in their severity and may or may not, at an early stage, deter or disable the victims from bringing a claim within the limitation period for any immediate or early injury attributable to the abuse.  The abuse may also, as Connell J. found here, give rise to, and similarly repress or mask, long-term and more serious psychiatric injury.  In such circumstances, we have some sympathy for the difficulties facing the Judge in identifying and distinguishing where necessary between section 14 and section 33 considerations.  Unfortunately, his difficulties were exacerbated by the parties’ concentration in the pleadings, evidence and argument on long-term psychiatric injury so as to side-line the immediate physical and mental injuries that all or some of the claimants may have suffered. </p>

However, after hearing all the original submissions on appeal, having reserved judgement and having begun to write it, we began to feel unease at the Judge’s concentration, for the purpose of determining the date of knowledge under section 14, on the immediate effects of the abuse which, for the reasons we have given, appeared not to be the injuries for which they sought damages.

Or so it seemed to us from the conduct of the action below and also from the focus of the arguments on appeal.  Each of the pleaded claims particularised the injury in respect of which damages were sought, by reference to a psychiatric report prepared many years after the last alleged abusive conduct and which, true to its intention, dealt with the claimant’s later psychiatric condition and its attribution.  The Judge appears to have given the immediate injury caused by and inherent in the abuse some prominence when dealing with limitation under section 14.  However, he does not appear to have considered it sufficiently important to examine it closely for the purpose of determining whether it met all the requirements of section 14(2).  Nor, in the main, does he appear to have it in mind when assessing quantum.  </p>

However, with the Court’s leave, he amended their notices of appeal to add a complaint challenging the Judge’s ruling against them under section 14, and each of the parties’ counsel have prepared a further skeleton argument and appeared before the Court on a re-opened hearing of the appeal to argue the point.  As will appear, that argument engendered a further concern about the Judge’s apparent failure, when assessing quantum of general damages in each case to have regard to the abuse itself and its immediate effects. But for the moment, we confine our remarks to our original concern, the Judge’s treatment of the meaning of “significant” knowledge of “the injury in question” for the purpose of section 14. </p>

The Court of Appeal after considerable hesitation accepted this argument on behalf of the plaintiff.  If it was necessary to decide the point I should not have found it easy to have agreed with the Court of Appeal.  Personal injury is defined in section 38 of the Act of 1980 as including ‘any impairment of a person’s physical or mental condition’ and I have the greatest difficulty in accepting that a woman who knows that she has been raped does not know that she has suffered a significant injury. The Criminal Injuries Compensation Board … has been making substantial awards to the victims of rape … and since the enlargement of the scheme in 1979 this has included victims within the family setting.  <span style="font-style:italic">Sexual abuse that goes no further than indecent fondling of a child raises a more difficult question, </span>but some of the plaintiff’s allegations are so serious that I should have no difficulty in regarding them as other than significant.  <span style="font-style:italic">However I do not find it necessary to resolve this difficult issue</span>.”  [our emphases]</p>

With respect to Lord Griffiths, we believe that those judgments should be revisited, not only as to lesser and “consensual” sexual abuse of the sort that he may have had in mind in his qualification, but also as to more serious sexual mistreatment and to physical abuse crossing the line of reasonable discipline of young children in care homes and the like.  All the members of the Court of Appeal stressed the importance of the special, partly subjective meaning given by section 14(2) to the word “significant” in section 14(1) and, in consequence, distinguished between the plaintiff’s knowledge at the time of the abuse and that much later when she was an adult and became aware of the long term psychological problems it had caused. </p>

On the facts, the impairment of the claimant’s physical condition was not significant in a section 14(2) sense since, although she had suffered distress, humiliation and degradation at the hands of her abusers, their conduct had not caused her physical injury, save for some assaults in about 1972 when she was aged 15 causing her nose to bleed.  In the state of society in the late 1970s and early 1980s the claimant would not reasonably have considered those assaults sufficiently serious to justify proceedings even “against an acquiescent and creditworthy defendant”.  As to impairment of the claimant’s mental condition, she could have sued for the immediate distress caused by the sexual abuse, but the claimant would not, at that stage, have regarded such distress in the absence of any apparent long-term consequence as sufficiently serious to justify proceedings nor, on the evidence, did she know within three years before issuing proceedings that the serious impairment of her mental condition was attributable to the abuse.  </p>

Whether a particular injury would reasonably be regarded as significant by a particular plaintiff, as the person whose date of knowledge is in question, is a very highly judgmental question.  The education of public opinion over the last five years or so, both as to the prevalence of child abuse within families and as to its serious long-term consequences, might well mean that almost any plaintiff would now reasonably regard such conduct (if other than very trivial) as significant in the statutory sense.  But before the publicity given to the Cleveland inquiry the level of public (and even professional) understanding was much lower and claims by children on reaching their majority against parents and siblings were unknown.  Recognition that these acts had caused her serious <span style="font-style:italic">long-term</span> mental impairment could reasonably be seen by the plaintiff as importing a new order of gravity.  To distinguish between the immediate impairment of the plaintiff’s mental condition caused by these acts, apparently minor and transient, and the much more serious <span style="font-style:italic">long-term</span> impairment of the plaintiff’s mental condition, the attributability of which to the Webbs’ conduct was appreciated later, is not in my judgment to defeat the intention of the legislature but to promote it.”</p>

That is in part as a result of cause of action estoppel, of which <span style="font-style:italic">Bristow v.

At first sight, it does not fit so readily the circumstances of abused children who, because of their immaturity and vulnerable position, might never consider or seek advice about suing their abusers, or those responsible for them, for damages.  The test, properly interpreted, is likely to be somewhat unrealistic in many child abuse cases when applied to claims for immediate injury.  Such injury is likely to include, in addition to any physical injury, a mix of emotions and other mental effects, for example, humiliation, distress, shame, guilt and fear of being disbelieved or of disclosure.  In such circumstances, depending on the severity of the victim’s condition and the dates of the abuse, it could have been unreasonable and unreal to have expected him, as he moved from childhood to three years beyond majority, to consider recourse to the civil courts for damages for something he just wanted to put behind him. Given the circumstances of the abuse and his subsequent way of life, making such a claim, or seeking advice about it, might reasonably never occur to him.  He might have known at the time of the abuse that it was wrong; he might have harboured resentment, great grievance, or even a desire for revenge, perhaps even a wish to report it to the police, but not necessarily to litigate for damages.</p>

For some such behaviour is unpleasant, but familiar.  As Mr. Owen put it in his supplemental submissions, such misconduct was for many of these claimants “the norm”; it was committed by persons in authority; and they, the claimants, were powerless to do anything about it.  Some victims of physical abuse may have believed that, to some extent, they deserved it.  And, in cases of serious sexual abuse unaccompanied by serious physical injury of any permanent or disabling kind, it is not surprising, submitted Mr. Owen that they did not see the significance of the conduct in section 14(2) terms, and simply tried to make the best of things.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However artificial it may seem to pose the question in this context, section 14 requires the court, on a case by case basis, to ask whether such an already damaged child would reasonably turn his mind to litigation as a solution to his problems?   The same applies to those, as in the case of many of these claimants who, subsequent to the abuse, progress into adulthood and a twilight world of drugs, further abuse and violence and, in some cases, crime.  Some would put the abuse to the back of their minds; some might, as a result or a symptom of an as yet undiagnosed development of psychiatric illness, block or suppress it.  Whether such a reaction is deliberate or unconscious, whether or not it is a result of some mental impairment, the question remains whether and when such a person would have reasonably seen the significance of his injury so as turn his mind his mind to litigation in the sense required by section 14(1)(a) and (2) to start the period of limitation running.   At this stage the section 14(1)(b) issue of actual or constructive knowledge of attributability becomes more of a live issue than it would have been at or shortly after the abuse, because in some cases it might only be after the intervention of a psychiatrist that a claimant realises that there could have been a causal link between the childhood abuse and the psychiatric problems suffered as an adult,  an argument accepted by the Court of Appeal, but which Lord Griffiths found difficult to accept, in <span style="font-style:italic">Stubbings v.

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The posing of such questions may have become less artificial in recent years. As a result of the publicity given to inquiries of the sort conducted by Sir Ronald Waterhouse in 1997 and 1998 and the disturbing increase in the number of criminal prosecutions and civil suits for child abuse, some of it a very long time ago. The momentum of increase in public awareness of such conduct, of which Bingham LJ spoke in 1992 in <span style="font-style:italic">Stubbings v. Webb</span> is likely to have begun to usher in a generation more sensitive to its seriousness and “significance” in a section 14(2) sense.  In that case the Court was concerned with sexual and other physical abuse of a child over a twelve year period from 1959 to 1971 when she was between two and fourteen years old.  Sir Nicholas Browne-Wilkinson V-C and Nolan LJ agreed with Bingham LJ that the claimant’s undoubted knowledge on reaching maturity in the early 1970s of what she had been through and its effect on her physical and mental condition at the time did not, on the facts of the case and in the climate of the time, amount to knowledge of significant injury for the purpose of section 14(2). As I have said, Sir Nicholas Browne-Wilkinson V-C and Nolan LJ spoke in similar terms to those of Bingham LJ in the passage from his judgment that we have set out in paragraph 36 above, suggesting that it may not have been until the late 1980s that public awareness had become such that abused children were, before or within three years after majority, more likely, depending on the nature of the abuse and other circumstances, to become aware of the significance, in a section 14(2) sense, of what had happened to them.

But in my judgment the available evidence does not show that she should reasonably have regarded her physical or mental injuries at that stage as sufficiently serious to justify the institution of proceedings for damages, even against hypothetically solvent and unresisitng defendants.  <span style="font-style:italic">It has to be borne in mind that until the last few years proceedings of the present kind were unheard of</span>.” [our emphasis]]</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">But the word ‘significant’ in section 14 does not bear its ordinary meaning.  For the purposes of that section, an injury is only ‘significant’ if the plaintiff would ‘reasonably have considered it sufficiently serious to justify [her] instituting proceedings for damages’ against her adoptive father and brother assuming that they would admit liability and be good for the damages.  In deciding what … [the plaintiff] would ‘reasonably have considered’ one has to have regard to the circumstances obtaining in 1975, when she attained full age.  The question is whether, in 1975, the plaintiff acted reasonably in not then suing … for the serious wrong alleged to have been done to her.  In my judgment it is important not to consider the question by reference to the social habits and conventions of 1991.  Over recent years, for the first time civil actions have been brought by victims of adult rape against their assailants.  As to actions against child-abusers, this is apparently the first case in which the alleged victim has sought to sue her abusers.  <span style="font-style:italic">In the present climate and state of knowledge it would in my judgment be very difficult, if not impossible, for a plaintiff coming of age in the late 1980s to establish that she acted ‘reasonably’ in not starting proceedings alleging child abuse within three years of attaining her majority.  But we are concerned with the reasonableness of the plaintiff’s behaviour in the period 1975-78.  At that time civil actions based on sexual assaults were unknown in this country….” </span>[our emphasis]</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There may be much force in Nolan LJ’s general observation at the end of that passage as to claimants who came of age in the late 80s.  However, it should, in our view, be treated with some caution, particularly in cases, where as in most of these appeals, claimants came to the abuse in question already deeply disturbed and acclimatised by previous ill-treatment and poor backgrounds and moved on after it into a similar culture as an adult.  To paraphrase Bingham LJ, whether a particular claimant would reasonably have not regarded a particular injury from such abuse when it occurred, as significant for this purpose is still likely to be a “highly judgmental question”.  It is a fact-sensitive question that needs to be considered on a case-by-case basis.  It is plain that the Judge did not do that.  First, it looks as if he construed the word “significant” in section 14(1) without reference to the special meaning given to it in this context by section 14(2).  And, second, even if he had its partly subjective meaning in mind, he does not appear to have considered its application on a claim-by-claim basis, in particular as to the nature, condition and circumstances of the individual claimant or to “the injury in question”.  A sure sign of his erroneous approach is that he felt able to credit all of the claimants with “the relevant knowledge before they left the community”, namely at a time when all or most of them were still as or more vulnerable than when they had first arrived there and when each of them had still to go out into the world.</p>

(see paragraph 20 above)   He urged the Court not to go behind the Judge’s general findings fact of knowledge of significant injury, relying, conventionally, on the advantage he had over the Court in having heard and seen the claimants and the medical witnesses.</p>

It was for the Judge to determine in the case of each claimant whether, within three years after majority, he or she had significant knowledge within the meaning of section 14(2) and in respect of what injury, whether physical and/or mental.  In the case of each claimant, the Judge had to consider, among other things, his or her individual history and circumstances, the nature, severity and duration of the abuse, the period of time when it occurred and its physical and/or mental effects evident to the claimant within three years after reaching majority.  He then had to relate them all to the question whether that claimant, given those and any other relevant circumstances, would have considered the injury of which he knew (“the injury in question”) sufficiently serious to institute proceedings against a solvent and compliant defendant.</p>

However, he maintained that that did not disentitle claimants from also claiming in respect of the same causative conduct, the previous abuse outside the extended period, which in itself would have justified an award of damages.

It was that in all or some of the claimant’s cases, part of the immediate injury caused by the abuse was of such a disabling character as to prevent them from acquiring section 14(2) knowledge within three years after their majority.  Where such disability could be established, the position, he submitted, would not be so very different from cases of insidious industrial diseases, the developing injury remaining unknown until the appearance of symptoms long after the negligence causing it.  Here it could take the form of a slowly developing psychiatric injury or one remaining dormant and only becoming manifest when triggered by some later event or events such as the publicity given to the work of the Waterhouse Tribunal, consequent police enquiries of the claimant or receipt of medical advice.</p>

Smith</span> [1996] AC 155 (as to the test in personal injury claims of foreseeability of personal injury to the plaintiff).  He added, by way of commonplace illustration, that in many, if not most, personal injury cases there is both a physical and a mental element and that the full extent of either element may take time to develop and manifest itself.  He said that, where that happens the deterioration does not amount to a different injury because it becomes of greater significance with time, a point that, he maintained, the Judge had in mind in paragraph 30 of his judgment in observing that a claimant’s “realisation of the extent of the injury may grow with time, as may the injury itself”.   He distinguished such cases from claims in cases of industrial diseases or other complex medical cases where many years may elapse before any symptoms appear.</p>

In that context it is an unfortunate, but necessary, consequence of the wording of sections 11 and 14.  But Mr. Faulks’ submission does not help him if the Judge wrongly found such early knowledge in the case of any individual claimant.  In that event, the later date of knowledge may save the action in respect of the earlier “insignificant” injury for this purpose of limitation as well as in respect of the injury of which the claimant later acquired the relevant knowledge.  See <span style="font-style:italic">Stubbings v. Webb</span>, per Nolan LJ and Sir Nicholas Browne-Wilkinson V-C at 211B-D and 212B-D respectively, set out in paragraphs 42 and 43 above. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The narrow question to which the courts are confined when a section 14 issue arises is as to the knowledge of the claimant at any material time for the purpose of starting the limitation period. If, as provided by section 11, an action for negligence, nuisance or breach of duty “includes” a claim for damages for personal injury which, at the material time, he knew to be “significant” so as to bring it within the limitation period, he may proceed with that claim.  He may also proceed with any other claim for damages arising out of the same cause of action – whether previous or subsequent to the injury of which he had significant knowledge, and whether or not for personal injuries.  But where an action includes a claim for damages for personal injury which he did not, within the limitation period,  know to be significant, that claim will be statute – barred unless the action “includes” another claim for damages for personal injuries of which he first had significant knowledge within the period.   Thus, in the same action, section 14, depending on the circumstances, may preserve or bar the recoverability of damages for the later of two injuries however late the date of knowledge of it, or enable recovery for the earlier of two injuries which, but for the claim for the second, would have been statute-barred. </p>

If the Judge was wrong in that finding, the operative date of knowledge would be that of the long-term psychiatric abuse which, if within the limitation period, would enable the claim for both the earlier immediate injuries caused by the abuse and the long-term psychiatric injury.  It is thus necessary to consider the case of each claimant individually against the general conclusion of the Judge at paragraph 30 of his judgment that “a young person who knows that he or she has been assaulted on a regular basis, who has been buggered, masturbated or fondled in an inappropriate way” has the relevant knowledge and that each of these claimants had it “before they left the community”. </p>

He dealt first with paragraph (a), the length of and reasons for the claimants’ delays.  He accepted that in all the claims there was an inevitable “degree of prejudice” to the defendants and that it increased with the length of the delay, largely because of the difficulty in testing the accuracy of uncorroborated claims so long after the alleged abuse.  He noted the striking similarity of the claimants’ reasons for delay, which he accepted as true and reasonable.  In the cases of proved sexual abuse, it was their acute embarrassment and/or a desire to block the abuse from their minds.  And, in the cases of physical abuse, it was the traumatising nature of the conduct about which they found it very difficult to talk.   He expressed his conclusion under this head by saying:</p>

The second defendants have had to deal with stale claims and have been handicapped by the absence of potentially relevant documents after the warehouse fire.  Nonetheless they have been able to defend these claims through Leading and Junior Counsel; they have called, or required to be called, relevant evidence from people working at the community at the relevant times, and they have chosen not to call others involved.  Mr. Owen QC … has been consistently critical of the fact that the second defendants have suggested to the court that the evidence of individual claimants may be unreliable or may be exaggerated without putting a direct factual challenge to the claimant in cross-examination.  I am not impressed by this criticism, since in my view the second defendants have been faced by the difficulty of meeting stale claims relating to circumstances of which they themselves have no direct knowledge.  They are fully entitled to put the claimants to proof.  This they have done properly and fairly, but notwithstanding their efforts I have been satisfied in each case that each claimant has some proper complaints arising from abusive conduct which he or she suffered at a time of life when what was needed and expected was constructive help and advice.  Instead the claimants were assaulted and abused <span style="font-style:italic">as I have found</span>.  In my view it would be manifestly unjust now to prevent those who prove their claims to the relevant standard from benefiting from those claims because they have lacked the confidence or ability to talk to others at an earlier stage about their very unhappy and embarrassing experiences.  I conclude that this injustice far outweighs the prejudice, which these second defendants have suffered through the late presentation of these claims, and I shall exercise my discretion by disapplying the provisions of section 11 in every case. …” [our emphasis]</p>

The second was that, in assessing the degree of possible prejudice to the defendants, he failed to distinguish or distinguish sufficiently between the three different issues in which it arose or could have arisen, namely: 1) whether the alleged abuse had occurred; 2) whether the first defendant had been negligent in failing to prevent abuse; and 3) causation and attribution of damage.

He also referred in this respect to: the general support that the Judge drew on this issue from the Waterhouse Report; the evidence of former care workers at the Community, Keith Evans, Peter Steen and John Jeffreys; and some documents disclosed by the respondent indicating achievable standards of which the first defendant met at different times, but which, on other evidence, were not met in the case of some claimants.

Why, he asked rhetorically, should a tortfeasor benefit from the proven consequence of his own tort?  As to the cogency of the evidence, he relied on the Judge’s own assertion, in the passage from his judgment that we have set out in paragraph 62 above, of the sufficiency of the evidence before him to enable him to try the various issues fairly.  He spoke of the absence of any indication from the respondent as to what documents might have been available but for the fire and if the claims had been tried earlier.  He acknowledged that the Judge’s reference to the balancing exercise, when he dealt with each individual claim, was exiguous, but relied on his general treatment of the subject at the beginning of the judgment. </p>

Given the width of the discretion, the extent to which the Court can give general guidance on the exercise is limited.  The task for a judge is particularly difficult and various in cases such as this where he has to decide whether he should attempt to determine and evaluate what happened many years before, often on little more than the uncorroborated and uncheckable assertion of a complainant.  Where, as in these appeals, there is a history of pre-care abuse supplemented by a post-care lifestyle each, individually or cumulatively, capable of causing or aggravating psychiatric harm, the further difficulty of determining the fact of injury and its extent and causation is formidable.  The Judge, in granting the respondent permission to appeal on this issue, did so because he regarded it as in the public interest to enable the Court of Appeal to consider what guidance it could properly give on the matter.  </p>

Many claimants, before being taken into care, have had troubled backgrounds, including sexual and/or violent abuse, and arrive in the homes in a highly disturbed state.  And, often, after leaving them, their lives deteriorate into alcohol and drug abuse and crime.  The claimants who bring these appeals are typical of such case histories.  Stripping away legal niceties, the question for the Judge under section 33 was whether, given the delays, he could fairly try claims that the first defendant had culpably failed to improve the claimants’ physical and/or mental condition and/or had culpably caused it to worsen. </p>

The nature of the prejudice either way resulting from delay, and the equity in allowing the matter to proceed, may vary according to the issue.  As we have said, the Judge here had to consider the exercise of his overall discretion in the light of three main issues: first, whether and to what extent each claimant had been abused while at Bryn Alyn; second, whether such abuse resulted from the First Respondent’s negligent failure to prevent it, an issue that required consideration of the standard of care reasonably expected at the time of the alleged abuse; and third, whether and to what extent the claimant had suffered injury attributable to that abuse.</p>

As Parker LJ showed in <span style="font-style:italic">Hartley v. Birmingham City District Council</span> [1992] 213, CA, at 224d-g, such a finding is usually neutral on the balance of prejudice:</p>

The extent to which such flaws affect the outcome of the claim in any individual claim depends: first, on whether the Judge correctly found the claim to have been barred under section 14 so as to engage the exercise of his discretion to disapply the limitation period under that provision at all; and second, whether, if he should have found a later date which would still have barred the claim, it would have still been equitable to exercise his discretion in favour of the claimant. </p>

To the extent that they were a disabling product of that abuse, they might more appropriately call for consideration under section 14 rather than section 33.  His reasoning in this respect also suffered from the flaw, to which we refer again below, of an acceptance of the validity of the claims in advance of determining the issue of limitation.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Third, he did not discriminate between claims where the delay was very long - in some cases in the region of 20 or more years from the end of the abuse – and where the delay was much less.  Clearly, subject to the variables that we have discussed, the longer the delay in any particular case the less justifiable it is likely to be and the more it is likely to prejudice the defendant.  In this connection, Mr. Faulks has drawn attention to the House of Lords’ decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Donovan v. Gwentoys</span> [1990] AC 472. There, the House held that, although section 33(3) did not expressly include delay prior to the expiry of the limitation period as one of the express circumstances to which the court was required to have regard (section 33(3)(b) referring only to the effect on cogency of evidence of delay subsequent to that period), it could nevertheless be a relevant circumstance to which the court should have regard under its general obligation under the provision to have regard to “all the circumstances of the case”.  The circumstances of the case there were a claim in negligence for damages for injury caused by a slip at work when a minor, brought some five years after the alleged accident and five and half months out of time.  No question of a delayed date of knowledge arose, though the bulk of the delay was taken up by minority. The claimant had only notified her employer shortly before the issue of the writ of the alleged accident, and then only inadequately.   And she had an unanswerable claim against her solicitor for negligence in failing to issue the writ in time.  As the speeches of Lord Griffiths and Lord Oliver, with which the other Law Lords agreed, indicated, the circumstances were such that the staleness of the claim and the availability of an alternative remedy made it inequitable to require the defendants to meet the claim.  Clearly, as Lord Oliver remarked, at 479G-480B, the staleness of a claim, regardless of when the limitation period may have expired, is always likely to be a relevant circumstance.  But its weight in the exercise of discretion one way or another under section 33 will depend on all the circumstances of the case of which it forms part, including the length of delay after expiry of the limitation period. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We do not consider it would accord with the broad discretion conferred on the court by section 33 and the fact-sensitive nature of the exercise to suggest some form of tariff for cases such as these.  For example, we could not justify in this context a proposition similar to that of Kilner Brown J. in <span style="font-style:italic">Buck v. English Electric Co. Limited</span> [1977] 1 WLR 806, at 810B-C, drawing on the then pattern of decisions in cases of strike-out for want of prosecution, that where there has been a delay of five or six years there is a rebuttable presumption that the defendant will suffer prejudice.  Although such a presumption might be thought to be more readily applicable in section 33 limitation cases, where the onus was on the claimant, than in strikeouts for want of prosecution, where the onus is on the defendant, it would, in our view, impermissibly cut down the wide discretion in such cases.  For the same reason, we would not go so far as Mr. Faulks in his suggestion that, except where there has been “a fairly minimal period of delay”, the limitation period should not be disapplied.</p>

As Lord Diplock observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Thompson v. Brown</span> in the passage that we have set out, the law has already catered for his delay in starting proceedings that is due to excusable ignorance of material facts as distinct from his knowledge that they may give him a good cause of action in law.   The reason why the Judge was driven to give the claimants’ reasons for delay so much weight under this head may be that in all their cases, he had not, properly identified the date of knowledge of <span style="font-style:italic">significant </span>injury under section 14. </p>

The Judge paid insufficient regard to the effect on the overall cogency of the evidence in each claim of the length of delay on the full range of issues on which he had to consider.  As we have said, these included, not only the fact of the abuse, but also the existence and breach of a duty of care in negligence and the attribution of cause for long-standing psychiatric conditions.  The second involved as great as, or greater difficulties than, the first, given the uncertainty of standards that, on <span style="font-style:italic">Bolam</span> principles, could reasonably have been expected of those employed in children’s homes to guard against child abuse at the material times.  The third would have been difficult enough without the delay. With it, the inherent uncertainties and nebulous nature of psychiatric or psychological complaints as an injury and its aetiology were far more difficult to resolve.  It is noteworthy that that there was more <span style="font-style:italic">prejudicial</span> delay to the defendants in most of these claims than in the evidentially less complicated case of <span style="font-style:italic">Dobbie v.

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It should be remembered that the reason for limitation provisions is to protect defendants from the injustice of having to meet stale claims.  And a judge, when considering whether to disapply under section 33, particularly where, as here, there is difficulty in testing old and unsupported complaints, should not form a concluded view on their validity for the purpose of determining the existence and extent of potential prejudice to claimants of being deprived of a remedy.   Such allegations are so easy to make and so difficult to refute that the danger of injustice is acute.  Here, the Judge had to bear in mind the possibility of them being fabricated or exaggerated for financial gain in the wake of publicity about Bryn Alyn and about other care homes where similar conduct had been alleged.  Yet his findings, both on the substantive issues and the effect of delay on cogency were based mostly on the strength of the claimants’ evidence alone and without rigorous testing by way of cross-examination derived from instructions or contemporaneous records, or of possible contradictory evidence that might have been available if the claims and the trial had been earlier.  It was, as he acknowledged in his opening remarks on the section 33 issue, an inherently difficult task, involving inevitable prejudice to the defendants in attempting to meet uncorroborated claims of this sort so long after the event.   It was doubly difficult because, for one reason or another, most of the claimants were not obviously reliable witnesses. </p>

In that case the respondent was able to produce a witness, Vevar, whose evidence the respondent’s counsel put to good effect to counter the most serious of her allegations.  But, apart from her claim, there was little available evidence to enable the respondent effectively to challenge many of the uncorroborated allegations of the claimants. For example, there were no surviving unit logbooks or matron's logs of which Keith Evans spoke in evidence.  And, as we have indicated, the respondent was severely limited in the availability of persons whom it could interview and, where appropriate, call as witnesses to refute the allegations.  </p>

But the claims against the defendants were in negligence and, whilst Allen and Stanley and their like would probably have been of little assistance in rebutting specific allegations of abuse, more might have been obtained from other former Bryn Alyn employees as to what, at times material to each claim, had been or should have been known of the abuse and what reasonably should and could have been done to prevent it.   On those critical issues, the Judge had little or no direct evidence.  He was driven to relying upon rumours of John Allen’s activities, rumours that the Waterhouse Tribunal had said, at paragraph 21.47, of its Report, “did not amount to a great deal” and which did not appear to have been taken seriously. </p>

However, as Mr. Faulks noted in his submissions, the Waterhouse Tribunal’s conclusions were not reached by applying the civil standard of proof and were, in most instances, highly general in nature, and in some instances, tentative.

But the Judge should have approached its findings with considerable caution when considering the individual allegations in issue in each of these claims.  Moreover, the Waterhouse Report had little or no evidential value in relation to issues of systemic negligence in the only three claims where <span style="font-style:italic">Lister</span> issue arose, namely MCK, JS and CD.

As we have already noted, the Judge’s findings here seem to have been a mix of consideration of this circumstance and a general conclusion on the whole section 33 issue.  But with regard to this circumstance, he was clearly of the view that it was reasonable for all the claimants, irrespective of the nature of abuse they claimed to have suffered or the length of their delay before coming forward, to have delayed as long as they did, before seeking advice.   </p>

As we have said, Mr. Faulks may have over-stated the approach of the Judge in this respect.  But he, Mr. Faulks, rightly drew attention to the considerable difficulties for bodies such as local authorities and children’s homes in defending stale claims by persons many of whom, for whatever reason, may be highly unreliable.  In such cases, as he noted, there is much danger of fabrication and/or exaggeration of evidence which long delay makes it very difficult to identify and refute.  </p>

The heaviness of the burden is well illustrated by the Court of Appeal’s approach in <span style="font-style:italic">Dobbie v. Medway Health Authority</span>. There, the claimant’s delay after the negligent medical treatment of which she complained and her date of knowledge under section 14 shortly after was about 15 years. Despite that lapse of time, most of the salient facts were not in dispute, most of the evidence was documentary and the case could have been tried without prejudice to the health authority.

Sympathetic though anyone reading these papers must be to the plaintiff, it would in my judgment (as in that of the judge) be unfair to require the health authority to face this claim arising out of events which took place so long ago.”</p>

In addition, to the extent that we conclude that claims remain statute-barred, but from a later date of knowledge than that adopted by the Judge, it is necessary in those cases to re-open the exercise of the section 33 discretion in any event.  Although, as the House of Lords have indicated in <span style="font-style:italic">Donovan v. Gwentoys</span>, delay before, as well after, expiry of the limitation period may be relevant to the question of prejudice to a defendant, it is still for consideration in each case what weight should be given to each period of delay when considering discretionary exclusion of the time limit.  Accordingly, we have decided to treat the matter as at large and to consider for ourselves in relation to each claim whether, if we conclude that it remains statute-barred, it would be equitable to disapply the bar.  </p>

There is no anomaly in this, since section 33 is there to provide a third, but discretionary, line of protection in such cases to a claimant who has already had the benefit of his entitlement to the delay permitted by the primary limitation period and of any extension of it under section 14.  It is true, of course, that the section 14 regime may enable a claimant to pursue his claim long after the primary limitation period despite the seriously prejudicial effect of the lapse of time to the defence, but that is a matter of entitlement granted in the light of a claimant’s justifiable ignorance that he has suffered a significant injury attributable to the defendant’s negligent act, not as an exceptional indulgence granted when he has lost that entitlement.</p>

Some might say that late developing psychiatric difficulties of the sort that feature in these claims are capable of causing greater difficulties, both in identifying the section 14 threshold and in determining what, if any, further “extension” would be equitable by way of disapplication under section 33.  But at present they are subject to the same regime as other forms of injury and disease.  And the Law Commission, in its recent report, <span style="font-style:italic">Limitation of Actions,</span> Law Com No 270, has not recommended any special treatment of them (see para. 3.162).  It has also specifically rejected the notion of a long-stop provision of the sort provided for latent damage not relating to personal injuries and in claims under the Consumer Protection Act 1987 (see paras. 3.102-107). </p>

When the Law Reform Committee first recommended that discretion to disapply the limitation period be introduced in personal injury cases, they intended the discretion to apply only to exceptional cases.  However, it has in practice become generally available.  It is arguable that under the regime we recommend this will be unnecessary.  The core regime will relax the definition of the date of knowledge in favour of the claimant, by incorporating a more subjective definition of constructive knowledge.  In addition, the primary limitation period running from the date of knowledge will be the only limitation period applying to personal injury claims.  The claimant will therefore have had three years from the date on which he or she should have discovered the relevant fact, whenever that was, to bring proceedings against the defendant.  Once the time limit has expired, it should only be in the most exceptional cases that the court will be justified in allowing a claimant a more generous time period within which to bring a claim.”</p>

Hesley Hall Limited </span>[2001] 2 WLR 1311, the first defendant would in the circumstances of these claims be vicariously liable for “the torts”, whether deliberate or negligent, of persons whom it had employed to care for the claimants.  In certain of the claims, those of MCK, JS and CD, there is, however, an issue as to what torts were committed by those persons.  The claimants assert that all their causes of action are “for damages for negligence, nuisance or breach of duty … where the damages claimed … consist of or include damages in respect of personal injuries” within section 11 of the 1980 Act.  That is important to them because it is only if the causes of action are within section 11 that there may be postponement of the period of limitation by reference to the date of knowledge as defined in section 14.  Also, it is only in respect of such actions that section 33 may entitle the court to disapply the limitation period. </p>

Accordingly, they maintain that the appropriate period of limitation in such claims is six years, one that is neither postponeable under section 14 nor capable of disapplication under section 33.  The Judge upheld that contention in the three claims in respect of which the issue arose.  In the case of MCK he held that, since the conduct of John Allen of which she complained was deliberate and there was no negligence by any other member of staff in failing to prevent it, her action must fail.  In the case of JS and CD, by a similar process of reasoning, he held that parts of their respective claims were statute-barred.  However, in JS’s case, as we have said, it seems to have been overlooked that she had brought her action within six years of the abuse, the general period for actions in tort permitted by section 2 of the 1980 Act.</p>

The phrase lying in juxtaposition with negligence and nuisance carries with it the implication of a breach of duty of care not to cause personal injury, rather than an obligation not to infringe any legal right of another person.  If I invite a lady to my house one would naturally think of a duty to take care that the house is safe but would one really be thinking of a duty not to rape her?  But, however this may be, the terms in which this Bill was introduced to my mind make it clear beyond peradventure that the intention was to give effect to the Tucker recommendation that the limitation period in respect of trespass to the person was not to be reduced to three years but should remain at six years.  The language of section 2(1) of the Act of 1954 is in my view apt to give effect to that intention, and cases of deliberate assault such as we are concerned with in this case are not actions for breach of duty within section 2(1) of the Act of 1954.”</p>

Williams </span>[1995] PIQR 470<span style="font-style:italic">,</span>CA, though concerned with different conduct by two defendants giving rise to the same personal injury, is a logical application of that reasoning.  There, the plaintiff issued proceedings against her father and mother, alleging physical and sexual abuse against her father and want of parental care against her mother.  The Court of Appeal ruled that the claim against the father, described by Russell LJ as “plainly a claim alleging trespass to the person”, was governed by the six years period of limitation and out of time, but that the claim against the mother, as a claim in negligence, was within section 11 and thus capable of disapplication under section 33.  Two members of the Court, Millett LJ and Sir Ralph Gibson, referred to the anomaly of there being different periods of limitation as between a perpetrator of abuse and someone negligent in not preventing it and of the potential extension of the limitation period for the latter instead of, as the Tucker Committee had intended, a reduction of the period in such cases.  They invited the Law Commission to consider the anomaly.  It has done so, recommending that claims for personal injuries, including those of child abuse, whether in trespass to the person or in negligence, should be subject to the same core regime of an extendable three years limitation period with discretion to disapply; see Law Com 270, paras. 1.5, 3.156, 3.162, 3.169 and Appendix A, Draft Limitation Bill, cls. 1, 2, 12 and 38.  For what it is worth, we warmly commend such a proposal.

Thus, it is necessary, when an issue of limitation arises, to consider whether the factual situation alleged fits the section 11 criteria, whether or not it also fits other criteria entitling the bringing of an action.  If the alleged factual situation does fit the section 11 criteria, the fact that it may also be characterised as another form of tort, say trespass to the person, does not exclude the shorter, but extendable, limitation in section 11 for breach of duty causing personal injury.  For example, in  <span style="font-style:italic">Morris v. C.W.

Their Lordships’ concern was with the closeness of the connection between the employee’s wrongful acts, however characterised as a matter of law, with his job so as to bring his acts within the scope of his employment.  More particularly, the House was concerned with the issue of vicarious responsibility for intentional wrongdoing.  Thus, Lord  Steyn, with whom Lord Hutton agreed, confined himself to the view, at 1320C-D, that the employer was liable for the “torts” of the employee without further analysis of what the torts were.  Lord Clyde said nothing as to the nature of the tort committed by the employee.  Lords Hobhouse and Millett both considered the nature of the tort in respect of which vicarious responsibility was sought, but took different routes to holding that such responsibility was established in respect of a deliberate, i.e. non-negligent act.</p>

Nevertheless, this line of argument may require further consideration.  For example, if the employee was aware of a physical injury sustained by a boy as a result of his conduct, it might be said to be part of his duties to report the fact to his employers.  If that is so, why should the same not be true of psychological damage caused by his sexual abuse of a boy?  In the present case those issues do not need to be decided.

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In our view, the correct approach is as Lord Millet has expressed it.  Whether or not section 11 is in play, it is to identify the wrongful act, deliberate or otherwise, in respect of which vicarious responsibility is claimed and to assess the closeness of its connection to the employment in question.  If the act is sufficiently closely connected with the employment, there is vicarious responsibility.  In such circumstance, and bearing in mind Lord Griffiths’ reasoning in <span style="font-style:italic">Stubbings v. Webb </span>(see paragraph 99 above), there is no justification or need, for the purpose of establishing vicarious responsibility, to elide the duty in respect of which the employee’s deliberate act is a breach with a duty of care delegated or “entrusted” to him by the employer.  The two are quite distinct.  Where section 11 is under consideration, it follows that claims for personal injuries in respect of deliberate conduct, whether considered in the context of vicarious responsibility or not, are not caught by its provisions. Accordingly, in the absence of some provable allegation of systemic negligence of the first defendant, we are of the view that its employees’ deliberate abuse does not fall within section 11 and is, therefore, governed by a non-extendable six years period of limitation rather than an extendable three years period.   We would accordingly uphold the Judge’s finding and ruling to that effect in the case of MCK, JS and CD.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">All the appellants’ pleaded claims were primarily for damages for long-term psychiatric and/or psychological injury, sometimes characterised as post-traumatic stress disorder, and particularised by reference to psychiatric and/or psychological reports.  Those reports in the main dealt with the actual abuse simply as part of the narrative giving rise to the long-term psychiatric damage alleged.  There was little, if any, focus in the evidence of the claimants on any immediate short-term effects of the physical or sexual abuse suffered while they were at Bryn Alyn.  On the contrary, as the Judge indicated in paragraph 28 of this judgment, Mr. Owen argued that none of the claimants had known that any injuries suffered while at Bryn Alyn were “significant” for the purpose of section 14.  There was a similar lack of attention to the immediate effect of the abuse in the initial arguments before this Court. The appellants’ main concern was recovery of adequate damages for the psychiatric or psychological effect on their adult lives and, where applicable, for loss of past and future earnings and cost of therapy.  However, as we have said, on the resumed hearing of the appeal Mr. Owen insisted, and without demur from Mr. Faulks, that the claims had throughout included an element for the abuse itself and its immediate effects.  He maintained that neither the Judge’s nor our initial awards took account of that element, a failure which, for our part, we acknowledge for the reasons we have given.  There is no doubt that awards in cases such as this should take account of the nature, severity and duration of the abuse itself and of its immediate effects, as well as of any long-term psychiatric harm that it may have caused, even though the latter may be the primary motivating and much the more serious injury giving rise to the claim.  As Buxton LJ observed in <span style="font-style:italic">C v. Flintshire County Council</span>, [2001] EWCA Civ 302; [2001] PIQR Q9, at para. 69, where there had been a similar concentration in argument on psychiatric injury at the expense of the actual abuse and its immediate effects, “[f]urther compensation is due for the events themselves”.  This is a matter to which we have had regard in reviewing the adequacy of our initial awards.</p>

The emphasis varies from case to case but in no case have I felt that it would be doing justice to the defendants to condemn them for the whole of the psychiatric injury suffered to date by any claimant.  In several of the cases the evidence drove me to the conclusion that the damage caused by the first defendants formed a significant but small part of the total injury described by the relevant doctors, leading to small awards.  In other cases their treatment at Bryn Alyn was the cause of more substantial damage.  Hence the variation in quantum from case to case.”</p>

(ii) There can be cases where the state of the evidence is such that it is just to recognise each of two separate tortfeasors as having caused the whole of the damage of which the complainant complains; for instance where a passenger is killed as a result of a head on collision between two cars each of which was negligently driven and in one of which he was sitting.  (iii) However in principle the amount of the employer’s liability will be limited to the extent of the contribution which his tortious conduct made to the employee’s disability.  (iv) The court must do the best it can on the evidence to make the apportionment and should not be astute to deny the claimant relief on the basis that he cannot establish with demonstrable accuracy precisely what proportion of his injury is attributable to the defendant’s tortious conduct.

We have asked ourselves whether there is any objection to the ‘workings out’ being disclosed.

Viewed in that light I conclude that it is impossible to say that he was wrong, still less that he was plainly wrong.” </p>

In the other cases the claims both for past and future loss of earnings are advanced in generalised form without significant detail or particularity.  Again I adopt Scott Baker J’s approach.  If a claimant proves on the balance of probability that pre trial he has earned less money than he would have earned if he had not been abused whilst in care of the first defendant; then I have made an award in a round sum to reflect this fact; adopting the broad brush approach approved by the Court of Appeal at paragraph 58 of the Judgment of Ward LJ in the case of Amanda Coxon and Flintshire County Council ….

The beneficial effects of therapy serve to reduce the respondent’s liability in respect of what would otherwise be continuing symptoms.  There is no suggestion that the additional symptoms produced by the abuse at Bryn Alyn can be treated independently from those with a separate cause.  It follows that the individual claimant must undergo the whole course of treatment or pass it up altogether.  On the Judge’s approach, some part of the treatment would have to be funded by the claimant himself, and that to achieve a result that would benefit the defendant.  In our view, once it is established that the Bryn Alyn experience played a significant part in the need for therapy, the whole of the anticipated cost should be recoverable from the defendant unless it can be clearly shown that the treatment is divisible.  </p>

And the respondent cross-appeals the Judge’s exercise of discretion under section 33 to disapply the limitation period.   And, as we have mentioned, his case provides a useful indicator of the Judge’s overall approach on quantum.  He received £35,000 by way of general damages, £10,000 for loss of earnings past and future (to include any handicap in the labour market), and £2,000 towards the cost of psychiatric treatment.  There is little help to be derived from the awards for loss of earnings and therapy.  But it seems to us that, being unapportioned, the award for general damages must have served the Judge as a benchmark or guide in all the other cases.  For that reason it may help to see how, in this instance, he approached the relatively straightforward task of assessing general damages.</p>

In summary they agree that Mr KR suffers from a mental illness, namely post traumatic stress disorder, which was caused by his experiences in care within the Bryn Alyn Community.  They agree that Mr Rowlands has adjusted to some extent to this disorder, but he continues to have significant symptoms and the disorder has affected and continues to affect his relationships with other people, his choices of employment and his mental state.  They agree that the appropriate treatment for this illness is a combination of anti-depressant medication and psychotherapeutic intervention by way of cognitive therapy.  There are risks that such intervention might worsen the claimant’s symptoms, but both agree that it is worthwhile as it is likely to help the claimant cope with his disorder in a practical fashion.”</p>

He made plain that, as to the sexual abuse, there had been no penetration or identifiable physical injury.  He mentioned that, much later in 1993, he had sought his social security records, but made clear that he had not by then considered the possible impact on him of the abuse, that is, of the insidious development of long-term psychiatric injury.  The Judge’s nearest reference to the issue in his individual treatment of the claim was that “[he had] known of the personal injury suffered since 1975 (although not the full extent of it)” and that it was not until July 1999 when he saw Dr. Holloway that he was able to talk about the abuse and only then that he realised the full impact of it on him.  We say “nearest reference” to these section 14 factors because the Judge made them in the context of the following justification for his decision under section 33 to disapply the limitation period:</p>

In my view it is not surprising that the claimant was unable to talk to anyone about his abusive experiences until July 1999 when he saw Dr. Holloway.  Such abuse is both humiliating and debilitating.  The claimant became withdrawn and, in the early years after his discharge from Bryn Alyn, angry.  During this angry period he committed some crimes as a result of which he was sent to a detention centre and to Borstal.  He is not entitled to any compensation for his own criminal conduct; but he has lived with the memory of his two unhappy years at Bryn Alyn over the past 25 years.  His day to day life has been adversely affected. He became concerned about his sexuality.  He was not able to tell either his wife or his subsequent partner of 7 years about his experiences of abuse.  He suffers flashbacks and intense psychological distress when exposed to external cues that resemble an aspect of the traumatic event.  He experiences persistent symptoms of increased arousal including sleep difficulties, difficulty in concentrating and an exaggerated startled response.  Initially the claimant coped with his difficulties by going away or by getting drunk.  He tried not to think about his experiences.  He wrote his experiences down.  Eventually in July, 1999 he reached the conclusion that the best way to deal with his problems was to face them head on. …. In the circumstances and for the reasons previously explained I deem it equitable to disapply section 11 …” </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As we have said, the Judge’s general treatment of the section 14 issue and his blanket application of it to all the claimants was wrong in that he confused their awareness at the time of the physical and other impact on them of the abuse with knowledge of its significance as an injury for the purpose of the time bar test in section 14.  Accordingly, we feel bound to regard the issue as at large and to consider for ourselves in the light of the uncontradicted evidence before the Judge whether he could properly be satisfied that KR had the requisite statutory knowledge at any time before 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 1996, the start of the three years period before the issue of the writ.   </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In our view, given the nature, length and dates of the abuse involved in this claim and the claimant’s and medical evidence on the issue, he cannot have known before that time that the injury he had sustained was significant in the statutory sense.  The two years period of sexual and physical abuse, though unpleasant and, in the long term, damaging, was not of such a degree as in the early 1970s or 1980s would have been regarded as significant in that sense by a claimant of his age, experience and circumstances, bearing in mind especially the observations of all three members of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Stubbings v. Webb</span> (see paras. 36, 43 and 44 above).  Thereafter, regard must also be had to the disabling long-term effect of the abuse which, on the undisputed evidence here, caused him to put it and its effect on him to the back of this mind, thus effectively perpetuating the reasonableness of his failure to appreciate the statutory significance of what had happened to him. The fact that he sought his social security records in 1993 is not, in itself, sufficient in the circumstances to indicate a statutory awareness by that time or at any time before he saw Dr. Holloway in July 1999.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It follows that, in our view, there was no occasion for the Judge to consider the exercise of his discretion under section 33.  Much of the Judge’s reasoning on that issue, as we have indicated, would have been more apt in the particular circumstances, to his determination of the date of knowledge for the purpose of section 14.  If, contrary to our finding that the date of knowledge was, as the Judge implicitly found, before September 1979, that is, the end of the three years period after majority and nearly twenty years before the issue of proceedings, we would have found it difficult to exercise discretion in the claimant’s favour.  Even allowing for some “blocking” effect of the abuse so as to prevent his appreciation of “another” significant injury in the form of long-term psychiatric injury, the sheer length of delay in such a case would, in our view, make it inequitable to allow the matter to proceed.  First, the period of delay, whether based on the total period of delay from the end of the abuse – 24 years - or on the Judge’s implicit assessment of the date of knowledge – 20 years, was very long.  Second, the effect of that delay was bound, given the source and nature of the allegations, to have had a serious effect on his ability properly to assess the cogency of the claimant’s evidence, given the absence of other evidential support for it and the lack of contemporaneous documents or witnesses by which to test and/or contradict it.  In our view, given the Judge’s finding as to section 14, it would have been inequitable to require the respondent, by disapplication of the limitation period under section 33, to meet such a stale claim.   However, as, in our view, the Judge was wrong in his ruling under section 14, unfairness or inequity in proceeding so long after the event does not come into it; the claimant is entitled to proceed with the claim – a comment equally applicable to most of the other claims. </p>

There is no doubt that even before going to Bryn Alyn DK had been a difficult child.  He was, as found by the Judge, over anxious, wilful, assertive, and egotistical.  At times he could appear vulnerable and it was noted that he had “a depth of awareness and sensitivity” unusual in a child of his age.  At a previous assessment centre he had been described as a “bright, personable child, indefatigable in his pursuit of knowledge, friendship, trust, affection and any other stimulatory experience he can gather”.  It had also been noted that he could not handle “any ambivalence on the part of authority”.  The Judge found that “the child, who arrived in the Bryn Alyn Community in the summer of 1979 aged fourteen, was clearly a child who needed specialist care and understanding from adults experienced in dealing with problem cases and who would undoubtedly test the patience of adults to the limit from time to time”.</p>

Sadly, his handling was far from appropriate.  Throughout his three years there he suffered physical violence at the hands of members of staff and of older children under the ‘Top Dog’ system which had been promoted by those running the Community in order to enforce discipline.

He suffered in this way because of faults in the system which were operated in the Community, in which the safety and wellbeing of some of the residents were neglected on a regular basis.”</p>

In cross-examination, in response to a question of what he had thought at the time about the abuse, he indicated that he simply had not thought about it. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to section 14, the Judge held that the claimant had known from 1982 when he left Bryn Alyn at the age of about 17 that he had suffered significant injury attributable to his physical ill-treatment there.  He concluded, therefore, that he could not rely on that provision to extend the limitation period since the claimant did not issue proceedings until July 1999 shortly after contact with the police, consulting a solicitor and receipt of medical advice in about 1997 or 1998.  As to section 33, the Judge found that, as the claimant had not wanted to remember his experiences and had done his best to block his unhappy memories from his mind for many years, it was equitable to disapply the limitation period.</p>

In our view, the physical abuse the claimant suffered from staff and older children at Bryn Alyn over three years, though serious in itself, and painful and distressing, would not have been such that by February 1986, that is, within three years after the expiry of his extended limitation period, he would reasonably have considered it sufficiently serious to justify proceedings.  In so concluding we bear in mind the character and circumstances of the claimant, the nature of the abuse and the period of time in which it occurred, applying the approach of all members of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Stubbings v. Webb</span>, which we have set out in paragraphs 36, 43 and 44 above. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It follows that, in our view, there was again no occasion for the Judge to consider the exercise of his discretion under section 33.  His reasoning on that issue, as in the case of Kenneth Rowands, would have been more apt in the particular circumstances to his determination of the date of knowledge for the purpose of section 14.  If, contrary to our finding, the date of knowledge was, as the Judge implicitly ruled, before February 1986, that is, over 13 years before the issue of proceedings in July 1999, we would have found it difficult to exercise discretion in the claimant’s favour.  By then the delay from the most recent of the conduct of which he complained was some 17 years.  To the extent that the Judge took into account, in addition to the claimant’s reason for delay, any other relevant circumstance, his reasoning is no doubt to be found in his general approach to the exercise of the discretion under section 33.  For the reasons we have given, that approach was defective. And, in its application to this claim, we are of the view that it led to a plainly inequitable result in section 33 terms.  First, the period of delay, whether based on the total period of delay from the end of the abuse – 17 years - or on the Judge’s implicit assessment of the date of knowledge – over 13 years – meant that the claim was very stale.   Second, the effect of that delay was bound, given the source and nature of the allegations, to have had a serious effect on his ability properly to assess the cogency of the claimant’s evidence of the “top dog” regime as it affected him, although there was some general support for his claims in the evidence of another claimant, CGE, and of one of the care workers, Dafydd Vevar. </p>

Both doctors agreed that he was suffering from a personality disorder that involved mood swings, and further that periodically he suffered from depression.  In Dr Holloway’s words it is “a recurrent major depressive disorder”.  The doctors were not in agreement, however, as to the extent to which his experiences at Bryn Alyn had contributed to his current condition.  Dr Holloway considered the Bryn Alyn experience to have been a significant factor, whereas Dr Carnwath suggested that the major cause had been the preceding unhappy upbringing.  On that issue the Judge preferred the evidence of Dr Holloway.  And from the extracts from his judgment that we have cited it is plain that he was  aware that he had to compare the way in which DK has turned out with how he would have been if had he not been let down by the Bryn Alyn staff.  </p>

We have set out his approach to claims in this category in paragraph 135 of our judgment. He awarded approximately two-thirds of the amount claimed for therapy.  Although we shall conclude that the whole sum claimed for therapy was recoverable, we infer that the Judge intended to apply the same ratio to general damages.  That would suggest that he had in mind £35,000 for the long-term personality disorder but for the pre Bryn Alyn difficulties.  If that is so, we do not disagree with his quantification.  However, we consider that the figure is insufficient to the extent that it does not appear to include an unapportioned element for the pain and suffering caused by the serious violence to which he was subjected for three years.  We would increase the award of general damages by £10,000 to reflect that injury, so as to increase the total award under this head to £35,000.</p>

The Judge awarded £3,000 and £2,500 respectively.  By the same reasoning that we applied in the appeal against the general damages award, we would have been minded to hold that he was entitled to two-thirds of any loss of earnings, which could be proved.  The difficulty for the Judge was, and is for us, that there was no firm evidence from which to reach a figure for past loss of earnings, let alone a sum for any likely losses in the future.  The Judge noted that the claimant preferred to be self-employed and that he had a reasonable record of such employment in the past and sensible plans for the future.  He noted that his drug and binge drinking habit might have had an adverse effect upon his ability to hold down a job.  Such was the somewhat tenuous basis for the Judge’s figures.  On the evidence available, it is our view that the claimant was fortunate to receive anything at all for loss of earnings.  For that reason and in the absence of any cross-appeal we leave the award undisturbed.  </p>

His treatment during that time is described by Connell J at paragraph 54 of his judgment.  It is essentially the claimant’s account, which the Judge was later to accept.  In his first week at Cotsbrook he was assaulted by a member of staff, Jeff Davies, because he had refused to pick up some rubbish.  Davis punched him in the stomach.  He received similar treatment from other members of staff and other residents.  The assaults included hair pulling, punching and kicking.  He was beaten up by a judo expert called Smyth and assaulted by Russell Mensah, a member of staff, whilst on a camping holiday.  This last was perhaps the worst act of violence; Mensah dragged him out of his tent and repeatedly punched him to the ground.  </p>

The early manifestations of his personality difficulties were likely present prior to being received into care at Bryn Alyn.

He made a statement to the police in 1993 about the assault by Russell Mensah and also a claim to the Criminal Injuries Board in respect of it, but his evidence was that he did not know at that time of the development of his personality disorder.  In his case also, part of the long-term disabling effect of the abuse on his personality and appreciation of what had happened to him, was, on the Judge’s finding, an inability to face up to it and to discuss it with others.  It was not until 1998 or 1999 that he first consulted a solicitor and was seen by Dr. Rowan about his condition, and it is at about then that we consider he first learned of the significance of his injury in a section 14 sense.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First of all, without apportionment it seems to us that the general damages figure should not have been less than £35,000.  Although neither doctor spoke in terms of percentages it is clear that both considered that the Bryn Alyn mistreatment made a material contribution, as the Judge seems to have recognised in awarding more than half the therapy costs. We consider that CGE’s claim for psychological injury is worth slightly less than that of DK.  He too had been a badly damaged child before his arrival at Bryn Alyn; his period of subjection to physical violence there was slightly longer – some three and half years, but the degree of violence, apart from one major assault, was slightly less; and he too should be compensated for the pain and suffering caused by and at the time of the abuse, an element to which the Judge, no doubt because of the concentration at trial on its psychological damage to the claimant, seems to have overlooked.  In our view, £20,000 is the least sum that should have been awarded as an apportioned sum for the pain and suffering and loss of amenity due to long-term personality disorder resulting from the abuse.  To it should be added a further sum of £9,000 for the immediate pain and suffering caused by the abuse.  </p>

The Judge attributed his failure to hold down a job in part to his criminal record and in part to his dependence on drink and drugs.  But his dependence on drink and drugs was the result, in part at any rate, of the treatment he had received at the hands of the first defendant.   We think that it would not be over generous to award him the equivalent of two years purchase for past loss and one year for the future, namely a total of £30,000.  That, as it happens, would be about the amount claimed at trial on the basis that he was never likely to earn more than £10,000 per annum.  Again we consider that the whole of the cost of treatment, namely £1,800, is recoverable.  </p>

She was 28 at the date of trial.  Even before being admitted to Bryn Alyn, her life had been unsettled and troubled.  She was one of seven children.  Her mother had left home when she was aged about three and her father was unable to cope with the family responsibilities.  She was moved between relations and various foster parents, ending up in care at Nazareth House, Lancaster together with three of her sisters.  Whilst there she was regularly assaulted and claims to have been sexually abused by a nun.  She was then sent to Milverton Court in Shropshire where she was assaulted by other residents and staff.  By this time she was becoming extremely difficult and had threatened one girl with a knife and attempted to throttle another.  She had also caused extensive damage to the home and had been involved in assaulting a staff member.  So this was a very badly disturbed young woman when first admitted to Bryn Alyn, even though an educational psychologist had described her as “a raw, ill-developed child still desperately striving for a strong parental relationship” and as having “considerable emotional warmth in her character and no sign of the usual neurotic symptoms”.  He also described her as being “socially responsive” and “concerned for the troubles of others”.  The Judge described her as “a very needy fifteen year old.”</p>

As Mr. Owen has submitted, she had had a long and significant history of psychiatric trouble.  A particular issue in her case was one of attribution of cause for her present condition, one on which could not reasonably have been expected to acquire the requisite knowledge without the assistance of expert advice. It is reasonable to conclude from the evidence that it was only about then that she would have appreciated the significance and partial attribution of the injury resulting from the abuse, namely the exacerbation of her already serious psychiatric condition.   </p>

First, although the period of delay was long – some nine years after the last abuse and five years after the expiry of the limitation period – it was significantly shorter than that of some of the other claims.  Second, although her account was unsupported, there was some documentation in evidence covering the earlier part of her period at Bryn Alyn by which it could be, and was, tested.  Third, her difficulty in bringing herself to relive the unhappy experience of her abuse at Bryn Alyn, would, as the Judge considered, be a relevant circumstance in considering the exercise of discretion under section 33.  </p>

However, she does appeal the award of £5,000 for general damages.  Whilst Mr Owen did not quarrel with the Judge’s summary of the evidence, he complained about the amount of the award in two respects: first, that the Judge failed sufficiently to attribute her psychological difficulties to the abuse; and second, that he took no account of the physical abuse suffered over a period of nearly two years.  As in all the other claims, the focus of the claim before the Judge had been on the long-term psychological condition from which she had suffered for up to two years. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In our view, but for the difficulties of attribution, RM would have been entitled to compensation for her psychological symptoms by a sum in the region of £50,000.  Even allowing that her experiences at Bryn Alyn did no more than “exacerbate her disorders” and contribute to the development of “panic disorder”, we would find it difficult to justify an award of less than £15,000 for a serious condition from which, on the medical evidence, she had a poor chance of recovery and also for the physical violence to which she was increasingly subjected during her two years at Bryn Alyn.   Consequently, we allow RM’s appeal to the extent of substituting that global sum for the Judge’s award of £5,000 for general damages. </p>

He spent various periods in foster homes and in homes and assessment centres run by Flintshire County Council.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, his own behaviour deteriorated.

The Judge also referred to witness statements about the acts of assault on him that he had made to the police in 1992 and 1993, copies of which were in evidence.

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As in the case of RM, despite GS’s early complaints about physical abuse at Bryn Alyn, we consider that the Judge wrongly held that he had the requisite knowledge early enough to put his claim out of time, that is, one including damages for long-term psychiatric injury to which the abuse there had partly contributed. He undoubtedly had been aware of the violence and its effects on him at the time.  But, in our view, the evidence does not support a finding that he knew that they constituted significant injury in a section 14(2) sense, notwithstanding that they could have justified an award of damages standing on their own.  Given his extremely difficult past before admission to Bryn Alyn, his own proclivity to violence, making him, as the Judge said, difficult to control and provoking incidents of violence against him, and his subsequent heavy drug abuse and criminal tendencies, it is fanciful to consider that he could have satisfied the section 14(2) test of knowledge of significant injury by the time he left Bryn Alyn or for many years thereafter.  On his own uncontradicted evidence, which the Judge accepted, he had only realised in 1999, shortly before commencing proceedings, that his psychiatric symptoms could be related to the violence the subject matter of his claim.  It was about that time that he first instructed solicitors and saw Dr. Veasey. </p>

First, the period of overall delay from the last abuse and that from the expiry of the limitation period - about ten and five years respectively - is similar to that in the case of RM.  Second, although, his account was largely unsupported, there was evidence from one of the care workers, Peter Steen, challenging some of his allegations.  There was also some documentation in evidence covering his period of stay in Bryn Alyn against which his account could be, and was, tested.   The Judge clearly took account of such material when rejecting some of his allegations and in determining how much of his later difficulties were attributable to his time at the Community.  Finally, there are the claimant’s explanation of his delay in following up his provision of witness statements to the police in 1992 and 1993, namely that he did not think he would be believed, and the Judge’s finding that he, in common to all the claimants, was reluctant to re-open unhappy memories.  Such matters, though possibly not relevant in the particular circumstances of his case to section 14 postponement, are nevertheless capable of being a relevant circumstance for the purpose of section 33. </p>

Both doctors agreed that one significant, though not major, factor in bringing about his present difficulties was the physical abuse suffered as an adolescent.  Neither could see formal treatment bringing about any marked improvement. Because of some early positive indications Dr Veasey thought there would have been a good chance that most of the unfortunate effects would have been avoided given appropriate treatment by the first defendant.

Given his background there must often have been a need for those who had charge of him to defend themselves.  On the other hand the regime which prevailed at Gatewen was not appropriate to the needs of the claimant when he was placed there.  Violence should not have been used upon him to the extent and with the frequency that I am satisfied that it was so used.  Peter Steen admitted to the Waterhouse Enquiry that he did lose his temper from time to time and he agreed to a complete lack of professional training.  In my view the description by the claimant of assaults upon him by Steen is likely to be true in part, albeit that I accept that the regularity alleged was exaggerated. …</p>

We propose to substitute an award of £12,000 for general damages to reflect both those considerations.   To that extent we allow the appeal.</p>

The problem with this submission is that, as described by the claimant, the assaults occurred when she went to John Allen’s office for a legitimate purpose.  She was alone with him at the time.  In my view it cannot be argued that other employees were negligent in allowing a resident at Bryn Alyn to visit the principal in his office.  The claimant does not suggest any distress on her part after these assaults, nor does she suggest that she made any complaint to any other member of staff.  Even if the proclivities of John Allen ought to have been suspected by a properly trained social worker or residential care worker, in my view it is asking too much of the defendants to expect other staff members to monitor every visit by a resident to the principal in his office in an attempt to ensure that no secret act such as sexual abuse might take place.  Accordingly, the claim based on negligence must fail.”</p>

He referred, in particular, to the claims of KR, DJ, KJM and DHM, all of whom had been placed at Bryn Alyn before MCK.  In such circumstances, submitted Mr. Owen, the Judge should have found that Allen’s proclivities were either known to or could reasonably have been suspected by properly trained staff, and that the first defendant and its staff ought not to have allowed Allen anywhere near the children in its homes by the time of her placement there. Mr. Faulks spent little, if any time, responding to this part of MCK’s challenge, relying, so far as we could tell, on the Judge’s reasoning and on his entitlement, notwithstanding his general observations early in his judgment, to look at each individual claim on its own facts. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In our view, it would be wrong to construe the general observations of the Judge in paragraph 19 of his judgment as effectively fixing the first defendant with liability in negligence in respect of every deliberately abusive act of Allen.   It is plain that the Judge, in his individual treatment of the claims, was alive to the distinction between conduct of which the first defendant was or ought reasonably to have been aware and conduct, which by reason of the particular circumstances and where - even if there had been an adequate system by the standards of the time - other employees may not have been put on notice.   Here, the Judge was plainly influenced by the particular circumstances of the assaults on MCK over about six months when she visited his office for a legitimate purpose and was with him there alone for a short time, and in respect of which she exhibited no distress and made no complaint.   And, as the Judge indicated, in the passage we have set out, it would be a counsel of perfection for those who did or should have known of his proclivities to monitor every ostensibly legitimate visit by a child to his office.  For those reasons, we consider that the Judge, with the breadth of experience given to him in assessing the evidence overall about the workings of the Bryn Alyn Community and the differing individual claims, was best placed to draw the line where he did.  We would not disturb his dismissal of the claim in negligence on this account.</p>

Whatever his intention, it is plain that this claimant did not, on his own summary of the evidence that he accepted, suffer any physical injury or short-term psychological hurt from Allen’s treatment of her.  Accordingly, we consider that he wrongly concluded that her date of knowledge would have preceded the period of three years immediately before she brought her claim.  In our view, if she had had a case in negligence, her date of knowledge would not have arisen until about 1997 and well within three years of her institution of proceedings in July 1999.  If we were wrong about that, we would have difficulty, on the basis of the Judge’s implicit finding that her date of knowledge must have coincided with the sexual abuse in 1983, in agreeing with him that this would be a suitable case for disapplication under section 33. Such an approach would have required to defendants to meet a 16 years old claim as well as being some ten years out of time.  It would also have attracted the other difficulties to which we have referred in other claims.

It is to that, we believe, the judge referred when he said “although she has no identifiable psychiatric disorder she has been damaged in a material sense by these experiences”.  However, she has managed to avoid psychological damage and we consider that the most that she could have expected by way of damages at this stage would be a sum in the region of £7,000, taking into account as well the effect on her at the time of the sexual indecency. </p>

The fact that he was Allen’s favourite did not protect him from suffering violence at the hands of others.

More accurately, in our view, on the evidence before the Judge as to the nature and circumstances of the claimant, the manner of the abuse and the time at which it occurred, he would not have reasonably considered that the abuse, despite its seriousness, would justify the institution of proceedings. The Judge’s distinction in saying that he did not know “the extent of the damage” until much later does not engage the meaning in section 14(1)(a) and (2) of the “significance” of the injury, as explained by Bingham LJ, as he then was, in <span style="font-style:italic">Stubbings v. Webb</span>, in the passage that we have set out in paragraph 36 above.  Even allowing for the seriousness of the abuse alleged, the Judge’s approach also overlooks the fact that such test has to be applied to conduct taking place in a wholly different climate of public opinion and attitudes over twenty years ago.  And it is plain from the Judge’s remarks and assessment of damages further on his judgment, at paragraph 97, that the only “extent” of damage which he had in mind was lately developed post traumatic stress disorder:</p>

The doctors agree that his tendency to lose control when in temper has been precipitated by his experiences of racial abuse as a child and his experiences of sexual and physical abuse at Bryn Alyn.  Having seen the claimant in the witness box over half a day, I conclude that he is likely to mature further and to overcome his difficulties as time proceeds, getting on with his life in a more constructive way than hitherto.  I take the view that he had in essence blocked out his memories of abuse between 1981 when he left Bryn Alyn and 1996/7 when he learned of the Waterhouse Inquiry.  <span style="font-style:italic">His suffering as a result of the Bryn Alyn experiences in that period of time was not such in my view as to merit compensation.</span>  He has however suffered significantly over 4 ½ years now and he will suffer on a reducing scale as time goes on.

And, in its application to this claim, we are of the view that it would have led to a plainly inequitable result in section 33 terms. First, the period of delay was very long.  This is an important circumstance given the purpose of section 33 to protect defendants from stale claims, however strong or weak they may seem when limitation is being considered.  As we have said, a judge may walk on uncertain ground when he determines the critical facts in an action and then relies on that determination to vouch for the safety and fairness of embarking on the trial at all.  In this case the effect of the delay was bound to have had a serious effect on the Judge’s ability properly to assess the cogency of DJ’ evidence as a whole.  The lack of other evidential support and of contemporaneous documents or witnesses by which to test and/or contradict his evidence was aggravated because of his potential unreliability, having had a number of convictions for dishonesty and a history of prolonged use of illicit drugs and alcohol abuse.   In our view, it would have been unfair on the defendants to require them, by disapplication under section 33, to meet such a claim arising out of events so long before. </p>

However, it looks as if the Judge, in fixing on that figure for the post 1996/97 suffering, has not included any allowance for the fact and effect on the claimant of the abuse at the time or for some consequential psychiatric problems in the intervening period from 1981 to 1996/97 mentioned in the agreed medical reports. Given the length and great seriousness of the abuse itself, particularly in the prolonged period of “grooming” and buggery to which he was subjected, we consider that a global sum for general damages of £50,000 would be appropriate.  And, for reasons that we have already given in our general observations on the Judge’s awards of the costs of therapy, we consider that he is entitled to recover the whole cost of therapy, namely £2,520. </p>

His case on limitation is that he has not been concerned to obtain compensation for the abuse suffered, but has preferred to avoid recalling matters which cause him pain.

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For the reasons we have given earlier in this judgment and on the available evidence in this claim, we are of the view that the Judge wrongly concluded that KJM had knowledge of significant injury for the purpose of section 14 on leaving the Community in 1975.  In our view, in the light of the evidence, any injury from the serious sexual abuse to which he was subjected at Bryn Alyn, though serious and distressing, was not of significance to him within the meaning of that provision at so early a stage or even by the end of the primary limitation period in December 1980.  Its significance and attributability to the abuse could possibly have become apparent to him in discussions with his probation officer in about 1992 at the earliest, leading to his giving evidence against Allen in criminal proceedings and claiming compensation from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board in 1995.  However, either of those dates would have been too early to bring his July 1999 claim within time. It appears from the claimant’s evidence, unchallenged and uncontradicted on this point, that his state of mind in 1992 and 1995 was of some uncertainty, particularly as to attributability - simply that his continuing difficulties might be sufficiently serious to warrant proceedings and might be attributable to the abuse.  It certainly fell short of a firm belief that that was so.  As Mr. Owen submitted, such an ambivalent state of mind, even if it had amounted to an unreasonable failure to consider his condition sufficiently serious to warrant proceedings for damages, would not have sufficed if he did not also have a firm belief in its attributability to the abuse while in the care of the first defendant; see dicta of this Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Spargo v. North Essex District Health Authority</span> [1997] PIQR 235, at P242 and<span style="font-style:italic"> Roberts v. Winbow</span> [1999] PIQR P77, at P88.  The Judge, having found and erred in the way he did as to the claimant’s section 14 knowledge at the time of the abuse, cannot have intended to make a repeat finding in respect of the 1992 or 1995 matters, and on the evidence, as it stood, would not have been justified in doing so.  In our view, he should have concluded from the evidence that the claimant’s date of knowledge was much later, probably in 1999 when he first instructed solicitors to investigate his claim and/or was seen by the psychiatrist, Dr. de Taranto. </p>

In its application to this claim, it would have led to a plainly inequitable result.  First, the period of delay, based on the Judge’s assessment of the date of knowledge as 1975 was extremely long - over 24 years from the last abuse and over 18 years from the expiry of the limitation period.  Second, the effect of the delay was bound to have had a serious effect on the Judge’s ability properly to assess the cogency of the claimant’s evidence. The lack of other evidential support and of contemporaneous documents about matters in issue over 24 years before by which to test and/or contradict his evidence was aggravated by his potential unreliability.  He had been described in reports as “a chronic liar and manipulative”, had numerous convictions for dishonesty and had a long history of use of drug and alcohol abuse. </p>

As we have already observed, the House of Lords did not have to consider in that case, an extension of the limitation period because of a delayed date of knowledge and there is nothing in the speeches of their Lordships to exclude regard to such a circumstance.  However, the weight to be given to it in the final balance of circumstances in each case is another matter.  Here, given the great length of the delay after the abuse itself and the problems that it created for the defendants, we would have given it less weight than in other cases of shorter overall delay. </p>

He was satisfied that the claimant continued to have unpleasant memories of that abuse and that he would continue to suffer from those unpleasant memories “although it … [might] be possible to minimise their effect to some extent by psychotherapy”.

What the Judge had to decide, however, was the extent, if any, to which the Bryn Alyn experience had contributed to those symptoms.  Looking at the effect of the abuse by Muir and disregarding the indecent assault by Bates, he concluded, at paragraph 126 of his judgment:</p>

However, Mr Owen submitted that some adjustment is necessary beyond the inevitable uplift for that incident.

Since we accept the Judge’s general approach to apportionment, we consider that the proper award for general damages should be £28,000, taking also into account the proven abuse itself.  We accept his conclusion with regard to the claim for loss of earnings and accordingly the appeal of JS will be allowed to the extent that we substitute the sum of £28,000 by way of general damages.</p>

He never knew his father, and his mother, a drunk, entirely neglected her maternal duties.  She had a succession of male friends or co-habitees who were frequently violent towards her.  Often enough GOM became involved in the violence out of a wish to protect his mother.  At the age of eight he was made a ward of court and went to live with his grandmother.  He and she did not get on and in March 1983 he was committed to the care of the local authority.  He had already got himself into trouble over “joy-riding”.  Whilst with the local authority he had a history of absconding from his placements and playing truant from school.  He was described in one report as “being resentful towards authority and surly and argumentative”.  It was thought that he needed firm control.  An educational psychologist considered that he had developed a non-trusting attitude towards adults and authority figures, and that should surprise no one.  The same psychologist suggested a placement in a secure and long-term base where the adults in charge would be able to accept his difficulties and develop his trust.  So he was sent to one of the homes within the Bryn Alyn Community, Pentre Saeson, where the man in charge was Ken Taylor.  </p>

The delay from the expiry of the primary limitation period was just over eight years.

He was asked specifically if he had been the victim of anal intercourse to which he replied Allen was “getting around to it but I told him no.”  He realised that this abuse was wrong but he did not tell anyone about it until 1996.  This was because he was ashamed of these events, and because he was warned by John Allen that if he told anyone, then he would be straight back to the secure unit at Rose Hill.  Eventually in 1996 a solicitor who was representing him in a criminal matter asked him whether had been at the Bryn Alyn Community, and whether he had been abused.

The situation therefore in this case is that the claimant made no complaint of any abuse at all until 10 years after the event; and a further 5 years elapsed before he made any allegation of buggery.  In these circumstances the court must look carefully at his evidence when asking whether or not the abuse alleged is proved to the requisite standard.  In my view it is not surprising that a young man is slow to reveal sexual abuse in which he has been a participant over a significant period of time, particularly when his participation has produced financial reward.  Further in my view it is significant that the allegation of buggery emerged during an interview with the doctor at which the claimant’s drug counsellor was present.  The claimant had built up a trusting relationship with that counsellor and in those circumstances in my view it became more possible for him to tell the full story.  Dr Staley observed that the claimant was very emotional and embarrassed as he described the events relied upon.  I observed the same characteristics in the claimant when he gave his oral evidence to the court, and he impressed me as a witness who was doing his best to recall events which he had attempted over a number of preceding years to dismiss from his mind.  I realise, of course, that this is a notoriously difficult field in which to reach conclusions as to truth; but I am satisfied, particularly bearing in mind what I have heard about John Allen throughout this hearing, that the sexual abuse alleged by GOM including the buggery, is proved to the requisite standard.”</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In our view, the sexual abuse suffered by GOM at Bryn Alyn, though serious and of over two years duration, is unlikely to have been of significance to him at the time or for many years after within the meaning of that word in section 14(2).  The sexual abuse, though of great frequency and gravity, was not itself secured by or accompanied with violence or threats of violence, but by bribery.  Its effect on the claimant at the time was one of confusion and shame, such that he felt unable to, and did not resist or complain about Allen’s conduct.  And the separate and more generalised physical abuse by members of the staff was certainly not the stuff of which a boy of his background and circumstances at the time would have realistically considered civil proceedings for damages.  The effects of the abuse, particularly of the sexual abuse by Allen only became of significance in a section 14 sense much later when he first began to face up to its after-effects.  For the reasons we have given earlier in this judgment, the Judge’s general approach to the meaning of knowledge of significant injury in this context was defective and led him to error in his finding of an early date of knowledge in this case.   On the claimant’s unchallenged and uncontradicted evidence on the point, although he may have known at the time or shortly after the abuse that it was “wrong”, it was not until late 1996 or 1997, shortly after the severe depressive illness had begun to manifest itself in 1996, and when prompted by his disclosure of the matter to the Waterhouse Inquiry, that he reasonably began to focus on the significance of what the abuse had done to him.  In the meantime, as Mr. Owen noted, albeit in the context of the Judge’s exercise of discretion under section 33, the claimant had “blocked out” the abuse at Bryn Alyn and had resorted to drug abuse. In our view, on the evidence, he did not have the relevant knowledge before late 1996 or 1997, that is, within three years before issue of proceedings. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the Judge’s exercise of section 33 discretion in favour of the claimant, predicated on his section 14 finding, we are of the view that it would have led to a plainly inequitable result.  First, the period of delay, based on the Judge’s assessment of the date of knowledge, was long – over 13 years from the last of the abuse complained of and over 8 years from the expiry of the limitation period.  Second, the effect of the delay was bound to have had a serious effect on the Judge’s ability properly to assess the cogency of the claimant’s evidence, particularly in this “notoriously difficult field in which to reach conclusions as to truth” as he put it.  Although, there was some contemporaneous Bryn Alyn documentation available, it did not amount to very much; and there was the usual lack of evidential support for the claimant’s evidence or by reference to which it could be tested.  As in other cases, he was potentially a highly unreliable witness, having had numerous convictions for dishonesty and a long history of drug and alcohol abuse.  This may be offset in part by evidence of other similar behaviour of Allen, to which the Judge referred.  However, we are of the view, given his finding as to section 14, that it would have been unfair on the defendants to require them by disapplication under section 33, to meet such a claim arising out of events so long before. Even if the claimant’s date of knowledge was early enough in 1996 to be just more than three years before his issue of proceedings in July 1999, the consequence that the delay beyond the limitation period would have been minimal, would not deter us from concluding that the staleness of the claim and its consequences on the facts of this case would have made it inequitable to allow the claim to proceed. We acknowledge that another tribunal might exercise its discretion differently in such circumstances, but we consider it important to keep in mind that section 33 relief is, as Lord Diplock put it in <span style="font-style:italic">Thompson v. Brown</span>, at 750C and 752E-F, “an exception to a general rule that has already catered for delay” in the provision, first, of the limitation period itself and, second, of an extension to it based on the claimant’s excusable ignorance of material facts. </p>

In arriving at the figure of £25,000 he allowed for the fact that the claimant had been badly damaged by his early childhood experiences.  He regarded what had happened at Bryn Alyn as being “cumulative”.  It is no doubt true that the Bryn Alyn experience built on what had gone before.  But, as we have pointed out earlier in this judgment, the proper comparison is between how a particular claimant turned out and how he would have turned out given proper support during his or her time in the first defendant’s care.  On that basis we are of the view that, taking full account of the serious after-effects of the abuse, a greater sum than £25,000 is warranted.  Also to be taken into the account, which the Judge omitted to do, is the effect on the claimant at the time of being subjected to such repeated and serious sexual abuse in particular over two years.  In our view, an appropriate global figure should have been in excess of £50,000.  After apportionment in respect of the long-term injury, we consider the appropriate award for general damages should be £45, 000. </p>

In February 2001, nearly 20 years after the event, the claimant alleged that he had also been abused by John Allen.  He accused Allen of mutual masturbation and attempted buggery. As the Judge was to find, the claimant had been the victim of very serious sexual abuse over a prolonged period whilst he lived at Cotsbrook Hall.</p>

Shapero and Carnwath acknowledge his account of having been subjected to systematic and regular sexual abuse while a resident at Cotsbrook Hall.  They agree that the police enquiries provoked the late onset of psychological symptoms that they describe as “delayed onset post traumatic stress disorder”.  They also agree that he suffers from “alcohol dependence syndrome” or, as most of us would say, alcoholism, and further that he has undergone an enduring personality change.  As to causation, the doctors are of the view that his difficult childhood and lack of care and affection had a part in the later development of alcohol dependency and poor anger control.  But, they agree nonetheless that his experiences at Cotsbrook Hall played the major part in the development of his post traumatic stress disorder and enduring personality change.  </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For the reasons given earlier in this judgment and on the facts of this case, we are of the view that the sexual abuse suffered by the claimant at Bryn Alyn, though serious and prolonged, was not of significance to him within the meaning of  section 14(2) at the time of leaving Bryn Alyn, or for many years after.  It is likely that his first knowledge of significant injury for this purpose was after the intervention of the police in 1997 resulting in his giving evidence to the Waterhouse Tribunal and the onset then of post-traumatic stress disorder.  We also consider that the Judge’s exercise of his section 33 discretion in favour of the claimant, predicated as it was on his section 14 ruling, was defective and in its application to this claim, led to a plainly inequitable result.  First, the overall period of delay of 18 years from the last of the alleged abuse was very long and was likely to have a serious effect on the cogency of the evidence notwithstanding the potential availability of two of the Bryn Alyn staff alleged to have had a part in it.  What was in issue was not so much the fact of the abuse, as the Judge appears to have had in mind in the above passage, but whether, having regard to the standards to be expected of the time, up to 20 or more years before the trial, the first defendant had been in breach of its duty of care.  The Judge’s reliance, in paragraph 147 of his judgment, in this respect on the evidence of Mr. John Jeffreys to the Waterhouse Tribunal, is somewhat tenuous.  There were, in addition, the various other obstacles, common to nearly all these claims, to a fair trial of all the issues, including the potential unreliability of the claimant given his convictions for dishonesty and history of significant alcohol abuse.  </p>

One of those psychiatrists was Dr Bhate who saw him on a number of occasions during 1998 and diagnosed chronic post traumatic stress disorder, with specific symptoms namely haunting images and flashbacks.  Dr Bhate attributed those symptoms to traumatic experiences suffered whilst in care which the Judge, reasonably, took to refer to time spent at Nazareth House and St Vincent’s as well as at Bryn Alyn.  The other psychiatrist, Dr Bronks, was of much the same view on this issue. However, there was some disagreement between the two of them as to the future.  Dr. Bhate considered that the prognosis was poor and that it was likely that the claimant’s psychiatric condition would remain unchanged “for the foreseeable future”.  Dr. Bronks was less pessimistic.  While accepting the likely continuance of current psychiatric symptoms for, possibly, some years, he considered it likely that there would be “a gradual and probably substantial, though incomplete, improvement in due course”.

The best guide available to the Judge on that issue was the report of the social worker written just before the claimant’s placement at Bryn Alyn (see paragraph 282 above) to the effect that, given proper treatment, there was a fair chance of success.  If weight is to be given to that evidence - as it should - it must lead to the conclusion that the first defendant should bear a significant share of responsibility for the claimant’s eventual condition.  Mr. Owen also drew attention to the nature, degree and length of the abuse and to the extent of the claimant’s disabilities and, as he described it, the claimant’s poor long-term prognosis.</p>

As we have said, and as his remarks, (which we set out below), as to future loss of earnings indicate, he clearly preferred the more optimistic evidence of Dr Bronks in this respect.  As in all the other claims, we would also increase the sum of general damages so as to include an element for the suffering of the abuse itself – here, excessive disciplinary and other violence for a period of about three and a half years.  In our view, having regard to those considerations, the proper sum for general damages is a sum of £30,000.  </p>

A member of staff was specifically on duty to supervise what went on in the bedrooms and whilst it would not be realistic to expect such a night guard to know everything that occurred, he ought to have been aware that there were too many visits by Bates to the claimant’s bedroom and he ought to have been put on his guard by the number of such visits.

As such, the claim was still out of time – just.

Later he set out at some length the history of the development of the allegations to illustrate the reasons for his anxiety as to their truth.  First, in about 1993, some two years after leaving Bryn Alyn, the claimant told a social worker that he had been physically assaulted whilst there, but not sexually abused.  Shortly, afterwards, in October 1993, in a statement to the police, he alleged that he had been physically assaulted at Bryn Alyn by John Allen, Pat Bates and others, but did not allege any sexual abuse.  His explanation in evidence for that inconsistency with his present claim was that he had lied to the police on the advice of the social worker in order to persuade them that he would be of no value as a witness in any proceedings about abuse at Bryn Alyn.  That explanation could not be tested since the social worker had died some years before the hearing. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“ 175.  The first matter which the court must decide is whether the abuse alleged at Bryn Alyn is proved to the requisite standard. For reasons previously explained, this is a difficult task. In addition there is no evidence one way or the other relating to these matters from Mr. Bates.  As far as I am aware the allegations have never been put to him and he cannot now be traced. …</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">177.  Accordingly, the only evidence as to what occurred in Bryn Alyn concerning this claimant comes from the claimant himself.  Both the statement to the police dated 30th March 1999 and the statement produced for the purposes of these proceedings give specific detail of the abuse alleged, and they are broadly consistent the one with the other.  I recognise the continuing possibility that the claimant has invented these matters; but at the end of the day it seems much more likely to me that he was abused as he now describes.  Patrick Bates has also been accused of sexual abuse by JS, which abuse has been proved to my satisfaction.  In these circumstances he is shown to be a man capable of abusing children despite his position of responsibility.  Accordingly I conclude that the abuse alleged by CD, both sexual and physical, is proved to the requisite standard by evidence which is sufficiently cogent.  In my view the delay on the claimant’s part in alleging sexual abuse is understandable given the embarrassing nature of the subject matter.  His delay in beginning proceedings is 3 years, and the defendants have not been able trace … Bates.  They do establish prejudice in this respect, but the prejudice which would result if the claimant should be prevented from pursuing his claim would be significant and in my view it would be unjust in all the circumstances so to prevent this claim from proceeding.”</p>

For the general reasons given earlier in this judgment and on the available evidence in the claim, we are of the view that CD did not have knowledge of significant injury in the section 14 sense when he left Bryn Alyn in mid 1991.  He may have known at the time or shortly after that it was wrong, but, on his evidence, he was more likely to have acquired the requisite knowledge some years later, possibly in 1995 or in 1996 when he was prompted by the publicity given to the Waterhouse Inquiry.  </p>

In exercising our own discretion under section 33 we take account of the fact that the period of delay from the last of the abuse, – some 8 years - is not so long as in some of the others, and the possible delay from expiry of the limitation period on the basis of our view of the earliest date of section 14 knowledge is relatively short – a year or so at the most.  To that extent the other features of potential prejudice to the defendants, common to all of the claims is lessened, though there are particular reasons in this case, as the Judge observed, for questioning the reliability of the claimant’s evidence.  </p>

Nevertheless, if the claimant has not established a late enough date of knowledge on which to rely under section 14, given the special difficulties of this case for both sides we would exercise our discretion under section 33 in the claimant’s favour and disapply the limitation period. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There was also physical abuse.  The Judge accepted the claimant’s evidence that he been kicked by a man called Rodda and bullied by another member of staff.  However, the Judge was satisfied that the sexual abuse was much the more serious of the two, particularly as it had been carried out over a significant period of time. </p>

In a joint statement Drs Barlow and Halstead, described by the Judge as experienced psychiatrists, agreed that the impact of the claimant’s experience overall had manifested itself:</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to limitation, the overall delay was ten years from the last of the alleged abuse when he left Bryn Alyn in mid 1989 to the institution of proceedings in July 1999. The Judge found, as with the other claims, that JM’s date of knowledge was, at the latest, when he left Bryn Alyn, putting him, on that finding, 5 years and 3 months out of time from the expiry of the limitation period.  However, he exercised discretion in his favour under section 33 because his delay in claiming was due to acute embarrassment and blocking of memory of the abuse. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For the general reasons given earlier in this judgment and on the available evidence on in this claim, we are of the view that JM did not have knowledge for the purpose of section 14 of the significant injury in respect of which he claims before about the mid 1990s.   Also, for the reasons we have given, we consider the Judge’s ruling under section 33, predicated as it was on his section 14 ruling, was defective.  However, depending on the precise date of the claimant’s proper date of knowledge, his claim may, after all, be in time or the period of delay such as would nevertheless justify us in exercising our discretion under section 33 in his favour. Although there was potential prejudice to the defendants in the death of Taylor in August 1998, we doubt whether the inability to call him was, in the end, a potential prejudice attributable to delay.  The decision in this claim is particularly finely balanced, given the overall delay of ten years from the last of the alleged abuse.  However, given also the uncertainty of the exact date of knowledge so near to the date when the action could have been barred, we would in any event be inclined to exercise our discretion in the claimant’s favour. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to quantum, both Doctors acknowledged that the pre and post Bryn Alyn experiences had had a part to play in the eventual outcome.  Dr Barlow considered that there were certain features of the abuse suffered at Bryn Alyn “which suggest[ed] that these experiences played a greater role in the subsequent development of JM’s psychological problems”.  Dr Halstead, on the other hand, was of the opinion that the claimant was already suffering from personality dysfunction and lack of educational achievement when he first went to Bryn Alyn.  Nevertheless, he conceded that the outlook would have been better if, during his time at Bryn Alyn, he had received “good, consistent, non-abusive parenting”.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the end the Judge awarded the claimant £17,500 in respect of his symptoms, having undertaken the same apportionment exercise as in other cases.  In performing that exercise he placed particular weight upon the post-Bryn Alyn abuse by Manning, observing that the claimant must have felt strongly about it to act as he did.  He then said, at paragraph 192 of his judgment:</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“The conclusion which I reach is that there were particular features about each of the sources of abuse which have had an adverse affect upon this claimant.  The St Christopher’s abuse took place when he was very young.  The Bryn Alyn abuse was perpetrated by people in authority.  The Manning abuse plainly gave rise to very strong feelings in the claimant.  I am unable to conclude that any of these abuses was more harmful that the other.  They have all made a significant contribution to the damage observed by the doctors in the claimant and they have had a cumulative effect.”  </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:-0.01in">On that basis it seems the Judge arrived at a global sum by way of general damages for the symptoms in excess of £50,000.  We are unable on the material before us to say that he was wrong either in that approach or in his final apportionment of damages at £17,500.  However, the claimant is entitled to a substantial further sum for the serious abuse, particularly sexual abuse, to which he was subjected for about three years, a sum that we would assess at £20,000.  </p>

Accordingly, we allow this claimant’s appeal to the extent only of substituting for the Judge’s award of £17,500 for general damages a sum of £37,500. </p>
