	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The central question in these three appeals is whether the setting of default multilateral interchange fees (“MIFs”) within the MasterCard<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>and Visa payment card systems contravenes article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union 2012/C326/01 (the “TFEU”).<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
		<p class="footnotedescription" style="margin-left:0.00in;margin-right:0.08in"><span> </span>It is worth acknowledging at the outset that the term “default MIFs” is to a certain extent tautologous, since “multilateral” interchange fees are by their nature imposed by default, in the absence of an agreement as to a bilateral interchange fee.  We will nevertheless use the term “default MIFs” since others have repeatedly done so, and it reminds the reader of the nature of the MIFs in question. </p>
	      </authorialNote>  Article 101(1) provides that agreements between undertakings which may affect trade between Member States and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the internal market are prohibited as incompatible with the internal market of the European Union.   Section 2 of the Competition Act 1998 (the “1998 Act”) makes the same provision in relation to agreements which may affect trade within the United Kingdom, and which prevent, restrict or distort competition within the United Kingdom. </p>

In the broadest of outline, the CAT decided in <span style="font-style:italic">Sainsbury’s v MasterCard</span> (the “CAT case” or “<span style="font-style:italic">Sainsbury’s v MasterCard</span>”) that the MIFs charged within the MasterCard payment system were prohibited anti-competitive agreements, whilst the two Commercial Court judges decided, for different reasons, in each of <span style="font-style:italic">AAM v MasterCard</span> (the “<span style="font-style:italic">AAM</span> case” or “<span style="font-style:italic">AAM v MasterCard</span>”) and <span style="font-style:italic">Sainsbury’s v Visa</span> (the “<span style="font-style:italic">Visa</span> case” or “<span style="font-style:italic">Sainsbury’s v Visa</span>”) that the MIFs charged respectively within the MasterCard and Visa payment systems were not prohibited anti-competitive agreements.  It falls to this court to resolve the considerable differences of approach between the three decisions under appeal. </p>

One side is that in which Issuers compete with each other for the business of customers to whom they will issue cards (“the issuing market”), the other is that in which Acquirers compete for the business of Merchants (“the acquiring market”). The two sides are closely linked and dependent on each other: the value of a Visa card to a cardholder is dependent on the extent to which it is accepted by Merchants and, correspondingly, the benefit Merchants gain from accepting Visa cards is dependent on the extent that consumers have and use those cards. Precisely what benefits Merchants gain from card transactions is a matter of dispute, but it is common ground that they benefit at least to the extent that card transactions are cheaper for them than cash transactions, involving the time costs, increased staff costs and bank charges of handling and banking cash.”  </p>

On 8 December 2010, the Commission adopted a decision accepting commitments offered by Visa regarding its EEA debit card MIFs.  The decision (i) required Visa to reduce its weighted average EEA debit MIF to 0.2%, (ii) recorded the allegation that the MIFs had both the object and effect of restricting competition, and (iii) without making a finding on liability, and subject to compliance with the decision, held that the Commission would not take further action against Visa in relation to its EEA debit MIFs. </p>

As for the counterfactual against which their restrictive effects were to be tested, the starting point was a rule that MasterCard transactions would be settled at par, which was equivalent to a default MIF of zero ([141]-[143]).  The CAT rejected a submission by Sainsbury’s that Visa should be assumed to have introduced a similar rule: the CAT reasoned that it was the effects of the MasterCard scheme that were being tested, and it would be wrong to make any presumptions regarding Visa that were not grounded in fact </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As to what Visa would have “actually” done in the counterfactual world, the CAT thought that it would have maintained its MIFs as close to their then level as it felt it could achieve ([160]-[163]).  The CAT considered that for the following reasons, this would not have resulted in issuing banks immediately leaving the MasterCard scheme due to the higher MIFs offered by Visa; rather, they would have sought bilaterally to agree interchange fees with acquirers ([174]-[178]).  Although it would have been open to acquirers to refuse to agree anything (resulting in a zero MIF attractive to their merchant customers), they would not have taken this course for fear of (i) a Visa monopoly as issuers switched schemes and (ii) issuers withdrawing valuable benefits or features of the scheme in response to reduced MIFs ([182]-[197]).  Instead, they would have secured new charging structures more favourable to particular types of merchants than the traditional <span style="font-style:italic">ad valorem</span> per transaction basis.  Over the claim period these new structures would, on average, have equated to positive interchange fees of 0.50% of transaction value for credit cards and 0.27% for debit cards.  Since Visa’s MIFs on debit cards were practically the same (0.26%), issuing banks would not have gradually abandoned MasterCard’s cards in favour of Visa’s cards [238].  Nor would they have drifted to Visa credit cards, despite the apparently higher MIFs on offer (0.80%), because (i) the new charging structures would render the actual difference in MIF levels between the schemes less stark, (ii) the MasterCard scheme is a wellfunctioning one with an established client base, and (iii) issuers do not choose whether or not to participate in schemes solely on the basis of MIF levels.  Accordingly, the MasterCard scheme would not have collapsed in the counterfactual world, and acquirers would have been able properly to differentiate their services by competing on price for merchants’ business, resulting in lower prices overall.  It followed that the MIFs as set amounted to a restriction of competition by effect ([267]-[269]). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Given its extensive reasoning on the first article 101(1) issue, the CAT was able to deal more briefly with the question of objective necessity.  It considered that the question answered itself: the MIFs were “on no view inherently necessary” to the MasterCard scheme, which would “operate perfectly well – indeed, it would be more competitive and better – without the UK MIF” [279]. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">At [285]-[289], the CAT dealt with the article 101(3) exemption.  It held that the MIFs as set did not satisfy any of the four conditions for the following reasons.  They inhibited economic progress by frustrating bilateral negotiations between issuers and acquirers, creating upward pressure on merchants’ service charges and preventing the emergence of new charging structures.  Accordingly, no benefits resulted and the second condition did not arise.  As for the third and fourth conditions, the MIFs were not indispensable to the scheme (but only served to avoid the transaction costs of bilateral agreements), and did enable the parties to eliminate competition.  In the light of its finding that interchange fees would be bilaterally agreed in the counterfactual, the CAT did not consider it necessary to decide whether the MIFs would have been exemptible under article 101(3) at any level lower than that at which they were actually set. </p>

It held that it could not: there was no turpitude on the part of Sainsbury’s Bank and, even if there was, Sainsbury’s Bank was not part of the same undertaking (within the meaning of article 101(1)) as Sainsbury’s, its conduct was not attributable to Sainsbury’s, and Sainsbury’s Bank did not bear “significant responsibility” for MasterCard’s infringement.  Those findings were not appealed by MasterCard and Visa does not advance any arguments on illegality. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">Sainsbury’s.  It started from its decision that, were it not for the MIFs as set, bilateral agreements would have resulted in an average interchange fee of 0.50% for credit cards and 0.27% for debit cards.  The CAT then calculated the difference between these levels and those actually charged, and applied it to the annual sales values on which MIFs were charged.  This resulted in an overcharge during the claim period of £102,787,541 for credit cards and £760,406 for debit cards ([427]-[431]).  The CAT accepted that any cost savings achieved by Sainsbury’s as a direct result of the overcharge should be set off against damages due, but in the event made no such deduction as the evidence suggested that any such savings would have been achieved irrespective of the MIF ([472]-[478]).  Likewise, there was insufficient evidence to show that Sainsbury’s passed any of the overcharge on to its customers, such that its damages should be correspondingly reduced ([432]-[470] and [479]-[485]).  Sainsbury’s did, however, derive a benefit from the overcharge received by Sainsbury’s Bank, to the extent that such amounts were spent by Sainsbury’s Bank for the benefit of Sainsbury’s.  The CAT assumed that 80% was so spent, and the level of damages due to Sainsbury’s was reduced accordingly, to £68,582,245 ([491]-[508]). </p>

Sainsbury’s would have received interest on this second 50%.  For 20% of it, the rate would be that which Sainsbury’s received on its cash balances and, for the remaining 30%, the rate would be that which the company paid on new debt ([527]-[547]). </p>

He disagreed for the following reasons with the CAT’s conclusion that bilateral agreements would emerge in the counterfactual: it would not necessarily be in merchants’ collective interest to agree to pay MIFs above zero; even if it was, individual merchants and acquirers would consider only their own interests and would be unwilling to put themselves at a competitive disadvantage to rivals who simply adopted the default rate of zero (the ‘free rider problem’); the number of (nonoverlapping) issuers and acquirers would require more bilateral agreements to be concluded than would be realistic in practice; and both parties’ experts had expressly rejected the possibility ([136]-[150]).  This finding was not, however, decisive, because Popplewell J went on to adopt the reasoning of the Commission, the General Court and the CJEU, which he expressed in the following terms at [156]: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.18in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“They [the MIFs] imposed a floor below which the [merchants’ service charge] could not fall, because acquirers had to pay at least that much to issuers and had to recoup it from the merchants, which in turn led to higher prices charged by acquirers to merchants through the [merchants’ service charge] than if the MIF were lower or zero. Such a floor restricts competition because it interferes with the ability of acquirers to compete for merchants’ business by offering [merchants’ service charges] below such floor. It is no different in kind from a collective agreement by manufacturers to maintain inflated wholesale prices, which prevents wholesalers competing on the retail market below those prices”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly, Popplewell J would have found that the MasterCard MIFs infringed article 101(1), were it not for the ‘death spiral argument’.  He expressed this argument in the following stages: (i) it is legally permissible for the counterfactual to take into account competition; (ii) the proper assumption in the present case is that Visa’s MIFs would have been the same in the counterfactual as they were in reality; and (iii) this would have led to the collapse of the MasterCard scheme as issuers abandoned it in pursuit of higher MIFs.  With respect to the first stage, he held that it is permissible to consider competition, on the basis of CJEU jurisprudence, including [177]-[179] of the CJEU’s decision; the contrary principle stated by the Court of First Instance in <span style="font-style:italic">Metropole Television (6) and others v Commission</span> [2001] 5 CMLR 33 (“<span style="font-style:italic">Metropole</span>”) was out of line with that jurisprudence ([164]-[185]).  Regarding the second stage, he held that Visa’s MIFs should be assumed to be the same in the counterfactual as they actually were, and not the same as MasterCard’s counterfactual MIFs, unless there was sufficient evidence that the two schemes were “materially identical”, which there was not ([186]-[219]).  As for the third stage, he concluded, on the basis of the evidence of MasterCard’s witnesses and of both parties’ experts, that the MasterCard scheme would not have survived in such circumstances ([220]-[236]).  Therefore, the MIFs as set did not restrict competition by effect, and were objectively necessary as an ancillary restraint, with the consequence that they did not infringe article 101(1). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Popplewell J then addressed the article 101(3) exemption, even though this was not strictly necessary in the light of his conclusions on article 101(1).  Since it was common ground that the fourth condition was met, Popplewell J only had to consider the first three of the four article 101(3) conditions set out above ([262]).  He then set out the law to be applied, as follows.  The benefits claimed to satisfy the first condition must be causally linked to the MIFs, and such links must be sufficiently direct to be capable of proof ([264]-[265]).  The second condition (whether merchants received a fair share of these benefits) would be met if the MIFs as set did not (i) exceed the benefits they produced for merchants, or (ii) generate “unduly high profits” for issuers ([287]).  In the circumstances of the case, the third condition (whether the MIFs were indispensable to attainment of the merchant benefits) would be met unless the MIFs created “an unfair degree of profit for issuers”, because there was no realistic counterfactual in which something other than MIFs could confer the relevant benefits ([290]-[291]).  Regarding burden of proof, it was for the defendants to prove whether the MIFs as set were exempt, but for the claimants to prove the maximum level of MIF that would have been exemptible under article 101(3), up to which they would not be entitled to damages, drawing an analogy with the requirement for claimants in sale of goods claims to establish as their measure of loss the difference between market value and price paid ([294]-[302]). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Applying these principles to the facts of the case, Popplewell J held that the first condition was met because the MIFs enabled issuers to offer incentives to cardholders, which increased card usage, in turn producing the following benefits for merchants: avoidance of the costs of other payment methods; competitive advantage over merchants who do not take cards (‘business stealing’); facilitation of online spending and e-commerce; guaranteed payment in the case of fraud or default; the avoidance of the cost of providing credit; and increased and earlier spending by customers ([308]-[335]).  For his analysis of the second condition, Popplewell J took as a starting point the Commission Survey, which used the MIT to estimate the value to merchants of avoiding the costs of cash payments by accepting cards ([347]).  He then adjusted the survey results, based on the parties’ expert evidence, such that they (i) applied to the average merchant, and not just large merchants ([363]-[368]), (ii) included the value of all of the benefits identified above, and not only the avoidance of the cost of cash payments ([369]-[397]), and (iii) reflected the extent to which issuers retained MIFs as profit rather than spending them on cardholder incentives, since the MIT assumed no such retention, and any MIF retained could not possibly contribute to merchant benefits ([398]-[410]).  The resulting values exceeded the MIFs as set (except for EEA debit cards for part of the claim period), so that Popplewell J’s threshold requirement of merchant neutrality was passed.  He did not consider the issuer profit margins on MIFs (estimated by one of MasterCard’s witnesses at 10% to 40%) to be excessive, and so the fair share condition was met.  It followed that the third condition was also met ([409]).  Accordingly, had it been necessary for MasterCard to rely on the article 101(3) exemption, Popplewell J would have held that the conditions were fulfilled. </p>

The test, they said, is not concerned with whether the restriction is necessary for the particular operation in question to compete successfully or be commercially successful.  They also said that an analysis of the pro- and anticompetitive effects of the restriction is for article 101(3) and does not form any part of the article 101(1) exercise, including as to ancillary restraint.

I see no difficulty in this court determining whether the former has been proved on the balance of probabilities. That test is capable of accommodating varying requirements as to what is expected to meet the standard: contract terms must be “certain”, allegations of fraud must be “distinctly proved” and it is often said that “cogent” evidence is required to rebut certain presumptions. In the case of Article 101(3), it is recognised that robust analysis and cogent evidence will be required to establish, on the balance of probabilities, that a restrictive agreement in fact and in the real world (as opposed to in theory) gives rise to pro-competitive effects.” </p>

As Popplewell J correctly recognised in stating the principles at [264] of his judgment, it is not sufficient to identify benefits which result from the use of credit cards or debit cards generally or from the particular MasterCard or Visa scheme generally.  This is because it is the restriction of the default MIF which, on this hypothesis, has been found to be a restriction of competition under article 101(1) and has not been shown to be objectively necessary under the ancillary restraint doctrine, and which therefore requires justification to be held exempt under article 101(3).  It is any alleged procompetitive effect of the default MIF which falls to be weighed against the anticompetitive restrictive effect: see [207] of the General Court’s decision in <span style="font-style:italic">MasterCard</span>, which was upheld in the CJEU’s decision at [232]. </p>

A claim that an interchange fee mechanism creates efficiencies within the meaning of article [101(3)] therefore must be founded on a detailed, robust and compelling analysis that relies in its assumptions and deductions on empirical data and facts. Apart from MasterCard’s general assertion that balancing of the demand of cardholders and merchants leads to a better performance of the MasterCard system, is inherent and indispensable to the operation of a four-party payment card system, contributes to overall economic welfare and therefore “undoubtedly” fulfils the first condition of article [101(3)] no such analysis and empirical evidence was provided to the Commission. </p>

Both the Commercial Court judges below proceeded on the basis that, if the first two conditions were satisfied in relation to the MIFs, then the MIFs were indispensable by definition.  It seems to us that that approach ignores that a restriction will only be indispensable if there are no other less restrictive means of achieving the same benefits or efficiencies (see [75] of the Guidelines).

They are a transfer of value from one side of a two-sided market to the other, in the form of either a discount on settlement at par, which is a positive MIF, or a premium over settlement at par, which is a negative MIF.  Once this is understood, it becomes clear that a zero MIF is legally and economically equivalent to a settlement at par rule, and that a positive or negative MIF does not fix prices any more than does a rule requiring settlement at par.  Since it is common ground that some form of default settlement rule is necessary for the schemes to function, the appropriate counterfactual must include some form of collusive agreement.  This is what, submitted Ms Rose, distinguished this case from a typical cartel case, where the counterfactual necessarily involves the participants setting their prices independently.  Accordingly, in this case, the competitive process will not differ in the counterfactual, because (i) it is common ground that a default settlement rule must be set, (ii) it is common ground that issuers and acquirers will not enter into bilateral agreements so as to depart from the default settlement rule, due to the ‘free rider problem’ (no acquirer will agree to pay a MIF unless it knows its competitors are paying the same), (iii) the MIF is a transparent common cost, which is passed on by acquirers to merchants, and does not figure in the negotiations between them, and (iv) acquirers nonetheless compete for merchants’ business in relation to the acquirer’s margin and the additional services they offer.</span>

They are negotiating over the same sterling amount (the acquirer’s margin), and the nature of the negotiation is the same.

	      <span style="color:#00000A">Finally, Ms Rose submitted that the court was not bound by the CJEU’s decision, because it depended on a finding of fact as to the likelihood of acquirers agreeing bilateral interchange fees.  The Commission found at [460], based on the statements of retailers, that (i) the default settlement at par counterfactual would lead to a period of bilateral negotiation; (ii) these negotiations would create uncertainty amongst acquirers as to what other acquirers were paying; (iii) this uncertainty would enable merchants to exert greater pressure on acquirers when negotiating the merchants’ service charge; and (iv) in the long term this dynamic would drive MIFs down to zero.  These findings of fact underpinned the decisions of both the General Court at [134] and [143] and the CJEU at [195] (which only sets out and approves the final sentence of [143] of the General Court’s judgment, and not the preceding sentence).  By contrast, the unanimous expert evidence before Phillips J (and Popplewell J) was that there would be no bilateral agreements between issuers and acquirers in the counterfactual (see [111]-[129] of Phillips J’s first judgment and [141]-[150] of Popplewell J’s judgment).  Phillips J, therefore, made a finding of fact that there would be no change in competitive dynamics in the counterfactual, which turned on the expert evidence about the impossibility of bilateral interchange fees, and which the court could not and should not disturb.

Moreover, even if the </span>CJEU’s decision in <span style="font-style:italic">MasterCard</span> did not turn on a factual finding about bilateral agreements, the Commission plainly relied on evidence to reach its conclusion that there would be more competition without the MIF due to merchants being able to exert greater pressure on acquirers.  The Commission referred to statements of retailers at the start of [460] and in footnote 516.  The references to “merchant pressure” at [143] of the General Court’s decision and [195] of the CJEU’s decision can only be referring to [460] of the Commission’s decision, because merchant pressure is not mentioned anywhere else.  The decisions were therefore based on evidence.  The evidence before Phillips J was the opposite, namely that there would be no greater competition in the absence of the MIF.

A default rule providing for any MIF, whether positive or negative, was fundamentally different from a default settlement at par rule.

The CJEU’s decision at [195] expressly referred to the effect of the MIF being to limit the commercial pressure which merchants were able to exert on acquiring banks.  That was a restriction of the competitive process on the acquiring market.  The restriction in question was the impediment to the merchants’ ability to drive down prices charged by acquirers, due to the setting of the price floor, not the absence of bilateral negotiations.  Since that impediment does not arise in a payment card scheme providing for settlement at par, in which competitive forces can operate unfettered, a positive default MIF is necessarily restrictive compared to a zero MIF counterfactual.   </p>

The default MIF “not only creates an (artificial) common cost for acquirers and thereby sets a floor for the fees each acquirer charges to merchants”, but “[a]cquirers also know precisely that all of their competitors pay the very same fees”, which eliminated an element of uncertainty for all suppliers involved.  The Commission said that, in the absence of the MIF, the merchants’ service charge would be set taking into account only “the acquirer’s individual marginal cost and his mark up”: see the last sentences of both [459] and [460]. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is in this context that [460] of the Commission’s decision needs to be understood.  It was explaining why the MIFs were not like an excise tax, but actually restricted competition between acquirers and forced up prices for merchants.  It referred to “statements of retailers demonstrat[ing] that they would be in a position to exert that pressure if acquirers were not able to refer to the interchange fee as the “starting point” (that is to say, as the floor) for negotiating the [merchants’ service charge]”.  The Commission explained that “without a default that fixes an interchange fee rate in the absence of a bilateral agreement, merchants could shop around to contract with the acquirer who incurs the lowest interchange costs”.  It then explained why, even if there were some bilateral agreements for a time, the process in the counterfactual would end up without a MIF at all and with settlement at par.  Footnote 517 to [460] makes clear that it was the Commission’s view that “in the absence of a default MIF banks may or may not enter into bilateral agreements on interchange fees”.  The Commission explained its view at [522] that “[i]n the presence of a MIF the marginal cost of acquirers are inflated, thereby setting a floor under the merchant fee”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">These points were rejected at [131] on two grounds.  First, at [132], the General Court said that, for the reasons it gave in [94]-[120], a MasterCard system operating without a MIF - solely on the basis of a rule prohibiting <span style="font-style:italic">ex post </span>pricing - was economically viable, and that was sufficient to justify it “being taken into consideration in the context of the analysis of the effects of the MIF on competition”.  This was the aspect of the General Court’s decision that was later said to be wrong by the CJEU (see [169] and [198] of the CJEU’s decision), but it demonstrates that the General Court was approving the “no MIF” plus prohibition of <span style="font-style:italic">ex post </span>pricing<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>counterfactual, which the CJEU also later approved for slightly different reasons (see [173]-[174] of the CJEU’s decision).

It recorded that MasterCard had submitted that the fact that the MIF had an impact on the level of the merchants’ service charge did not affect competition between acquirers, because the MIF applied in the same way to all acquirers, and operated as a cost that was common to all of them.  MasterCard argued that the prohibition of <span style="font-style:italic">ex post</span> pricing effectively imposed a MIF set at zero which “from a competitive aspect, would be equivalent to and just as transparent as the current MIF, the only difference being the level at which it is set”. </p>

There, the CJEU recorded the argument that, in assessing a restrictive effect on competition, the Commission should have considered what the actual counterfactual hypothesis would have been in the absence of the MIF.

This is important because the CJEU later expressly approved that counterfactual for article 101(1) purposes at [173]-[174].

That was why the CJEU concluded at [169] that the General Court should not at [132] and [143] of its decision have relied on “the single criterion of economic viability” to justify the inclusion of a rule prohibiting <span style="font-style:italic">ex post</span> pricing as part of its counterfactual.  The General Court, said the CJEU, had nowhere explained “whether it was likely that such a prohibition would occur in the absence of MIF”.

Such a rule was less restrictive of competition than MasterCard’s existing MIF solution.  That led the CJEU to conclude at [173] that the <span style="font-style:italic">ex post</span> pricing prohibition could be regarded as a counterfactual hypothesis that was “not only economically viable in the context of the MasterCard system but also plausible or indeed likely, given that there is nothing in the [General Court’s] judgment … to suggest, and it is common ground … that MasterCard would have preferred to let its system collapse rather than adopt” that solution. </p>

He held that, subject to the death spiral argument, the MasterCard MIFs “did amount to a restriction of competition on the acquiring market by comparison with a counterfactual of no MIF”, because they imposed a floor below which the merchants’ service charge could not fall, because “acquirers had to pay at least that much to issuers and had to recoup it from the merchants, which in turn led to higher prices charged by acquirers to merchants through the [merchants’ service charge] than if the MIF were … zero”.  Such a floor, said Popplewell J, restricted competition because it interfered with the ability of acquirers to compete for merchants’ business by offering merchants’ services charges below such floor.  It was no different from a collective agreement by manufacturers to maintain inflated wholesale prices, which prevents wholesalers competing on the retail market below those prices. </p>

The third question is whether there is an exemption under article 101(3).

That does not mean, however, that an agreement which raises prices is not capable of restricting competition.  It will depend on the circumstances.  The circumstances here were quite different from those in the <span style="font-style:italic">BAGS</span> case.  Moreover, Phillips J drew the wrong conclusion when he said at [97] that the CJEU’s decision (at [195]) had made plain that the correct legal question is whether the effect of the imposition of the MIFs was that it reduced competition in the relevant market, not merely whether it resulted in higher merchants’ service charges.  Whilst what he actually said is correct, he failed to take due account of [195] of the CJEU’s decision in which the CJEU had said expressly that it was apparent from [143] of the General Court’s decision that the MIFs, which resulted in higher prices, limited the pressure which merchants could exert on acquiring banks, resulting in a reduction in competition between acquirers as regards the amount of the merchants’ service charge. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Having considered the issues as to the correct counterfactual and the evidence before him in detail, Phillips J concluded at [137] that the effect of the merchants’ argument was that any level of MIF, on the scale from infinitely positive to infinitely negative (including an infinitesimally small level), was deemed to be a restriction of competition, all in comparison with an infinitesimally small point on that scale equating to there being no MIF (a figure of zero).  He held that there was “in this context, no magic in the number zero and no reason why it represent[ed] an inherently more competitive situation than any other level [of MIF]”.  We take the view that [137] of Phillips J’s judgment is beside the point.  As we have already said, the exercise under article 101(1) is to consider whether there would be more competition in the absence of the measure in question.  The measure in question here was the rule that, in the absence of bilateral agreements, a default MIF would be imposed.  In the absence of such a rule, there would have been no bilateral agreements and no MIFs would have been charged, because there would have been either a settlement at par rule or an <span style="font-style:italic">ex post</span> pricing restriction, as the CJEU held.  Accordingly, we think that Phillips J was wrong to think that there was “no magic in zero” just because of the possibility of negative MIFs.  Moreover, the Commission saw any positive MIF as setting a floor under and inflating merchants’ service charges, as it said at [522]. </p>

In fact, as we have already said above, the Commission’s decision at [460] was explaining why the MIFs were not like an excise tax, but actually restricted competition between acquirers and forced up prices for merchants.  The reference to statements of retailers demonstrating that they would be in a position to exert pressure on acquirers in the absence of a floor to the merchants’ service charge was there to explain that, without a default rule that fixed a MIF in the absence of such bilateral agreements, merchants could shop around to contract with the acquirer who incurred the lowest interchange costs.   </p>

We consider that Phillips J was misled by Ms Rose’s argument as to a sliding scale of MIFs including the zero MIF as one point on that scale.  As we have said, that ignores the basic question one is required to ask under article 101(1), namely whether there would be more competition without the measure in question, that is to say the rule imposing a default positive MIF in the absence of bilateral agreement.  The answer to that question was delivered by the Commission, and approved by the General Court and the CJEU.   The correct counterfactual envisaged no default MIF and a prohibition on <span style="font-style:italic">ex post</span> pricing.  The MIF did set a floor on the merchants’ service charge, and restricted competition between acquirers, because the higher prices resulting from it limited the pressure which merchants could exert on acquirers, reducing competition between acquirers as regards the amount of the merchants’ service charge. </p>

As we have described in paragraph 266(3) above, given the dynamic between Acquiring Banks and Merchants on the one hand and Issuing Banks on the other, there is a danger that if the MIF is set too high, Issuing Banks will be disinclined to negotiate, and Acquiring Banks/Merchants will not have the market power to make them”. </p>

Plainly, the reasoning of the CJEU to which we have referred does not mean that any very small default MIF would automatically be a restriction on competition.

The CJEU had said that it was necessary “to take into account any factor that is relevant, having regard, in particular, to the nature of the services concerned, as well as the real conditions of the functioning and the structure of the markets, in relation to the economic or legal context in which that coordination occurs, regardless of whether or not such a factor concerns the relevant market”, and “[w]here there are several markets that are inter-connected, that very inter-connection, in our view, is a matter that needs to be taken into account”.  In our judgment, however, as we have already said, it is necessary to read [177]-[182] of the CJEU’s decision as a whole.  The CJEU was not gainsaying the need to concentrate on the acquiring market in determining whether the imposition of default MIFs were restrictive of competition.  It was saying that such an evaluation had to be in an appropriate context, that context including the structure within which the acquiring market was set.  We do not consider that the CJEU was sanctioning a broad consideration of the competitive effects within the entire inter-scheme market at the first stage.  The CAT’s determination to consider the inter-scheme and issuing markets as part of the article 101(1) question also raises questions about the way it approached the evidence about what would have occurred in the counterfactual world. </p>

The CAT acknowledged that no bilateral interchange fees were agreed in the UK ([183]), but took comfort from some inconclusive evidence from Mr Douglas, the Executive Vice President and General Manager of MasterCard in the USA ([185]), and from Mr Willaert, Head of MasterCard’s Interchange Fee Team from 2010-12 ([184]).  The CAT itself acknowledged that the expert evidence was not supportive of bilateral interchange fees being agreed in the way it found to be likely.  Dr Gunnar Niels, MasterCard’s expert, said that, if the default MIF was zero, there would be no negotiation of positive bilateral interchange fees because the merchants would insist on a short-term costs benefit ([194]-[195]).  Mr Nils von Hinten-Reed, Sainsbury’s expert, thought that bilateral negotiations would only produce a very low interchange fee ([186]-[187]), so that the costs of negotiation would not be worth the effort.  </p>

This is not a decision from which this court either can or should depart.  It answers the schemes’ argument that, whether as a matter of evidence or not, <span style="color:#00000A">the competitive process will not differ in the counterfactual.  The default MIFs may be a transparent common cost, which is passed on by acquirers to merchants, and which does not figure in the negotiations between them, but it does not follow that acquirers nonetheless compete as strongly for merchants’ business in relation to the acquirer’s margin and the additional services they offer, as they would in the absence of the default MIFs.  </span></p>

The fallacy of his approach was demonstrated by the statement at [178] of his judgment, to which Mr Brealey took particular exception: “If competition would kill off the main operation without the restriction being in place, the restriction is necessary for the main operation”.  Mr Brealey submitted that this proposition cuts across the fact that the whole purpose of competition was to compete on price, quality and service and beat one’s competitors.  The judge’s approach would enable an inefficient enterprise which entered into a restrictive agreement to rely upon the ancillary restraint doctrine to argue that it needed the restrictive agreement to prevent its more efficient competitors putting it out of business.   </p>

She submitted that Phillips J had been wrong to conclude in [168(ii)] of his first judgment that it was difficult to conceive of a scenario where one scheme was unable to set default MIFs, but the other remained unconstrained.  This was exactly what had occurred in Hungary in 2010, as had been in evidence before Phillips J, when Visa had significantly cut its debit MIFs pursuant to a commitment given to the Commission, but MasterCard had not, and Visa had lost half its market share in that country.  This was also what occurred in the United Kingdom when, in order to satisfy Commission decisional practice, Visa maintained lower credit card MIFs than MasterCard.

The asymmetrical counterfactual which Popplewell J accepted assumes that MasterCard would be prevented from setting default MIFs but Visa would remain unconstrained.  As Phillips J said at [168(ii)] of his first judgment, addressing the mirror argument made by Visa in that case, that situation is “not merely unrealistic but seems highly improbable”.  As Phillips J said, the schemes are engaged in the same business, using the same model and are fierce competitors.  We were not impressed in this context by the arguments on behalf of the schemes that there have been inconsistencies in approach on the part of the Commission and other competition authorities and regulators.  Whilst there have been differences in the detail, as appears from the chronological background set out at Part II of this judgment, the competition authorities and regulators have sought to constrain both schemes in a broadly similar fashion.  We consider that a realistic counterfactual would assume that, if one of the schemes was unable (whether for commercial or legal reasons) to set default MIFs, the other scheme would be similarly constrained.  </p>

The critical point is that the hypothesis of the asymmetrical counterfactual is that one of the schemes would be prevented from setting any default MIF but the Commission and the UK competition authorities and regulators would allow the other scheme to carry on setting its default MIFs, without any constraints being imposed.  That seems to us to be completely unrealistic and improbable.  Realistically there would be similar constraints on both schemes.  </p>

His essential reasoning for that conclusion at [190][193] of his judgment was that it should not be open to one unlawful scheme to save itself by arguing that it otherwise would face elimination by reason of competition from the other scheme, which is itself unlawful.  </p>

They are both four-party card payment schemes with an Honour All Cards Rule for credit and debit cards, in which default MIFs are set which are paid to issuing banks and passed on to the merchants as part of the merchants’ service charge imposed by acquiring banks.  In those circumstances, even if Popplewell J had been correct that it was appropriate to consider, in the context of the ancillary restraint doctrine, the competitive effects of the removal of the restriction in question on the specific main operation, he should have gone on to conclude that the schemes were materially identical, so that in the counterfactual world Visa’s MIFs would be constrained to the same extent as MasterCard’s. </p>

Having set out the three conditions of article 101(3) which had to be satisfied and his conclusions on the burden and standard of proof (to which we have already referred), the judge turned to consider the first condition, the benefits requirement.  At [308] he identified what Mr Hoskins described as “the virtuous circle”, namely the 6 benefits to merchants of accepting credit and debit cards.  In terms of benefits derived from the MasterCard scheme generally, although four of those were challenged before the judge, only one remains challenged by the AAM parties on appeal, so-called “business stealing” to which we return later in this judgment.  </p>

MasterCard’s argument that charging positive MIFs led to an increase in the use of cards and therefore an increase in the amount of the benefits enjoyed by merchants as a result of the use of cards is made good on the evidence before me. So too is its case that because cardholders received benefits from issuers which were funded by the MIF, the benefits to merchants of card use are to some extent directly caused by the MIF. That does not mean that all the benefits enjoyed by merchants are directly attributable to the level of MIFs charged by MasterCard. It does, however, mean that a MIF at some positive level is directly causative of some benefits to merchants. That is the starting point for the Article 101(3) process. There then remains to be addressed the difficult quantification exercise involved in valuing those merchant benefits which are directly attributable to the MIF. This raises difficult questions, which I address below, but none of them were issues which MasterCard sought to address before the Commission, or which the Commission, General Court or CJEU needed to address.” </p>

At places in this analysis, the judge did refer to the MIF being causative of benefits, but this was very much on the basis of the economic analysis propounded by the experts.  One exception was the fraud guarantee, in respect of which he referred to the evidence of Mr Willaert of MasterCard, although, as the judge noted, Mr Willaert accepted that MasterCard would have deployed anti-fraud technology even if MIF revenue had not been available.  </p>

Issuing banks receive the MIF income and must know what they do with it in broad terms.  Documentary evidence could have been obtained from issuers in the form of board minutes and internal memoranda and from studies as to how the banks spend income from credit and debit cards, their motives and intentions, how they view the stream of MIF income and whether and, if so, to what extent it causes them to provide promotional benefits to cardholders.  Witnesses from issuers could have been called to speak to those matters.  We accept that a “ledger” approach of giving precise figures for MIF pass-through might not be possible, but see no reason why issuers could not provide some estimation of the extent to which MIF income is passed through to cardholders.

The judge mentioned this point in passing at [403] and, as we have said, recognised that it was sound in principle.  To be fair, the experts agreed, at least as regards credit cards, that pass-through would incentivise card use.  There was, however, no empirical, factual evidence on this point, which seems to have been based on economic theory.  If issuers were passing through MIF revenue to cardholders with a view to incentivising card usage, one would expect some factual or empirical evidence from those issuers as to the extent to which such pass-through was having the desired effect.

The judge did not take sufficient account of this point.  Likewise, the judge’s analysis does not take into account that a large percentage of overall transactions in a mature card market, which Phillips J at [49] of his second judgment considered the UK market to have been during the claim period, would always have been transactions using the relevant scheme’s cards anyway, so that the merchants bear the burden of the MIFs on those transactions without any corresponding advantage.  </p>

This assumption is inconsistent with the point made by the Commission at [695] of the Commission decision, which we cited at [85] above, reiterated at [730] and [732] (and at [60] of the Commission Survey) that it cannot be presumed that an increase in card usage will be beneficial, so that cogent evidence to that effect is required.

It is clear from the expert evidence at trial that the socalled framework was on the basis of “switching” from other methods of payment to MasterCard cards, whether cash, store credit, PayPal or other card schemes such as Amex.

This concerns his treatment of pass-through.  Mr Hoskins can legitimately point out that, in the trial before Popplewell J, unlike in the trial before Phillips J, it was not being contended by the AAM parties that the scheme had failed to establish pass-through at all.  As the judge recorded at [400], Mr Dryden accepted that a significant proportion of MIF income was passed through to cardholders.  His point and the AAM parties’ case was that, in circumstances where it was not 100% (or, as he put it in cross-examination, “materially incomplete”) and MasterCard could not establish by evidence the extent of pass-through, for the purposes of the first and second critical steps, the extent to which MIF revenue was used to incentivise card usage and did in fact stimulate additional card usage could not be established.  </p>

We do not consider that the various materials referred to by Mr Dryden, which the judge set out at [401], satisfy the requirement for cogent factual or empirical evidence of pass-through.  We have already noted that the judge discounted the Commission’s econometric analysis on the basis that it was not a secure indication of pass-through.  The Evans, Chang &amp; Joyce analysis in the United States of inferring 80% pass-through from issuers’ share prices is merely another species of economic theory, inferences drawn by analysts and hardly empirical evidence. </p>

It was a survey of the response of consumers to a proposed increase in card fees, concluding that a proposed 0.25% charge on all transactions using a credit card would lead to a 26% decrease in the use of such cards.  The judge said of this survey: “This suggests that in the UK the MIF subsidisation of costs which would otherwise have to be recouped in card fees has a very significant impact, implying a high level of pass through”.  That was the judge’s own inference.  It does not seem to us that the inference is necessarily a valid one but, in any event, it is hardly evidence. </p>

He did so because, having started from the erroneous assumption that increased card usage always benefited the relevant consumers, he considered that he had to make some quantification of the extent of the pass-through and thus of the net benefits.  On the contrary, the judge should have concluded, on the basis of the evidence before him, that the first condition of article 101(3), the benefits requirement, was not satisfied so that MasterCard had not established entitlement to an exemption under article 101(3). </p>

In the AAM parties’ appeal, it is common ground that this requirement is looking at the position of the merchants and is only satisfied if the merchants were no worse off as a consequence of the restriction, so that unless they obtain greater benefits from the default MIF than the anti-competitive disadvantage it imposes upon them, the second condition will not be satisfied.

He rejected the contrary argument for the AAM parties that the relevant pool of merchants to be considered was all merchants, not just those who take MasterCard cards, so that business stealing was a “zero sum game” (see [318]-[320] of the judgment).  </p>

The judge said, however, in the first sentence: “Visa did not adduce direct empirical evidence that Issuers have reduced their reward programmes because of the lowering of MIF levels following the introduction of the [Interchange Fee Regulation]”. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In fact, as Ms Rose demonstrated, there were internal reports from three issuing banks in evidence before the judge.  The first internal report was of a business unit committee meeting some two years before the Interchange Fee Regulation came into force, which referred to evidence from Australia and the United States where legislation reducing MIF rates had been introduced and the rewards to customers had reduced.  The report made the point that with a lower capped MIF, customers who were previously profitable would become loss-making.  One of the press reports produced by Dr Caffarra related to this bank and reported, three months before the Interchange Fee Regulation came into force, that it had halved rewards to customers in anticipation of the Interchange Fee Regulation. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The second internal report was from a consultant to another issuer in March 2015, articulating similar concerns about the impending regulation, and referred to what had happened when similar legislation had been introduced in Australia and the United States and suggested that the UK market response would be similar.  The consultant made a bold proposal that the bank should not cut cardholder benefits in response to the Interchange Fee Regulation in order to seize market share, but that proposal was not accepted.  Dr Caffarra produced a press report showing that that bank had cut its customer rewards by 60% and blamed the Interchange Fee Regulation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The third report was a minute of a strategic management committee meeting of a third issuing bank in April 2014, making the same point that what was currently a profitable model would cease to be so if the Interchange Fee Regulation went ahead.  The report expressed reluctance on the part of the bank to cut its rewards to customers, but the press report produced by Dr Caffarra showed that it nevertheless did so.  </p>

Mr Hoffman gave specific evidence about how, on past occasions when there were reductions in MIF rates, Barclaycard had cut its rewards to its customers in response.  Mr Evans gave evidence from his experience about the correlation between the level of interchange fee income and the level of customer rewards.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is clear that the judge has failed to deal with that factual evidence, which provided cogent support for what was said in the press reports.  The first sentence of [45(a)] is, therefore, wrong and cannot stand.  We consider that the judge was unduly dismissive of the press reports.  Overall, the judge’s statement at the end of [45(a)] that this material (the press reports) is “the <span style="text-decoration:underline">very best</span> evidence Visa adduced to demonstrate a link between MIF levels and the extent to which issuers utilise the 6 “channels”” was incorrect. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The other channel on which Ms Rose focused was innovation, which included the development of Contactless.  Phillips J had said the following at [45(c)]: “Gary Hoffman … and Mr Evans gave evidence that the revenue from Interchange Fees was a primary driver in the decisions of Barclaycard to pursue Contactless as a proposition for credit cards, but it is unclear why they were not equally motivated by the far larger revenue generated in the form of interest from revolvers and costs savings for Issuers”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">We agree with Ms Rose that that is an inadequate summary of their evidence, particularly that of Mr Hoffman who was at Barclaycard when it was a pioneer in the development of Contactless.  In his witness statement and in cross-examination, he explained that the reason why it was initially developed for credit cards only was that credit cards generated revenue, by way of MIFs, to fund Contactless and MIF revenue was a crucial part of the business case for its innovation.  Mr Evans gave similar evidence and, when it was put to him in cross-examination that the MIF was not needed to introduce contactless technology, he said that Contactless would not have been a profitable enterprise without the MIF.  The judge did not deal with that factual evidence.  It cannot be said that in [45(c)] he has considered it, weighed its significance and then rejected it.  </p>

The judge did not refer to the evidence that, in other jurisdictions with lower MIFs, contactless cards and other technology took far longer to eventuate than in this country.   </p>

There was empirical evidence from customer surveys about the extent to which customers would be deterred from making online purchases with cards by additional security online and similar evidence from retailers about customer behaviour.  Both Mr Hoffman and Mr Evans gave evidence that Barclaycard would not have been prepared to invest in the online protection necessary for customers without MIF revenue.  There was also evidence from Mr Sheedy, a senior Visa executive, as to what happened to ecommerce when MIFs were reduced: “[issuers] threw sand in the online process because they would suffer the cost of it, i.e. fraud, and get no benefits”. </p>

This is not a case where the judge has set out or summarised the factual, empirical evidence before him and said, for example, that he does not accept it or given reasons for discounting it.  Rather, it is a case where, in a number of respects, he has overlooked empirical and factual evidence which was before the court, and made a number of general statements about the absence of any such evidence. </p>

The difficulty is that the judge appears to be making a sweeping statement about the complete absence of factual and empirical evidence as opposed to economic theory, which cannot be justified in the light of some of the evidence to which we have been referred by Ms Rose. In relation to issuer revenue, pass-through and always cards transactions, the judge was critical at [49] and [51] of the absence of empirical evidence and the quality of the expert and other evidence available, saying at [51]: </p>

It may be that, had he done so, he would still have reached the same conclusion, but it is impossible for this court to say that is inevitably so, and accordingly that is no answer to his failure to address the evidence in question.  </p>

This is a reference to the fact, recorded at [9] of Phillips J’s first judgment, that in closing submissions at the trial Sainsbury’s accepted that a UK MIF of up to 0.2% for debit cards and 0.19% for credit cards would be lawful.  </p>

Ms Rose pointed out that, as she had said to the judge in her closing submissions, Sainsbury’s had never advanced any pleaded case that only a zero MIF was lawful.  Its pleading had accepted, after correction by its expert, that MIFs of 0.19% for debit cards and 0.17% for credit cards were lawful.

He held that the claimants do not establish that the extent of their loss is the full amount of the MIF merely by establishing that the default MIFs as set were unlawful.  He said that, as the claim is for tortious damages, the principles of causation in tort apply.  It is, he said, for the merchants to establish the extent of their loss by reference to the extent of the unlawfulness; and so it is for the merchants to establish as their measure of loss the difference between, on the one hand, what MasterCard could lawfully have charged by setting an exemptible MIF and, on the other hand, the amount of the MIFs actually charged.  </p>

Accordingly, having concluded that below the following levels the default MIFs as set would be exempt under article 101(3) - UK Credit 1.01%, UK Debit 0.38%, Irish Credit 1%, Irish Debit 0.39%, EEA Credit 1.28%, EEA Debit 0.38% - rounding to the nearest basis point, the following levels of default MIF would be exemptible under article 101(3) for the purposes of calculating any damages claim - UK Credit 1.11%, UK Debit 0.42%, Irish Credit 1.10%, Irish Debit 0.43%, EEA Credit 1.41%, EEA Debit 0.42%. </p>

MasterCard says that it is always open to the merchants to show that no positive MIF would meet the criteria for exemption, for example, by showing that the MIF did not generate any relevant benefits or the benefits were insufficient to outweigh the costs of the MIF; and it will also be open to the merchants to put forward evidence and analysis indicating that an exemption could be justified within a range but only up to an identified maximum. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">We also agree with Phillips J that, in any event, as a matter of principle, the burden of proving any particular exemptible level of default MIF for the purpose of assessment of damages should lie on the scheme rather than the merchant.  The burden of proving that some agreement, other than the actual agreement, would have been lawful should lie on the party putting forward that assertion.  Otherwise a heavy burden would be placed on the merchants, incompatible with the enforcement of competition legislation through private claims in national courts: see Case C-295/04 <span style="font-style:italic">Manfredi v Lloyd Adriatico SpA</span> [2007] Bus LR at [89]-[91].  It would require the merchants to prove a complex negative, namely the highest level at which the MIF would be exempt.  It would require the merchants to satisfy the court as to what the defendant could and would have done, that is to say something which on the face of it would be based on facts within the scheme’s knowledge.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">That makes no sense in the context of the requirement that, in order to prove an exemption under article 101(3), the defendant is required to lead precise empirical evidence and cannot rely simply on economic theories, such evidence being within the defendant’s own possession.  It would make no sense, in a case where the scheme cannot or in any event does not adduce evidence to establish any level of exemption under article 101(3), to impose the burden on the merchants, in order to recover damages for an undoubtedly unlawful default MIF charge, to have to establish the highest level at which the MIF would have been lawful.  As Mr Turner submitted, requiring the merchants to prove the cut-off between lawful and unlawful MIFs operated by the schemes, based on theoretical defences which the merchants do not accept, is unrealistic and excessively difficult. </p>

The cases cited by Popplewell J in support of that proposition, <span style="font-style:italic">SPE International Limited v Professional Preparation Contractors (UK)</span> [2002] EWHC 881(Ch) at [87], and <span style="font-style:italic">Blayney (t/a) Aardvark Jewelry) v Clogau St David’s Gold Mines Ltd</span> [2002] EWCA Civ 1007, [2003] FSR 19 at [31]-[34], were cases in which there was a lack of evidence on which the claimant could rely to prove loss.  In cases such as those with which we are concerned, the analysis under articles 101(1) and (3) will show what unlawful amount has been charged by way of the default MIF. </p>

The CAT regarded Sainsbury’s as an indirect purchaser, as regards the default MIF, but it is common ground that, for the purposes of the legal treatment of pass-on, Sainsbury’s is to be regarded as a direct purchaser.

The Supreme Court, allowing the appeal from the Court of Appeal, held that there was no relevant causal link which required the owners to bring that benefit into account.  Lord Clarke, giving the lead judgment, said (at [30]) that the essential question was whether there was a sufficiently close link between the owners’ interest in the capital value of the vessel and the interest injured by the charterers’ repudiation of the charter party, that is the prospective loss of income for a period of about two years.  He said that the relevant link was causation, and that the benefit to be brought into account must have been caused either by the breach of the charter party or by a successful act of mitigation.  There was nothing about the premature termination of the charter party which made it necessary to sell the vessel, either at all or at any particular time.  If the owners decided to sell the vessel, whether before or after termination of the charter party, they were making a commercial decision at their own risk about the disposal of an interest in the vessel which was no part of the subject matter of the charter party; and (at [34]) for the same reason the sale of the ship was not on the face of it an act of successful mitigation. </p>

Firstly, the Damages Directive has been incorporated into our domestic legislation through schedule 8A of the 1998 Act, which came into force on 9 March 2017.  Secondly, Parliament introduced a collective action procedure by the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (the “2015 Act”), which can facilitate a class action by indirect purchasers to whom an unlawful anti-competitive charge has been passed on.  Those provisions, inserting new sections 47B-47D in the 1998 Act, came into force on 1 October 2015.

First, whereas an economist might well define passon more widely (i.e. to include cost savings and reduced expenditure), the pass-on defence is only concerned with identifiable increases in prices paid by the claimants’ customers.  Secondly, the increase in price must be causally connected with the overcharge, and demonstrably so.  Reflecting the view of an economist, the CAT was effectively saying at [525]-[526] that, when it comes to compound interest claimed as damages, the award of such interest should reflect the fact that a significant portion of the cost of the MIF was absorbed internally by Sainsbury’s by savings and the like. </p>

One obvious feature of competition litigation is the almost ubiquitous presence of expert economic evidence, often of a complex and technical nature. Another common feature, related to the last one, is evidence as to the characteristics and dynamics of specific industries and markets. Mindful of these features, Parliament provided for the specialist competition tribunal to have a multi-disciplinary constitution. In this way panels have the potential to include not just lawyers but also, for example, distinguished economists, accountants or industry experts, selected for each case from the members appointed to the CAT by reason of their knowledge and experience in these areas. Expertise of this kind is of considerable assistance in understanding and resolving the difficult issues which are a common feature of competition litigation. This has long been recognised in the UK, the former Restrictive Practices Court having had a similar constitution. Although it is not impossible for a judge sitting on a case in the High Court to enlist the assistance of a court expert, this is relatively uncommon, and there are resource and other obstacles to the adoption of that course on more than very exceptional occasions. </p>

We are conscious that we have held that Popplewell J ought to have concluded on the evidence that he heard that MasterCard’s claim for exemption under article 101(3) failed.  Since, however, the schemes in the CAT case and in <span style="font-style:italic">Sainsbury’s v Visa</span> will have an opportunity to re-argue the article 101(3) exemption issue based on the principles set out in this judgment, we have considered whether MasterCard should have the same opportunity in <span style="font-style:italic">AAM v MasterCard</span>, even though it has not filed a Respondent’s Notice.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">We take the view that, despite what we have said above, it is not certain that, had Popplewell J had the benefit of this judgment and thus been fully aware of the need for empirical data and facts in order to prove an exemption, MasterCard’s case on article 101(3) would have failed in its entirety.  It is possible, bearing in mind the acceptance by Sainsbury’s and the CAT in the other two cases that there was a lawful level of MIF, that the judge would have found that there was some exemptible level of MIF, albeit a lower one than he in fact found.  Altogether removing the article 101(3) issue from reconsideration could therefore result in an unjustified windfall for the AAM parties.  It seems far more just to us that the issue should be reconsidered in all three cases, based on the same principles, by the same tribunal.  There is no real injustice to the AAM parties in the course we propose, since the windfall to which we have referred would have arisen from the procedural mishap caused by the separation of three cases raising almost identical issues.  If the CAT is now able to reach a consistent conclusion in all three cases on the exemption and quantum issues, that will produce a fair and just outcome for all the parties.  It would be a triumph of form over substance if we were to hold that we were unable to reach a just solution simply as a result of a procedural accident.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">We emphasise that the cases will be remitted for reconsideration and not for a retrial, so that it will not be open to any party to adduce fresh evidence before the CAT, save in respect of quantum in <span style="font-style:italic">Sainsbury’s v Visa</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">AAM v MasterCard</span>.  We note in that context that there was no application to adduce fresh evidence before this court.  We have, however, devoted some thought to the question whether the parties should be confined to the evidence that they adduced in each case, or entitled to rely on evidence that was adduced in the other two cases.  We have ultimately preferred the latter course on the basis that it would be unsatisfactory, in view of our decision that the cases should all be heard by the same tribunal at the same time in order to ensure consistency, if arbitrary results were reached as a result of the parties in each case being unable to rely on generic evidence from the other two cases that was equally applicable to both the schemes and to all merchants.  The CAT should be entitled to take such evidence into account in all three cases. <br/></p>

The Community competition rules have as their objective the protection of competition on the market and cannot be detached from this objective. Moreover, the condition that consumers must receive a fair share of the benefits implies in general that efficiencies generated by the restrictive agreement within a relevant market must be sufficient to outweigh the anti-competitive effects produced by the agreement within that same relevant market. Negative effects on consumers in one geographic market or product market cannot normally be balanced against and compensated by positive effects for consumers in another unrelated geographic market or product market.

This means that efficiencies are not assessed from the subjective point of view of the parties. Cost savings that arise from the mere exercise of market power by the parties cannot be taken into account. For instance, when companies agree to fix prices or share markets they reduce output and thereby production costs. Reduced competition may also lead to lower sales and marketing expenditures. Such cost reductions are a direct consequence of a reduction in output and value. The cost reductions in question do not produce any pro-competitive effects on the market. In particular, they do not lead to the creation of value through an integration of assets and activities.

According to the third condition of [article 101(3)] the restrictive agreement must not impose restrictions, which are not indispensable to the attainment of the efficiencies created by the agreement in question. This condition implies a two-fold test. First, the restrictive agreement as such must be reasonably necessary in order to achieve the efficiencies. Secondly, the individual restrictions of competition that flow from the agreement must also be reasonably necessary for the attainment of the efficiencies.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.13in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In the context of the third condition of [article 101(3)] the decisive factor is whether or not the restrictive agreement and individual restrictions make it possible to perform the activity in question more efficiently than would likely have been the case in the absence of the agreement or the restriction concerned. The question is not whether in the absence of the restriction the agreement would not have been concluded, but whether more efficiencies are produced with the agreement or restriction than in the absence of the agreement or restriction.  </p>

In making this latter assessment the market conditions and business realities facing the parties to the agreement must be taken into account. Undertakings invoking the benefit of [article 101(3)] are not required to consider hypothetical or theoretical alternatives. The Commission will not second-guess the business judgment of the parties. It will only intervene where it is reasonably clear that there are realistic and attainable alternatives. The parties must only explain and demonstrate why such seemingly realistic and significantly less restrictive alternatives to the agreement would be significantly less efficient.”  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The next issue was whether the MIFs restricted competition within the meaning of article 101(1).  At [401]-[407] the Commission considered it unnecessary to determine whether they were a restriction of competition by object, because it could be clearly established that they were a restriction by effect.  When compared with a counterfactual of a settlement at par rule and prohibition on <span style="font-style:italic">ex post </span>pricing, the MIFs reduced price competition in the acquiring market by inflating the base on which acquiring banks set charges to merchants ([408]-[410]).  Such a finding was consistent with the Commission’s previous case practice [412].  Further, it was supported by two separate quantitative analyses undertaken by the Commission, as well as a survey of more than 200 merchants concerning the impact of the MIFs on their negotiations with acquiring banks ([425]-[438]). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The Commission then rejected various arguments put by MasterCard as to why the MIFs did not restrict competition ([439]-[521]).  One such argument was that the MIFs were similar to an excise tax because they were “a common identical cost … that does not influence price competition between acquirers in terms of determining the level of [merchants’ service charges]”.  This argument was rejected for three reasons.  First, it ignored the fact that the MIFs were decisions by an association of undertakings.  Secondly, it would deprive article 101 of its <span style="font-style:italic">effet utile</span>.  Finally, the MIFs not only created an artificial common cost for acquirers and thereby set a floor on the merchants’ service charge, but also eliminated an element of uncertainty for acquirers, who knew that their competitors all paid the same fees ([455]-[460]).   </p>

This was demonstrated by the fact that several such schemes had operated successfully in Europe without MIFs ([548][619]).  Further, these schemes had not collapsed in the face of competition from closed systems (such as American Express and Diners Club), and so MasterCard’s argument to that effect was rejected ([620]-[647]).  Therefore, the MasterCard MIFs were a restriction of competition within the meaning of article 101(1), and were not objectively necessary for the main operation. </p>

The scheme had relied merely on economic theory, and had not produced empirical evidence sufficient to demonstrate that its theory held true in the real world.  Such evidence was required in the light of European Central Bank statistics showing that schemes operating without MIFs still had relatively good system output.  Requiring such evidence did not place an excessively high burden on MasterCard.  Therefore, whilst the Commission accepted that the MasterCard <span style="font-weight:bold">scheme</span> contributed to technical and economic progress, MasterCard had failed to demonstrate that such progress was causally linked to the MIFs, and the first condition of article 101(3) was not met ([670]-[733]). </p>

In a scheme where MIFs were paid by acquirers to issuers, this meant that the efficiencies must “in particular counterbalance the restrictive effects to the detriment of merchants”.  MasterCard had failed to demonstrate that this was the case.  Whilst merchants may have benefitted from enhanced network effects from the issuing side, this did not necessarily offset their losses sustained from paying inflated interchange fees.  It followed that it was unnecessary to examine whether cardholders sufficiently benefitted from the MIFs, and the second condition was not satisfied ([739]-[747]).   </p>

By way of remedy, the Commission required MasterCard to cease setting MIFs for intra-EEA and SEPA transactions (excluding on commercial credit and charge cards, in relation to which an investigation of possible efficiencies was ongoing) within 6 months of the decision.  No fine was imposed, but the company would be subject to a daily periodic penalty payment of 3.5% of its daily revenue in the prior business year in the event of non-compliance ([753]-[776]).  </p>

The plea fell into two parts, the first of which related to restrictive effects and the second of which related to the ancillary restraint doctrine.  The General Court dealt with the second part first.  It rejected MasterCard’s complaint that the Commission should have held that the MIFs were an ancillary restraint because it would have been difficult to implement the main operation without them.  <span style="font-style:italic">Metropole</span> had held that the only question was whether the restriction is necessary, and considerations relating to the competitive situation on the relevant market are not part of the analysis ([77]-[92]).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The General Court then turned to the first part of MasterCard’s first plea, which alleged various errors of assessment in the Commission’s analysis of the restrictive effects of the MIFs.  It upheld the Commission’s counterfactual (i.e. no default MIF, with a prohibition on <span style="font-style:italic">ex post</span> pricing) on the basis that it did not render the scheme economically unviable.  It explained that the Commission had referred in [460] to bilateral negotiations between issuers and acquirers merely in order to point out that interchange fees would cease to be charged in the counterfactual, and said that the Commission’s analysis was not manifestly incorrect ([129]-[134]).  Further, the Commission was entitled to take into account the fact that competition between schemes resulted in upward pressure on MIFs ([135]-[141]).  The General Court considered MasterCard’s argument that, because the MIFs operated as a cost common to all acquirers, they did not affect competition between acquirers, but merely the level of the merchants’ service charge.  It held that the Commission had not erred in concluding that the MIFs restricted competition by setting a floor under the merchants’ service charge, and thereby limiting the pressure which merchants could exert on acquiring banks.  The General Court rejected MasterCard’s challenges to the quantitative analyses and surveys which had underpinned the Commission’s findings ([142]-[147]).  Nor had the Commission been wrong to find that there was a distinct acquiring market; any “system output” arguments concerning the inter-relationship of the issuing and acquiring markets fell to be addressed under article 101(3) ([148][182]).  Finally, the General Court rejected various procedural complaints, with the result that MasterCard’s first plea was rejected in its entirety ([183]-[193]).  </p>

The first part alleged that the Commission had imposed an excessively high evidential burden on it, and the second that the Commission had made various manifest errors of assessment.  The General Court considered that it was not possible to examine the Commission’s approach in the abstract, and so dealt with both parts of the plea together ([193]-[198]).  It began by upholding the Commission’s approach to the first article 101(3) condition.  It was necessary to ask whether any benefits were specifically caused by the MIF, rather than the MasterCard system as a whole ([199][207]).  The Commission was entitled to conclude, on the evidence before it, that MasterCard had failed to prove a sufficiently close link between the MIFs and the objective advantages to merchants of accepting MasterCard cards ([208]-[226]).  In the absence of such proof, the Commission could not be criticised for failing to consider any benefits that the MIFs produced for cardholders ([227]-[229]).  Finally, the Commission’s approach had not imposed an excessively high evidential burden on MasterCard.  Indeed, it might be said that any such difficulty had resulted from the way MasterCard chose to put its case, which meant that it needed to prove a sufficiently close correlation between the MIF and the costs of providing issuing services, taking account of issuing banks’ card revenues from sources other than the </p>

The CJEU rejected this argument on the basis that it was wrong in law (the requirement being that it would be impossible to run the main operation without the restraint) and would undermine the effectiveness of the article 101(1) prohibition ([86]-[95]).  It then dealt with the second and third parts of the first plea, which sought to challenge the objective necessity counterfactual used by the Commission and upheld by the General Court.  MasterCard’s central argument was that the counterfactual should not have included an <span style="font-style:italic">ex post</span> pricing rule, because such a rule would not have been adopted without regulatory intervention.  The CJEU rejected this argument, considering that the objective necessity counterfactual is not limited to the situation that would arise in the absence of the restriction, and may extend to other realistic situations that might arise ([96]-[114]).  The fourth and final part of the first plea, which contended that the General Court had failed to apply the required standard of judicial review, was also rejected, meaning that MasterCard’s appeal failed in its entirety ([115]-[121]). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The CJEU then turned to the first plea in the cross-appeals, which maintained that the General Court had erred in law in its assessment of restrictive effects under article 101(1).  It was argued that the General Court had wrongly relied on the sole criterion of economic viability to justify including an <span style="font-style:italic">ex post</span> pricing rule in its counterfactual, and should have also asked whether such a rule would be likely to have occurred in the actual context.  Although the CJEU accepted this contention as a matter of law, </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">and agreed that the same counterfactual is not necessarily appropriate for the restrictive effect and ancillary restraint analyses, it upheld the restrictive effect counterfactual because it considered the operative part of the General Court’s decision to have been well-founded: there was no other postulated counterfactual, and nothing to suggest that MasterCard would have preferred to let its system collapse than adopt an <span style="font-style:italic">ex post</span> pricing rule ([122]-[175]).  An argument that the General Court had failed to recognise the importance of constraints from other payment systems was rejected, on the basis that it had expressly found at [137] that the Commission had been right to consider inter-system competition when analysing the effects of the MIF ([176]).  An argument that the General Court had failed to take into account the two-sided nature of the scheme was also rejected, since the criticisms presented to it had focused only on economic advantages arising from this aspect of the scheme, and such advantages are only relevant under article 101(3) ([177]-[182]).  Next, the CJEU disagreed with a submission that the General Court had conducted only a “short form analysis” of the anti-competitive effects of the MIFs: the General Court had not merely presumed that the MIFs set a floor under the merchants’ service charge, but had carried out a detailed examination to determine this was indeed the case ([183]-[194]).  Finally, the CJEU made clear that the General Court had not held that the MIFs were anticompetitive solely because they resulted in higher prices; what mattered was that those higher prices arose because the MIFs limited the pressure that merchants could exert on acquiring banks ([195]).  The first plea in the cross-appeals was therefore rejected ([196]-[199]). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The second plea in the cross-appeals related to article 101(3), and was expressed in three parts.  The first part (relating to the evidential burden on MasterCard) was rejected as inadmissible, on the basis that it merely repeated the same arguments put to the General Court and did not seek to explain how that court had erred in evaluating those arguments ([200]-[219]).  The second part alleged that the General Court had been wrong to focus solely on benefits to merchants, and to ignore benefits to cardholders, for the purposes of the first two conditions of article 101(3).  In respect of the first condition, the CJEU said that, in the context of a two-sided scheme such as MasterCard’s, benefits to both merchants and cardholders should be taken into account.  The General Court had not, however, ignored the latter, but had concluded that the evidence was insufficient to support MasterCard’s claimed efficiencies.  Further, having properly concluded that there was no proof that the MIFs produced any appreciable benefits for merchants, it was unnecessary for the General Court to consider benefits to cardholders, because benefits to a market other than the one harmed by the restriction cannot “in themselves” compensate for the harm.  The second part of the second plea was therefore rejected ([244]-[250]).  The third and final part, to the extent it was admissible, made similar arguments to those summarised above, and was also rejected.  Consequently, the cross-appeals were dismissed in their entirety ([251]-[259]). </p>
