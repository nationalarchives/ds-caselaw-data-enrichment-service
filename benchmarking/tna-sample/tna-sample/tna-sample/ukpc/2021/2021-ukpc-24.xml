The injunction granted in this case accordingly combined the features of being granted both after judgment was given and against a person against whom no cause of action existed (or had existed).

To ensure compliance with article 24 of the Brussels Convention on the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, section 25(1) of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 (the “1982 Act”) was enacted so as to provide that the High Court in England and Wales “shall have power to grant interim relief … where proceedings have been or are to be commenced in a Contracting State …”. Section 25(1) was brought into force in 1987 and at the same time the rules of court were amended to permit service of a writ out of the jurisdiction “where a claim is made for an interim remedy under section 25(1) of the [1982 Act]”. Section 25(3) made provision for the power conferred by section 25(1) to be extended by Order in Council to other proceedings; and in 1997 it was so extended to proceedings commenced or to be commenced anywhere in the world.</span>

To this classification Lord Brandon went on to specify two exceptions - the first being the power to grant an injunction to restrain foreign proceedings on the ground of forum non conveniens and the second being the power to grant freezing injunctions. While Lord Bridge of Harwich and Lord Brightman agreed without reservation with Lord Brandon’s speech, Lord Goff of Chieveley (with whom Lord Mackay of Clashfern agreed) was unwilling to accept that the power of the court to grant injunctions is restricted to certain exclusive categories, stating (at p 44G):</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif"> [1993] AC 334. The claimants, who had employed the defendant contractors to build the Channel tunnel, brought an action seeking an injunction to restrain the defendants from suspending work. The defendants applied for the action to be stayed on the ground that the dispute was one which the parties had agreed to arbitrate. The Court of Appeal granted a stay which the House of Lords upheld. One issue was whether in this situation, where the action had been stayed in favour of arbitration, the court had power under section 37(1) of the 1981 Act to grant an interlocutory injunction to restrain the suspension of work pending the decision of the arbitrators. The House of Lords held that there was such power, although it was not appropriate to exercise it on the facts of that particular case. The importance of the decision for present purposes lies in the rejection of the defendants’ argument, founded on Lord Diplock’s remarks in </span>

Lord Nicholls spelt out a principled basis for the practice of granting freezing injunctions which, until then, the courts had been struggling to articulate. His key point was that the essential purpose of a freezing injunction is to assist the enforcement through the court’s process of a money judgment (which is usually prospective): the claimant’s underlying cause of action is relevant only in so far as it bears on the prospect that such a judgment will be obtained.

It is relief granted to facilitate the process of execution or enforcement which will arise when, but only when, the judgment for payment of an amount of money has been obtained.

	      <span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif"> was whether the High Court had been entitled to grant an injunction to restrain the defendant from proceeding with a claim in arbitration to decide a matter which was the subject of litigation between the parties. The plaintiff sought to uphold the injunction on the ground that it was clear that the dispute was not within the scope of the arbitration agreement: hence any award made by the arbitrators could not be binding and, if allowed to proceed, the arbitration would be futile and vexatious. The Court of Appeal (Brett and Cotton LJJ) allowed the defendant’s appeal. Their reasoning, in summary, was that, before the 1873 Act, no court would have considered that going on with the arbitration would infringe any legal or equitable right of the plaintiff. Section 25(8) of the 1873 Act, despite its wide wording, was not intended to dispense with the need to point to a legal or equitable right which an injunction would protect, but only to ensure that, where there was such a right capable of being enforced independently of the Act, the High Court could grant an injunction to protect the right where it was just or convenient to do so. As there was no such right in that case, there was no ground for granting an injunction.</span>

In the 1970s, the UK still had exchange controls restricting the transfer of funds out of the country and electronic banking lay far in the future. Today the international transfer of funds is easy and almost instantaneous.

	      <span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">Whatever merit it might have had if the question was a new one, CCL’s argument that this rule encompasses a claim made for a freezing injunction comes far too late in the day. The common law does not operate on a principle of third time lucky. On the contrary, at its core is the doctrine of stare decisis, meaning “stand by what has been decided”. That doctrine remains as essential as ever to securing stability, consistency and predictability in the common law. The Board has never acted on a strict rule that it is bound by its own previous decisions, nor those of the House of Lords or Supreme Court; but the Board will not depart from a previous decision of its own or of the House of Lords or Supreme Court without compelling reason to do so: see Lord Mance and J Turner, </span>

Such a reason is unlikely to be found where the question concerns the meaning of a rule of court. Where the meaning of such a rule has already been settled at the highest level of judicial authority, litigants should be entitled to rely on that meaning in the knowledge that there is a procedure readily available for amending the rules, if necessary. The use of that procedure is generally the fairest and most efficient means of ensuring that the rules of court are kept up to date. (See also in this respect the warning by Lord Hailsham in </span>

That provision gives the High Court power to grant an injunction by “an interlocutory order … in all cases in which it appears to the court or judge to be just or convenient that the order should be made ...”. It would be hard to cast the power in wider terms than that. The EC Court of Appeal was persuaded by an argument that, in circumstances where section 24(1) makes no reference to the grant of injunctions in aid of foreign proceedings and no statutory provision similar to section 25 of the 1982 Act in the UK had been enacted in the BVI (although this has since changed), section 24(1) does not give the court power to grant such injunctions.

The question is whether there is any justification for treating the words “in all cases” as excluding a case where an injunction is sought in aid of foreign proceedings. The absence of legislation conferring a more specific power is not a reason to do so. Nor can the fact that such legislation has been enacted in the UK and some other common law jurisdictions (well after the BVI Act was enacted in 1969) have any bearing on the meaning of section 24(1) of the BVI Act.</span>

For example, under the Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act 1922 and the Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Ordinance 1964 in the BVI, a foreign judgment given in a country to which the legislation applies, on being registered in the High Court, has the same force and effect for the purposes of execution as if the judgment had been a judgment originally given in the High Court. Provided there are assets against which a judgment registered under this legislation could be executed through the process of the BVI court and a sufficient prospect that such a judgment will be obtained in the foreign court, there is just as much reason to grant a freezing injunction if it is needed to prevent execution of the judgment from being frustrated as there is where the initial proceedings are taking place in the High Court. Indeed, declining to assist where the proceedings are pending in the foreign court would not only be unprincipled but contrary to the spirit and arguably also the letter of the legislation providing for reciprocal enforcement.</span>

In the case of a freezing injunction, the relevant conduct always lies in the future, as the injunction seeks to pre-empt future dealings in assets that would frustrate enforcement of a judgment which is itself usually prospective. Once it is recognised that, as Lord Mustill put it, with a freezing injunction “the right to the injunction and the ultimate right to damages or whatever else is claimed in the action are wholly disconnected” (see para 90 above), there is no justification for requiring that a right to sue for damages or another form of money judgment must already have accrued before the injunction can be granted.

(Blenman JA thought it unnecessary to address this question.) Pereira CJ concluded that there was no proper evidence to support the judge’s finding that there was a good arguable case that the shares in Town Health held by Broad Idea (or any of them) are beneficially owned by Dr Cho.</span>

In his reasons for granting the injunction, the judge did not refer to any evidence capable of supporting an inference that Broad Idea does not beneficially own the shares in Town Health registered in its name. Nor did CCL identify any such evidence on this appeal. The high point of its case appeared to be the fact that Mr Choi had referred in affidavits filed on behalf of Broad Idea to “my investment” in Town Health. However, Mr Choi explained that the way in which his investment was made was by acquiring Broad Idea with Dr Cho for the purpose of making investments in Town Health. There is nothing in his evidence which suggests that the corporate structure put in place was not intended to reflect the reality of the chain of legal and beneficial ownership. The fact that - as it was put in CCL’s written case - Broad Idea is purely a holding company and its shareholding in Town Health “provides the source of value for” the shares in Broad Idea is not a reason to regard Town Health as a mere nominee; rather, the reverse. No reasonable basis has been shown for asserting that Dr Cho had any direct beneficial interest in any of the shares acquired by Broad Idea.</span>

The EC Court of Appeal upheld the decision to grant a freezing injunction against the company on the grounds that, if the claimants obtained a judgment, they could potentially have the share transfer reversed and enforce the judgment against the shares and that, in these circumstances, the claimants had an interest in preserving the value of the company’s assets in order to maintain the value of its shares.</span>

The practical purpose of granting a freezing injunction against the company in that case was to restrain the third party to whom its shares had been transferred from procuring the disposal of the company’s assets and thereby diminishing the value of its shares (against which a future judgment could potentially be executed). There would not have been a need to grant an injunction against the company if the shares had remained in the possession of the defendants, as in that event the freezing injunction granted against them would have restrained them from procuring the company to dispose of its assets (thereby diminishing the value of the shares) and no purpose would have been served by granting in addition a freezing injunction against the company itself.</span>

The freezing injunction initially obtained against him in the BVI had been discharged because he was not subject to the jurisdiction of the BVI court (see above) and no application had yet been made for such a freezing injunction against Dr Cho in Hong Kong, despite that being the obvious place in which to seek one. The fact that Dr Cho had absconded to Australia was no bar to applying for a freezing injunction against him in Hong Kong any more than it had precluded the application made in the BVI. In circumstances where Dr Cho remained free to dispose of or deal in any other way with his shares in Broad Idea, there was no justification for seeking to prevent conduct which would indirectly diminish the value of those shares.

That injunction restrains Dr Cho from (among other things) disposing of, dealing with or diminishing the value of his shares in Broad Idea. Dr Cho is accordingly restrained by that injunction from using his powers of control over Broad Idea to procure the company to deal with its shares in Town Health in a way which would reduce the value of his shareholding in Broad Idea. For Mr Choi knowingly to assist in such a transaction would also put him in contempt of the Hong Kong court. It is not evident that there is in these circumstances any need or warrant for granting, in addition, an injunction against Broad Idea. Any application for an injunction against Broad Idea, if said to be required to make the worldwide freezing injunction against Dr Cho effective, would in any event need to be made to the BVI court and/or the Hong Kong court on the basis of up-to-date evidence which reflects the current situation. It is not a matter suitable for determination by the Board on this appeal.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">The Siskina</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">, for the Board to reject the wider statements of principle made by Lord Diplock in that case would derogate from the value of certainty and consistency in the common law.

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">The Siskina</span>

Third, the view is expressed that, because the Board has ultimately concluded (unanimously) that the decision of the EC Court of Appeal to allow the appeal of Broad Idea should be upheld on the particular facts of this case, the “power issue” does not actually arise for decision and nothing said about it by the Board can amount to a binding precedent. In these circumstances the minority considers that the Board should allow the common law to develop in a more incremental way and should not “seek to put the clock back to 1977”.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">There are two main legal questions to be considered on this appeal. The first question is whether a court has the power at common law to grant a freezing or </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif"> injunction against a defendant when no substantive claim is made against that defendant in proceedings before the domestic court (the “power issue”). Such relief is said to be available in aid of existing or intended foreign proceedings or arbitration. The second question is whether, if such a power exists, the gateway allowing a claim form to be served out of the jurisdiction if “a claim is made … for an injunction ordering the defendant to do or refrain from doing some act within the jurisdiction” (Part 7.3(2)(b) of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court Civil Procedure Rules 2000 (“EC CPR”)) permits service out where the only claim made is for a freezing injunction (the “service out issue”). In two separate appeals, the Eastern Caribbean Court of Appeal (the “ECCA”) decided the power issue in favour of the first respondent, Broad Idea International Ltd (“Broad Idea”), a British Virgin Islands (“BVI”) company, and the service out issue in favour of the second respondent, Dr Cho Kwai Chee Roy (“Dr Cho”), a resident of Hong Kong.</span>

His order (the “second order”) prevented Broad Idea from dealing with any of its assets anywhere up to US$75.5m, changing its share register, and registering changes in its legal or beneficial share ownership. On 24 September 2019, Broad Idea filed its Notice of Appeal against Adderley J’s second order. Chivers J’s order against Broad Idea (continued by undertakings) lapsed after the hearing before Adderley J imposing a new wider injunction against Broad Idea.</span>

Brett LJ said, at p 36, that it was not necessary to decide whether section 25(8) had given power to issue an injunction in cases where no court could have issued an injunction before the 1873 Act, but his inclination was in the negative. Cotton LJ said, however, at p 39 that section 25(8) gave the court “power, if it should think it just or convenient, to superadd to what would have been previously the remedy, a remedy by way of injunction, altering therefore not in any way the rights of parties so as to give a right to those who had no legal right before, but enabling the court to modify the principle on which it had previously proceeded in granting injunctions, so that where there is a legal right the court may, without being hampered by its old rules, grant an injunction where it is just or convenient to do so for the purpose of protecting or asserting the legal rights of the parties”. In Cotton LJ’s view, “all that was done by [section 25(8)] was to give … the High Court power to give a remedy which formerly would not have been given in that particular case, but still only a remedy in defence of or to enforce rights which according to law were previously existing and capable of being enforced”. That was why he formulated the general principle as he did including the words “whatever may have been the previous practice”. It was a misunderstanding of </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif"> to think that it was authority for the proposition that section 25(8) gave no power to the court to grant an injunction in a case where no court could have granted one before the 1873 Act. Brett LJ left that question open, and Cotton LJ accepted that section 25(8) expanded the scope of the remedies which might be available.</span>

A right to obtain an interlocutory injunction is not a cause of action. It cannot stand on its own. It is dependent upon there being a pre-existing cause of action against the defendant arising out of an invasion, actual or threatened by him, of a legal or equitable right of the plaintiff for the enforcement of which the defendant is amenable to the jurisdiction of the court.

It held that a claim to an interlocutory injunction under section 37(1) was incidental to and dependent on the enforcement of a substantive right and could not exist in isolation. Although the substantive right usually took the form of a cause of action, it was not a necessary condition of the grant of such an injunction that it should be ancillary to a claim for relief to be granted by an English court. In doing so, the House distinguished between the English court’s power to grant relief and whether it will actually do so (p 342H). There was no reason in principle why an order for a mandatory stay of an action could not be combined with an injunction to secure interim relief. But whilst there was power under section 37(1) to grant the injunction sought by the claimant, it was not appropriate to grant it, since it would largely pre-empt the arbitrators’ ultimate decision under clause 67.</span>

He referred to Lord Mustill’s speech as demonstrating that “in the context of arbitration proceedings whether it is the court or the arbitrators which make such final determination will depend upon whether the defendant applies for a stay”, and said that the same was true of ordinary litigation based on a contract having an exclusive jurisdiction clause.</span>

The first defendant also owned a Hong Kong company, and Mercedes applied for and was originally granted a freezing injunction against him in Hong Kong, and leave to serve substantive proceedings out of the jurisdiction under various gateways not including the injunction gateway.

The question was whether the statutory enlargement of territorial jurisdiction created by Order 11, rule 1(1) “entitle[d] the court to permit the service of a writ … claiming such relief on the foreigner out of the jurisdiction, thus compelling him to choose between suffering a judgment in default or appearing before a court which has no other jurisdiction over him to argue that his assets should not be detained”. The second question assumed that the foreign defendant could be served either within the jurisdiction or by service out, and that the matters in dispute had no connection with the English court and could not be brought before it. The second question was whether the court had “power to restrain the free disposition of the defendant’s assets in England and Wales, to await the conclusion of proceedings brought against that person in a foreign jurisdiction”.</span>

The application must be supported by an affidavit stating that the claimant has a “claim” with a realistic prospect of success, to which the defendant can serve a defence. Other process, such as an application notice (perhaps including a claim for interim relief such as a freezing injunction), may be served out of the jurisdiction “in proceedings in which permission has been given to serve the claim form out of the jurisdiction”. A claim form can be issued and served without a statement of claim only if a date is stated by which it must be served. It is clear that EC CPR Part 7.3(2)(b) is referring to a substantive claim and a substantive claim form “for an injunction ordering the defendant to do or refrain from doing some act within the jurisdiction”.</span>

Section 25 of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 had come into effect on 1 January 1987 and had enabled the High Court in England and Wales to grant interim relief in support of claims made in courts other than those in England and Wales. The Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 (Interim Relief) Order 1997 (SI 1997/302), which came into force on 1 April 1997, enlarged the power of the High Court in England and Wales under section 25(1) to grant interim relief in aid of legal proceedings in other countries beyond those taking place in countries that were party to the 1968 Brussels Convention or the 1988 Lugano Convention. Para 3.1(5) of CPR PD 6B allowed service out of a claim form where a “claim is made for an interim remedy under section 25(1) of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982”.

Once it is established, as the Board has decided, that these proceedings cannot be served out of the BVI on Dr Cho, the only remaining claim is the one made against Broad Idea for a freezing injunction. As I have said, there is no substantive claim anywhere against Broad Idea. In these circumstances, one can see from the second judgment of the ECCA that (a) there was, on the facts, no sufficient basis for the conclusion that Broad Idea was merely holding assets to which Dr Cho was beneficially entitled, (b) Broad Idea’s assets were not amenable to any process of execution to satisfy any judgment that might be obtained against Dr Cho in Hong Kong, and (c) that there was therefore no basis for Adderley J’s finding of a risk of dissipation. The parties submitted further written argument after the hearing directed to these issues. I have reached the clear view that the Board has no basis to interfere with the factual conclusions reached by the ECCA at paras 57 and 61, notwithstanding the decision of the Hong Kong Court of Appeal to overturn the decision of Harris J and to impose a worldwide freezing order on Dr Cho.</span>

Accordingly, the majority’s ground-breaking exposition of the law of injunctions will not, as a matter of precedent, be binding on lower courts, but will be powerful obiter dicta. That, in my judgment is an unsatisfactory way to change the law in such an important area. I understand that, in one sense, the importance of the subject is precisely the reason why the majority feel so strongly that they should subscribe to the views expressed by Lord Leggatt. But I am concerned that the result will be a lack of clarity in many jurisdictions as to the consequences of such obiter dicta. These consequences have certainly not been the subject of argument before us.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">Thirdly, I am concerned that the majority has gone further than simply to explain and endorse the subsequent developments of the law enunciated by the courts since </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">The Siskina</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">, which is what I have sought to do. I understand Lord Leggatt’s view that it would be “putting the clock back if the Board were now to lend any credence to the notion that [Lord Diplock’s statements in </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">Siskina</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">] remain good law”. But Lord Leggatt has sought to provide a juridical foundation for the entire law of freezing and interlocutory injunctions, when the argument before us was limited (at most) to freezing injunctions in general and the circumstances of this case in particular. As I have already said, there are dangers in seeking to develop the common law in this way, however attractive it may be to the judges of a particular generation to do so. The main dangers are uncertainty in the common law, the effects caused by legislation in different jurisdictions having been drafted on the premise of a newly invalidated legal foundation, and deviation from the doctrine that previous decisions should only be departed from where it is essential to do so to decide the case before the court. I fear that it may take more litigation to sort out the ramifications of the majority’s decision. Whilst the process I advocate may be slower, it has the benefit of allowing the common law to develop incrementally according to the cases that come before the courts for decision. I entirely endorse Lord Leggatt’s desire to secure stability, consistency, certainty and predictability in the common law. We disagree only as to the best way in which that can be achieved.</span>
