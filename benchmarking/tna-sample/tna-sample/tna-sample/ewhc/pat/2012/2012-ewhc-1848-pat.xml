	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">In this action the Claimant (“Mylan”) seeks revocation of European Patent (UK) No. 0 762 888 (“the Patent”) and a declaration of non-infringement.  The First Defendant (“Yeda”) and the Second Defendant (“Teva”) are respectively the proprietor of, and the exclusive licensee under, the Patent. The Patent relates to a material known as copolymer-1 which was first described in 1971. Teva sells a product which it claims is protected by the Patent under the trade mark Copaxone (non-proprietary name glatiramer acetate) for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (“MS”). The purpose of this action is to enable Mylan to clear the way for the launch of its own generic glatiramer acetate in the United Kingdom. </p>

The result was a trial lasting 12 days (spread over 13 days, not including the court’s pre-reading time). It follows that this judgment is necessarily rather long. (For comparison, the combined length of the parties’ written closing submissions is 947 paragraphs and 266 pages.) </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">MS is an autoimmune disease. Autoimmune diseases are ones in which the body’s immune system malfunctions and is no longer able to make the distinction between the body’s own and foreign antigens. The result is that the body’s immune cells attack structures in the body itself. In MS there is an inflammatory response that leads to the removal of the sheath around nerves.  As this sheath is comprised of the protein myelin, this process is referred to as “demyelination”. Without the insulation provided by the myelin sheath, the nerve cells are not able to function correctly and control motor functions or to receive and relay information from the sensory systems. As  MS progresses, it causes multiple lesions or scleroses to form on the brain and spinal cord, hence the name. MS is a chronic and progressive disease. The neurological effects, progression and disabilities associated with the disease are diverse. They include cognitive, motor and sensory impairments.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">The clinical hallmarks of MS typically start in young adulthood. MS is usually characterised by episodes of neurological symptoms (called “relapses”) which often recover (or “remit”). This is referred to as “relapsing-remitting” MS (previously referred to as “exacerbating-remitting” MS).  Over time, however, there is less recovery after relapses, leaving patients with increasingly persistent deficits. At about the age of 40, the relapses become less frequent and the patient enters a phase of “secondary progression” in which he or she experiences slow accumulations of disability between relapses. A much rarer form of MS is “primary progressive” MS. This resembles the secondary progressive disease, but without the preceding relapses.  </p>

There is evidence, however, that its causes are complex and multifactorial, with factors such as the environment and the genetic susceptibility of the individuals implicated. </p>

EAE is an autoimmune disease which resembles MS. It can be induced in a number of animal species, including mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits and primates, by the injection of brain or spinal cord tissue.  The encephalitic agent was identified in the early 1960s as myelin basic protein (“MBP”), thus enabling EAE to be induced by administration of MBP. The immune response destroys the myelin in the central nervous system and the animals show increasing symptoms of neurological failure. </p>

Basophils and mast cells are both involved in the development of Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergic reactions (also known as immediate-type hypersensitivity). Initial exposure to an allergen induces B-cells to produce specific IgE antibodies which bind to the surface of mast cells and basophils.  Upon subsequent exposure to the same allergen, the allergen binds and cross-links the surface-bound IgE antibodies. This initiates a cascade of intracellular events leading to the release of chemical mediators such as histamine and serotonin – a process called “degranulation”.

In order to do so, polypeptides are broken down into their constituent amino acids, usually by use of aqueous acids to cleave the peptide bonds. Once this has been done, the amount of each amino acid can be measured, by either ion exchange chromatography (IEC) or high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In the IEC method, the retention time of each amino acid is determined by running known amino acid standards through the column. As the amino acids exit the column, they are derivatised with a compound that provides colour, such as ninhydrin. In the HPLC method, they are derivatised prior to chromatography, for example with phenylisothiocynanate to form phenylthiocarbamyl (PTC) derivatives which absorb in the UV. In both methods the amount of each amino acid can be quantified by the absorbance of light in a spectrophotometer.  The response of the spectrophotometer can be calibrated against the response of a known amount of a known amino acid, allowing the amount in the sample to be calculated. </p>

It separates molecules on the basis of their size in solution (referred to as “hydrodynamic volume”). The sample is passed though a column packed with a porous separation gel.  The gel beads in the column have pores that allow molecules to enter to varying degrees depending on a particular molecule’s size.  Small molecules enter the beads to a greater degree and thus take longer to pass through the column.  Larger molecules bypass the small pores and therefore exit the column earlier. The length of time it takes for the polymer to pass through the column is called the retention or elution time.  The concentration of polymer exiting the column over time is typically measured using an ultraviolet (UV) or refractive index (RI) detector. The raw output of an SEC analysis is therefore a plot of the detector response versus elution time (referred to as a chromatogram).  </p>

Likewise, two chemically distinct polymers having different molecular weights but the same size in solution may elute together. Further, solution conditions such as pH can affect the size and shape of a polymer, especially if the polymer is made up of monomers having a positive or negative charge.

Determination of the intrinsic viscosity of both the sample and the standard allows accurate determination of the sample’s molecular weight. This requires an online viscometer, an expensive piece of equipment which not every laboratory had in 1994, but was nevertheless fairly widely available. Secondly, calibration can be conducted by determination of the “Mark-Houwink coefficients”. These constants are the slope and intercept of the plot of log molecular weight against the log of intrinsic viscosity. These coefficients can then be used to determine molecular weight directly from intrinsic viscosity. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">In statistics, precision is quantified by the standard deviation (σ) of the data from the mean (μ). A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be very close to the mean, whereas high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a large range of values. In a normal distribution, the distribution can be divided into bands, each of which has a width of one standard deviation as shown below (source Wikipedia): </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">It is common to express the precision of an experimental measurement in terms of its relative standard deviation (sometimes called the “coefficient of variation”) expressed as a percentage. This is obtained by dividing the standard deviation by the mean and multiplying by 100. The lower the percentage, the more precise the measurement. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">The main differences between the parties concern the synthetic chemist and the analytical chemist with expertise in amino acid analysis. So far as the synthetic chemist is concerned, the Defendants contend that he would have experience of polypeptide chemistry, since the Patent relates to a known synthetic polypeptide, namely copolymer-1. This contention is supported by Prof Sampson. Mylan contends that such experience is not necessary. This contention is supported by Prof Hunter. While I accept Prof Hunter’s evidence that a person with sufficient experience in synthesising polydisperse polymers should be able to make copolymer-1 even if he did not have experience with polypeptides, I think it is clear that experience in polypeptide synthesis would be an advantage. Accordingly, I agree with the Defendants that the relevant member of the team would be likely to have at least some experience of this. As counsel for Mylan submitted, however, this makes little difference to the reasoning below. </p>

The Defendants contend that he would only need to have experience in interpreting amino acid analyses, since the actual analysis could be contracted out. This contention is supported by the evidence of Prof Sampson. The real difference between the parties, however, is not as to whether the analysis could be contracted out or not. Plainly it could be. What matters is the level of expertise of the analytical chemist in interpreting the results. So far as that is concerned, I consider that he would be likely to have a level of expertise intermediate between that of Prof Kent (who, as discussed below, is a leader in the field) and that of Prof Sampson (who, as discussed below, had relatively little experience of the technique).     <span style="text-decoration:underline">The expert witnesses</span></p>

Yet further, there is some overlap between some of Mylan’s witnesses. Still further, both counsel submitted that a witness called by the other side possessed greater expertise on a topic than another witness called by that side.

I do not find this a helpful approach. It is frequently invoked and Mr Waugh Q.C. invoked it in this case in an effort to downgrade Rockwater's expert evidence on obviousness given by Professor Witz. Mr Waugh said his witness, Mr Nash, was more appropriately qualified than Professor Witz, and that the latter, because he had patents in his name, ‘was of an inventive turn of mind’. </p>

They then proceeded to serve a witness statement from Dr Altmann as part of Mylan’s first round of evidence in which he described the statistical analyses he carried out. It is obvious that the reason why they took the course of serving a witness statement from Dr Altmann was that Mylan had only sought and obtained permission to call five experts, and Dr Altmann would have been a sixth. To try and camouflage the fact that Dr Altmann’s evidence was really expert evidence, his witness statement was drafted so as merely to report the results of his analysis. Thus it contained no overt expression of opinion on the part of Dr Altmann as to suitability of the method of analysis he used (an analysis of risk ratios) or as to the significance of his analyses.  </p>

Furthermore, in the absence of the important reservation expressed by Dr Altmann in his expert report, the impression was wrongly given by Dr Altmann’s witness statement, particularly when read together with Dr Coles’ first report, that Dr Altmann considered that his analyses could be relied upon to support Dr Coles’ conclusions.

When she joined Teva, she was appointed as a Project Manager with responsibility for, among other things, the copolymer-1 project. As such, she was responsible for coordinating all the various activities relating to the development of copolymer-1 as a drug for MS. She remained in that role until Copaxone was placed on the market in the US in 1997. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">The Defendants contend that it was common general knowledge to the clinician that the immunogenic properties of polypeptides were relatively insensitive to the amount of tyrosine present. The evidential basis for this contention is two-fold. First, Prof Schellekens expressed the opinion that it was well known to those who had an interest in the immunogenicity of polypeptides that the scientists at WIS had shown in the 1960s that this was the case. This proposition was not put to Dr Coles, however. In any event, I was not persuaded by Prof Schellekens’ evidence that this was common general knowledge. He did not refer to any textbook or other literature to support his opinion. Furthermore, he explained that, although he had not trained as an immunologist, he had specialised in the immunogenicity of therapeutic proteins for the last 20 years. In those circumstances I accept that the WIS work was well-known to him and others like him, but I do not accept that this establishes that it would be well-known to the clinical member of the skilled team. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Secondly, Prof Arnon said that she and Prof Sela had shown that the immunogenicity of samples of polytyrosyl gelatins containing 5% and 10% tyrosine was essentially the same, citing their paper “Studies on the Chemical Basis of Antigenicity of Proteins 2. Antigenic Specificity of Polytyrosyl Gelatins”, <span style="font-style:italic">Biochem. J.</span>, (1960), 75, 103-110.  The latter point was put to Prof Kent, who agreed that he had no reason to contradict Prof Arnon’s evidence. Neither Prof Arnon’s evidence nor the cross-examination of Prof Kent suggested, however, that this work would have been common general knowledge to a member of the skilled team in 1994, still less that the skilled person would have regarded it as applicable to the immunogenicity of tyrosine.    </p>

Prof Kent said that he would expect any laboratory with the capability to conduct amino acid analysis to achieve “reproducibility of  ±5% or better” (by which I understood Prof Kent to mean that the experimental result should not differ from the true result by more than 5% of the true result). </p>

The participating laboratories used 43 instruments of various different makes. They also used two different chemical methods (involving ninhydrin and PTC respectively). The participating laboratories were asked to analyse differing quantities of two unidentified samples, one pre-hydrolysed and one not. The authors analysed the results for accuracy (calculated as average % error for all amino acids measured except two) and “precision” (calculated as average % standard deviation). For the unhydrolysed sample, the average % error ranged from 9% (5 μg analysed) to 15% (0.2 μg analysed) for all responses and the average % standard deviation ranged from 21% to 29.4% for all responses. For the pre-hydrolysed sample, the corresponding figures were 15% (4 μg analysed) to 20% (0.1 μg analysed) and 16% to 25.7%. As the authors commented at 53, surprisingly it was found that there was a greater error with the pre-hydrolysed sample, although the “precision” was superior. As the authors also pointed out at 53, the data are not separated into intra- and inter-laboratory data i.e. the results for “precision” conflate repeatability and reproducibility.

There is a sharp dispute, however, as to whether the skilled SEC analyst would regard peak molecular weight (M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">p</span>) as an average molecular weight. The evidence of both Prof Hunter and Dr Hunt in their first reports was that M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">p</span> was (i) not an average molecular weight and (ii) not referred to as such.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">So far as the first point is concerned, Prof Grant said (a) that “average” included mean, median and mode, and (b) that M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">p</span> was the mode of the molecular weight distribution in an SEC analysis. Prof Hunter, to whom most of the Defendants’ crossexamination on this topic was directed, agreed with (a) as a matter of mathematics and with (b) as a description of the SEC experiment (although, as he explained, care is needed about this, since the mode of the molecular weight distribution is only the same as the mode of the chromatogram if the calibration curve is linear). He did not agree, however, that M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">p</span> was an average molecular weight. He pointed out that M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">n</span>, M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">w</span> and M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">z </span>are all properties of the material, whereas M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">p</span> is a feature of the SEC experiment. He explained that it is important to distinguish between polymers which are close to monodisperse and those which are polydisperse. In the case of the former, one can approximate M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">p</span> to M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">n </span>and M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">w</span>. In those circumstances it is commonplace to take M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">p</span> as representing the “molecular weight” of the polymer. Indeed, this is the whole basis of calibration using narrow standards.  In the case of the latter, one cannot use M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">p </span>quantitatively to characterise the polymer, although one can use it in a relative manner. </p>

More were produced by the Defendants for the purposes of cross-examining Prof Hunter and Dr Hunt. It is manifest that many of these papers had been located by means of electronic searches for the term “peak average molecular weight”, or similar expressions. They covered a long period of time (1971 to 2007) and an astonishing range of subject matter (in fields such as coated gold nanoclusters, extracts from oak heartwood, the drying properties of metathesised soybean oil and polymers used for dental prostheses), but none of them was concerned with measuring the average molecular weight of a protein or polypeptide. Prof Hunter was cross-examined on a number of these papers. He accepted that they showed use of the term “peak average molecular weight”, or similar expressions, by their authors. He did not accept that any of them showed use of M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">p</span> as an average molecular weight accurately to characterise a polydisperse polymer.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">As counsel for Mylan submitted, what is most telling is that not a single textbook was produced describing M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">p</span> as an average molecular weight. To the contrary, extracts from a number of textbooks on SEC are in evidence, all of which are to the opposite effect. For example, section 1.4 of Billingham, <span style="font-style:italic">Molar Measurements in Polymer Science</span> (Kogan Page, 1977) entitled “Definitions of average molar masses” explains the definitions of M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">n</span>, M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">w</span> and M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">z</span> and also refers to M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">v</span>. It does not refer to M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">p</span>, which is discussed elsewhere. When I asked Prof Grant about this, he mentioned (having thought about the matter overnight) a chapter in <span style="font-style:italic">Remington’s Pharmaceutical Sciences</span>. It turned out that he was referring to a chapter entitled “Statistics” by Randolph and Ciminera (it is not clear to me from which edition), an extract from which was appended to a Teva document describing an SEC method. But this made no reference to “peak average molecular weight”, or indeed to SEC at all. All it showed was that, for a normal distribution, the mean coincides with the peak (as shown in the illustration below paragraph 75 above).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">The first was whether a further method of calibration was common general knowledge. This is calibration using a range of broad self-standards.

Dr Hunt disagreed with this in his second report. Counsel for the Defendants submitted that Dr Hunt had accepted it in cross-examination, while counsel for Mylan submitted that the materials relied on by Prof Grant did not support his assertion except where the chromatogram peak is a log normal distribution, in which case one can take the square root of M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">n</span> and M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">w</span> as M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">p</span>. </p>

That passage concerns the case where the peak is log normal, and it states that where this is not the case “M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">peak</span> is not calculated simply”. In cross-examination Prof Grant accepted that the books he had referred to and the passage in Dawkins at 90-91 were describing the case where the peak is log normal, but nevertheless suggested that there was an iterative process for assigning it in other cases. In re-examination he identified this as a procedure described in Dawkins at page 92.

It is well established that is not itself objectionable. If a claim is truly ambiguous, so that it is unclear what is the correct test to determine whether or not a product or process infringes, however, then the claim is insufficient, as discussed below.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Each of the claims requires the presence or production of “copolymer-1”. The Patent states at [0003] that “Copolymer-1 is a mixture of polypeptides composed of alanine, glutamic acid, lysine and tyrosine in a molar ratio of approximately 6:2:5:1.” What is the meaning of “approximately 6:2:5:1”? Mylan’s primary contention is that, for the reasons explained below, the word “approximately” covers compositions in which the molar fraction of any single amino acid does not differ from 6:2:5:1 by more than <span style="text-decoration:underline">+</span>10%, with the result that Mylan’s product does not infringe. Mylan’s secondary contention is that, if this is not correct, the Patent fails to provide any criterion by which to determine what is covered by the word “approximately”, and thus is ambiguous. The Defendants’ contention is in essence that the word “approximately” means what it says, and reflects the fact that copolymer-1 is a random copolymer whose composition is not precisely defined. Thus the skilled reader would understand that, in this respect, the claims have a fuzzy boundary. The skilled reader would also understand, however, that the claims embrace compositions in which the molar ratios of the amino acids (as distinct from the molecular weight distributions) correspond to those of the prior art copolymer-1 compositions referred to in the Patent. These broad contentions generated a number of sub-issues and a considerable volume of evidence. </p>

Accordingly, the burden of interpretation would primarily fall on the analytical chemist with expertise in amino acid analysis and the synthetic chemist.

Furthermore, the skilled team would see from the Patent that copolymer-1 even according to the invention has a fairly broad molecular weight distribution. In my view this casts considerable doubt on Prof Kent’s approach, since the skilled team would not expect repeat syntheses to produce the same composition. In any event, as noted above, it is common ground that the skilled team would not rely simply on their reading of the Patent and their common general knowledge, but would look to the cited prior art for any guidance on this point. </p>

A number of points are made in support of this contention, which may be summarised as follows. First, the specification describes what is disclosed in these documents at [0001]-[0002] as “copolymer-1” before going on to define “copolymer-1” as having a molar ratio of “approximately 6:2:5:1” in [0003].

In this regard, it is common ground that the variation in the proportion of lysine in Teitelbaum 1971 Batch II from that in a composition of exactly 6:2:5:1 exceeds Prof Kent’s 10% threshold: on Prof Kent’s approach to the comparison (as to which see below), it is 16%. </p>

A number of points are made in support of this contention. First, the skilled reader would place most weight on Bornstein 1987, since this was the landmark study establishing the efficacy of copolymer-1 in humans and since it was the nearest in time to the Patent. The skilled reader would note that the composition used for this trial corresponded to Batch I of Teitelbaum 1971, and would presume that there was some reason for this. Secondly, and by contrast, the skilled reader would note that Teitelbaum 1971 Batch II is not reported to have been used in a study involving human beings, and indeed is not referred to at all in any of the other cited publications. Thirdly, the skilled reader would not think that it was possible to draw any meaningful conclusion as to the variability of the synthesis of copolymer-1 from the limited information in Teitelbaum 1971. Fourthly, the skilled reader would note that there was no change in the proportion of tyrosine between Batch I and II in Teitelbaum 1971. Thus, even if the skilled reader concluded that Teitelbaum 1971 told him something useful about the variability of the synthesis of copolymer-1, he would understand that the variability did not affect the proportion of tyrosine. Fifthly, the skilled reader would note that tyrosine is present in a lower relative amount than the other amino acids, and so any variation in tyrosine would be expected to be lower on an absolute basis. Lastly, the skilled reader would think that the molar ratio of Batch II was better described as approximately 7:2:4:1.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">So far as this sub-issue is concerned, I find the points relied on by the Defendants more persuasive than those relied on by Mylan. So far as Mylan’s first two points are concerned, none of the documents identify any reason why Bornstein 1987 used a composition corresponding to Teitelbaum 1971 Batch I and not Batch II, and Teitelbaum 1971 suggests that Batch II should be equally efficacious in humans. As to the third point, the information given by Teitelbaum 1971 is limited, but it is the most pertinent information on this point. As for the fourth and fifth points, these are driven by Mylan’s non-infringement argument, which is based on the proportion of tyrosine in its product. It is not legitimate to construe the claim by reference to the alleged infringement, however. Furthermore, these points are inconsistent with Prof Kent’s 10% interpretation, which involves treating all the amino acids in the same way. Yet further, the tyrosine proportion of Batches I and II is not identical, as can be seen from the table above. (Both molar ratios have tyrosine as one because both ratios are normalised with respect to tyrosine.) In any event, I do not think the skilled reader would conclude from Teitelbaum 1971 that the variability in tyrosine, at least in relative terms, was necessarily less than the variability in the other amino acids. The skilled reader would be more likely to conclude that the fact that the proportion of tyrosine was more similar in Batches I and II than, say, the proportion of lysine was down to chance.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">The fifth sub-issue concerns the manner in which differences in molar ratios should be assessed. The evidence and arguments in relation to this sub-issue became very elaborate during the course of trial. The core of the dispute, however, concerns two questions. The first question is whether the skilled reader would consider the difference in the proportion of each amino acid as a percentage of that proportion (i.e. the difference relative to that amino acid) or the difference as a percentage of the whole composition (i.e. the difference relative to the whole). For convenience I will refer to these as “relative difference” and “absolute difference” respectively. Take, for example, a sample in which the molar fractions expressed as percentages are 42.7, 14.4, 33.6 and 9.2 (as in Mylan’s batch GMA2 referred to below). The relative difference in tyrosine compared to a molar ratio of 6:2:5:1 is 29.6% (9.2 – 7.1 as a percentage of 7.1), whereas the absolute difference in tyrosine is 2.1% (9.2 – 7.1). Prof Kent supported the former approach, whereas Prof Sampson supported the latter approach. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">In addition, Prof Kent’s approach is supported by the fact that, as Prof Sampson accepted, the conventional approach to questions of repeatability and reproducibility in amino acid analysis is to look at the molar fraction for each amino acid, i.e. the relative difference. Indeed, as counsel for Mylan submitted, it is striking that neither the papers such as Crabb nor Teva’s disclosure documents that are in evidence adopt the approach of looking at the absolute difference. Furthermore, as Prof Kent pointed out, looking at the absolute difference ignores the relative abundance of the amino acid. This is particularly significant in the case of the least abundant, namely tyrosine. Finally, Prof Sampson’s approach of comparing the total absolute differences of all four amino acids seems to have very little logic to it at all. Prof Sampson sought to justify it in her oral evidence by drawing an analogy with comparisons between proteins, but I did not find this persuasive. </p>

If the skilled reader allowed for a 10% error in analysis, Prof Kent’s own logic would lead to a 20% limit; and if he allowed for a 15% error, that would lead to a 30% limit. The second problem concerns premise (c). For the reasons given above, I consider that the skilled reader would appreciate from the Patent and his common general knowledge that copolymer-1 did not consist of a single species, but rather a random mixture of different species, and would note from Teitelbaum 1971 that two batches synthesised in an identical manner had appreciably different molar ratios.

It is quite true that the mixture is complex in that it contains chains of varying length and varying amino acid sequences as well as varying proportions of amino acids. Variations in length and sequence are relatively unimportant for this purpose, however, since what we are concerned with is the molar ratio of the four amino acids taken as an average across the mixture. It is also quite true that the average reflects the presence of a variety of different species in terms of amino acid proportions. The real mixture does not contain chains with non-integral numbers of amino acids, however. On the contrary, each chain has an integral number of amino acids. Thus in my opinion, provided it is kept firmly in mind that they are a simplification of a more complex situation, Prof Sampson’s illustrations are helpful in showing the effect of changes in molar ratio in terms of numbers of amino acids. </p>

As stated above, I agree with Prof Kent that one of the flaws of Prof Sampson’s approach based on absolute differences is that it ignores the relative abundance of the amino acids and that this is particularly significant in the case of the least abundant, tyrosine. What Prof Sampson’s second illustration shows, however, is that, precisely because tyrosine is the least abundant, a change in a single amino acid from lysine to tyrosine can result in a relative difference in tyrosine of 29.6% and change the molar ratio from 6:2:5:1 to 4.6:1.6:3.7:1.0. For this reason, I consider that the skilled reader would be inclined to accept a greater deviation, expressed in terms of relative difference, in the proportion of tyrosine as being encompassed by “approximately 6:2:5:1” than in the case of the other amino acids.   </p>

The skilled team would consider that the word “approximately” was intended to cater for variations in both amino acid analysis and the synthesis of copolymer-1. They would proceed on the basis that the inventors might well be intending to allow for a level of error in analysis of greater than <span style="text-decoration:underline">+</span>5%. As for the variability in synthesis, they would not think it was appropriate to take twice the variance in the analysis as marking the limit of compositions that could properly be regarded as constituting copolymer-1. They would take into account the effect of changes in molar ratio in terms of numbers of amino acids as shown by Prof Sampson’s illustrations, and as a result would be inclined to accept a greater deviation in the proportion of tyrosine than in the case of the other amino acids. Accordingly, the skilled team would conclude that the claim was one that had a fuzzy boundary. It is therefore not possible to say precisely where that boundary lies. What can be said is that in my judgment the skilled team would not regard a relative difference in tyrosine of 29.6%, as in the case of batch GMA2, as taking the batch outside the claim.

In contrast, the other types of averages require calculation and the Patent is silent about any such calculation. As both Prof Hunter and Dr Hunt pointed out, however, SEC instruments in 1994 generally had software which calculated all these values.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Fourthly, in traditional polymer chemistry, it is common practice for both M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">n</span> and M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">w</span> values to be quoted (or for one value to be given together with the PDI), so as to indicate the degree of polydispersity.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Fifthly, the legends of Figures 1 and 2 identify the curves as being of samples of “average molecular weight” of 7.7 and 12.0 kDa. In the case of Figure 1, the peaks of the curves appear to be at approximately 7 and just over 10 kDa respectively. Prof Grant opined that this would support the skilled reader’s view that the average in question was M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">p</span>. He gave an explanation for the discrepancies between the molecular weights quoted and the apparent peaks of the curves in Figure 1. This was that<span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif"> </span>the Figure had been created by dividing the original chromatogram into a small number of slices and plotting a graph of the percentage of the sample attributable to a particular slice against the molecular weight of that slice. The accuracy of this method will depend on the number of slices of the chromatogram taken. When only a few slices are taken, the precise positioning of the peak of the molecular weight distribution will not necessarily correspond precisely to the peak of the chromatogram. In the case of Figure 1, the peak of the 7.7 kDa curve is at nearly 14% of the total mass of the sample. Unless this figure was created from a small number of wide slices, the area under the curve would be greater than 100%. In his second report Prof Hunter agreed that Figure 1 appeared to have been prepared in the manner described by Prof Grant and that this indicated that there was some error in the position of the peaks of the curves.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Prof Hunter’s opinion was that it was unclear from the specification what was meant by “average molecular weight”. His expectation was that this was a reference to either M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">n</span> or M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">w</span>. He did not think that it was M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">p</span> because he did not consider M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">p </span>to be an average molecular weight. <span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller"> </span>In an attempt to ascertain whether “average molecular weight” meant M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">n</span> or M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">w</span>, he conducted an experiment using the Figures. This involved putting tracing paper over each Figure, marking the position of about 20 points on the curve, obtaining x and y values for these points using graph paper, converting every pair of sequential data points into the bars of a histogram and using the histogram to calculate the M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">n</span>, M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">w</span> and M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">z</span> values. In addition, he estimated the positions of each peak to obtain M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">p</span>. He subsequently repeated the exercise. The results were summarised by Prof Hunter in his first report as follows: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">This experiment led to an elaborate dispute between Prof Hunter and Prof Grant.

In his third report, however, Prof Hunter came to the conclusion as a result of further analysis of the Figures undertaken by him in response to Prof Grant’s second report that this was not correct. Prof Hunter proceeded to explain his analysis further in his fourth report in reply to Prof Grant’s third report. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">In summary, Prof Hunter explained in his third and fourth reports that there are two forms of differential molecular weight distribution, w(M) and x(M). w(M) represents the molecular weight distribution as a function of molecular weight M, while x(M) represents the log of the molecular weight distribution as a function of log molecular weight. Accordingly, it is usual to plot w(M) against M and x(M) against log M. If x(M) is plotted against M, the effect is that the curve acquires a high molecular weight tail and the peak also shifts. Standard equations can be used to calculate M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">n</span> and M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">w</span> from a plot of x(M) against log M or from a plot of w(M) against M.  If x(M) is plotted against M, then an adjustment has to be carried out in order to determine M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">n</span> and M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">w</span>. A plot of x(M) against log M has the same shape as the chromatogram assuming that the calibration curve is linear, and hence the peak of such a plot is M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">p</span>.  If the plot is of w(M) against M, however, a conversion must be carried out to estimate M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">p</span>.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Prof Hunter’s opinion was that Figure 1 in the Patent is a plot of w(M) (multiplied by a scaling factor) against M. He accepted that there was no information in the Patent which made it clear whether Figure 1 was a plot of a scaled version of w(M) against M or a scaled version of x(M) against M. He believed that Figure 1 was of the former type because it was conventional to plot w(M) against M rather than x(M) against M, and the x axis in Figure 1 was labelled as “molecular weight”.  Furthermore, that would be particularly appropriate given the prominence of average molecular weight and molecular weight distribution characteristics in the Patent and would mean that one could read off from the curves the relative proportion of species present at any molecular weight. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">In his second and third reports, Prof Grant disagreed with Prof Hunter’s interpretation of Figure 1. His opinion was that Figure 1 was not a differential molecular weight distribution at all. In exhibit GAG8 to his second report, Prof Grant enlarged on the explanation he had given in his first report of the way in which he thought that Figure 1 had been created (summarised in paragraph 231 above). As Prof Hunter demonstrated in his fourth report, however, what this process results in is a plot of x(M) (multiplied by a scaling factor) against M.  As noted in paragraph 114 above, Prof Grant was reluctant to accept this; but he was unable to point to any error in Prof Hunter’s analysis. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">It follows that the difference between Prof Hunter’s and Prof Grant’s interpretation of Figure 1 is as to whether the y axis (labelled “% total mass”) is a scaled version of w(M) or a scaled version of x(M). If the y axis is a scaled version of w(M), then the standard equations can be applied directly and produce the results set out by Prof Hunter in his first report and quoted in paragraph 232 above (although, as noted in paragraph 234 above, the figures for M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">p</span> require adjustment: these should read 11.7, 11.7, 21.3 and 20.8). If the y axis is a scaled version of x(M), then a conversion needs to be undertaken. Prof Hunter set out the relevant figures in exhibit CH11 to his third report. The upshot was that, on the latter basis, the best fit is with the average molecular weight being M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">w</span>, but there are still discrepancies. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">So far as the science is concerned, I found Prof Hunter’s analysis in his third and fourth reports and his explanations in cross-examination completely convincing, and I have no hesitation in accepting it. The issue which I have to decide, however, is not whether Prof Hunter’s analysis or that of Prof Grant is the more scientifically accurate. The issue is how the skilled reader of the Patent would interpret the references to “average molecular weight”. So far as that issue is concerned, I have come to the conclusion that counsel for the Defendants was correct to submit that Prof Hunter’s approach to the figures does not represent the approach which the skilled reader would adopt even though it is scientifically sound. My reasons are as follows. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">First, I am not persuaded that the skilled reader would think of conducting an experiment of the kind carried out by Prof Hunter in order to ascertain what the inventors meant by “average molecular weight”. The experiment is a painstaking and time-consuming exercise. Furthermore, I think that there is force in the point made by both Prof Grant and counsel for the Defendants that the skilled reader would be doubtful that the Figures were sufficiently accurate to be used in this way. I do not consider that the skilled reader would view the Figures as purely schematic, but he would note two curiosities about them. The first is that, as I shall explain below, the Figures do not appear to be consistent with each other. The second is that, perhaps due to an artefact of reproduction, the spacing on the axes is uneven: on the x axis the distance between each 10,000 Da interval varies from 20.5 to 22 mm, while on the y axis the distance between each 2% interval varies from 14 to 15 mm.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Secondly, I agree with counsel for the Defendants that it is significant that even Prof Hunter thought until quite late in the day that it was possible to estimate M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">p</span> directly from the positions of the peaks in Figure 1 and that the discrepancy between the values observed and the values quoted in the Patent could be explained by the manner in which the Figure had been produced from the chromatogram. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Thirdly, it is also significant that Prof Hunter’s analysis in his third report was heavily based on a paper by Shortt, “Differential Molecular Weight Distributions in High Performance Size Exclusion Chromatography”, <span style="font-style:italic">J. Liq. Chrom.</span>, 1993, 16(16), 3371-</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.00in">3391. Prof Hunter said that this paper was included in Teva’s disclosure documents. He did not suggest that he was familiar with it prior to reading it for the purposes of preparing his third report. Furthermore, Shortt states that it reveals and corrects a number of “common errors in the literature”, of which plotting x(M) against M is one. I am therefore not persuaded that the ordinary skilled SEC analyst using just his common general knowledge would arrive at the analysis which Prof Hunter finally arrived at. In this regard, it is telling that this analysis was undertaken by Prof Hunter and not Dr Hunt. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Fourthly, even if the skilled reader did undertake the experiment, I do not think he would draw the conclusion from it that Prof Hunter did. In my view he would be more likely to conclude that the experiment was flawed, probably because the Figures were not accurate enough to admit of such an analysis. This is not only because none of the averages calculated by Prof Hunter correspond with the values quoted in the Figures, but also the values obtained by Prof Hunter from Figure 1 and 2 differ substantially from each other.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Counsel for Mylan relied on the fact that, when confronted with Prof Hunter’s analysis in cross-examination, Prof Grant said on several occasions that the skilled person would not know whether the y axis of Figure 1 was a scaled version of x(M) or a scaled version of w(M). Counsel argued that this confirmed that the Patent was ambiguous. I do not accept this argument. Prof Grant’s answers have to be viewed in context, which was a discussion of the correctness or otherwise of Prof Hunter’s analysis. Considered as a whole, the effect of Prof Grant’s evidence was that the skilled reader would not analyse Figure 1 in that kind of depth at all. For the reasons I have just given, I agree with that assessment.         </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Finally, I must consider a separate argument advanced by counsel for Mylan. He submitted that one approach which the skilled team could take would be to note that the Patent contrasts the average molecular weight of the products of the invention with the average molecular weight of copolymer-1 in the prior art. This would suggest that the Patent was using the expression “average molecular weight” to mean the same thing as it meant in the prior art cited in the specification. Counsel submitted that this did not take the skilled team any further forward, however. If they looked at Bornstein 1987, they would see mention of a molecular weight, which must be an average molecular weight, but no indication of which average molecular weight is intended or how it was measured. If they looked at US 550, the position would be the same. If the skilled team looked at Teitelbaum 1971, the analyst would see from section 3.7 that the molecular weights, which are expressly stated to be average molecular weights, have been measured by ultracentrifugation techniques, citing references 24 and 29. Prof Hunter’s opinion having considered those references was that the most likely interpretation was that Teitelbaum 1971 was referring to M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">w</span>. Prof Grant said this involved an incorrect assumption, and that it could be M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">n</span>, M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">w</span> or M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">z</span>.

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Accordingly, counsel for Mylan argued that the skilled person who reviewed the prior art cited in the Patent would note that the authors of the prior art (who include three of the four inventors of the Patent, namely Prof Arnon, Prof Sela and Dr Teitelbaum) cite numbers for what are clearly average molecular weights without specifying whether they are M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">n</span> or M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">w</span> (or even M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">z</span>), but which do not appear to be M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">p</span>, and </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">While I acknowledge the force of this argument, I am not persuaded by it. The problem with it is that the skilled team would appreciate that the Patent is clear that the average molecular weights have been determined by SEC, but that there is no indication that SEC was used to determine the molecular weights quoted in the prior art. On the contrary, it is clear from Teitelbaum 1971 that at least in that case SEC was not used. Thus while the skilled team might well start with the presumption that the inventors were using the term “average molecular weight” in the same way as the prior art, they would realise upon reflection that that might well not be the case. Accordingly, they would be driven back to trying to work out what the term meant in the context of the Patent. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Although I confess that I have at times come close to concluding that the Patent is ambiguous, in the end I have come to the conclusion that the skilled team would interpret the Patent as using “average molecular weight” to mean M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">p</span>. In reaching this conclusion I have taken into account all the points considered above, but I have been most influenced by Prof Grant’s first and fifth points and Prof Hunter’s responses to them. In summary, it seems to me that the skilled analyst would be likely to approach the specification with the presumption that “average molecular weight” meant M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">n</span> or M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">w</span> (or possibly M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">z</span>), which would lead him to wonder which of these was intended. Upon consideration of the facts that the (i) the Patent specifies the use of SEC to determine the “average molecular weight”, (ii) it gives a single “average molecular weight” and (iii) the values quoted in Figure 1 appear to correspond with the peaks shown allowing for the error introduced by the manner in which the skilled analyst would think that Figure 1 had been prepared, however, the skilled analyst would conclude that the inventors must be taking M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">p</span>, albeit somewhat inaccurately, as the average molecular weight of the copolymer. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">The Defendants rely upon three arguments for interpreting the claim as referring to a molar fraction. The first is that it was Prof Grant’s opinion that the use of the word “species” indicated that the patentee was referring to 5% of the molecules, i.e. 5% of the sample on a molar basis. As Prof Hunter pointed out and Prof Grant accepted, however, paragraph [0009] of the Patent states that Figure 1 shows “the proportion of species with molecular weight above 40 kDa” and Figure 1 shows mass fraction, not </p>

Mylan’s counter-argument is that there is a clear difference in wording between claim 1 on the one hand and paragraph [0011] and claim 7 on the other hand, which should be given effect to. In my opinion the skilled reader would take the view that this is another instance in which the claims of the Patent have been sloppily drafted (like the omission of “average” from claim 10 mentioned above, and the omission of “over” from claim 4 as discussed below). Accordingly, he would be more likely to think that claim 1 should be interpreted consistently with paragraph [0011] and claim 7 than he would to think that the difference in wording was intentional and significant.       </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">The third argument is based on a comparison between what the specification says at [0020]-[0021] with what is shown in Figures 1 and 2. Professor Hunter’s assumption was that Figures 1 and 2 showed the molecular weight analyses for the two batches described in [0020]-[0021]. Curiously, Prof Grant disagreed with this assumption. He gave three reasons for doing so. First, the Patent did not say this. That would not prevent the skilled team from reading the document and reaching their own conclusion, however, just as, on Prof Grant’s own view, the absence of a definition of “average molecular weight” would not prevent the skilled team from concluding that that meant M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">p</span>. Secondly, the Figures show three batches whereas only two are described in [0020]-[0021]. But the Figures show two batches which have the same molecular weight distribution. This could be explained by the preparation of Batch A being repeated. Thirdly, Prof Grant said that he would expect that fractionation would lead to a narrower distribution than that shown for the 7.7 kDa sample in the Figures. But this evidence appeared to be based on his knowledge of copolymer-1 fractionation gained from his extensive exposure to Teva’s disclosure documents.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">As Prof Hunter noted in his first report, if one does assume that Figures 1 and 2 show the molecular weight analyses for the two batches described in [0020]-[0021], then it can be seen that the curve for the 7.7 kDa sample in Figure 2 goes to zero at 40 kDa, which fits the description of Batch A in [0020], whereas the corresponding curve in Figure 1 goes to zero at about 45 kDa. As Prof Hunter said, this suggests that the figures given in [0020] refer to molar fraction since Figure 2 is a plot of molar fraction whereas Figure 1 is a plot of mass fraction. (Although it is odd that the two curves should reach zero at substantially different points.) In the case of the 12 kDa sample, it is not clear whether the description in [0021] refers to the molar fraction plot or the mass fraction plot. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Despite his conclusion based on visual inspection of Figures 1 and 2 that the percentages in [0021]-[0022] related to molar fraction, Prof Hunter addressed this issue by means of another part of his experiment described above. I shall not set out the results of this part of the experiment, but the upshot was similarly inconclusive in that none of the percentages tallied with [0021]-[0022], although Prof Hunter’s opinion was that on balance the results favoured the view that the percentages were mass fractions. Again, however, it seems to me that the skilled reader would not undertake such an experiment, or if he did, he would conclude that the Figures were not sufficiently accurate for the results to be reliable.

The Defendants contend that the skilled reader would understand from the specification as a whole that claim 4 was intended to refer to “over 75%” and that the word “over” had been inadvertently omitted. I agree with this. Thus Prof Hunter admitted that he had not noticed that the word “over” was missing.       <span style="font-style:italic">Predetermined by small scale reaction </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Claim 7 requires that the reaction “takes place for a time and a temperature predetermined by small scale reaction”. Mylan contends that this must be done for each batch, whereas the Defendants contend that it is sufficient if it is done once. It is common ground that the skilled reader would interpret this requirement in the light of paragraphs [0033]-[0034] of the specification. Mylan focuses on the statement in [0033] that “a test reaction is performed on every batch”. The Defendants focus on the statement in [0034] that, after the results obtained in [0033] have been used to plot a curve of molecular weight against time, the time needed is calculated from the curve and “performed on larger scale reaction”. In my judgment the skilled reader would understand from this that, once the small scale or test reaction had been performed to obtain the curve, the curve could be used repeatedly to produce the desired copolymer-1 material by larger scale reactions. The skilled reader would not consider that it was necessary to repeat the small scale reactions every time that a larger scale reaction was carried out. Nor is there any evidence that the skilled reader would consider that it was technically necessary to do this. On the contrary, Prof Hunter accepted that, once the appropriate reaction conditions had been determined on a small scale at the outset, then the skilled person would not need to carry out the test reaction each time unless there was some variation in the reaction conditions or the reagents that made this necessary. He was unaware of any variation in the process or starting materials that might necessitate repeating the small scale reaction. Prof Sampson’s evidence was to similar effect. </p>

For this purpose, the core of the inventive concept can be taken to be copolymer-1 having an average molecular weight in the range 6.25-8.4 kDa with over 75% in the range 2-20 kDa and less than 5% over 40 kDa. The difference between Bornstein 1987 and this is that Bornstein 1987 does not disclose copolymer-1 having those molecular weight characteristics, but only copolymer-1 having a “molecular weight” (i.e. an average molecular weight) in the range of 14-23 kDa. For different reasons, neither side contends that it matters for this purpose whether the skilled reader would understand Bornstein 1987 to mean M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">n</span> or M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">w</span> or M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">p</span>. </p>

I agree with the Defendants. Bornstein 1987 gives the skilled team no reason whatsoever to develop copolymer-1 of average molecular weight lower than 14-23 kDa. On the contrary, it suggests that what they want is material in that weight range. Accordingly, if the synthetic chemist accidentally produced some copolymer-1 of lower average molecular weight, I consider that the skilled team would discard it as not being what was wanted. Accordingly, in my judgment the product claims are not obvious over Bornstein 1987 even if the claimed process is obvious.  This is particularly true of claims 4-6 and 11-12.     </p>

I do not agree that it follows that the clinician would recommend the development of 7 kDa copolymer-1. As noted above, even on the basis that the difference in molecular weight had been pointed out to him and that he took an interest in this information, it was Dr Coles’ evidence that he would not have felt sufficiently informed about the Phase III trial to recommend development of 7 kDa rather than 14-23 kDa copolymer-1. In those circumstances, I consider that the clinician would not have concluded that the headline results provided a good basis for developing 7 kDa copolymer-1. Rather, he would want to see the full report in order to see if this shed any light on the reasons for, and significance of, the difference in molecular weight between the material used in Bornstein 1987 and that used in the Phase III trial. </p>

Johnson 1994 states that molecular weight of copolymer-1 is approximately 7 kDa, and later says that effort has been devoted to developing a standardised preparation, but it does not say that there has been any change in the molecular weight since the earlier trials. Indeed, the implication is the opposite. Thus it would be far from clear to the clinician that the material used in the Phase III trial did in fact have a molecular weight of 7 kDa. The clinician might well wonder if the statement in Johnson 1994 was a mistake.      </p>

The question, however, is whether the skilled team would have a sufficient expectation of success to justify the effort and expense of developing both 7 kDa copolymer-1 and 14-23 kDa copolymer-1. Having regard to how little was known about MS and the mechanism of action of copolymer-1 in May 1995, and having regard to the uncertainties as to whether 7 kDa copolymer-1 had really been used in the Phase III trial and, if so, why a change had been made to the molecular weight of the material, I do not consider that they would have a sufficient expectation of success to make this an obvious step to take.  </p>

After the polymerisation reaction was complete, he would comprehensively analyse the intermediate reaction product by the following techniques: (a) analytical ultracentrifugation; (b) light scattering to corroborate his AUC results; (c) end-group analysis; (d) NMR; (e) mass spectrometry; (f) infrared spectroscopy; (g) UV/visible spectroscopy; (h) SEC; and (i) amino acid analysis.

Her view was that the extent to which a synthetic chemist would want to characterise the reaction products in a synthetic pathway depended on the purpose of the synthesis, what was known about the pathway and what was expected to occur.  Since the polymerisation of NCAs was well established by 1994, she thought that the skilled person would not see the need to characterise the intermediate product as extensively as suggested by Prof Hunter. Rather, he would simply do the analyses that were necessary to confirm that the expected reaction had taken place. At the end of the polymerisation reaction, these would be thin-layer chromatography (to check the reaction had gone to completion by looking for the absence of NCA monomers) and UV and NMR (to check that all the amino acids were present in the protected polymer). She thought that there was no reason why the skilled person would perform any molecular weight analysis on the intermediate product at this stage. Rather, the skilled person would only check the molecular weight of the product once the protecting groups had been removed. This was partly to save time and effort, but also because it was only at that stage that he would be able to make a comparison with Teitelbaum 1971. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">So far as the analysis of the product of this reaction is concerned, it is common ground that it was a well-known reaction by 1994, and so the skilled person would not be anticipating problems. In these circumstances, the skilled person would not think it worthwhile to undertake molecular weight analysis at this stage, even if he had undertaken it after the polymerisation reaction. This would be time consuming, and unnecessary for determining whether the deprotection reaction had gone to completion. Whereas UV and NMR would allow the skilled person to see the extent of loss of benzyl groups, molecular weight analysis would merely indicate that mass had been lost. It would say nothing about what had been lost. Thus it would also not provide useful information in relation to the deprotection reaction. </p>

It does not follow, however, that the ordinary skilled person would do so without inventive insight. I am not persuaded that he would. Even if it were obvious to analyse the molecular weight at each stage and hence to discover the unexpected loss of mass in the HBr deprotection step, which for the reasons I have given I doubt, I do not accept that it would have been obvious to the skilled person that he could take advantage of this phenomenon to control the molecular weight of the desired polymer. In my view, he would be more likely to regard the loss of mass in the way that Blout and Idelson and Katchalski and Sela did, namely as representing degradation of the polymer. Accordingly, rather than being inspired to exploit it, he would be more likely to view it as undesirable, and to respond by shortening the reaction time and/or redoubling his efforts to make the reagents anhydrous. The way in which he would have attempted to control the molecular weight was by varying the amount of initiator (or subsequent fractionation). </p>

I do not propose to go into the details of this argument. It suffices to say that I do not accept it for two reasons. First, I do not agree that, if Prof Sampson’s approach were followed, the skilled person would be likely to discover that the HBr deprotection reaction caused a reduction in molecular weight.

In my judgment this is of little relevance to the obviousness or otherwise of the product claims over Bornstein 1987 and Johnson 1994, but does provide some modest further support for my conclusion that the process claims were not obvious over Teitelbaum 1971. The short point is that Prof Katchalski, Prof Sela and a number of other distinguished WIS scientists had worked extensively in the field of synthetic polypeptides generally since the late 1940s, and some of them had worked on copolymer-1 since the work that was published in Teitelbaum 1971, yet none of them discovered that the reaction with HBr in glacial acetic acid could be used to control the molecular weight of the final product as well removing the benzyl protecting groups. That discovery was only made by Eliezer Konfino of Teva in the late 1980s. (It is a curious, but irrelevant, aspect of the case that all the inventions claimed in the Patent were made in the late 1980s, yet the Priority Document was not filed until May 1994).     </p>

It is surely axiomatic that whatever the standard for susceptibility to industrial application may be, the information about it must be in the patent (supplemented if necessary by the common general knowledge of the time). Otherwise you could satisfy the Art.57 requirement by just identifying a compound in the patent and finding a use for it later. That would contravene, for example, Art.5(3) of the Directive. You cannot have a patent for an invention when only years later you or someone else finds out what it is for.

If a patent does disclose enough to make the invention plausible at the priority or filing date, can an opposing party came along 20 years later and say that, in the light of subsequently acquired knowledge, in fact the invention does not have the technical benefit that it appeared to have? As a matter of principle, it seems to me that the reasoning of the Board of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Johns Hopkins</span> and of the English judges quoted above applies with equal force: just as a patent which does not make the invention plausible cannot be supported by post-dated evidence, then a patent which does make the invention plausible cannot be shown to </p>

As he accepted, the specification does not state, nor would the skilled reader understand from his common general knowledge, that either assay is predictive of toxicity in humans. He submitted, however, that the specification necessarily implied that the improvement in toxicity was clinically meaningful, that is to say one which would influence the decisions of a clinician. Furthermore, he argued that the mere possibility of an improvement was not a technical advance in any real sense. Accordingly, if there was a technical advance, it must reside in the proposition that copolymer-1 as claimed caused (not might cause) less irritation at the injection site and/or a reduced incidence of systemic side effects.

Moreover, whilst claim 1 suggests that the critical threshold of species having a molecular weight of more than 40 kDa is 5%, the Patent does not disclose the actual % of such species in Example 2B.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Mylan relies upon extrinsic evidence which is contemporaneous with the Patent as demonstrating that copolymer-1 as claimed does not cause less irritation at the injection site and a reduced incidence of systemic side effects than copolymer having a molecular weight of 14-23 kDa, or at least as casting sufficient doubt on this to shift the evidential burden to the Defendants to prove that it does have the benefit. This consists of other experimental data and comments thereon recorded in Teva’s contemporaneous disclosure documents. The Defendants contend that these materials support the conclusion drawn in the Patent rather than undermine it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Although at earlier stages other documents were relied on, in Mylan’s closing submissions reliance was confined to a single Teva document. This is a table of experimental results compiled in April 1994 (“the April 1994 Table”). The April 1994 Table contains results for (i) average molecular weight, (ii)  percentage serotonin release in the RBL degranulation assay, (iii) mouse lethality and (iv) guinea pig skin irritation for a number of batches of copolymer-1, together with annotations in a mixture of English and Hebrew. Prof Kimber’s first report includes a transcription </p>

Prof Baird’s opinion was that the data did show a correlation in that the toxicity increased with molecular weight and then levelled off at a higher molecular weight. She acknowledged that there were two outliers at 9.6 and 9.9 kDa, but said that the trend of increasing RBL degranulation with increasing average molecular weight was nevertheless clear.

Prof Kimber’s evidence was that the skin irritation test was more likely to reflect the ability of different batches of copolymer-1 to cause local injection site reactions in patients than either of the tests in the Patent.

This is supported by the evidence of Dr Pinchasi that, although Teva performed the tests to see if there was a correlation between RBL degranulation and skin irritation, Teva concluded that the skin irritation test was less informative than the RBL degranulation test or mouse mortality assay and abandoned it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Counsel for Mylan submitted that the effect of the skin irritation data was to place the burden on the Defendants to demonstrate that copolymer-1 having the molecular weight characteristics of the claims conferred an improvement in local injection site reactions compared to Bornstein 1987. I do not accept that submission. In my view the data in the April 1994 Table have to be considered as a whole. I consider that the mouse lethality data and the RBL degranulation data in the April 1994 Table are broadly consistent with the data reported in the Patent and that, taken together, they also make it plausible that copolymer-1 as claimed is less toxic than the copolymer-1 used in Bornstein 1987.

For the reasons given above, I do not consider that it is open to Mylan to rely upon such evidence for this purpose. I must nevertheless consider the evidence, both in case I am wrong in that conclusion and because Mylan relies on the same evidence as demonstrating insufficiency.

In a Forest plot, raw data for each observation is extracted from the clinical trial reports and re-plotted and re-analysed. The size of the blue squares indicate the number of patients involved in the study and the position of the blue squares on either side of the line of no effect indicate whether the treatment is favoured or the control is favoured. If a blue square falls on the right side of the line of no effect, this indicates a result in favour of the control, meaning that the adverse effect is seen more frequently in those patients being treated with copolymer-1 compared with placebo. The horizontal lines on either side of the blue squares indicate the 95% confidence intervals (that is to say, the “true” result may be found, with 95% confidence, somewhere within the area found between the upper and lower limits).

It is unlikely that either of these differences is statistically significant, however, because for both itching and swelling there are regions where the horizontal lines (the confidence intervals) for each of the blue squares overlap. This impression is supported by the formal test for heterogeneity, which leads to a p value &gt; 0.05 (p = 0.07 and p = 0.68 in relation to “itching” and “swelling”, respectively), i.e. they are homogeneous.

Fewer patients experienced injection site redness in Bornstein 1987 and Bornstein 1991 compared to the other trials, and the test for heterogeneity across these trials is positive (p = 0.000), i.e. they are heterogeneous. The test for heterogeneity for “pain” is also positive (p = 0.027), but the profile of the frequency of pain across the trials does not differentiate lower molecular weight copolymer-1 from higher molecular weight copolymer-1. Pain is seen most frequently in Bornstein 1987 and Wolinsky 2007, whereas Bornstein 1991 </p>

Overall, therefore, these results suggest that higher molecular weight copolymer-1 causes less itching and redness than lower molecular weight copolymer-1, while there is no evidence of any difference in relation to swelling or pain. </p>

Dr Altmann, like the authors of the Cochrane Review, analysed the data in terms of “risk ratio”, that is to say the ratio of the two proportions of patients reporting the relevant side effect in each arm of the trial. Prof Sasieni accepted that such an analysis was standard where the risks were small and it could be assumed that the risk ratio was independent of the underlying risk. In his opinion, however, this was not the situation in the present case. <span style="font-size:11pt">For example</span>, in Wolinsky 2007 the risk of itching in patients on placebo was 1.9% and it was 10.6 times greater in patients on copolymer-1.  In Bornstein 1987 20% of patients on placebo had itching. It was thus impossible for the relative risk to be 10.6 in Bornstein 1987: the most it could be would be 5.0 if all of the patients who received copolymer-1 reported itching.</p>

For redness and pain, the differences in the excess risk were smaller and nonsignificant. Prof Sasieni also considered the patterned reaction data, and concluded that it was not possible to say that there was a difference in patterned reactions between the earlier and later trials whether analysed by relative risk or excess risk.   </p>

Notwithstanding the differences in their respective analyses, there was a considerable amount of common ground between Dr Altmann and Prof Sasieni. Importantly, as noted in paragraph 119 above, they were agreed that statistical analysis of the available clinical trial data did not make it possible to determine whether lower molecular weight copolymer-1 had fewer side effects than higher molecular weight copolymer-1. This is because none of the clinical trials were designed to compare the side effects of lower and higher molecular weight copolymer-1. In order to do that, a trial would have to be carried out involving the two products for which measurement of the adverse effects was the primary endpoint. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">So far as the choice of risk ratio or risk difference was concerned, Dr Altmann did not accept that it was relevant or desirable to assume the treatment effect had to be independent of the underlying risk and therefore discount the risk ratio approach. He pointed out that the risk difference analysis was not free from difficulty either. For example, the copolymer-1 minus placebo risk difference for pain in Bornstein 1987 was 60%, but it was impossible for the risk difference in Bornstein 1991 to be the same because the placebo risk was 47.3% and the active risk could not be greater than 100%. He considered the risk ratio approach to be more intuitive and, in his experience, more frequently used as a measure of treatment effect than risk difference. Nevertheless, he did not believe that there were any statistical grounds for preferring risk difference to risk ratio or vice versa. The fact that the two approaches led to different conclusions in the present case was reflection of the well-known statistical problem of assessing heterogeneity. He therefore concluded that there was no clear statistical evidence of a difference in side effects between the earlier and later copolymer-1, since the risk ratio and risk difference approaches gave discordant results. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Prof Sasieni agreed that there were problems with both approaches, although he considered that these were fatal with risk ratio, but merely critical with risk difference.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in"><span style="font-style:italic">Dr Coles’ evidence</span>. Dr Coles’ opinion was that neither the result of the risk ratio analysis nor the result of the risk difference analysis was biologically credible. The risk ratio analysis suggested that higher molecular weight copolymer-1 caused less itching and redness than lower molecular weight copolymer-1. Dr Coles’ view was that a true difference between the two would lead to a segregation in all four symptoms of itching, swelling, redness and pain, since they were due to the same pathological mechanism, namely inflammation. Thus he did not find it plausible that there should be a difference in only two of these symptoms. Similarly, the risk difference analysis suggested that lower molecular weight copolymer-1 caused less itching and swelling than higher molecular weight copolymer-1. Again, he did not find this plausible for the same reason. Accordingly, it was his opinion that these differences arose by chance and as a result of the idiosyncrasies of the statistical techniques. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Nevertheless, it was also Dr Coles’ opinion that, given the clinical trials included 947 patients on copolymer-1 and 642 patients on placebo, there was enough data to assess whether there was in fact a clinically meaningful difference between the adverse effect profiles of higher and lower molecular weight copolymer-1. In his view, there was no such difference.       </p>

Prof Schellekens’ opinion was that the comparisons between clinical trials which Dr Coles and Dr Altmann had undertaken were “scientifically flawed” and “meaningless” because of six actual or potential differences between the trials. I was unconvinced by this evidence for the following reasons. First, for the reasons given above, I do not think that Prof Schellekens was well qualified to give it. Secondly, it emerged that he had not troubled to read the primary publications. Thirdly, he had considerable difficulty in justifying his criticisms in cross-examination. Fourthly, he had no coherent answer to the point that the authors of the Cochrane Review, which as noted above is a publication in a highly respected series, had adopted the same approach. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in"><span style="font-style:italic">Conclusions</span>. My conclusions are as follows. First, no clinical trial has been carried out which directly compares the side effects of higher and lower molecular weight copolymer-1. Thus reliable statistical evidence as to which, if either, has fewer side effects is not available. Secondly, the statistical analyses of the available clinical trial data are inconclusive. There is no clear statistical evidence either way, particularly bearing in mind the conflicting results of the two analyses and Dr Coles’ evidence to the lack of biological credibility of both analyses. Thirdly, that just leaves Dr Coles’ opinion as a clinician that there was no difference between the adverse event profiles. As he made clear in cross-examination, it was his view not merely that there was no evidence of difference, but that there was evidence of no difference. I consider that his opinion is one that merits respect for the reasons I have given above. Nevertheless, in the light of the statistical evidence, I am unable to accept it. In my judgment the proper conclusion to be drawn from the evidence as a whole is that it is inconclusive: </p>

I reviewed the law as to insufficiency in <span style="font-style:italic">Sandvik v Kennametal </span>at [106]-[124]. As I discussed there, it is possible to distinguish between three ways in which a patent may be invalid on the ground that the specification does not disclose the invention clearly enough and completely enough for it to be performed by the skilled person, although there is some overlap between them. First, where the skilled person is unable to carry out the claimed invention either at all or without undue burden and without needing inventive skill (“classical insufficiency”). Secondly, where the claim is ambiguous so that the skilled person cannot tell when he is within the claim or outside it. Thirdly, where the breadth of the claim exceeds the technical contribution to the art made by the invention. Neither side took issue with my analysis of the law in those paragraphs. </p>

In particular, it does not disclose either (i) what mobile phase should be used or (ii) how the column should be calibrated. Mylan contends that the Patent is insufficient as a result, partly because it imposes an undue burden on the skilled person and partly because different skilled persons would choose different conditions and thereby obtain different results. Thus this is partly an objection of classical insufficiency and partly an objection of ambiguity. For convenience I will consider it under the former heading. </p>

I do not accept that this renders the Patent insufficient for the following reasons. First, as I have already said, I do not think that the skilled person would have chosen a substantially basic eluent. Secondly, the reason why Dr Hunt suggested that pH would have this effect was that it would affect the conformation of a charged polymer, and it is common ground that copolymer-1 is amphoteric (i.e. it has both negatively and positively charged groups). As he accepted, however, copolymer-1 is a random coil in solution. As Prof Grant explained, it follows that its conformation would not be expected to change with pH. Thirdly, there is no evidence that this does in fact occur or, if so, as to the extent of the effect on the molecular weight results. Prof Grant fairly accepted that he could not say that different mobile phases would not have an effect on the results, but no specific figure for the magnitude of the effect was put to him in this regard.      </p>

I did not understand Dr Hunt to dispute this. Furthermore, as counsel for the Defendants pointed out, we now know that it does in fact work, because Natco uses it to determine the average molecular weight of Mylan’s glatiramer acetate product. In cross-examination Prof Grant was asked why, if universal calibration would have been regarded as a suitable approach, Teva had not used it in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He said that he did not know. As counsel for the Defendants submitted, given the evidence that universal calibration (a) was common general knowledge, (b) would be expected to work and (c) would in fact work, it does not matter what the explanation is.

So far as narrow selfstandards are concerned, Dr Hunt made the point that fractionation is a timeconsuming business. He estimated that this could take as long as 6 months. He accepted, however, that it was a routine technique which could be given to a technician to perform. He was not aware of anything about copolymer-1 which would make it difficult to fractionate. As for his estimate that it could take 6 months, this was based on 1 gram of each of 6-10 standards. In cross-examination, however, he accepted that only 5 fractions would be needed and that only 10 mg of material would be needed if light-scattering (SEC-MALLS, a commercially available technique) was used to measure the M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">n</span> and M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">w</span> of the fraction.

First, the average molecular weights of two of the samples lying behind the Figures in the Patent were measured by Teva in July 1993 as being 7150 and 7250 Da respectively and in May 1994 as both being 7700 Da (it is not entirely clear which “average molecular weight” these are, but it appears that in fact they are M<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">p</span>).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Finally, Mylan contends that the product claims are insufficient since they make no technical contribution to the art. Mylan relies in support of this contention on the same evidence as it relies upon in support of its case that product claims are obvious for want of technical contribution. In this context, Mylan particularly relies upon the evidence concerning the clinical trials. It is common ground that, for this purpose, it does not matter that this evidence post-dates the priority or application date of the Patent. </p>

Accordingly, the breadth of the claim did not exceed the technical contribution, and it was neither here nor there that the specification only disclosed one way of making the product. In the present case, however, even claims 1-3 cover a range of products. Claims 4-6 and 11-12 are not simple product claims at all. Furthermore, the key characterising features of all these claims, the average molecular weight and molecular weight distribution features, depend at least to some extent upon the way in which the copolymer-1 is made.  </p>

In particular, the inventions disclosed in claims 1-3 are copolymer-1 fractions having the molecular weight features of those claims. There is no dispute that the skilled team would be able to make such fractions. Mylan’s objection is not that the breadth of those claims exceeds the technical contribution to the art made by the invention in the sense explained by Lord Hoffmann in <span style="font-style:italic">Biogen v Medeva</span>, namely that they cover ways of achieving the desired result which owe nothing to the Patent or any principle it discloses. Rather, Mylan’s objection is that none of the claimed products have the advantage claimed for them in the specification. It seems to me that it is arguable that that is an objection not of insufficiency, but of inutility, which is not a ground of objection under section 72 of the 1977 Act. </p>

In case G1/93, <span style="font-style:italic">Advanced Semiconductor Products</span>, the Enlarged Board of Appeal of the EPO stated (at paragraph [9] of its reasons) that the idea underlying Art. 123(2) is that that an applicant should not be allowed to improve his position by adding subject matter not disclosed in the application as filed, which would give him an unwarranted advantage and could be damaging to the legal security of third parties relying on the content of the original application. At paragraph [16] it explained that whether an added feature which limits the scope of protection is contrary to Art. 123(2) must be determined from all the circumstances. If it provides a technical contribution to the subject matter of the claimed invention then it would give an unwarranted advantage to the patentee. If, on the other hand, the feature merely excludes protection for part of the subject matter of the claimed invention as covered by the application as filed, the adding of such a feature cannot reasonably be considered to give any unwarranted advantage to the applicant. Nor does it adversely affect the interests of third parties.  </p>

Prof Hunter agreed with this. Further, he accepted that diafiltration would remove all molecules smaller than the molecular weight cut-off point of the membrane and that the finest membrane available from the leading supplier, Millipore, would remove polypeptides having about 12 amino acid residues or less.
