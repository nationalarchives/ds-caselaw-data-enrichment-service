	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">5.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>The trial did not go according to plan. When the trial started on 26 February 2014, it was planned that, following oral opening submissions, I would hear Virgin’s witness Mark Jackman cross-examined in relation to Virgin’s Product and Process Description for 234 for about an hour, then I would hear the evidence of the expert witnesses in relation to 234 for about a day each, then I would hear the evidence of the expert witnesses in relation to 1856 for about a day each, and then the parties would prepare and deliver closing submissions. On this basis, it was envisaged that the trial would finish on 7 March 2014. In the event, Mr Jackman was cross-examined for over half a day. At the conclusion of his evidence, counsel for Rovi requested that Virgin provide certain further information. It was subsequently agreed that the court would not sit on 27 February 2014. When the trial was resumed on 28 February 2014, I heard the evidence of the expert witnesses in relation to 1856, followed by the evidence of the expert witnesses in relation to 234. This enabled the factual position in relation to infringement of 234 to be clarified as described below before those experts gave evidence. The trial finished on 11 March 2014. In my view it is clear that Virgin were mainly responsible for this state of affairs, although Rovi contributed to it. In order to explain why, I must first set out the law in relation to the preparation of product and process descriptions in patent cases. </p>

The purpose of this provision is to avoid, if possible, obliging the defendant to give extensive discovery much of which, experience has shown, is rarely if ever referred to. If this object is to be achieved, it is essential that parties and their advisers appreciate that the rule requires ‘full particulars of the product or process alleged to infringe’ to be given. <span style="font-style:italic">In this context, ‘full particulars’ means particulars sufficient to enable all issues of infringement to be resolved.

I would add two points. The first is that it is sometimes said (and I have sometimes been guilty myself of saying) that a product or process description only needs to contain information at the same level of generality as the claims of the patent in suit. This is not correct. It </p>

	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.00in">would be more accurate to say that it must contain information of <span style="font-style:italic">at least</span> the level of specificity of the claims. It is often the case that the product or process description needs to contain rather more detailed information than the claims. This is because, even if the claims are expressed in general terms, the issues on infringement often involve understanding precisely how the allegedly infringing product or process is constructed or functions. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The second is that the defendant’s lawyers sometimes complain that they do not understand how the claimant is putting its case on infringement, and therefore they do not know exactly what details of the product or process need to be described. Sometimes the claimant’s lawyers respond to such a complaint that it is not possible to provide a detailed statement of case on infringement until the defendant has properly described its product or process. Assuming that the claimant’s claim for infringement is not speculative (in which case it should be struck out for that reason), it should be recognised that, as is stated in paragraph 10.3 of the Patents Court guide, both parties have a responsibility. The claimant has the primary responsibility to articulate its infringement case as clearly as it can. The defendant has the primary responsibility to provide full particulars of its product or process. Both parties have a duty to cooperate with the other. Sometimes this may require a degree of iteration. But, in general, I do not accept that it is legitimate for a defendant to seek to use a lack of clarity of the claimant’s case on infringement as an excuse for not providing proper particulars of its product or process. If the defendant is genuinely unsure about what particulars it needs to provide, it should apply to the court for directions. </p>

(I note in passing that the 1856 PPD was designated “Confidential”, but it is not clear that it contains any confidential information and no application was made at trial for an order under CPR rule 31.22 in respect of it.) I should make it clear that Mr Jackman did not draft the PPDs or sign the statements of truth which they bore, although he gave evidence that he had checked the 234 PPD for technical accuracy. It is manifest that the PPDs did not adequately describe the functionality of the TiVo and VHD STBs. As a result, there </p>

On 14 February 2014 Virgin served a witness statement of a witness who confirmed the completeness and accuracy of the Addendum. That was not the end of the matter, however. Rovi asked for a further clarification, which resulted in the service by Virgin of a short Second Addendum on 20 February 2014. At that point, Rovi were content and did not require the individuals who had verified the PPD and the Addenda to attend for cross-examination.     </p>

Furthermore, elucidating the full and correct position was much more troublesome. On 23 October 2013 Rovi served a request under CPR Part 18. Virgin served its reply (which was not verified by a statement of truth, contrary to rule 18.1(3) and Part 22) on 30 October 2013. Regrettably, this turned out to contain at least four errors.   </p>

Rovi were not content with this, and applied for an order for disclosure of the database schema for the VHD and TiVo STBs. On 9 January 2014 I made an order for disclosure of the database schema so far as relevant to Rovi’s infringement case and ordered Virgin to pay the costs of the application. On 20 January 2014 Virgin served two additional PPDs, one of which (verified by Chuang Liu) set out extracts from the TiVo database schema and a description of how the fields were used to generate the EPG, and the other of which (verified by Mr Jackman) explained that the VHD STBs did not store data in a relational database, but set out equivalent extracts from the relevant software and a description of how the data was used to generate the EPG. In my view this information should have been included in the PPD. Indeed, I would go further. I think a considerable amount of time, effort and money could have been saved if Virgin had simply disclosed the TiVo schema and the VHD application layer software, or at least the relevant parts of it, on terms as to confidentiality at the outset. </p>

Thus I accept that Rovi contributed to the debacle on day 1 of the trial; but I think it is clear that this was mainly the responsibility of Virgin for not having provided proper PPDs at the outset or at least well before trial. To the extent that Virgin’s difficulty was caused by uncertainty as to what particulars to provide, this was substantially self-inflicted in that they failed to apply for an order requiring Rovi to serve a statement of case on infringement, or otherwise to seek directions from the court.      </p>

The patentee is told by [rule 29(7) of the Implementing Regulations to the EPC] that if he puts numerals into his claim they will not be used to limit it. If the court subsequently pays attention to the numbers to limit the claim that is simply not fair. And patentees would wisely refrain from inserting numbers in case they were used against them. That is not to say that numbers are pointless. They help a real reader orient himself at the stage when he is trying to get the general notion of what the patent is about. He can see where in the specific embodiment a particular claim element is, but no more. Once one comes to construe the claim, it must be construed as if the numbers were not part of it. To give an analogy, the numbers help you get the map the right way up, they do not help you to read it to find out exactly where you are.” </p>

According to established case law it will, for example, normally not be allowable to base an amended claim on the extraction of isolated features from a set of features originally disclosed only in combination, e.g. a specific embodiment in the description, see for example decisions T 1067/97, T 714/00 or T 25/03 cited in the Case Law of the Boards of Appeal, 6th edition, 2010, III.A.2. Such an amendment results in an intermediate generalization, in that it further limits the claimed subject-matter, but is nevertheless directed at in an undisclosed combination of features broader than that of its originally disclosed context, see for example T 1408/04 and T 461/05. It is justified only in the absence of any clearly recognizable functional or structural relationship among the features of the specific combination, see T 1067/97, and if the extracted feature is thus not inextricably linked with those features, see T 714/00.” </p>

The satellite transmission would be received at the headend by a large satellite dish.

There are subscriber-related messages, which grant or deny entitlements to view (Entitlement Management Messages or EMMs), and service- or programme-related messages, which provide information on each service or programme including which entitlements are needed for the STB to be allowed to decrypt and display the service or programme (Entitlement Checking/ Control Messages or ECMs). Since EMMs are needed by every STB, these are normally either broadcast in-band alongside every television service, or for cable, outof-band on a separate data channel. ECMs relate only to a particular TV service, so each ECM is only broadcast on the channel carrying the service to which it relates.  </p>

Each satellite may have multiple transponders. Satellite transponders transmit signals in a variety of ways to avoid interference between signals. Signals are polarised (either linear polarisation, i.e. horizontally or vertically, or circular polarisation, i.e. left-handed or right-handed) and broadcast in different frequency ranges (e.g. C-band or Ku-band as mentioned above and described in more detail below).  </p>

The signal from the feedhorn is passed first to a polariser and then to a low-noise block converter (LNB), which converts the frequency of the signal received from the satellite to a lower RF frequency band known as “L-band”. This enables the signal to be carried to the IRD using a standard coaxial cable.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Because the C- and Ku-bands occupy different frequency ranges they require different LNBs with different specifications (or different channels of a dual band LNB). Furthermore, because the Ku-band signal is inverted relative to the C-band signal (the local oscillator signal is higher than the received frequency for C-band, but lower for Ku-band), the manner in which the channels map into frequencies is inverted. Thus, even after conversion to L-band, the signals for C-band satellite channels are materially different to those for Ku-band satellite channels. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Digital broadcasting uses advanced modulation techniques that employ a combination of phase and amplitude modulation, for example, quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) to maximise the data throughput per RF channel. The RF channel bandwidth of QAM channels is typically the same as the bandwidth of modulated analogue TV channels (for example, 6 MHz in the USA). Since digital television also employs video and audio compression techniques to reduce the bit-rate of the television signal, it has become common practice to employ time-division-multiplexing (TDM) to carry multiple TV channels within a QAM channel. Digital television therefore allows the operator to broadcast many more TV channels within a given frequency band.  </p>

When a viewer changed channel, they would be shown not just the name of the new channel, but also the name of the current programme and its rating.

At that stage, InSight’s system used the VBI in the signals of the US Public Broadcasting System (PBS) member stations to transmit the EPG data. By 1994 fully interactive EPGs were being developed by StarSight, TV Guide on Screen (“TVGOS”) and Prevue Channel, among others, and STBs designed to function with interactive EPGs were being developed by GI (the Jerrold DigiCable CFT-2900), Scientific Atlanta (the 8600X), Zenith (the HT-2000) and Pioneer, among others.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">An approach taken by some broadcasters was to highlight on-screen the presence of potentially objectionable content, so that it could more readily be avoided by those who would not wish to see such content. This was a technique that was used by Channel 4 in the UK for a while during the 1980s where a red triangle was continuously displayed in the top left corner of the screen for late night material rated unsuitable for viewers below 18 years of age. These flags also made it easier for parents to see if their children were watching unsuitable material, since a quick look by the parent would enable them to see whether the triangle was present. (C4’s approach proved counter-effective, however, with younger viewers sometimes seeking out red triangle programming.)  </p>

In the case of terrestrial broadcasting, the small number of channels available up to and including the 1980s meant that it was impractical to imagine a whole channel which might broadcast nothing other than potentially objectionable content, so no need presented itself to consider providing any form of channel lock. The much larger number of channels that could be provided on cable or by satellite resulted in the appearance of dedicated “adult” channels (such as the Playboy Channel launched in the USA in 1982). In response to this, many early cable and satellite STBs adopted a very simple approach to parental control, namely making it possible to lock out access to a complete channel, so that content on that channel could only be viewed after a PIN code was entered. </p>

The cinema industry had introduced a ratings system after the outcry that accompanied some movies of the 1920s and 1930s. This was established in the UK by the British Board of Film Censors (later the British Board of Film Classification) (“the BBFC”) early in the 20th Century, with the Motion Picture Association of America (“the MPAA”) providing ratings from the late 1960s. By the 1980s it was clear that this pre-existing ratings system could be used as the basis for television parental control for movies.  </p>

This was initially introduced through the use of CA technology.  </p>

The parental control rating scheme was expanded to support not just MPAA or BBFC ratings, but also broadcaster-provided “L” (language), “V” (violence) and “S” (sexual situations) flags. The CA system within the STB controlled user interaction in terms of flagging blocked content and then unlocking it on entry of a PIN which was securely stored within the CA system in the STB. Since it was designed for potential pan-European use, and also to allow for changes in national rating schemes, Eurocypher used a downloadable table within the STB CA system to map from numeric values sent in the over-air messages accompanying each programme to the national ratings (such as those of the BBFC) which were displayed on screen.  </p>

There are two main types of IPTV. Closed circuit IPTV uses dedicated bandwidth on the provider’s network. It requires the subscriber to have a STB to receive the service, the signal for which is encrypted.  From the user’s perspective, such closed circuit IPTV services are quite similar to traditional cable broadcasts. In addition to linear television broadcasts, however, closed circuit IPTV services typically include catch-up facilities and other forms of video-on-demand (VOD). In “over the top” or OTT IPTV, the signal is delivered via a standard broadband connection and can be viewed (with appropriate software applications) on any device with such a connection, including PCs, tablet computers and smartphones. This case is only concerned with closed circuit IPTV. A variety of higher level protocols (i.e. higher than IP) are employed in IPTV systems.  </p>

The amount of adult situations involving sex and violence has steadily increased during the last 40 years. The issue of how this affects children or other viewers has gained national attention. Providing a parent with the ability to lock-out a channel is a well known and widespread feature of certain television receivers and cable converter boxes. Despite this availability, the feature is seldom used by parents. The main impediments to its effective use are the cumbersome ways in which it is generally implemented, as well as the requirement that entire channels be blocked in order to block access to any objectional [sic] programming. A channel-oriented parental lock is unfair to other programmers on the blocked channel -- who, for example, offer adult-oriented programming in the evening and youth-oriented programming the following morning and inconvenient for viewers<span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt"> </span>who want access to such programs. </p>

If L is chosen, that indicates that “a key lock access has been selected for programs rated with an ‘L’ rating for violent or explicit language”. The system indicates this by displaying a key lock icon below the L category display (not shown in Fig. 30). The user can deactivate the key lock access in the same manner. The user can also set a key lock access “for any of the other program content identifiers appearing in the Parental Guidance category”. To enter or change the key lock access code, the user selects “Change Key Access Code” 304, and to clear the key lock access code, the user selects “Clear Key Access Code and All Keys” 305, as described at [0094]. </p>

In this case the user must enter a lockout code in order to access the Lockout screen. The lockout code is set when the system is installed using the screens shown in Figs. 40-40E as described at [0101]-[0102]. Once the user has accessed the Lockout screen, he can clear or change the lockout code as described at [0103]-[0104]. To set a lock in the Movie Rating, Parental Guidance or Channel categories, the user selects the desired rating, guidance or channel and then presses a lockout key on the remote controller.

He describes himself as having “discovered electricity while in nappies, and started tinkering with circuitry at the age of 4”. He spent his youth building everything from radio transmitters to computers. In 1971 he obtained his first patent at the age of 16. In 1973 he began studying for a degree in Computer Science at Sydney University, but dropped out. From 1974 to 1988 he was Research and Development Director of Fairlight Instruments Pty Ltd, which he had co-founded and which made the world’s first sampling synthesisers.  </p>

From 1988 to 2000 he was Managing Director of Right Hemisphere Pty Ltd, which he had founded. Right Hemisphere’s main focus was on attempting to bring a parental control system to market. In addition, it developed various technologies in the field of information technology and electronic entertainment for a number of clients. During this period Mr Vogel also spent four years building an unusual limestone house for himself and his family. </p>

Mr Vogel demonstrated a prototype of his system on an inventors’ programme on Australian television in July 1994. Access to the parental control system, which enabled the parent to block programmes with certain ratings, was by PIN code. </p>

This object of this venture was to supply a subscription and advertising supported service which allowed subscribers better to manage their OTA television viewing though an STB which provided an EPG with parental controls. In 2006 Mr Vogel co-founded Vogel Ross Pty Ltd, a technology consultancy. In 2009 he founded Peter Vogel Instruments which makes electronic keyboard instruments. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Vogel was a very careful witness, but despite that I did not find his evidence of much assistance. In part, this was for reasons which were not his fault. Because of his unusual background and because of his position in May 1994 as essentially a lone inventor in Australia, I do not consider that he can be considered to be representative of a member of the skilled team to whom 234 is addressed. Furthermore, whether for that reason or due to his instructions, it became clear during his evidence that he had a very strange conception of the skilled team, which appeared both to include people who had no interest in EPGs and to exclude most of the teams actually working on interactive EPGs at the time. This inevitably coloured his whole approach to the common general knowledge, the Patent and the prior art. Still further, his approach to </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.00in">the question of common general knowledge was a very narrow one, which involved an unduly stringent application of the requirement of a good basis for further action. In addition to these matters, however, I was troubled by various aspects of his evidence. I will give three examples. First, it emerged during cross-examination that he had abandoned an important point regarding the inventive concept of 234 made in his first report in his second report, but without making that clear. Secondly, even after abandoning that point, he maintained an interpretation of the inventive concept which he accepted was not described in the specification or claims and the implementation of which he had difficulty explaining. Thirdly, he maintained that the disclosure of Bestler (as to which, see below) was “largely aspirational”.            </p>

From 1977 to 1983 he worked for the Ministry of Defence, initially as researcher into electro-optical systems and then as Senior Lecturer in electronics and other subjects. From 1983 to 1985 he worked for Mars Electronics as a software development engineer on automatic test equipment. He was named as an inventor on two patent applications during this period.

BTB’s STB offered features such as “now and next” programme information and individual parental control based on BBFC film classification combined with content flags to highlight the presence of violence, sex or potentially offensive language (i.e. limited interactive EPG functionality).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Turner was an excellent expert witness, being very knowledgeable, clear in his explanations and balanced in his approach. Counsel for Rovi submitted that he was not appropriately experienced, but I do not accept this.  I have no hesitation in preferring his evidence to that of Mr Vogel on technical matters where they differ. More importantly, counsel for Rovi submitted that Mr Turner’s evidence with regard to the prior art was influenced by hindsight, since he had been shown 234 before being asked to consider the prior art. This is particularly important with regard to Bestler, since, as discussed below, there is an important issue as to what Bestler discloses. I agree that it would have been better if Mr Turner had been asked to form a view as to the disclosure of Bestler before reading the Patent, and I have therefore approached Mr Turner’s evidence on this topic with a degree of caution. </p>

It is common ground that the skilled team would have been well aware that, in the years prior to May 1994, there had been intense concern, particularly but not exclusively in the USA, about children being exposed to inappropriate content, particularly but not exclusively violent content, on television. Rovi contend that such concerns were all directed to the content itself, and not to either programme titles or programme information. Virgin contend that the skilled team would have appreciated that, particularly in the context of channels showing both mainstream and adult content, the display of programme titles, and particularly programme information, was potentially of concern. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In support of Virgin’s position, counsel for Virgin relied mainly on two pieces of evidence. First, he pointed to some extracts from <span style="font-style:italic">TV &amp; Satellite Week</span> from 1994 which are in evidence. The pages in question show programme listings for The Adult Channel below, and in the same column as, programme listings for the Bravo channel. As the guide makes clear, Bravo and The Adult Channel were broadcast on the same satellite channel at different times of the day i.e. from a functional perspective they were part of the same channel. Some of the titles for programmes on The Adult Channel are entirely innocuous (e.g. “Cat and Mouse”), some might be regarded by some as mildly offensive (e.g. “Euroslut – French Tart”) and some would be regarded by many people as not being suitable for children’s eyes (e.g. “Blow Job Bonnie”). Counsel for Rovi submitted that the fact that such titles appeared in a mainstream publication sold in newsagents for 60p confirmed that they were of no concern. Counsel for Virgin submitted that there was a considerable difference between such titles appearing buried in the small print of a paper guide and appearing on screen as part of an EPG.        </p>

Counsel for Virgin submitted that the designer of an EPG which included programme information as well as programme titles and which carried adult content would be forced to think about whether it was acceptable to display programme information about the adult content.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Secondly, counsel for Virgin relied on the evidence of Mr Turner as supporting the submissions I have recorded in the preceding two paragraphs. Mr Turner recalled that, while he was working at BSB in 1989-1990, there was debate during the discussions over the implementation of the parental control system as to whether some programme titles might be objectionable and should be blocked together with the programme itself. BSB decided that it was not necessary to do this, because BSB was an IBA licensee which was not intending to broadcast material that was likely to have an objectionable title. Counsel for Rovi submitted that this evidence confirmed that programme titles were of no concern. As Mr Turner explained, however, BSB was (a) limited to 35 characters and (b) operating in a tightly regulated environment. This was not true of all broadcasters. He gave two examples to illustrate this. The first was that, to begin with, Sky operated outside IBA control (although it later submitted voluntarily to IBA regulation). Secondly, he explained that when he worked for FilmNet in Norway there was considerable concern about adult material emanating from neighbouring Sweden. Furthermore, Mr Turner pointed out that, by 1994, the industry was planning for the delivery of multichannel digital services and more extensive programme information could be contained in downloaded EPGs. He said </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Finally, Rovi contend that the conventional approach in 1994 was to display everything in the EPG which was stored in the memory of the STB. Mr Turner explained, however, that there was a trade-off, particularly in light of the limited screen resolution of the time, so that the system might put up the title only, and allow the user to call up more detailed information. This approach can be seen in the prepriority interactive EPGs of which there is evidence.                  </p>

In Rovi’s opening skeleton argument, it was expressed most succinctly as follows: “[the invention] removes blocked programmes from the EPG <span style="text-decoration:underline">altogether</span>, so that they do not even appear in the programme listings, with the consequence that programmes cannot be selected from the EPG” (emphasis in the original). As Mr Vogel conceded during cross-examination, however, this idea is nowhere described in the specification or claims. As Mr Turner pointed out, the specification does not expressly state that restricting access to programme schedule information includes restricting access to the programme title, and it is unclear whether it goes that far (Fig. 41 suggests that it only envisages restricting access to information other than the title). Even if it does, there has to be some indication that the programme has been locked (e.g. a padlock symbol in the appropriate space in the grid) and an opportunity for the user to unlock it by entering the PIN code. No doubt as a result, in Rovi’s written closing submissions, the inventive concept was expressed as follows: “restricting the ability to view programme schedule information based on parental control options and (of claim 4) additionally restricting access to the programme content”. Although the reformulated version is closer to Virgin’s formulation, there remains an important difference between them. Virgin contend that the core inventive concept is simply restricting the ability to view programme content and/or programme schedule information based on parental control options. The difference is that Virgin contend that there is no suggestion in 234 of using the restriction on viewing programme schedule information <span style="font-style:italic">as a means for</span> preventing access to the programme content.

Rovi dispute this. The crux of the issue can be expressed in this way: is integer E satisfied by a method in which entering the code turns off the parental control options (which has the consequence that any viewer can see any previously restricted information) or does it require a method in which entering the code enables the viewer to see particular restricted information without turning off the parental control options (which has the consequence that only the current viewer can see only the restricted information in question)? I agree with Rovi that as a pure matter of language it is possible to interpret this integer as meaning “the information is restricted, but you can turn off the restriction to view the information”. Construing it purposively in the context of the preceding integers of the claim and of the specification as a whole, however, I consider that the skilled team would understand it to require a method in which entering the code enables the viewer to see particular restricted information without turning off the parental control options altogether.    </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Secondly, Rovi contend that this integer extends to a method in which entering the code merely allows the viewer first to access the parental control options screen so as then to turn the parental control options off and then to access the previously restricted information. Virgin dispute this. What this issue adds to the first is that entering the code does not (without more) enable the viewer to view the restricted information. As a pure matter of language, one might read this integer either way: the word “capable” favours Rovi’s interpretation, while the words “is” and “when” favour Virgin’s. Counsel for Rovi submitted that the purpose of this integer was simply to impose the barrier of a code between the user and the information. I am prepared to accept that the skilled team would not think that it mattered if an additional step was required (for example, pushing a special button on the remote after entering the code). </p>

Virgin contend that these steps must be performed in order as follows: integers F and G are the set-up phase, and can be reversed, but after that the sequence must be H then I then J. Rovi contend that these steps can be performed in any order. I agree with Virgin that, reading the claim purposively and in the context of the specification of whole, it is implicit that the steps must be performed in sequence.

Virgin contend that this requires that the record contains a field which is specific to the programme. Rovi contend that it is sufficient that it contains a field which is specific to the channel, and hence to every programme identified elsewhere in the database as being on that channel. In support of Rovi’s construction, counsel for Rovi argued that the skilled team would appreciate that the structure of the database in which the information was stored did not matter, that the specification made it clear at [0009] that part of the purpose of the invention was to provide a simple method of channel blocking and accordingly that the patentee could not have intended to limit the claim to records containing fields specific to the programme. I do not accept this argument. Although it is quite true that part of the purpose of the invention is to provide a parental control system which includes the ability to lock channels, it would be clear to the skilled team from [0009], [0026] and the description of both embodiments that the main purpose of the invention was to </p>

Furthermore, the language used in the claim confirms this understanding: the claim language is clearly expressed at the programme level and not at the channel level.

Integer E requires receiving “a user command to display stored television program schedule information”. Integer H requires that the prompt is displayed “in response to the user command when it requests display of restricted program schedule information”. Virgin contend that the user command in integer H is the same user command as in integer E. Rovi command that it may be a different user command. In my judgment Virgin’s construction is the correct one. Counsel for Rovi relied on the fact that integer does not say “said user command”; but it does say “the user command”, which amounts to the same thing since it presupposes an antecedent and there is only one possible antecedent. Furthermore, this conclusion is supported by the fact that the claim specifies a sequence of steps as discussed below. Counsel for Rovi also argued that the two user commands were doing different things, because integer H refers to “restricted” program schedule information while integer E does not. This is not correct. Between integers E and H, integer F has established whether or not viewing programme schedule information is restricted by checking the appropriate field in the record. If the information is restricted, then the prompt for a code is displayed at H. </p>

Integer G requires that “restricted program schedule information is displayed when a code is received from the user in response to a prompt”. Virgin contend that this means that display must be a direct causal consequence of the entry of the code, and hence of the user command to display the program schedule information. Rovi dispute this. I agree with Virgin. As counsel for Virgin pointed out, this integer does not use the language “capable of being viewed” of granted claim 1, and so the conclusion that it requires display of the information in response to entry of the code is all the stronger. Furthermore, this conclusion is supported by the single user command point discussed above and the sequence of steps considered below.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Before turning to the substantive issues on added matter, it is convenient to address three linked preliminary points. The first is that Rovi contend that the granted claims were based on [0111], whereas the EPO claims are based on [0095]. Virgin dispute this, and contend that both sets of claims must be based on the description of the Lockout screen embodiment, and in particular [0110]-[0112]. This is because both sets of claims include within their scope the restriction of programme schedule information for programs on a particular channel basis (see granted claims 7 and 17 and EPO claims 1 and 5), whereas the description of the Key Lock Access embodiment explicitly excludes this at [0099]. I agree with this. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The second is that Virgin also contend that the claims cannot be based on [0111] alone, because that paragraph cannot be divorced from the preceding and succeeding paragraphs. Again, I agree with this. As counsel for Virgin pointed out, the mere fact that part of the description of the Lockout screen embodiment is divided into three paragraphs, whereas the corresponding part of the description of the Key Lock Access screen embodiment is contained in the single paragraph [0095], would not cause the skilled reader to read them in a different way. The skilled team would understand that both passages describe a single indivisible process. Furthermore, [0111] makes no sense on its own. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The third is that Rovi contend that the second and third sentences of [0111] disclose a distinct feature independently of the remainder of the method i.e. the method may be used to restrict access to programme schedule information independently of whether it may be used to restrict access to programmes. Virgin dispute this. Again, I agree with Virgin. It is true that the third sentence begins “Additionally”, which might indicate an independent feature, but both the second and third sentence contain the word “also”. Read in context, the skilled team would understand from this that the method enables access to the programme schedule information to be restricted as well as access to the programmes themselves. It is also true that both [0112] and [0113] say that, if the user enters the lockout code, the system will tune to or order the programme “or” display its schedule information. There is no suggestion, however, that a user who is locked out of the programme schedule information relating to a particular programme can nevertheless access the programme itself.       </p>

Ms Bestler cannot have intended her words to be subject to detailed semantic analysis and that is not how the skilled team would read them. There is no reason to think that, just because she used the word “receive” in the third sentence, as opposed to the word “displayed” in the second sentence, she was intending to draw a fundamental distinction between the two, as opposed to varying her language to avoid monotony. This is particularly so given the context of the two sentences as indicated by the main heading (“Downloaded data, not images”) and the sub-heading (“Conditional display of data/user filtering”). Both sides prayed in aid other aspects of the context, but in my view these do not significantly affect the interpretation of this passage. I conclude that the skilled team would understand Bestler to suggest that the system should enable the conditional display/user filtering of detailed movie descriptions for adult channels i.e. that users should be able to control whether such descriptions were displayed or not. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">On this basis, Virgin contend that (i) the skilled team would appreciate that viewing detailed movie descriptions for adult channels was a parental control issue, (ii) the skilled team would note what Bester had said about consistency of the user interface and (iii) it would obvious to the skilled team that the techniques which Bestler suggests using for channel and programme locking could also be used for restricting access to programme information such as movie descriptions for adult channels.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Apart from the dispute over the disclosure of Bestler, Rovi relied upon three main arguments as to why this would not have been obvious. The first is that restricting programme information was counter-intuitive since the designer of an EPG would want to display as much information as possible. I do not accept that this would have been the approach of the skilled team for the reason given in paragraph 140 above. In addition, Bestler herself provides a clear explanation as to why this is not the correct approach.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The second argument is that the skilled team would not have had any motive to restrict access to programme information. So far as the skilled team’s perception based on their common general knowledge is concerned, I have already considered and rejected this contention in paragraph 134-139 above. In addition, however, Bestler herself supplies a clear reason for doing this, namely enabling viewers to avoid unwanted exposure to detailed descriptions of adult programmes. Mr Vogel suggested that the obvious way to do this was not to include such descriptions in the database, but this would deny the information to those who wanted it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The third argument was to ask why, if this was obvious, it had not been done before. I am not impressed with this argument. It is true that, as counsel for Rovi pointed out, the development of interactive EPGs was a field in which there was considerable activity in the early 1990s. Bestler was only published around a year before the priority date, however, and there is no evidence that it was widely read. Furthermore, it is clear from Mr Turner’s evidence that it was only in about 1993/94 that it was becoming possible to download sufficient quantities of EPG data to an STB to enable this to be done. As counsel for Virgin pointed out in his closing submissions, simply obtaining and disseminating the programme schedule information, something which 234 takes for granted, required a substantial investment in infrastructure.  </p>

SuperGuide was originally marketed by SuperGuide Corp as a standalone unit in 1986. By 1990 SuperGuide Corp had developed an improved version of SuperGuide, referred to as “SuperGuide 2”, which was incorporated into the Uniden 4800. The Uniden 4800 was exhibited by Mr Hallenbeck at a satellite industry show in Nashville in July 1990, and it was launched shortly afterwards. Mr Hallenbeck described in his statements the functionality of  the Uniden 4800, including SuperGuide 2, in considerable detail. It used EPG data broadcast via a dedicated satellite channel which was stored in a database in the Uniden 4800. The data included attributes of programmes such as MPAA rating and warnings of potentially objectionable content, e.g. adult, violence, nudity. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">SuperGuide 2 had a “Parental Lock” feature, which allowed users to lock specific channels. This feature did not restrict access to information about programmes showing on that channel, but did prevent access to the channel itself. A locked channel was identified by a padlock symbol next to any programme listing for that channel. In response to an attempt by a user to view the channel by any means, a password prompt would be displayed, and correct entry of the password allowed the channel to be viewed. </p>

Unlike Bestler and the Davis Demonstration, the Uniden 4800 does not disclose locking programmes as opposed to channels. Accordingly, it is little different to the common general knowledge approach. I am not persuaded that it was an obvious step to go from channel locks to restricting access to programme information on a per programme basis. Accordingly, I conclude that EPO claim 1 is not obvious over the Uniden 4800. On other hand, I consider that it would have been an obvious step from the Uniden 4800 to restrict the display of programme information for locked channels as a whole. Accordingly, I conclude that the granted claims are obvious over the Uniden 4800.     </p>

Both the TiVo and VHD STBs store programme listings information transmitted to them in a database. There is a flag (“the adult flag”) in a field in the database which indicates if a channel is an adult channel. In the case of the TiVo STB, this is a single bit in a 64 bit field called [channelBits] in a table called UclChannel. In the case of the VHD STBs, this is a field called [category] in a Javascript array called sChannels Array, which is regarded as indicating an adult channel if the value of the [category] field is 12.  </p>

Channel information is stored in the Virgin Media applications layer, while programme information is stored in the Seachange layer. The Virgin Media applications layer maintains a list of channels to be displayed in the TV Guide (“the Channel List”). If Hide Adult Listings has been activated, the system checks the [category] field in the sChannels array, and if this is 12 the channel is not added to the Channel List.    When programme information is required to populate the TV Guide, the Virgin Media applications layer makes an API (Application Programming Interface) call to the Seachange layer in form of a search command for programmes on the channels identified for display in the Channel List. The results of the search are returned in the form of a Javascript object called TV Program Object. This occurs channel by channel.

By contrast, if the user is receiving both cable and terrestrial services and he has two input ports on his television, he can attach one to each port; but if he does not have two input ports, he must manually switch from one to the other. Manual switching is unacceptable to many consumers, however, and manually switching between channels becomes more complicated as the number of channel sources is increased.  </p>

In the preferred embodiment, the system then carries out an automatic switching/tuning process that switches the input to the television (either<span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt"> </span>RF or video) to a source device. Source devices include DBS, cable box, television tuner, etc. The system then tunes to the required channel for the desired show. Additionally, the source identifier can be utilized to switch between various devices automatically when unattended VCR programming is desired. Furthermore, when program information is received from multiple satellite sources and a desired channel is selected, the present invention can, in one embodiment, automatically move the customer’s satellite dish such that the customer receives the desired program from the associated source. The present invention then tunes to the correct channel. </p>

For example, in the case of DBS/local channel implementations, a channel map is created with both local cable and DBS channels merged. The local channels and the DBS channels are tagged with a source identifier. When the user/consumer selects a non-DBS channel from the guide, the integrated receiver decoder unit (IRD box) for the satellite switches the IRD to couple the local cable to the receiver. The system then tunes the television tuner or other tuning device to the required channel. If a DBS channel is later selected, the system switches the IRD to couple the satellite receiver/decoder to the receiver. The system then tunes the DBS tuner to the selected DBS channel. In the case of, for example, cable and antenna inputs, the system switches to the correct video input and then tunes the television tuner to the required channel for receiving the selected source.

Although he was also from a cable background, he appeared to have had a greater knowledge of satellite television at the time than Mr Hassell. As with Mr Turner, Counsel for Rovi submitted that Mr Adams’ evidence with regard to the prior art was influenced by hindsight, since he had been shown 1856 before being asked to consider the prior art. This is particularly important with regard to Young, since as discussed below there is an important issue as to what Young discloses. Again, I agree that it would have been better if Mr Adams had been asked to form a view as to the disclosure of Young before reading the Patent, and I have therefore approached Mr Adams’ evidence on this topic with a degree of caution.       </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">It is necessary, however, to say a little more about re-transmission of OTA channels by cable. It is common ground that it was commonplace in 1995 for cable operators to carry both cable-specific and re-transmitted OTA channels. Where an OTA channel was available by cable, the viewer would use that source rather than the OTA antenna, both for simplicity and because cable signals were usually better than OTA signals even in the absence of geographical obstructions. It was very rare for cable subscription packages to consist only of re-transmitted OTA channels. There was some debate as to the extent to which OTA channels were not re-transmitted. The evidence on this topic focussed exclusively on the situation in the USA, no doubt because that was the largest and most-developed cable market in 1995. The conclusion which I draw from the evidence is that, although the bulk of local OTA channels were carried by cable providers, some local OTA channels were not, particularly in the larger cities. The channels which were not re-transmitted were the less popular ones; but, as Mr Adams pointed out, that does not make any difference to the person who wants to receive a particular a channel. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Counsel for Rovi submitted that the evidence showed that in 1995 the industry was partitioned between OTA, cable and satellite. I do not accept this. Cable operators retransmitted OTA channels, distributed their services to cable headends by satellite and were getting involved in DTH satellite broadcasting. Furthermore, cable operators participated in a project for EPG standardisation which was predicated upon the availability of television via OTA, cable and satellite. At the level of STBs, these were not multifunctional devices, but both cable STCs and satellite IRDs included bypass switches for OTA signals. Thus the skilled team would have been well aware of these different kinds of television service, even if their background was in OTA, cable or satellite. Furthermore, the skilled team would have been aware that, at least in some circumstances, users might need, or at least want, to access more than one kind of service and to be able to switch between them.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Both claim 1 and claim 12 refer to “sources”, “source devices” and “transmission schemes”. It is very difficult to understand precisely what the Patent means by “sources” and “source devices”, and whether these are intended to be the same or different. Although I have stripped out the reference numerals from the claims in paragraph 233 above, it is noticeable that both claims refer in different places to numerals 26, 28, 30 as being both “sources” and “source devices”. In the description the terms “sources” and “source devices” appear to be used almost interchangeably. Certainly, if they are intended to mean different things, the distinction is not consistently maintained. For example, the specification refers in [0012] to the embodiments shown in Figs. 1A and 1B as having “multiple sources”, while the embodiment shown in Fig. 1C is said to have “DBS and cable as “source devices”. Similarly, the specification states in [0013] that in the preferred embodiment “television channel broadcasts are received from at least two separate sources such as (1) cable and a satellite dish, or (2) two different satellites, or (3) local cable and DBS sources”, while in [0014] it says that “Source devices include DBS, cable box, television tuner, etc.” Similarly, the specification refers in [0022] to “multiple sources 26, 28 and 30”, while in [0023] it says that “DBS (via IRD box 28) and cable (via cable box 26) are source devices”. In addition, claim 1 refers to “a plurality of sources using source devices” whereas claim 12 refers to “multiple source devices” and “said sources” in integer D of claim 12 has no antecedent. By contrast, the term “transmission schemes” causes less difficulty, since it is only mentioned in [0004] and in the claims.  </p>

In my judgment it is clear from [0013] (“two separate sources such … two different satellites”), [0014] (“multiple satellite sources”) and [0017] (“multiple satellite sources”) that the specification proceeds on the basis that the signals received from different satellites are from different sources/source devices. Equally, it is clear from [0004] that the specification proceeds on the basis that “conventional satellite dishes” (which the skilled team would understand to mean dishes primarily intended for reception at cable headends e.g. C-band systems) and “DBS systems” (e.g. Ku-band systems) employ different transmission schemes and hence are different sources/source devices.

The Uniden 4800 allowed the user to have inputs from one or two satellite dishes, which could be directed towards multiple satellites. It could receive a signal from one dish on the C-band, and from the other on the Ku-band. Alternatively, a single dish could be used but with different LNBs for the C-band and Ku-band signals. The Uniden 4800 was indifferent to whether the satellite was conventional or DBS. It only needed to know the satellite position, band and polarity. The Uniden 4800’s SuperGuide EPG showed programmes and channels from multiple satellite transponders (whether C-band or Ku-band). The programme information database was downloaded to and stored by the STB. This included, for each channel, sufficient information about each satellite transponder source to allow the device to switch to the correct satellite source and tune to the correct channel. There were separate transponder-to-frequency tables for C-band channels and Kuband channels. There were versions of the Uniden 4800 that also included an IR emitter for controlling a VCR. </p>

As I have construed those terms, these requirements were satisfied by the Uniden 4800. The simplest way to look at this is by considering use of the Uniden 4800 to receive signals from a conventional satellite and a DBS satellite using separate dishes. In that event, there would be two sources and source devices (the conventional satellite dish and the DBS satellite dish) and two different transmission schemes (conventional and DBS). More specifically, the Uniden 4800 could receive both C-band and Ku-band signals.

Virgin, supported by Mr Adams, contend that it discloses switching between cable and OTA channels. Rovi, supported by Mr Hassell, contend that Young discloses a cable-only device. Both Mr Hassell and Mr Adams addressed this issue in their reports and both were cross-examined on it.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Virgin rely on four main aspects of the document. The first is the passage referring to “over-the-air subscribers” (quoted in paragraph 282 above). As is common ground, the skilled team would not think that Young meant this literally: there were no OTA subscribers. Nor can it be a reference to subscribers to re-transmitted OTA channels (whether as part of a pure re-transmitted OTA package or a mixed re-transmitted OTA and cable package) since they would be included in the “all cable channels” previously referred to.  Mr Adams’ evidence was that he interpreted Young as referring to subscribers to a data feed that arrived OTA. This could be programme information carried in the VBI of the OTA channels, which could not be stripped by the cable companies. Mr Hassell accepted in cross-examination that this was a possible interpretation. In my view it makes better sense than any other interpretation. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The second aspect is the passage saying that all broadcast stations will be listed and then all cable services (quoted in paragraph 283 above). Mr Adams interpreted this as meaning OTA then cable. Mr Hassell interpreted it as meaning re-transmitted OTA then cable-specific. I prefer Mr Adams’ interpretation since it does not say “all other cable services”. On its own, this is a small point, however. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The third aspect is the statement that the Fig. 22A “receives a TV signal from antenna 200 and/or from cable input 205” (see paragraph 285 above). Mr Adams interpreted this as meaning exactly what it said: the signal could be an OTA or cable signal. Mr Hassell acknowledged that this sentence was inconsistent with his view that Young related only to cable delivery. His evidence was to the effect that this was just a stray reference in a patent application which, read a whole, was all about cable. If this sentence stood on its own, I might agree with this; but it does not.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The fourth aspect is what is shown in Fig. 22A. There are two points here. The first is that item 202 is shown as connected to both the antenna and cable via lines 201 and 205 and is described as “TV tuner/cable decoder”. The second is that line 216 goes from the TV tuner decoder to the TV/monitor (via the video switcher). As Mr Adams explained, it is clear from this that the device disclosed in Fig. 22A can deliver both OTA and cable signals to the TV. I did not understand Mr Hassell to dispute this, but he pointed out that Young does not explicitly describe switching between these sources (at least, unless you interpret the sentence considered in paragraph 292 above in that way). Rovi also rely on the fact that the same signal goes to the VBI decoder, and thus can be used to deliver EPG data through the OTA VBI; but in my this does not detract from the point Virgin rely on.  </p>

On that basis, the difference between Young and claim 1 is that Young does not explicitly disclose a source identifier. It would be clear to the skilled team that such an identifier was necessary, however, and they would know how to implement this. Accordingly, I conclude that claim 1 is obvious. Claims 4 and 5 are also obvious. Since Young discloses an IR emitter, so too is claim 12.                    </p>

The way in which this is done depends on whether one is considering the “Phase 3” or “Phase 4” implementations mentioned in the PPD. An important feature common to both implementations is that, when the user chooses to view a past program, all the TiVo STB knows is the state of the catch-up flag for that program. If the flag shows that the program is supposed to be available on catch-up, the TiVo STB has to request further information from servers in the TiVo Service Centre (which it does by communicating over IP through the DOCSIS modem) about the catch-up possibilities. It does this by conducting what is called an Offer Search, and downloading an Offer file or files. </p>

Instead, the STB selects the first Offer received (after giving preference to Offers relating to Virgin Media VOD-provided catch-up, but in a different way to Phase 3), and then an application is launched. Which application is launched depends ultimately on the “partnerID” in the Offer file, which differs as between VM VOD and the BBC. In the former case, the VM VOD Software application will launch, which then communicates with the Seachange servers to set up playback via the QAM tuners as for Phase 3. In the latter case, the iPlayer application is launched and results in streaming via the DOCSIS modem as for Phase 3. </p>
