Sovaldi represents a significant breakthrough in the treatment of Hepatitis C virus (“HCV”). A standard course of treatment of Sovaldi takes from only 12 weeks (a significant reduction compared to previously available HCV treatments), has a high efficacy rate and few, if any, side effects when compared with other treatments. Sovaldi received a marketing authorisation from the European Medicines Agency in January 2014. In the UK it is in the process of approval by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (“NICE”). On 15 August 2014 NICE published draft guidance on Sovaldi which contained positive recommendations based <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span> on the cost-effectiveness of the treatment. By contrast, Idenix has no product either on the market or near to receiving a marketing authorisation which is covered by the Patent. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">Gilead deny infringement and counterclaim for revocation of the Patent on the grounds of lack of novelty over Gilead’s own International Patent Application PCT/US2004/012472 (“the Pharmasset PCT”), lack of inventive step, insufficiency and added matter. Somewhat unusually, there is an issue as to the entitlement to priority, not of the Patent, but of the Pharmasset PCT. As explained below, this involves issues both of fact and US law. In support of their allegation of insufficiency, Gilead rely upon work done by a number of Idenix scientists. As part of their answer to Gilead’s case on this point, Idenix rely upon certain experiments conducted for the purposes of these proceedings.  Idenix contend that claims 1, 5-7, 21 and 24 are independently valid and infringed. Idenix have also made a conditional application to amend the Patent. As a result, there are a considerable number of issues to be determined, on which the parties adduced a large body of evidence.  </p>

On 17 March 2014, Gilead filed its Defence and Counterclaim. Gilead applied to expedite the trial, and on 16 April 2014 Birss J gave directions for an expedited trial. As a result, the case came on for trial in less than seven months from the grant of the Patent and the commencement of the proceedings. The parties and their representatives are to be congratulated on having brought such a complex patent case on for trial so swiftly and so efficiently. </p>

IPI was founded (as Novirio Pharmaceuticals Inc) by Dr Jean-Pierre Sommadossi in May 1998. On 31 March 2003 it was announced that Novartis was to acquire a majority stake in IPI, together with the right jointly to develop IPI’s HCV drug candidate NM283. As noted above, the Application was filed on 27 June 2003. As their names indicate, IPI’s co-applicants, and co-proprietors of the Patent, are academic institutions. In August 2014 IPI was acquired by Merck &amp; Co Inc. </p>

He is Chair of the Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Alberta in Canada, a position he has held since July 2014. He studied chemistry at undergraduate level at the University of Kiel and then the Technical University of Munich from 1984-1991, and obtained the equivalent of an MSc degree in 1991. He obtained a PhD from the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in 1997 for studies on the reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme of HIV-1, a multifunctional enzyme that possesses DNA polymerase and ribonuclease H activities and is critical for replication of HIV. He was a postdoctoral researcher at the Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research at the Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Canada between 1997 and 2000. During this time, he turned his attention to mechanisms of action and resistance associated with nucleoside analogue RT inhibitors. He started his own lab at the Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research in 2000 working on HIV as well as HCV and related viruses. He studied the structure and function of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, also referred to as NS5B, in both HCV and BVDV. Working with commercially available nucleotide analogues that lacked the 3'-hydroxyl group, his group observed in cellfree biochemical assays that chain termination with these compounds could be reversible in the BVDV model. They presented these findings at the 10th International Meeting of HCV and Related Viruses in December 2003. In 2005 Prof Götte moved to the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at McGill University, Montreal, Canada. In 2007 he was promoted to Associate Professor and in 2011 to full Professor. His interests over the last 14 years have covered a broad range of viruses, including HIV, HCV, BVDV, and human herpes viruses. Recent findings from his laboratory have contributed to the development of novel classes of viral polymerase inhibitors with antiviral activity against resistant variants. He has published his work on viral polymerases in approximately 80 peer reviewed papers. He is also the coeditor/co-author of a number of books and book chapters. </p>

Much of counsel’s cross-examination was devoted to trying to persuade Prof Götte to accept that the level of common general knowledge was higher and that this impacted on the question of plausibility, but that does not establish that Prof Götte proceeded on the wrong basis. More generally, counsel for Idenix submitted that Prof Götte’s approach was extreme and in several respects unsatisfactory. I do not accept this either.

He received an undergraduate degree in Medicinal Chemistry from the University of Rome “La Sapienza” in 1996.  In 2001 he was awarded a PhD from the University of Cardiff for a thesis on a new group of nucleosides with antiviral activity. From February 2001 to September 2002 he undertook post-doctoral research in Professor Chris McGuigan’s group. This research focussed on phosphorylation of, and chemical modifications to, nucleoside analogues that might have activity against HBV and HIV. In particular, it included modifications to the 5'-phosphate group of such nucleotides. As part of that work, he investigated prodrugs, including masked phosphate prodrugs, of such nucleoside analogues. During his PhD and post-doctoral work, he personally synthesised a considerable number of nucleosides. He also used the fluorinating agent diethylaminosulphur trifluoride (DAST). In September 2002 he was appointed to a lectureship in the School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. He is an author on approximately a hundred peer-reviewed journal articles in a variety of journals concerned with medicinal chemistry and allied fields. </p>

Counsel for Gilead gave three reasons for this. First, Dr Brancale was not actively working in the field of nucleoside analogues against HCV, and in particular NS5B inhibitors, at the date of the Patent. When he took up his lectureship, he started work on a project on HCV helicase which was not published until 2009. He did not become interested in NS5B until 2009. By contrast, Prof Götte was working on NS5B in 2003. Secondly, Dr Brancale had not carried out any fluorination reactions on a sugar ring during his career. Indeed, he had only once fluorinated a primary carbon and had not fluorinated a tertiary carbon. By contrast, Prof Boons had considerable experience in fluorinating sugars, including for the purpose of synthesising modified nucleotides, although he had little experience of synthesising nucleoside analogues. Thirdly, Dr Brancale’s particular interest since 2006, when he ceased doing wet chemistry in the laboratory, has been in computer modelling of biological problems and drug design. I agree with counsel for Gilead that each of these three points, and particularly the first two, constitute significant limitations in Dr Brancale’s expertise. Nevertheless, he did have the most experience of nucleoside synthesis of all the experts, and that experience was gained during the period prior to the date of the Patent.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">Counsel for Gilead also submitted that Dr Brancale’s evidence was unsatisfactory in five respects, the first three of which stemmed from the nature of his instructions. First, Dr Brancale prepared his expert reports with the understanding that the common general knowledge included anything that turned up on a literature search. Secondly, Dr Brancale was not provided with the Application before preparing his first expert report. Thus he only considered it after he had read, and formed his opinions as to the disclosure of, the Patent. Thirdly, Dr Brancale was not asked to consider the allegation that the Patent fails to disclose a technical contribution over the prior art. Fourthly, Dr Brancale had what counsel characterised as an eccentric view of the disclosure of a patent or patent application. By contrast with his approach to scientific papers, he did not focus on the technical information they contained. Rather, he approached such documents as an exercise in detecting the commercial intentions of the proprietor. He thought that a patentee “will keep some hidden cards” by holding back data, and that by focussing on the claims one could deduce what the patentee regarded as the most promising compounds despite the absence of supporting data or a scientific rationale from the patent. Fifthly, counsel submitted that Dr Brancale’s evidence about the use of DAST was tainted with hindsight.  </p>

The third point is not accurate. As to the fourth point, I did find Dr Brancale’s approach to patents and patent applications somewhat unusual for a scientist, but it is right to acknowledge that he made it clear that he was not saying that the scientific content of the document should be disregarded. I will address the fifth point below.  </p>

I do not accept this. It is correct that Prof Boons’ focus is on carbohydrate chemistry, but this is very relevant to the synthesis of nucleoside analogues, since one of the two main routes for such syntheses involves modifying the sugar. An illustration of this point is that, as explained in paragraphs 560-563 below, Mr Clark and his colleagues published some of their synthetic work in the Journal of Carbohydrate Chemistry, a journal for which Prof Boons serves on the editorial board and acts as peer reviewer and which is on his research group’s reading list. Furthermore, as discussed above, Prof Boons did have some experience of synthesising modified nucleotides. He also had some experience in antiviral research, but in any event it would not have mattered if he had not, because that part of the case was addressed by Prof Götte.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">I would make three general comments about the expert evidence on US law. The first is that the reports prepared by the experts not only dealt with the relevant principles of law, but also their application to the facts of the case. The evidence on the latter aspect was inadmissible. I do not blame the experts for this, but those instructing them should have known better. The second was that, at the pre-trial review on 20 September 2014, there was a dispute as to whether the experts should be crossexamined (as Idenix proposed) or whether cross-examination should dispensed with (as Gilead proposed). At my suggestion, the parties agreed a compromise under which it was ordered that the experts should be cross-examined by videolink from the USA for a maximum of 1½ hours each. By the time the experts came to give evidence, the parties had sensibly prepared an agreed statement on US law setting out a considerable number of agreed principles and a small number of disputed principles, from which it became clear that there was very little dispute as to the relevant principles of Georgia law and limited areas of dispute as to Federal patent law. Accordingly, counsel were able to keep all their cross-examinations, but particularly the cross-examinations of the Georgia experts, shorter than the time allowed. The third comment is that no one suggested that any of the experts was other than very well qualified and trying to assist the court.           </p>

The critical interaction in polymerase-catalyzed DNA or RNA synthesis involves the 3'-hydroxyl group of the nucleotide on the DNA or RNA of the so-called “primer” strand, which is complementary to the strand being copied (the “template”). The 3'-hydroxyl of the growing primer strand attacks the first (or <span style="font-family:'Segoe UI Symbol'"></span>) phosphate group of the incoming 5’nucleotide nucleoside triphosphate that forms a base pair with the template strand. This forms a 3',5'-phosphate diester linkage which builds up the backbone structure of the DNA or RNA.

Enzymes are functional proteins that are required to catalyse reactions within cells. To do this, enzymes must interact with their substrate. This takes place in the active site of the enzyme. The way in which enzymes work is closely related to their complex three-dimensional structure. Knowledge of the structure of an enzyme is an important tool in understanding how an enzyme works.  </p>

Cytotoxic effects are therapeutic in cancer, as the object of the treatment is for the nucleoside analogue to cause cell death, with a greater ultimate effect on the quickly replicating cancer cells than the other cells. Conversely, cytotoxic effects should be avoided in the development of nucleoside analogues to treat viral infections where the aim is to kill the virus rather than the host cells.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">The antiviral activity of the nucleoside analogue RBV was discovered in 1972. RBV shows a broad spectrum of activities against unrelated RNA viruses from diverse families that share little genetic sequence homology, e.g. HCV and respiratory syncytial virus. The structure of RBV has similarities to naturally occurring nucleosides, but it contains a pseudo base that resembles A or G in their ability to base pair with U and C, respectively, depending on its rotation. </p>

In theory, nucleoside analogues can be altered at most positions on the sugar ring and the base by the addition of a range of substituents. But to have antiviral activity, they still need to be recognised by cellular enzymes to phosphorylate the nucleoside analogue to the active triphosphate form and be recognised by the viral polymerase to catalyse its incorporation into the viral RNA chain. It was appreciated that even small changes in the nucleoside analogue can lead to significant changes in its activity. These changes can give rise to toxicity, inactivity or antiviral therapeutic potential. Once a promising candidate compound has been found, studies can be carried out to try to understand how its structure affects its mechanism of action. Typically, this involves making small changes to the structure and seeing how these affect its activity, enabling a picture to be built up of the structure-activity relationship.  </p>

In general, these compounds contain chemical modifications in either the sugar or the nucleobase of the nucleoside or both. The aim of the modifications when developing antiviral compounds is to ensure that the biosynthesis of DNA and RNA of the target virus is affected, but this needs to be done without causing harm to healthy host cells (which produce their own DNA or RNA).

The chemical basis for Markovnikov's Rule is the formation of the most stable carbocation during the addition process. However, it may not always be straightforward to predict which carbocation will be the most stable in a given molecule, and mixtures of regioisomers may be possible.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">The successful synthesis of a complex target compound typically involves selecting protecting groups based on the consideration of various issues, such as the reaction conditions required to introduce a protecting group and the fact that the installation of the group chosen should be compatible with the other functionalities in the compound. In addition, the protecting groups chosen must be stable under the conditions used during subsequent synthetic steps, and generally need to be capable of being installed and removed under mild conditions in a highly selective manner and high yield.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">It is also important to appreciate that there are circumstances in which protecting groups are not innocent bystanders in chemical transformations and may affect the reactivity of other functionalities. For example, electron withdrawing ester functionalities reduce the nucleophilicity of neighboring hydroxy groups. Furthermore, bulky protecting groups can sterically block other functionalities, and protecting groups may affect the conformation of the molecule which can in turn affect the reactivity of the compound. </p>

The protecting groups for hydroxyl groups included benzyl, benzoyl and tetraisopropyldisiloxanyl ether (“TIPDS”). TIPDS is useful in nucleoside analogue synthesis because it enables simultaneous protection, and then simultaneous deprotection, of the hydroxyl groups at the 3' and 5' positions.   </p>

It employs a sheet of glass, plastic, or aluminum foil that is coated with a thin layer of an adsorbent material, such as silica gel or aluminum oxide. After the sample has been applied to the plate, a solvent or solvent mixture is drawn up the plate via capillary action. Often, different organic compounds interact differently with the adsorbent material and therefore ascend at different rates up the TLC plate, resulting in separation of the different organic compounds in the mixture. The location of the compounds on the TLC plate can often be determined by holding it under UV light. Additionally or alternatively, the TLC plate can be stained with a chemical which causes the “spots” of compound to become visible to the naked eye. A stain which is commonly used in the fields of carbohydrate, and hence nucleoside, chemistry is 10% sulphuric acid in methanol. The TLC place is subsequently heated, which causes carbohydratecontaining compounds to char, and hence the spots to become brown. </p>

Suitable salts include those derived from alkali metals such as potassium and sodium, alkaline earth metals such as calcium and magnesium, among numerous other acids well known in the pharmaceutical art. Pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs refer to a compound that is metabolized, for example hydrolyzed or oxidized, in the host to form the compound of the present invention. Typical examples of prodrugs include compounds that have biologically labile protecting groups on a functional moiety of the active compound. Prodrugs include compounds that can be oxidized, reduced, aminated, deaminated, hydroxylated, dehydroxylated, hydrolyzed, dehydrolyzed, alkylated, dealkylated, acylated, deacylated, phosphorylated, dephosphorylated to produce the active compound.

A number of nucleotide prodrug ligands are known. In general, alkylation, acylation or other lipophilic modification of the mono-, di-or triphosphate of the nucleoside reduces polarity and allows passage into cells. Examples of substituent groups that can replace one or more hydrogens on the phosphate moiety are alkyl, aryl, steroids, carbohydrates, including sugars, 1,2-diacylglycerol and alcohols. Many are described in R. Jones and N. Bischoferger, Antiviral Research, 1995, 27:1-17. Any of these can be used in combination with the disclosed nucleosides to achieve a desired effect.” </p>

As a result of this request, Idenix’s patent attorneys discussed the meaning of the term “phosphate” with the examiner during a telephone conversation on 21 October 2013. In that conversation Idenix’s patent attorneys argued that the term “phosphate” was “a generic term including mono-, di- and triphosphate derivatives”, while the examiner took the view that “phosphate, when nothing else is mentioned, is a clear term for the skilled person meaning a monophosphate and not a derivative thereof”. Accordingly, claim 38 was rejected by the examiner.  </p>

Dr Brancale agreed, however, that the medicinal chemist and the virologist would collaborate in the synthesis and testing.

The first is that, unusually, it is Idenix who are contending that more information formed part of the common general knowledge than Gilead. Normally it is the party attacking the validity of the patent which tries to prove a higher level of common general knowledge. It is clear that Idenix’s purpose in trying to prove a higher level of common general knowledge is to attempt to remedy the deficiencies in the Patent. I shall return to this subject below.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">The second point is that the first area of dispute, which is the most important one, lies in what Idenix contend to be province of the medicinal chemist. Hence it was addressed by Dr Brancale rather than Prof Glenn. On Gilead’s side, however, it was addressed by Prof Götte rather than Prof Boons. This simply reflects the division of labour between the two pairs of experts that I have already discussed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">The third point is that Idenix primarily relied not on the evidence given by Dr Brancale, but upon evidence given by Prof Götte and upon a number of papers which had not been exhibited or referred to by either Dr Brancale or Prof Götte, but which were first produced shortly before the cross-examination of Prof Götte (or indeed were produced during the course of cross-examination).

From the Medicinal Chemist’s perspective, research on nucleoside analogues against HCV infection started in the late 1990s. Around the beginning of the 2000s, certain 2'-modified nucleoside analogues were known to have anti-HCV activities. The research activity in the area is reflected in International Patent Application WO 01/90121 published on 29 November 2001 which reports anti-HCV activities of 2'-methyl-up nucleoside analogues; and in WO 99/043691 published on 2 September 1999, which reports 2'-fluoro nucleoside analogues having anticancer activities and antiviral activities against several viruses including HCV. Further, other 2'-modified nucleoside analogues were reported to be active against other members of the <span style="font-style:italic">Flaviviridae</span> virus. For example, WO 01/92282 published on the 6 December 2001 reports 2'-methyl-up nucleoside analogues showing antiviral activities against BVDV and YFV. The existence of these patents illustrates the type of work that was being undertaken with respect to 2'-modified nucleoside analogues as anti-<span style="font-style:italic">Flaviviridae</span> agents.” </p>

Obviously, inhibition of this pivotal enzymatic activity would lead to suppression of the HCV replication in infected cells. The enzymatic reaction catalysed by NS5B, RNA-dependant RNA synthesis, is moreover a reaction not normally carried out in noninfected cells [119].

As more details of the HCV life cycle are elucidated, new targets and approaches will be discovered. Drug development is difficult, expensive, and always agonizingly slow for patients in need and their physicians. Nonetheless, a broad effort has been mounted for HCV, and substantial progress has been achieved.  The prospects for new HCV treatments are bright.

Recent studies on ribavirin suggest that some of its antiviral activity may result from the ability of NS5B to misincorporate ribavirin triphosphate into the viral genome (Maag et al., 2001). The mutagenized genome presumably decreases the fitness of progeny viruses. As such, nucleotides with this property could function as antiviral treatments, especially in combination with other drugs (Hong &amp; Cameron, 2002; Walker &amp; Hong, 2002). In contrast, chain terminators are proven viral DNA polymerase inhibitors and analogous RNA polymerase inhibitors are predicted. Indeed, Merck Research Laboratories (West Point, Pa., USA) recently described two ribonucleoside analogues that appear to act as chain terminators (Carroll et al., 2002). Both 2'methyl-adenosine (2'-Me-A) (Figure 6a) and 2'-O-methylcytidine (2'O-Me-C) (Figure 6b) inhibit NS5B in their triphosphate forms by using the replicase complex assay or the in vitro NS5B assay with IC50 values of 2.5 and 3.5 µM (replicase complex), and 1.9 and 3.8 µM (NS5B assay), respectively (Bhat et al., 2002; Carroll et al., 2002). The 2'-MeA was more active than 2'O-Me-C in an HB1 HCV replicon cell line (EC50 0.25 vs 21.5 µM) presumably due to inferior metabolism of 2’O-Me-C (poor conversion to the triphosphate form in vivo) (Bhat et al., 2002).

In addition, a class of 3'-deoxynucleoside analogues exhibits submicromolar activity in vitro (Figure 6d) (Ismaili et al., 2002). NS5B is known to be more selective for nucleotides lacking the 3'-OH group than for nucleotides lacking the 2'-OH group, which supports the potential of these compounds (Lohmann et al., 2000). The interest in inhibiting the HCV RdRp has led to the identification of new classes of compounds with great potential to serve as potent anti-HCV therapies.

In this report, we describe the identification of 2'-substituted nucleosides as inhibitors of HCV replication. The 5'-triphosphates of 2'-C-methyladenosine and 2'-O-methylcytidine are found to inhibit NS5B-catalyzed RNA synthesis in vitro, in a manner that is competitive with substrate nucleoside triphosphate. NS5B is able to incorporate either nucleotide analog into RNA as determined with gel-based incorporation assays but is impaired in its ability to extend the incorporated analog by addition of the next nucleotide. In a subgenomic replicon cell line, 2-C-methyladenosine and 2'-Omethylcytidine inhibit HCV RNA replication. The 5’-</p>

However, significantly higher concentrations of 2'-C-methyladenosine triphosphate than 2'-O-methylcytidine triphosphate are detected, consistent with the greater potency of 2'-Cmethyladenosine in the replicon assay, despite similar inhibition of NS5B by the triphosphates in the in vitro enzyme assays. Thus, the 2'-modifications of natural substrate nucleosides transform these molecules into potent inhibitors of HCV replication.” </p>

It states that ‘A class of compounds useful in treating inflammation-related disorders is defined by Formula 1’. I will deal with this submission and the other submissions on construction later in this judgment in the context in which they arise.

On the other hand the defendants contended that the invention of the specification was a class of compounds substantially all of which were both anti-inflammatory and had significantly less harmful side effects than the existing NSAIDs. They further said that the specification taught only two mechanisms for reducing harmful side effects: to provide Cox II selectivity, and further to provide Cox I inactivity. They submitted that while gastric-sparing qualities might arise from other causes, so far as the specification was concerned the teaching was such that the addressee would understand that the inventor's contribution lay in a class of compounds which possessed Cox II/Cox I selectivity at least when assayed in the manner described in the specification. However, apart from a specific teaching in respect of the thiophenes at page 3 line 29 (see paragraph 27 above) the patent neither identifies the members of the claimed class which possess Cox II selectivity nor those which do not inhibit Cox I. The defendants contend that accordingly the teaching of the patent is that all the claimed classes, or at least all the thiophenes, possess Cox II selectivity, and moreover produce a reduced amount of side effects. This question as to the teaching of the specification is fundamental to the dispute between the parties. …’ </p>

It was that contribution that merited a 20 year monopoly. In my view the only question capable of argument is whether the compounds in the class were chosen merely for their anti-inflammatory action or because in addition they had reduced side-effects due to them being Cox II selective.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">I will begin by considering Gilead’s primary contention. Prof Götte’s evidence was that “phosphate” meant a PO<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">4</span> group, i.e. monophosphate, and that it would not ordinarily be used as a collective term for all three phosphates. This receives support from a passage in the Recommendation on Nomenclature of Phosphorous-Containing Compounds of Biochemical Importance issued by the IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature in 1976 (<span style="font-style:italic">Biochem. J.</span>, 171, 1-19 (1978)), which states (at page 3) that “‘phosphate’ means that all atoms attached to the phosphorous atom are oxygen atoms”. Nevertheless, Prof Götte himself also said that the term “monophosphate” was usually used where it was necessary to draw a distinction between mono-, di- and triphosphates. This in itself suggests that “phosphate” can be used as a collective term for all three. This is indeed how the term is used in the wellknown textbook by Alberts <span style="font-style:italic">et al</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Molecular Biology of the Cell</span> (3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> ed, 1994) (at page 58), and Prof Götte accepted that this was not unreasonable. This accords with Dr Brancale’s evidence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">More importantly, I agree with counsel for Idenix that Gilead’s primary contention is at odds with the Patent. The specification refers at [0083] (corresponding to page 108 lines 16-24 of the Application, quoted in paragraph 201 above) to “alkylation, acylation or other lipophilic modification of the mono-, di- or triphosphate of the nucleoside”, and then refers back to this as a replacement “on the phosphate moiety”. Furthermore, the skilled team would know that the target enzyme in HCV, NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, interacts with triphosphates. The skilled team would also know that, in order to function as anti-viral drugs, nucleoside analogues generally undergo phosphorylation <span style="font-style:italic">in vivo</span> until they become triphosphates. Accordingly, the skilled team would conclude that it would make no sense for the Patent to exclude triphosphate from “phosphate”.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">Turning to Gilead’s secondary contention, I think that it is reasonably clear that the term “phosphate” is ordinarily used and understood to mean a mono-, di- or triphosphate, and not to include a phosphoramidate (still less a phosphoramidate with a phenol ester attached). It does not necessarily follow, however, that the term cannot be used and understood in that way in a particular context. Idenix provided two examples of this happening outside the context of the Patent. </p>

As Dr Brancale explained, creatine phosphate is a phosphoramidate. It is a phosphorylated molecule which acts as a rapidly-accessible reserve of phosphate in muscle fibres. It is used in phosphorylation of ATP after intense muscle activity, which is why some athletes take creatine-based supplements to assist their training. Counsel for Gilead put it to Dr Brancale that “creatine phosphate” was “a famous misnomer”. It is true that it is strictly a misnomer, as can be seen from the IUPAC-IUB Recommendation, but that has not stopped it from being widely used, including in four scientific papers exhibited by Dr Brancale. </p>

As usual, this requires consideration of what the skilled team would understand to be the technical purpose that lay behind the use of this term. Dr Brancale’s opinion was that the skilled team would understand it to include a masked phosphate group as well as mono-, di- and triphosphates. His reasoning was that the skilled team would understand that a masked phosphate group would function as the phosphate part of the molecule, because <span style="font-style:italic">in vivo</span> it would be metabolised into a form which underwent phosphorylation to the triphosphate and then participated in the viral RNA replication. Furthermore, he pointed out that phosphoramidates and phosphate esters were well known classes of nucleoside prodrugs.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">Both counsel relied on the fact that the specification includes extensive discussions of prodrugs, and in particular makes express reference to phosphoramidates (see [0089] and [0091] corresponding to pages 110 lines 6-8 and page 111 line 1 – page 112 line 12 of the Application referred to in paragraph 202 above). Counsel for Idenix argued that the skilled team would appreciate from this the patentees could not have been intending to exclude such prodrugs from the scope of the invention and had contemplated the use of masking groups like phosphoramidates, whereas counsel for Gilead argued that the skilled team would note that the wording of the claims did not include references to “prodrugs” as opposed to “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” and that the patentees had distinguished between “phosphates” and </p>

So far as this aspect of the issue is concerned, it seems to me that Gilead’s argument is a purely linguistic one which carries little weight. Thus in the McGuigan articles referred to above, the authors use both the proper term “phosphoramidate” and the shorthand “phosphate”. I consider that the skilled team would place greater weight on statements in the specification such as the statement in [0080] (corresponding to page 107 lines 21-30 quoted in paragraph 201 above) that “The active compound can be administered as any salt or prodrug that upon administration to the recipient is capable of providing directly or indirectly the parent compound” and the statement in [0083] (corresponding to page 108 lines 16-24 of the Application quoted in paragraph 200 above) that “The nucleosides described herein can be administered as a nucleotide prodrug”.         </p>

So far as the amendment on 17 June 2009 is concerned, counsel pointed out that I had held in <span style="font-style:italic">Actavis v Lilly</span> at [112] that, in principle, a limitation made to a claim to avoid an objection of lack of clarity could be relied on as aid to construction. I adhere to that view, but with the benefit of the arguments of the present case I would add that such an amendment is less likely to be a useful aid to construction than a limitation to avoid an objection of lack of support, which was the primary focus of my discussion in <span style="font-style:italic">Actavis v Lilly</span>. In the present case, the amendment relied on by Gilead is the excision of the wording referring to “a pharmaceutically acceptable leaving group” in order to meet the examiner’s objection that this expression lacked clarity. In my judgment this does not assist Gilead. The clarity objection concerned the term “leaving group”. The substance of the clarity objection was that this term was imprecise, so that the skilled person could not be sure whether a particular group was or was not a “leaving group”. Idenix responded simply by omitting this term from the claim. The clarity objection did not concern the term “phosphate”, and the amendment did not affect that term. Nor was there was any discussion of the meaning of that term or of whether the claim covered prodrugs in which the phosphate was masked. In these circumstances the amendment sheds no light on the meaning which the skilled team would understand the patentees to be conveying by use of the term “phosphate”. It is neither here nor there that a masked phosphate such as a phosphoramidate would probably have constituted a leaving group falling within the excised wording. I would add that, on any view, the scope of the term “phosphate” is much narrower than that of the “leaving group” wording even if the two overlap. </p>

As explained below, Gilead’s answer to Idenix’s claim for indirect infringement is that the claims are restricted to compounds which are for administration to a patient and do not extend to metabolites which have the structure of Formula (IX) as defined in the claims. Idenix dispute this interpretation. </p>

I accept that, strictly speaking, this is correct. Nevertheless, as Dr Brancale pointed out, the extensive discussion of prodrugs and cleavable moieities in the specification would mean that the skilled team would have it well in mind that a substance could be administered in the form of a prodrug and then metabolised into the active form and that there could be advantages to proceeding in that way. In those circumstances I do not accept that the skilled team would understand the claims to be limited in the manner contended for by Gilead.                                    </p>

If he is neither the person who filed the earlier application nor his successor in title then he is denied the privilege. Moreover, his position is not improved if he subsequently acquires title to the invention.  It remains the case that he was not entitled to the privilege when he filed the later application and made his claim.  Any other interpretation would introduce uncertainty and the risk of unfairness to third parties. In reaching this conclusion I derive a measure of comfort from the fact that the Board of Appeal of the EPO has adopted the same approach to the interpretation of art.87 EPC in two cases: J19/87 and T62/05.” </p>

PWC proposed that (what would become) Pharmasset Barbados would purchase technology (i.e. the rights in certain compounds) from universities and other sources throughout the world and engage (what would become) Pharmasset Georgia to undertake all research and development in the USA. PWC proposed two alternative arrangements as between Pharmasset Barbados and Pharmasset Georgia: (a) a costs sharing agreement, pursuant to which the development costs, intangibles and revenues would be shared between the two companies; and (b) a “costs plus” arrangement in which all of the development costs would be borne by Pharmasset Barbados.

The R&amp;D Agreement has five Exhibits identified as A to E. These exhibits have been located in a file bearing a postit note in Mr Roberts’ handwriting reading “Originals of final draft of Exhibits”. Exhibit A is a list of patents and patent applications which was created in part by cutting and sellotaping tables of patents and patent applications photocopied from a Stock Purchase Agreement dated 4 June 1999 or some other source.

The only evidence to support Gilead’s case that the R&amp;D Agreement was in fact executed, however, is Mr Roberts’ recollection of having seen a signed copy bearing the signatures of Mr Pritchard and Dr Schinazi on behalf of Pharmasset Barbados together with two other signatures on behalf of Pharmasset Georgia made by persons whose names Mr Roberts could not recall. Mr Roberts could not recall when this happened, save that it was some time during his tenure at Pharmasset Georgia. Neither signature was particularly distinctive, nor were Mr Pritchard and Dr Schinazi identified by name in the document which Mr Roberts recalls that he saw. Mr Roberts’ evidence was that the reason why this stuck in his mind was that it was the only time he could recall seeing an agreement signed on behalf of Pharmasset Georgia as well as Pharmasset Barbados. Every other document he could recall had only been signed on behalf of Pharmasset Barbados.  </p>

In his first witness statement, Mr Roberts suggested that the signed R&amp;D Agreement could have been misplaced on one of two occasions: either during an archiving project when Pharmasset Georgia was in Atlanta or when Pharmasset Delaware moved its principal premises from Georgia to New Jersey in mid 2005. For the archiving project, a paralegal had been hired to remove documents, take them off site to be scanned and sort out the resulting electronic copies.  In cross examination, Mr Roberts accepted that it was unlikely that one of the company’s key documents would have been misplaced by the paralegal or the scanning service provider. If the document had not been misplaced during the archiving project, a scanned copy would exist in electronic form. Even if the original had been lost during the move to New Jersey, the electronic copy should exist. </p>

The absence of Dr Schinazi is particularly notable given that he was apparently involved in day-to-day operations and was copied in on Mr Kuhl’s email dated 5 May 2000.  According to Mr Roberts, if the R&amp;D Agreement was to be signed and Dr Schinazi was involved, it would have been signed. Mr Kuhl’s evidence was to the same effect. No reason has been given for Dr Schinazi’s absence, however. The same is true of Mr Pritchard, Mr Roemer, Ms Metzger and Mr Brown. </p>

First, as I have explained, there is documentary evidence that the R&amp;D Agreement was prepared for signature in mid May 2000. Secondly, I found Mr Roberts’ evidence that he recollected seeing a signed version of the R&amp;D Agreement credible and persuasive. Thirdly, I have to consider the inherent probabilities: how likely is it that a document which was important for tax purposes and which had been specifically requested by PWC for the purposes of an audit was not signed? Furthermore, how likely is it that lightning struck twice i.e. that, having failed to get the R&amp;D Agreement executed following the board meeting on 11 December 1999, Pharmasset again failed to do so following the request from PWC?

I am concerned solely with whether Gilead have a valid claim to priority in respect of the Pharmasset PCT in the United Kingdom. That question is governed by English law, albeit that English law should be interpreted consistently with the international treaties to which it is intended to give effect, namely the EPC, PCT and Paris Convention.

Counsel for Idenix submitted that clause 3.3 was perfectly clear: Pharmasset Georgia granted Pharmasset Barbados an exclusive licence to use, develop and enjoy any Improvements (but no more). He further submitted that there was no inconsistency between clause 3.3 and 5.2 because references to “ownership” of rights by Pharmasset Barbados in the R&amp;D Agreement were references to it being an exclusive licensee. In support of the latter submission, he pointed out that the first preamble refered to Pharmasset Barbados as the “owner of all right, title and interest in … the Intellectual Property” and that clause 5.1 referred to Pharmasset Barbados’s “exclusive right, title, and interest in and to the Intellectual Property”. He submitted, however, that it was clear from Exhibit A that Pharmasset Barbados was merely an exclusive licensee in respect of the Intellectual Property.          </p>

So far as I can ascertain, only one of the agreements referred to in Exhibit A is in evidence, namely the first one. While that does appear to be an exclusive licence, I do not know whether the same is true of the other agreements. This point causes me some concern, because counsel for Idenix only advanced this interpretation of Exhibit A in Idenix’s closing submissions. Since it was not foreshadowed in Idenix’s skeleton argument, Gilead did not have the opportunity to adduce evidence addressing it. On the other hand, counsel for Gilead did not raise any objection on this ground. Nor did Gilead seek to put the other agreements before me. In the circumstances, I will assume that counsel for Idenix is correct about the effect of the agreements listed in Exhibit A. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment Gilead’s construction of the R&amp;D Agreement is the correct one, for the following reasons. First, on its face, clause 5.2 clearly and unambiguously provides that Pharmasset Barbados is to be the <span style="font-style:italic">sole owner</span> of <span style="font-style:italic">all rights</span> relating to Improvements made by Pharmasset Georgia. This is the language of ownership, not licence.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, this ties in with clause 5.1, which clearly provides that, at least as between Pharmasset Georgia and Pharmasset Barbados, Pharmasset Barbados has <span style="font-style:italic">exclusive right, title and interest in </span>the Intellectual Property. Again, this is the language of ownership, not licence. Given that the Improvements are ones that may relate to the Intellectual Property, as can be seen from clause 1.7, it makes sense for Pharmasset Barbados to be the owner of both the Intellectual Property and the Improvements, at least as between Pharmasset Barbados and Pharmasset Georgia.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, the fact that Pharmasset Barbados may be an exclusive licensee of, rather than the owner of, the Intellectual Property, does not alter this conclusion. If Pharmasset Barbados is an exclusive licensee of the Intellectual Property, that implies that the Intellectual Property is owned by third parties who developed it. But the R&amp;D Agreement envisages that the Improvements will be made by Pharmasset Georgia. Thus there will not be a third party owner of the Improvements. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">Fourthly, it is fair to say that, on this interpretation of clause 5.2, clause 3.3 appears to be redundant. Agreed principle (16) indicates that the court should avoid an interpretation which renders any of a contract’s provisions mere surplusage and must construe the contract as a whole. It is clear, however, that this principle is subject to the overriding principle of ascertaining and giving effect to the parties’ intentions. For the reasons given above, I consider that the parties’ intentions are clear from clause 5.2. </p>

It is also clear that the parties acted upon the understanding that this was the effect of the R&amp;D Agreement. Thus it was Pharmasset Barbados which obtained confirmatory assignments from inventors like Mr Clark, Pharmasset Barbados which filed patent applications such as the Pharmasset PCT and Pharmasset Barbados which granted licences. Accordingly, to the extent that the R&amp;D Agreement is ambiguous or uncertain, it should be interpreted to give effect to that intention and understanding in accordance with agreed principles (12), (13) and (14). </p>

If it had merely said “shall be the owner”, then I would agree with Idenix. But as counsel for Gilead pointed out, the words “at all times” clearly mean that Pharmasset Barbados is to be the owner of the rights from the second that the R&amp;D Agreement is assented to (or at least signed). This indicates that clause 5.2 is not merely binding Pharmasset Georgia to assign rights in the future, but rather is intended to have immediate effect. It is true that clause 5.2 does not use the language of assignment. As I have said, however, it uses the language of ownership, and it does so in a manner which indicates that it is intended to have immediate effect. That is sufficient to constitute an assignment. </p>

The reason for this is that there is no proven common general knowledge to show that the type of substituent that may be present in the claimed compounds would be irrelevant to the existence of the alleged herbicidal activity. On the contrary, the Board accepts the appellant's own submission that the structural differences between the compounds disclosed, for example, in D3, D7 and D8 on the one hand, and the claimed compounds on the other hand, are such that a person skilled in the art would have been unable to predict on the basis of his common general knowledge that the claimed compounds would have herbicidal activity …., and that it can therefore be accepted as undisputed common general knowledge that even small structural modifications may cause major differences in biological activity. Nevertheless, it is also well accepted that the properties of chemical compounds do indeed largely depend on their chemical structure, and that a skilled person would therefore normally expect that the properties of two compounds would become the more similar the more similar their chemical structures became …. In view of all the above considerations, the Board finds that reasonable predictions of relations between chemical structure and biological activity are in principle possible, but that there is a limit beyond which no such prediction can be validly made.  </p>

In the part of the application as filed describing the prior art related to the invention (page 2), it is disclosed that subgroups in the family had been defined according to the percentage of homology between members, the members of a given subgroup being from 70% to 90% homologous. Here, GDF-9 is very far from fulfilling this criteria as its sequence is stated to be significantly divergent from those of other family members (cf. page 28), the maximal percentage of homology which was observed being 34% with the bone morphogenetic protein, BMP-4. This implies that GDF-9 cannot be attributed to any subgroup and, thus, must at best be considered as the first member of a yet unidentified subgroup. This finding and that in point 7 lead to the conclusion that, contrary to GDF-1 in document (3), GDF-9 cannot be clearly and unambiguously identified as a member of the TGF-Beta superfamily by only using a ‘structural approach’. </p>

Yet, functions of members of the TGF-Beta superfamily previously isolated from ovarian follicular fluid (inhibins) or shown to inhibit ovarian cancer (MIS) are recited, and tentatively and presumptively attributed to GDF-9. Further putative roles are also suggested for GDF-9 which cover some of the effects observed with TGF-Beta (paragraphs bridging pages 8 and 9). At oral proceedings, it was argued that speculations of this kind should be permitted because of the ‘first to file approach’ of the European patent system which forced the applicant to cover any and all subject-matter connected with its invention. The board is unable to endorse this reasoning. On the contrary, in a first-to-file system the (earlier) filing date of the application, not the date at which the invention was made determines to whom of several persons having made an invention independently of each other, the right to a European patent belongs (cf. Article 60(2) EPC). Hence, it is particularly important in such a system that the application allows to conclude that the invention had been made, i.e. that a problem had indeed been solved, not merely put forward at the filing date of the application. Therefore, the issue here is rather how much weight can be given to speculations in the application in the framework of assessing inventive step, which assessment requires that facts be established before starting the relevant reasoning. In the board's judgment, enumerating any and all putative functions of a given compound is not the same as providing technical evidence as regard a specific one. </p>

The said post-published documents are indeed the first disclosures going beyond speculation. For this reason, the post-published evidence may not be considered at all. Indeed, to do otherwise would imply that the recognition of a claimed subject-matter as a solution to a particular problem could vary as time went by. Here, for example, had the issue been examined before the publication date of the earliest relevant post-published document, GDF-9 would not have been seen as a plausible solution to the problem of finding a new member of the TGF-Beta superfamily and inventive step would have had to be denied whereas, when examined thereafter, GDF-9 would have to be acknowledged as one such member. This approach would be in contradiction with the principle that inventive step, as all other criteria for patentability, must be ascertained as from the effective date of the patent. The definition of an invention as being a contribution to the art, i.e. as solving a technical problem and not merely putting forward one, requires that it is at least made plausible by the disclosure in the application that its teaching solves indeed the problem it purports to solve. Therefore, even if supplementary postpublished evidence may in the proper circumstances also be taken into consideration, it may not serve as the sole basis to establish that the application solves indeed the problem it purports to solve.” </p>

If it had not turned out to be true, the patent would have been insufficient.

I can deal with this contention quite shortly, because it is Idenix’s own evidence that claim 1 covers classes of compounds which it was not plausible would be effective. Dr Brancale expressed the opinion in paragraphs 201-202 of his first report that compounds of Formula (IX) would not have been thought likely to have antiviral activity where R<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">1</span> and R<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span> were either “straight chained, branched or cyclic alkyl” or “benzyl, wherein the phenyl group is optionally substituted with one or more substituents”.

It was known in June 2003 that certain nucleoside analogues could inhibit replication in certain viruses, since such analogues had been used successfully in HIV and HBV therapy. It was also known that NS5B was a potential target for direct acting nucleoside analogues and this was an area of active research. Accordingly, as a matter of common general knowledge, it was plausible that as yet untested nucleoside analogues <span style="font-style:italic">might</span> exhibit anti-HCV activity through their effect on NS5B. The Patent contains nothing which makes this more plausible. Still less does it contain anything to make it more plausible that the compounds claimed in claim 1  – as opposed to, for example, other compounds claimed in the Application – might exhibit such activity. In particular, the passage at [0022(10)] (corresponding to page 9 line 29 – page 10 line 24 of the Application, quoted in paragraph 181 above) which is relied on by Idenix does not do so. As I have said, it is simply part of the recitation of prior art and it does not identify the 2'-modified nuclesides which were the subject of the Eldrup, Bhat and Olsen presentations at the Savannah conference.  </p>

This does not assist Idenix, however. Prof Götte was clear that this did not make it plausible that the claimed compounds would be effective against HCV, rather this had to be tested. Furthermore, it was part of the skilled team’s common general knowledge that small structural changes could have a substantial effect on activity and/or toxicity. Still further, as I have explained, Idenix failed to establish that the skilled team would have regarded fluorine as an isostere for a hydroxyl group. On the contrary, the skilled team would have appreciated that substituting fluorine for hydroxyl could seriously affect the properties of the molecule, and in particular its biological activity.  </p>

As Prof Götte explained, because the art in 2003 was largely empirical, almost any nucleoside analogue was worth testing. Thus the question was merely restating the common general knowledge.

Nonetheless, variously formulated claims to pharmaceutical products have been granted under the EPC, all through the years. The patent system takes account of the intrinsic difficulties for a compound to be officially certified as a drug by not requiring an absolute proof that the compound is approved as a drug before it may be claimed as such. The boards of appeal have accepted that for a sufficient disclosure of a therapeutic application, it is not always necessary that results of applying the claimed composition in clinical trials, or at least to animals are reported. Yet, this does not mean that a simple verbal statement in a patent specification that compound X may be used to treat disease Y is enough to ensure sufficiency of disclosure in relation to a claim to a pharmaceutical. It is required that the patent provides some information in the form of, for example, experimental tests, to the avail that the claimed compound has a direct effect on a metabolic mechanism specifically involved in the disease, this mechanism being either known from the prior art or demonstrated in the patent per se. Showing a pharmaceutical effect in vitro may be sufficient if for the skilled person this observed effect directly and unambiguously reflects such a therapeutic application (T 241/95, OJ EPO 2001, 103, point 4.1.2 of the reasons, see also T 158/96 of 28 </p>

He pasted into his laboratory notebook the stained TLC plates for the crude reaction mixture (i) after 5½ hours, (ii) after leaving the reaction overnight and (iii) after deprotection. The last of these three appears to show four main spots which charred with the staining and two very small spots which had been visible under UV, and had been circled in pencil by Dr Griffon, but which did not char. Dr Griffon then analysed the mixture by analytical HPLC. He then separated the crude reaction mixture using silica gel chromatography into three components. The first component he presumed to be the uracil base. The second component, which appeared to be the major product, he analysed by MS, <span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">1</span>H and <span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">19</span>F NMR.

As I have said, Idenix seek to prove this by their Experiments considered below. In addition, Idenix contend that Dr Griffon’s approach to his task was an idiosyncratic one which did not represent the approach which would have been adopted by the average skilled person in June 2003. Idenix say that, throughout his work on this project, Dr Griffon’s thinking was driven by his desire to make a relatively large amount of the target compound. This led him to focus on reactions which produced reasonably high yields of the desired products, and to ignore minor products produced in low yields. Idenix further say that the skilled person would have analysed minor reaction products even if they were produced in low yields in case they turned out to be the desired product. Accordingly, Idenix contend that a skilled person who followed Strategy 6 would not merely have made the desired compound, but also would have detected, separated and characterised it. </p>

For these purposes, he wanted about 100 mg of the product. In relation to the 2'-methyl up, 2'-fluoro down project, his aim was to develop a synthetic route that would deliver enough 2'-methyl-2'-fluoro uridine for these purposes and also for conversion to 2'-methyl-2'-fluoro cytidine. Thus his goal was to synthesise at least 200 mg or so of 2'-methyl-2'-fluoro uridine. This thinking influenced his approach to the project in that he was looking for reaction steps that would produce the desired product in high yields. His practice was therefore to investigate the major reaction products and ignore the others. Furthermore, if a particular reaction did not appear to give the desired product at the first attempt, he might try it again under different conditions, but he tended not to pursue the matter beyond that. </p>

Although Dr Griffon repeatedly said that he was seeking yields of 20-30%, or even 30-50%, it is clear from his laboratory notebooks that he sometimes isolated and characterised products at lower yield, including ones at 15% and 16%. Furthermore, Dr Griffon started multiple experiments with amounts of starting material in the region of 50-100 mg, where getting 100-200 mg of product would simply have been impossible. Still further, Dr Griffon’s Progress Reports make no mention of him only seeking high yields and do not use language which suggests that only major reaction products were considered. Yet further, Dr Griffon accepted that he had pursued his research with great persistence: his attitude to his experiments had been “never give up”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">Above all, it is clear that Dr Griffon was not so poor a synthetic chemist that he did not ask himself what the minor products of reactions were. This is demonstrated in particular by the very evidence that Idenix rely upon and which formed the basis for their Experiments. As discussed above, Dr Griffon’s TLC analysis of the crude deprotected reaction mixture revealed the presence of a number of products. Dr Griffon separated three of these. It is true that he only characterised one of them, which he hoped might be the fluorinated compound, but turned out not to be; but he still thought about what the other two were.

No doubt Dr Brancale is correct that it is good science to do this, but, as Prof Boons pointed out, Dr Griffon had already spent a considerable amount of time getting to the point he had reached in mid February 2003.

Secondly, the evidence indicates that Dr Griffon explained to experts such as Prof Fleet and Dr Coe what approaches he had tried and what the results had been.

As for Dr Clemens’ approach, Prof Boons’ evidence was that the average skilled person would not have used iodine, LC/MS or reverse phase HPLC.  </p>

I do not accept this submission. The fact of the matter is that the Idenix Experiments departed from Dr Griffon’s procedure in three respects, but no explanation whatsoever was given for this. In the absence of any alternative explanation, the natural inference is that the differences were thought likely to improve Idenix’s prospects of getting the desired result. More specifically, the protocol followed by Dr Clemens suggests a focussed attempt to establish that the reaction mixture does contain a particular product rather than an investigation into whether the reaction had produced the desired product.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">Turning to the materiality of those differences, counsel for Idenix submitted that the evidence showed that the differences were not material. I accept this in relation to the first difference, but not the the other two. So far as the first difference is concerned, Prof Boons said that, in nucleoside and carbohydrate chemistry, the stain commonly used was sulphuric acid, because it indicated the presence of carbohydrate-containing compounds. Although Prof Boons said that iodine was only used in specialised cases, he accepted that iodine was less likely to reveal the presence of carbohydratecontaining compounds. So far as the second difference is concerned, Dr Brancale agreed that Dr Clemens appeared to have used LC/MS to achieve an efficient separation. As to the third difference, Dr Brancale agreed that reverse phase HPLC gave better separation and this would not have been the first approach taken by a skilled person to purifying this type of reaction mixture in June 2003. Counsel for Idenix relied on the fact that these differences did not relate to the method of synthesis itself. Given that it is Idenix’s case that Dr Griffon failed to detect and isolate a product which was in fact present in his crude reaction mixture, whereas a skilled person following the same procedure would have done so, however, these are potentially significant points.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">So far as the fourth point is concerned, counsel for Idenix argued that the skilled person would have done what Dr Griffon did in one respect, but not in another: the skilled person would have proceeded with the deprotection reaction (as Dr Griffon did), but would have separated and analysed the more minor product in the way which Dr Clemens did (which Dr Griffon did not do). If one is considering what the average skilled person would have done, rather than what Dr Griffon did or might have done, then I found Prof Boons’ evidence on the first aspect persuasive. As for the second aspect, I think that Dr Brancale substantially accepted that the skilled person in June 2003 would not have used LC/MS and reverse phase HPLC in the way in which Dr Clemens had.      </p>

Prof Boons’ evidence was this would have taken two or three days to carry out, and so Gilead had time in which to do this. There is no suggestion, however, that Gilead carried out such an experiment, but failed to put it before the court. Accordingly, there is no reason to infer that, if such an experiment had been done, it would have assisted Idenix. As it is, Idenix assumed the burden of proving the facts stated in the Notice, but in my judgment they failed to discharge it because they failed to follow the procedure followed by Dr Griffon, but deviated from it in a number of ways which (a) may have affected the result and (b) did not accord with the approach that the average skilled person would have adopted in June 2003. Furthermore, as I have explained, I am not persuaded that Dr Griffon’s approach to the reaction was one that would have been followed by the skilled person in any event.  </p>

Encouraged by the first two papers, they followed Wachtmeister’s method, but using DAST rather than Deoxo-Fluor and omitting the pyridine. It is unclear why they used DAST and not Deoxo-Fluor. It is also unclear why they omitted the pyridine, whether this would have been expected to make any difference and whether this in fact did make any real difference. Whatever the answers to these questions, it is clear from the Clark Paper and Clark II that the success of the fluorination reaction was considered worthy of specific comment in publications in two high profile journals.  </p>

The skilled person would start by carrying out a literature search and undertaking a retrosynthetic analysis. The skilled person would appreciate that, at the highest level of generality, there were two main alternative routes, the sugar route and the nucleoside route. Either way, the skilled person would conclude from his retrosynthetic analysis that the key modifications were the 2'-methyl-up and 2'-fluoro-down modifications. Dr Brancale outlined in his first report a synthetic strategy using the sugar route and a synthetic strategy using the nucleoside route. (Like him, I shall for convenience use 2' to refer to the appropriate position on the sugar in either route.) Both strategies involved conversion of a ketone at the 2' position to 2'-methyl-down-2'-hydroxy-up using methyl lithium, in the latter case following the method of A.

In this connection, counsel for Idenix understandably placed strong reliance upon Prof Boons’ vivid evidence that, if one was trying to synthesise the 2'-methyl-down-2'hydroxy-up compound, and carried out a literature search, Matsuda would be turned up “in a heartbeat”. But this evidence has to be seen in its proper context, which was the assumption that the retrosynthetic analysis was concentrated on the route identified by Dr Brancale. Prof Boons made it clear that he did not accept that assumption. If the skilled person started with a clean sheet of paper and worked backwards from the target compound, the position would be rather different, because of the multiple possible routes that could potentially be adopted. This is graphically illustrated by Dr Stewart’s evidence that he started his work by performing a literature search that took an average of two hours a day for six months (see paragraph 524 above), yet it does not appear that he turned up Matsuda.

With a few exceptions, nucleophilic substitutions at a tertiary carbon have little or no preparative value.” </p>

Accordingly, the skilled person must be taken to read the passage on page 519 in this light. Read in that light, the statement that DAST converts tertiary alcohols, as distinct from primary and secondary alcohols, in high yields under mild conditions is surprising. Prof Boons’ explanation was that the text was dealing with simple alcohols, not complex molecules. He did not disagree that DAST was often successful with primary and secondary alcohols, but said that tertiary alcohols were a different proposition. Again, I shall return to this point below. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">Prof Boons’ opinion in summary was that making any of the claimed compounds was a research project which represented a significant synthetic challenge and which was of uncertain outcome. He had conducted a literature search on the synthesis of 2'methyl-2-fluoro nucleosides, and had found that no such synthesis of such a compound, regardless of stereochemistry, had been reported by June 2003. There was literature relating to 2'-methyl sugars/nucleosides and, separately, to 2'-fluoro nucleosides, but it would not have been thought possible to combine these teachings. A major difference between what had been reported and what needed to be accomplished was the nature of the fluorine at the 2' position: synthesis of a secondary fluorine at the 2' position had been reported, but not the synthesis of a </p>

	    <p style="margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.00in">tertiary fluorine at the 2' position. The tertiary fluorine would fundamentally alter the reaction pathways compared to a nucleoside with a secondary fluorine at the 2' position.  The skilled person undertaking a retrosynthetic analysis would have been confronted with a number of possible routes, all of which would have had potential difficulties associated with them, and the skilled person would not have known in advance which, if any, might have led successfully to the product. Nucleophilic substitution of a tertiary alcohol was just one possible step on one of these routes, but it was known to be difficult with competing reactions, including elimination and migration reactions. In addition to nucleophilic substitution, it was also known that fluorination could be attempted using electrophilic addition, but again this would be difficult to control. Accordingly, if asked to carry out this project, Prof Boons would have asked for a year’s funding for a post-doctoral worker, would not have considered that success could be predicted and would have considered a successful synthesis worthy of publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Prof Boons formed this view before he knew about the numerous failed attempts by Dr Griffon. He subsequently reviewed various documents relating to these attempts, and concluded that they reflected a project of significant complexity with numerous failures, very much along the lines he had anticipated. </p>

First, he submitted that Prof Boons had raised a lot of theoretical potential difficulties which did not represent real obstacles. I do not accept this.

He argued that, as Dr Brancale’s analysis demonstrated, the Patent identifies a key precursor and a method of making it, and if the skilled person needed more information, he would quickly locate Matsuda. March would then make DAST an obvious choice of reagent to fluorinate that precursor, and the skilled person would have a reasonable expectation of success. Again, I do not accept this. For the reasons given above, I do not consider that the skilled person would get any real assistance from the Patent. Furthermore, I found Prof Boons’ evidence as to the complexities of the retrosynthetic analysis convincing. Yet further, it is supported by Dr Griffon’s work.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, counsel for Idenix criticised Prof Boons’ evidence with regard to the methylation step, because Dr Brancale had clearly set out this part of his retrosynthetic analysis with its reference to Matsuda in his first report, but Prof Boons had not taken issue with it until cross-examined about it. I do not accept this criticism. As I have indicated, Prof Boons agreed that the skilled person who decided to proceed via the 2'-hydroxy-up-2'-methyl-down compound and carried out a literature search would turn up Matsuda and therefore would be able to synthesise that compound without difficulty. His point was a different one, namely that the 2'-hydroxy-up-2'methyl-down compound is only one possible precursor and that one only arrives at that precursor working backwards in the retrosynthetic analysis if and when one has solved the problem of fluorinating the tertiary alcohol. Unless the skilled person perceives a solution to that problem, his retrosynthetic analysis will be likely to work back by other routes.

In this regard, counsel for Idenix pointed out that Prof Boons himself had said, in a book he had written with Karl Hale, <span style="font-style:italic">Organic Synthesis with Carbohydrates</span> (Sheffield Academic Press, 2000) that “the most commonly applied reagent for direct fluorination is diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (Et<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span>NDF<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">3</span>, DAST). In this reaction, an alcohol displaces a fluoride of DAST resulting in an activated intermediate, which in turn is displaced by the liberated fluoride (Scheme 3.2e).” Scheme 3.2e shows the fluorination of a secondary carbon, however, not a tertiary carbon. Moreover, Prof Boons did not dispute that DAST was a wellknown and popular reagent. Thus I do not consider that this undermines Prof Boons’ evidence.  </p>

Prof Boons’ evidence was clear that he did not think it likely that the skilled person would plan such a route, or that the skilled person would have been likely to use DAST (he said that he himself would not have used it), or that the skilled person would have had a reasonable expectation of success. As I have indicated, I consider that Prof Boons’ evidence is supported by Dr Griffon’s work. But it is also supported by the fact that Prof Fleet did not suggest the use of DAST to Dr Griffon (he proposed electrophilic substitutions) and by the fact that Dr Coe’s comments on the use of DAST made it clear that he expected it to lead to elimination and migration reactions.           </p>

The specification gives the skilled person no meaningful assistance, and so the skilled person has to rely upon his common general knowledge.

He would appreciate that making such a compound would be difficult and challenging, and there would a large number of potential routes to consider. The skilled person’s prospects of success would depend on both skill and luck. If he was skilled and lucky, he could hit upon a successful synthesis fairly quickly, as Mr Clark and his colleagues did. If he was skilled but unlucky, he could spend many months on the problem without success, as Dr Griffon did.  </p>

Counsel for Gilead pointed out, however, that Dr Brancale had agreed with Prof Götte that the scope of the compounds disclosed and claimed in the Application was substantial, and that it was not plausible that each compound claimed in the Application would be effective. Furthermore, counsel for Gilead drew particular attention to the following answer which Dr Brancale gave in cross-examination: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.31in">A. The reasoning on this patent, and on the patent in general, is that very often the essence of the patent is in the claims. So clearly the good idea is there to be protected.  If we have to look for science and want to know where the science – to start to look for science we have to start from the claims and I think within the claims to the more specific claims. That is what I said in the report.  We have to look at the more specific claims because that is where we might find the actual needle in a haystack where the meat is in these ones. Then you can probably work your way around the patent and try to understand the connection there in terms of the science that it can offer -- well, what science is there to support it in terms of references maybe or in terms of data, if there is any data.” </p>

Once 22 classes of compounds and large parts of the remaining class were discarded, leaving the subclass claimed in claim 1, the task facing the skilled team was different. The instruction “search among the compounds of claim 1 as granted to find those that have efficacy against <span style="font-style:italic">Flaviviridae</span>” was in substance a different instruction to “search among the 23 broad classes of compounds in the Application to find those that have efficacy against <span style="font-style:italic">Flaviviridae</span>”. </p>

Furthermore, the message that that subclass is one of the classes of particular interest is reinforced by claims 9-11. I do not consider that the skilled team would learn anything new about that embodiment of the invention as a result of claim 1 as granted being restricted to that subclass and claims to the other classes of compounds being abandoned.

The term “purine or pyrimidine base” is defined at page 104 of the Application by way of a non-exhaustive list encompassing a very large number of bases. In claim 4 of the Patent, Base* is limited to eight bases, namely cytosine, uracil, guanine, adenine, thymine, hypoxanthine, 5-fluorouracil and 5-fluorocytosine. In claim 5 of the Patent, the definition of Base* is still further limited to cytosine, uracil, guanine, adenine, thymine.

The skilled team would be aware from their common general knowledge that those bases were of particular interest for use in nucleoside analogues with modified sugars since they were the most readily available and best characterised bases. Although this argument comes close to argument that the selection of the natural bases would be obvious, which is not enough to avoid an allegation of added matter, I am just persuaded that it would be implicit to this skilled team reading the Application that the natural bases would be of particular interest.
