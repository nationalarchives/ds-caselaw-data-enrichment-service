	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Pemetrexed disodium is a cancer treatment which has been marketed by the Defendant (“Lilly”) or its subsidiaries under the brand name Alimta since 2004. Pemetrexed and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts were protected by European Patent No. 0 432 677 (“677”), which expired on 10 December 2010. The protection conferred by that patent has been extended by Supplementary Protection Certificates (“the SPCs”) which will expire on 10 December 2015. Lilly also owns European Patent No. 1 313 508 (“the Patent”), which will not expire until June 2021, for the use of pemetrexed disodium in combination with vitamin B12 or a pharmaceutical derivative thereof and optionally a folic protein binding agent. The Claimants (whom I will refer to as “Actavis” save when it is necessary to distinguish between them) intend to launch a generic pemetrexed product the active ingredient in which will be either pemetrexed diacid, pemetrexed dipotassium or pemetrexed ditromethamine. Actavis intend to obtain regulatory approval for their product by reference to Alimta. Actavis contend that dealings in their product will not infringe the Patent. Lilly disputes this. Actavis would like a resolution of this issue in good time for them to enter the market on expiry of the SPCs. Furthermore, Actavis wanted the issue to be determined with respect to the French, German, Italian, Spanish and United Kingdom designations of the Patent, which cover the major pharmaceutical markets in Europe, in a single trial. Accordingly, Actavis commenced these proceedings seeking declarations of non-infringement (“DNIs”) in respect of each of those designations of the Patent. Lilly has counterclaimed for threatened infringement only of the UK designation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At an early stage of these proceedings, I heard a jurisdictional challenge by Lilly in relation to the French, German, Italian and Spanish designations which I rejected for the reasons given in my judgment dated 27 November 2012, [2012] EWHC 3316 (Pat) (affirmed [2013] EWCA Civ 517, [2013] RPC 37). Since then, there have been a number of developments, of which the following are the most significant for present purposes. A detailed procedural timetable is set out in paragraphs 237-292 below.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, as explained in more detail below, Lilly brought proceedings against Actavis for threatened infringement of the German designation of the Patent before the Düsseldorf Landgericht (Regional Court). Despite the fact that this court was first seized, Actavis’ jurisdictional challenge was rejected and on 3 April 2014 the Düsseldorf Regional Court gave judgment on the merits of Lilly’s claim. In those circumstances, Actavis decided to discontinue the present proceedings so far as they relate to the German designation.</p>

Furthermore, Lilly contends that Actavis have not satisfied certain requirements, which Lilly characterises as requirements of <span style="font-style:italic">locus standi</span> and Actavis characterise as procedural requirements, under French, Italian and Spanish law.</p>

In essence, Actavis say that, even if Lilly’s procedural objections were well founded as at the date of the first and second actions, the relevant procedural requirements had been satisfied by the date of one or more of the later actions. Lilly contend that the bringing of the later actions amounts to an abuse of the process of the court. In a judgment given on 27 November 2013 ([2013] EWHC 3749 (Pat)) I dismissed an application by Lilly to strike out the fourth and fifth actions as an abuse of process, primarily on the ground that, for the reasons given in that judgment, the application was premature. </p>

I also ruled, for the reasons given in my second judgment of that date ([2014] EWHC 839 (Pat)), that there should no cross-examination of Dr Maria Rotaru of Sindan Pharma SRL (“Sindan”), who had verified a Product and Process Description (“PPD”) served by Actavis in lieu of giving disclosure with regard to relevant properties of  pemetrexed diacid, dipotassium and ditromethamine.

All of the technical experts were good witnesses who did their best to assist the court. The only points about their evidence that merit comment are as follows. First, Prof Ferry struggled to put himself in the position of the skilled team. Secondly, and more importantly, there was some divergence between what Prof Ferry said in his oral evidence and what he had stated in his written reports both for these proceedings and for the German proceedings. In the end, there was little disagreement between him and Prof Seckl. Thirdly, Prof Thurston’s area of expertise was of much less relevance to this case than that of Dr Spargo. Indeed, Prof Thurston had not come across either Berge or Stahl &amp; Wermuth (as to which, see below) before. When it came to questions about salt formation and selection, in general Prof Thurston agreed with Dr Spargo’s evidence or deferred to Dr Spargo’s experience. To the extent that he differed, I prefer Dr Spargo’s evidence.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not understand there to be any real dispute between the parties as to the incidence of the burden of proof. So far as the UK designation of the Patent is concerned, as noted above, Lilly has counterclaimed for threatened infringement by Actavis, and thus the burden of proving infringement lies on Lilly. Actavis admit that they intend, if it is lawful to do so, to market a generic pemetrexed product which will be pemetrexed diacid, dipotassium or ditromethamine. Furthermore, Actavis admit that the product is to be administered in combination with vitamin B12 and folic acid. Accordingly Lilly only needs to show either that the proposed products fall within the scope of the claims of the Patent or that the supply of the proposed products would amount to indirect infringement of the Patent. If Lilly fails to establish infringement, the burden of proving it is appropriate to make a DNI lies on Actavis. So far as the French, Italian and Spanish designations are concerned, the burden lies on Actavis to establish that the proposed products do not fall within the scope of the claims of the Patent, that the supply of the proposed products would not amount to indirect infringement and that the applicable criteria for making DNIs are satisfied, although the burden lies on Lilly to prove any positive allegations it makes. As will appear, however, I have not found it necessary to resort to the burden of proof in order to resolve any of the issues between the parties. </p>

The present invention thus generally relates to a use in the manufacture of a medicament for improving the therapeutic utility of antifolate drugs by administering to the host undergoing treatment with a methylmalonic acid lowering agent as vitamin B12. We have discovered that increased levels of methylmalonic acid is a predictor of toxic events in patients that receive an antifolate drug and that treatment for the increased methylmalonic acid, such as treatment with vitamin B12, reduces mortality and nonhematologic events, such as skin rashes and fatigue events previously associated with the antifolate drugs. Thus, the present invention generally relates to a use in the manufacture of a medicament for reducing the toxicity associated with the administration of an antifolate to a mammal by administering to said mammal an effective amount of said antifolate in combination with a methylmalonic acid lowering agent as vitamin B12.</p>

Secondly, because the making of the invention could in itself change the art.

It follows that the legal fiction involved in Swiss form claims is no longer required, and instead it is possible for the patentee to obtain a claim to “Substance X for use in method of treatment Y”. Accordingly, the Enlarged Board of Appeal has held that it is no longer appropriate to grant claims in the Swiss form: see G 02/08 <span style="font-style:italic">Abbott Respiratory/Dosage regime </span>[2010] EPOR 26. </p>

Lilly’s original position, as pleaded in its Statement of Case on Common General Knowledge and stated in its opening skeleton argument at trial, was that the Patent was directed solely, or at least primarily, to a medical oncologist.

Apart from that slight difference, the scope of claim 12 is the same as that of claim 1. Counsel for Lilly suggested that there was a difference in scope. If I understood him correctly, this was for one of two reasons. The first was that claim 12 corresponded to claim 2. This overlooks the fact that in claim 12 the folic protein binding agent is optional, however. The second is that claim 12 was limited to a single combined preparation of the two or three ingredients. This overlooks the definition in [0021] and the fact that claim 12 expressly refers to “simultaneous, separate or sequential use”, however.     </p>

Counsel for Lilly cited no authority in support of the proposition that different claims of the same scope in the same patent may be addressed to different skilled persons even for the purposes of the same issue.

Lilly has not applied to delete claim 12, however, and Actavis seek a declaration of non-infringement in respect of all claims of the Patent. (I would add that, as counsel for Lilly accepted, it is clear that Actavis’ proposed product will infringe claim 2, as well as claim 1, if those claims extend to pemetrexed diacid, dipotassium and ditromethamine, since Actavis intend to seek regulatory approval by reference to Lilly’s product which is administered together with both vitamin B12 and folic acid.)</p>

It is clear from the evidence of both Prof Ferry and Prof Seckl that a medical oncologist would be unable to make a single combined preparation for simultaneous use falling within claim 12, whether the combination consisted just of pemetrexed disodium and vitamin B12 (or derivative) or all three components, and would require the assistance of a chemist for this purpose.

I do not accept the argument advanced by counsel for Lilly that, because claim 1 is a Swiss form claim which was a legal fiction designed to circumvent Article 52(4) EPC 1973, therefore it should be interpreted as if it were a claim to a method of treatment. I accept that, as indicated by <span style="font-style:italic">Virgin v Premium</span>, the skilled person interpreting the claim is deemed to have some understanding of relevant drafting conventions, but that does not warrant interpreting claim 1 as if it was to a method of treatment. Even under the EPC 2000, the method of treatment would not be patentable. Claim 1 is directed at the manufacturer of the pemetrexed disodium medicament, and it embraces a single combined preparation for simultaneous use. Furthermore, it is clear from the evidence of Dr Spargo that in the real world the teams who deal with developing and making medicaments for use in treatment comprise a range of disciplines, and in this context would comprise both a medical oncologist and a chemist.</p>

As Prof Ferry accepted, the choice of an appropriate alternative salt would not be something that the medical oncologist could assist with. To put it another way, if the skilled team did not include a chemist and the claim extended to alternative salts, the claim would be insufficient for that reason alone.</p>

Importantly, Prof Ferry agreed with Prof Seckl that the choice of salt form was really the province of the chemist and that the oncologist would not be involved in this.

Where this is the case, it is generally possible to form different salts of the parent molecule by reacting it with a complementary base or acid. The salt will typically have different properties from the parent molecule. For example, a salt may be a solid at room temperature, whereas the parent molecule is a liquid; a salt may be soluble in water, whereas the parent molecule is not; and so on. Furthermore, different salts will typically have different properties from each other. For these reasons, salt screening is a routine, but important, part of the process of determining the most suitable form of a drug for formulation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Formation of a salt involves the transfer of one or more protons (hydrogen ions) from the acid to the base, resulting in a negatively charged species (an anion) and a positively charged species (a cation). The ion which is not derived from the parent molecule is generally referred to as the “counter-ion”. Where the parent molecule is an acid, it will form an anion when reacted with a base. The base will provide the counter-ion. Thus pemetrexed diacid reacts with sodium hydroxide to form pemetrexed disodium salt. In this case the counter-ion is sodium, which is a cation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Solid salts consist of the anions and cations regularly arranged in a fixed lattice structure. In sodium chloride, for example, each ion is surrounded by six ions of the opposite charge in a structure known as a face-centered cubic lattice. It is possible to draw a cube containing a number of ions which is a repeating element in an infinite array. In a salt consisting of a single cation and a single anion, there are equal numbers of alternating cations and anions in the lattice. Where there are different ratios of cations and anions, this gives rise to different lattice structures. The different lattice structures in turn give rise to different crystal structures. Although lattices contain infinite numbers of cations and anions, the fact that the cations and anions are present not only in fixed proportions, but also fixed relative positions, means that it is possible to speak meaningfully of the salt as being present in solid form.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is important to appreciate that, when a salt like pemetrexed disodium is dissolved in a solvent like water, the ions dissociate from each other and become surrounded by solvent molecules. The result is free cations and anions in solution. It follows that the salt does not exist as such in the solution, but rather there is a solution containing the separate constituent cations and anions. Thus a solution of sodium chloride does not contain sodium chloride, it contains sodium cations and chloride anions. It is commonplace to refer to “a salt solution” or “a salt in solution”, but this is a convenient shorthand which is not technically entirely accurate.   </p>

When deciding which counter-ions to test in a salt screening process, the chemist would routinely refer to the lists of commonly used counter-ions which had been identified in standard texts. The two most common standard texts were Berge, Bighly and Monkhouse, “Pharmaceutical Salts”, <span style="font-style:italic">J. Pharm.

Both of these texts contain tables showing the most common counter-ions found in approved pharmaceuticals.  At the time of Berge, the most common counter-ion for acidic parent molecules was sodium, followed by potassium, calcium, zinc, lithium, magnesium and aluminium. By the time of Stahl &amp; Wermuth, sodium was still the most common, now followed by calcium, potassium, magnesium, meglumine, lysine and a variety of others.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">Predictability of the viability of salts</span>. It was common ground between the experts that one could not predict in advance (a) whether one could make a particular salt form of a parent molecule, (b) what its properties would be once the salt form was made or (c) whether it would affect the efficacy of the drug. As Dr Spargo explained in his reports, the screening and selection process for salt forms is an empirical one involving trial and error. As Prof Thurston agreed, this remains the case even if one has already identified a suitable salt (such as the sodium salt) and is looking for an alternative. In particular, one cannot predict the solubility of any particular salt form in advance of making and testing it. A typical approach would be to screen a handful of potential candidates. Once these had been made (assuming this could be achieved), they would be tested for solubility, stability and so forth. Thus, while the chemist tasked with finding an alternative salt to pemetrexed disodium would have a reasonable expectation of being able to find a suitable alternative, he would not be confident that any particular salt would be suitable before making and testing it. I would add that Dr Stefánsson’s evidence is entirely consistent with this.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in">“My Lords, a patent specification is a unilateral statement by the patentee, in words of his own choosing, addressed to those likely to have a practical interest in the subject matter of his invention (i.e. ‘skilled in the art’), by which he informs them what he claims to be the essential features of the new product or process for which the letters patent grant him a monopoly. It is those novel features only that he claims to be essential that constitute the so-called ‘pith and marrow’ of the claim. A patent specification should be given a purposive construction rather than a purely literal one derived from applying to it the kind of meticulous verbal analysis in which lawyers are too often tempted by their training to indulge. The question in each case is: whether persons with practical knowledge and experience of the kind of work in which the invention was intended to be used, would understand that strict compliance with a particular descriptive word or phrase appearing in a claim was intended by the patentee to be an essential requirement of the invention so that <span style="font-style:italic">any </span>variant would fall outside the monopoly claimed, even though it could have no material effect upon the way the invention worked.</p>

Nor does it arise unless at the date of publication of the specification it would be obvious to the informed reader that this was so. Where it is not obvious, in the light of then-existing knowledge, the reader is entitled to assume that the patentee thought at the time of the specification that he had good reason for limiting his monopoly so strictly and had intended to do so, even though subsequent work by him or others in the field of the invention might show the limitation to have been unnecessary. It is to be answered in the negative only when it would be apparent to any reader skilled in the art that a particular descriptive word or phrase used in a claim cannot have been intended by a patentee, who was also skilled in the art, to exclude minor variants which, to the knowledge of both him and the readers to whom the patent was addressed, could have no material effect upon the way in which the invention worked.”</p>

The Court of Appeal rejected that construction, and in doing so considered it relevant that the specification gave no indication that any derivatives of rapamycin would in fact work (see [20]). The Court also held that the patentee could not adopt a construction which included “all variants that did not materially affect the invention” and therefore effectively by-pass <span style="font-style:italic">Improver</span> questions 1 and 2 (see [23]-[24]).

Construction is objective in the sense that it is concerned with what a reasonable person to whom the utterance was addressed would have understood the author to be using the words to mean. Notice, however, that it is not, as is sometimes said, ‘the meaning of the words the author used’, but rather what the notional addressee would have understood the author to mean by using those words. The meaning of words is a matter of convention, governed by rules, which can be found in dictionaries and grammars. What the author would have been understood to mean by using those words is not simply a matter of rules. It is highly sensitive to the context of, and background to, the particular utterance. It depends not only upon the words the author has chosen but also upon the identity of the audience he is taken to have been addressing and the knowledge and assumptions which one attributes to that audience. ...</p>

He (or, I say once and for all, she) comes to a reading of the specification with common general knowledge of the art. And he reads the specification on the assumption that its purpose is to both to describe and to demarcate an invention—a practical idea which the patentee has had for a new product or process—and not to be a textbook in mathematics or chemistry or a shopping list of chemicals or hardware. It is this insight which lies at the heart of ‘purposive construction’. … The purpose of a patent specification, as I have said, is no more nor less than to communicate the idea of an invention. An appreciation of that purpose is part of the material which one uses to ascertain the meaning. But purpose and meaning are different. … There is no presumption about the width of the claims. A patent may, for one reason or another, claim less than it teaches or enables.</p>

The question is always what the person skilled in the art would have understood the patentee to be using the language of the claim to mean. And for this purpose, the language he has chosen is usually of critical importance. The conventions of word meaning and syntax enable us to express our meanings with great accuracy and subtlety and the skilled man will ordinarily assume that the patentee has chosen his language accordingly. As a number of judges have pointed out, the specification is a unilateral document in words of the patentee's own choosing. Furthermore, the words will usually have been chosen upon skilled advice. The specification is not a document <span style="font-style:italic">inter rusticos</span> for which broad allowances must be made. On the other hand, it must be recognised that the patentee is trying to describe something which, at any rate in his opinion, is new; which has not existed before and of which there may be no generally accepted definition. There will be occasions upon which it will be obvious to the skilled man that the patentee must in some respect have departed from conventional use of language or included in his description of the invention some element which he did not mean to be essential. But one would not expect that to happen very often.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.02in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:-0.51in">35. <marker name="tab"/>One of the reasons why it will be unusual for the notional skilled man to conclude, after construing the claim purposively in the context of the specification and drawings, that the patentee must nevertheless have meant something different from what he appears to have meant, is that there are necessarily gaps in our knowledge of the background which led him to express himself in that particular way. The courts of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Germany certainly discourage, if they do not actually prohibit, use of the patent office file in aid of construction. There are good reasons: the meaning of the patent should not change according to whether or not the person skilled in the art has access to the file and in any case life is too short for the limited assistance which it can provide. It is however frequently impossible to know without access, not merely to the file but to the private thoughts of the patentee and his advisors as well, what the reason was for some apparently inexplicable limitation in the extent of the monopoly claimed. One possible explanation is that it does not represent what the patentee really meant to say. But another is that he did mean it, for reasons of his own; such as wanting to avoid arguments with the examiners over enablement or prior art and have his patent granted as soon as possible. This feature of the practical life of a patent agent reduces the scope for a conclusion that the patentee could not have meant what the words appear to be saying. It has been suggested that in the absence of any explanation for a restriction in the extent of protection claimed, it should be presumed that there was some good reason between the patentee and the patent office. I do not think that it is sensible to have presumptions about what people must be taken to have meant, but a conclusion that they have departed from conventional usage obviously needs some rational basis.”</p>

It does say what principle should not be followed, namely the old English literalism, but otherwise it says only that one should not go outside the claims. It does however say that the object is to combine a fair protection for the patentee with a reasonable degree of certainty for third parties. How is this to be achieved? The claims must be construed in a way which attempts, so far as is possible in an imperfect world, not to disappoint the reasonable expectations of either side. What principle of interpretation would give fair protection to the patentee? Surely, a principle which would give him the full extent of the monopoly which the person skilled in the art would think he was intending to claim. And what principle would provide a reasonable degree of protection for third parties? Surely again, a principle which would not give the patentee more than the full extent of the monopoly which the person skilled in the art would think that he was intending to claim. Indeed, any other principle would also be unfair to the patentee, because it would unreasonably expose the patent to claims of invalidity on grounds of anticipation or insufficiency.”</p>

The courts felt unable to escape from interpretations which ‘unsparing logic’ appeared to require and which prevented them from according the patentee the full extent of the monopoly which the person skilled in the art would reasonably have thought he was claiming. The background was the tendency to literalism which then characterised the approach of the courts to the interpretation of documents generally and the fact that patents are likely to attract the skills of lawyers seeking to exploit literalism to find loopholes in the monopoly they create.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in">“The German courts have their own guidelines for dealing with equivalents, which have some resemblance to the Protocol questions. In the ‘quintet’ of cases before the Bundesgerichtshof (see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">Kunstoffrohrteil</span> [2002] G.R.U.R. 511 and <span style="font-style:italic">Schneidemesser 1</span> [2003] E.N.P.R. 12 309) which concerned questions of whether figures or measurements in a claim allow some degree of approximation (and, if so, what degree), the court expressly said that its approach was similar to that adopted in <span style="font-style:italic">Catnic</span>. But there are differences from the Protocol questions which are lucidly explained by Dr Peter Meier-Beck (currently a judge of the 10th Senate) in a paper to be published in the International Review of Intellectual Property and Competition Law (IIC). For example, German judges do not ask whether a variant ‘works in the same way’ but whether it solves the problem underlying the invention by means which have the same technical effect. That may be a better way of putting the question because it avoids the ambiguity illustrated by <span style="font-style:italic">American Home Products Corp v Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd </span>[2001] R.P.C. 8 over whether ‘works in the same way’ involves an assumption that it works at all. On the other hand, as is illustrated by the present case, everything will depend upon what you regard as ‘the problem underlying the invention.’ It seems to me, however, that the German courts are also approaching the question of equivalents with a view to answering the same ultimate question as that which I have suggested is raised by Art.69, namely what a person skilled in the art would have thought the patentee was using the language of the claim to mean.”</p>

There is no difficulty in principle about construing general terms to include embodiments which were unknown at the time the document was written. One frequently does that in construing legislation, for example, by construing ‘carriage’ in a 19th century statute to include a motor car. In such cases it is particularly important not to be too literal. It may be clear from the language, context and background that the patentee intended to refer in general terms to, for example, every way of achieving a certain result, even though he has used language which is in some respects inappropriate in relation to a new way of achieving that result. ….”</p>

One is still at the end of the day concerned with the meaning of the language used. Hence the other extreme of the Protocol - a mere guideline - is also ruled out by Article 69 itself.

Likewise when there is a reference to the patent being a divisional application, it would be perverse to work on the basis that the skilled man would not know what that means. A real skilled man reading a patent which, as in the case of the Patent, refers to ‘the parent application’ would surely say ‘what's a parent application?’ – and he would go on to ask a man who knows, probably a patent agent.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I would add the following observations on two aspects of the question of equivalents. The first point is that it is vital not to lose sight of the fact that the claim must be construed in the same manner for the purpose of considering both infringement and validity. Article 69 and the Protocol govern the interpretation of the claim for both purposes. It follows that, once due account has been taken of equivalents in determining the scope of the claim in accordance with Article 2 of the Protocol, that claim scope is determinative of questions of both of infringement and validity. To put it bluntly, one cannot use equivalents to extend the scope of the claim just for infringement and not for validity. Still less can one use equivalents to extend protection outside the claims for the purposes of infringement, but confine attention to the claims when considering validity.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second point is that experience shows that patentees resort to arguments about equivalents in three main classes of case. The first is where, with the benefit of hindsight, it can be seen that the patent was unfortunately drafted, whether because of poor instructions from the inventor or poor drafting by his patent attorney or a combination of these things. <span style="font-style:italic">Improver</span> might perhaps be regarded as an example of this. The second class is where technology has moved on since the priority or filing date of the patent. <span style="font-style:italic">Kirin-Amgen</span> might perhaps be regarded as an example of this. The third class is where the patentee now regrets a decision taken during the course of prosecution of the patent application, whether by himself or by the examiner, and is trying to avoid the consequences of that decision. As will appear, in my view the present case is a clear example of this.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the first class of case, the law recognises that drafting patent claims is a difficult and imprecise art and that third parties should not be allowed to exploit infelicities of drafting where it is reasonably clear that those infelicities should not affect the scope of the claim. This is in order to provide “fair protection for the patent proprietor”. The law also recognises, however, the countervailing consideration that third parties are entitled to rely on the drafting of the claim when deciding on a commercial course of action. There is no tort of avoiding a patent claim. Thus it is also necessary to provide “a reasonable degree of legal certainty for third parties”. The problem, of course, is that what is fair protection to one person is legal uncertainty to another. Conversely, what is reasonable legal certainty to the second person is a denial of protection to the first. The courts have to strike a balance. In striking that balance, it is important to bear in mind that, as Lord Hoffman and Jacob LJ have pointed out, both the patentee and the third party will generally rely on skilled professional advice (and may have a remedy if the advice is incompetent).    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the second class of case, the problem is more acute. It is difficult for an applicant for a patent to anticipate how technology may evolve during the 20 year life of the patent. The law is sympathetic to the proposition that third parties should not be able to avoid infringement merely by employing new technical means to implement the invention. But on the other hand, a claim may be drafted in a manner which is inescapably tied to the old technology. There is no easy answer to this conundrum. It is not necessary to explore this question any further for the purposes of the present case, however.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the third class of case, there is no reason why the law should be sympathetic to the patentee. Not only do applicants generally rely on skilled professional advice, but also they can appeal against adverse decisions of examiners during the course of prosecution if they consider that those decisions are wrong. If the courts allow decisions as to claim scope made by the examiner during the course of prosecution which have not been successfully appealed effectively to be overturned by decisions on claim construction, the courts undermine the important role of the examiner. This is still more so if the courts allow decisions as to claim scope made by the applicant during the course of prosecution effectively to be reversed by decisions on claim construction.</p>

The requirement of reasonable certainty for third parties does, however, call for restraint in using arguments derived from the granting file in favour of the patentee. Consequently, a court will only be justified in using clarifying information from the public part of the granting file, when it holds that even after the average person skilled in the art has considered the description and the drawings, it is still open to question how the contents of the claims must be interpreted.

But it did contain objective information about and commentary on experiments which were conducted in response to official observations, and it could be of assistance in resolving some puzzling features of the specification. Although the prosecution process may sometimes superficially resemble a process of negotiation between the applicant and its advisers and the officials who scrutinise the file, it is not the sort of commercial negotiation which is still rigidly excluded in the construction of a written contract (see <span style="font-style:italic">Investors Compensation Scheme v.

In the real world, however, anyone who is interested in ascertaining the scope of a patent and who is professionally advised will obtain a copy of the prosecution file (most, if not all, of which is generally open to public inspection) and will consider it to see if it sheds light on the matter. In some cases, perhaps not very many, the prosecution history is short, simple and shows clearly why the claims are expressed in the manner in which they are to be found in the granted patent and not in some broader manner. In such a situation, there is no good reason why the court should shut its eyes to the story told by the prosecution file. On the contrary, consideration of the prosecution file may assist in ensuring that patentees do not abuse the system by accepting narrow claims during prosecution and then arguing for a broad construction of those claims for the purpose of infringement.

I do not accept this. As a matter of principle, I can see no good reason why the prosecution history should only be useful as an aid to construction in the former type of case and not in the latter. Counsel for Lilly argued that an amendment made in order to address an objection of lack of support/added matter could not shed any light on the meaning which the applicant (subsequently the patentee) intended, because there was a distinction between the disclosure of a specification and the scope of a claim. I entirely accept that there is such a distinction. I also accept that it follows that, in some cases, a claim can be broadened during prosecution without adding subject matter. I do not accept that it follows that a limitation made to a claim during prosecution in order to avoid an objection of lack of support for a broader claim cannot shed light on the patentee’s purpose in framing the claim in the manner that he did and hence upon the meaning that the skilled person would have understood the patentee to have been intending to convey by that choice of language.</p>

As counsel for Lilly made clear, Lilly reserves the right to contend that the meaning of the expression is broader still, and embraces e.g. analogues of pemetrexed; but it is not necessary for Lilly to go that far for the purposes of the present case. In brief summary, Lilly contends that it would be obvious to the skilled team that substitution of the free acid or a different salt would have no material effect on the way in which the invention works, in particular because (a) the invention is about reducing the toxicity, while maintaining the efficacy, of pemetrexed and (b) the active chemotherapeutic principle is the pemetrexed anion, and the skilled team would therefore conclude that “pemetrexed disodium” was being used in a figurative sense which was exemplary of the means of obtaining the benefits of the invention.</p>

First, looking at the invention from the oncologist’s perspective, the active anti-cancer principle in an aqueous solution of pemetrexed disodium for intravenous administration is the pemetrexed anion. From the oncologist’s perspective, the source of the pemetrexed anion is immaterial, since it will not affect the efficacy or safety of pemetrexed as a treatment for cancer. Nor will it affect the efficacy of co-administration of vitamin B12 (or a derivative) and a folic protein binding agent as a means of the reducing toxic side effects of pemetrexed. </p>

This is because Actavis will not obtain regulatory approval to market products containing these active ingredients if that is not the case. In order to obtain regulatory approval, Actavis will need to establish that its product is bioequivalent to Alimta.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As I see it, Actavis do not seriously dispute that, considering the matter from the oncologist’s perspective, it would be obvious that, <span style="font-style:italic">provided the diacid yielded a sufficient concentration of pemetrexed anions in solution and did not introduce side effects which were not obtained with the disodium salt or other complications</span>, then using the diacid would have no material effect on the invention.

Accordingly, the oncologist would ask the chemist. It is clear from the evidence of Dr Spargo and Prof Thurston that the chemist’s answer would be, in short, “I do not know until I have tested it”. It appears that the chemist’s uncertainty would be greatest in relation to the diacid, less in relation to the ditromethamine salt and lowest in relation to the dipotassium salt; but even in relation to the dipotassium salt the chemist would not be confident of success before testing it (in particular because of the potential toxicity of potassium given the quantities of pemetrexed required). This is far from the level of confidence required for an affirmative answer to <span style="font-style:italic">Improver</span> question 2: see <span style="font-style:italic">Merck &amp; Co Inc v Generics (UK) Ltd</span> [2003] 2842 (Pat), [2004] RPC 31 at [78] (Laddie J).</p>

It turns out, however, that pemetrexed calcium is not sufficiently soluble.

I do not accept that this is the correct way in which to approach <span style="font-style:italic">Improver</span> question 2. The correct approach is to ask whether it is obvious from the skilled team’s common general knowledge. As counsel for Actavis submitted, assuming that the skilled team knows that the variant has received regulatory approval is really an attempt to short circuit the analysis by providing the skilled team with the answer to the question in advance. The skilled team must be able to ask and answer question 2 before investing what may be four years’ effort and considerable expense to obtain regulatory approval even on the basis of bioequivalence. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Lilly’s third and most important answer is that Actavis’ argument involves mischaracterising the invention. The invention, Lilly argues, is all about reducing the toxic side effects of pemetrexed by co-administration of vitamin B12 (or a derivative) and a folic protein binding agent. It is not about providing a convenient and safe source of pemetrexed anions in solution. The source of the pemetrexed anions makes no difference at all to the reduction in toxic side effects achieved by such co-administration. The problem is solved by means which have precisely the same technical effect as pemetrexed disodium.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This is a powerful argument. In the end, however, and not without considerable hesitation, I do not feel able to accept it. My reasons are similar to those I have given in relation to the question of the identity of the addressee. Although it is true to say that the underlying invention is an improved method of treatment, that invention was not and is not patentable as such. The only patentable invention is the use of the drug for the manufacture of a medicament for use in the combination therapy (claim 1) or a product containing the drug in combination with the other ingredient(s) for use in therapy (claim 12), depending on whether one is looking at it from the perspective of EPC 1973 or EPC 2000. Either way, the patentable invention involves the making of the medicament or the product. If the proposed source of pemetrexed anions is not sufficiently soluble or is not pharmaceutically acceptable for some other reason, then as a practical matter the skilled team cannot make that medicament or product and therefore cannot obtain the benefit of the patented invention. To that extent, therefore, it would not be obvious to the skilled team that pemetrexed diacid would have no material effect on the way the invention works. The same goes for pemetrexed dipotassium and ditromethamine.</p>

Pemetrexed disodium is the name of a specific, known chemical compound with a specific atomic formula and molecular structure. There is no sense in which it can be regarded as a figurative expression. It is not as if the expression used was “pemetrexed”, which might well cover any suitable form of pemetrexed. Pemetrexed diacid, dipotassium and ditromethamine are all different chemical compounds with different atomic formulae and molecular structures. As a matter of language, therefore, this integer of the claims means only one thing and does not mean other, different things. </p>

Further, the only data contained in the specification relate to pemetrexed disodium.</p>

Furthermore, in the latter case the claims explicitly contemplate the use of “a physiological salt or ester thereof”. Actavis contend that the skilled team would not only notice this difference in language, but also would regard it as explicable by reference to the fact that no other form of pemetrexed was known to be efficacious and safe whereas other forms of vitamin B12 and folic acid were known.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Fourthly, Actavis contend that this reading is supported by the expert evidence. Prof Seckl’s unchallenged evidence was that the oncologist member of the skilled team, when faced with the Patent, would have assumed that the chemist involved had specifically chosen pemetrexed disodium for a reason, would not have made any assumptions one way or another regarding the adequacy of any other salt form of pemetrexed, and would have deferred to a chemist with expertise in such matters. Importantly, Prof Ferry entirely agreed with this in cross-examination. It is clear from the evidence of Dr Spargo and Prof Thurston that the chemist member of the team would not assume that any other form of pemetrexed was equivalent to pemetrexed disodium, but would appreciate that any alternative form would have to be tested for solubility and pharmaceutical acceptability. Accordingly, as Prof Thurston agreed, it would be reasonable for the chemist to assume that the patentee meant specifically that chemical form because it was the only form which had been made and tested.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Fifthly, Actavis contend that the skilled team would appreciate that there were a number of other reasons why the patentee might have wished to limit the claims to pemetrexed disodium even if the use of other forms of pemetrexed had no material effect on the way in which the invention worked. These include the following: so as precisely to cover the commercial embodiment, Alimta; because broader claims would lack support or be unclear; because the patentee opted for narrow claims in order to get the Patent granted rapidly; or  for some other reason known only to the patentee.</p>

In essence, Lilly’s construction amounts to “anything that works”. As noted above, Lilly reserves the right to argue that the claims embrace pemetrexed analogues. But why stop there? If “pemetrexed disodium” is being used figuratively, why does the claim not extend to any antifolate whose toxicity is reduced by co-administration with vitamin B12 and folic acid?   </p>

It is very clear from this why the claims are limited to pemetrexed disodium. In short, Lilly attempted to obtain broader claims, first to an antifolate and secondly to pemetrexed, but the examiner objected to those claims. In particular, the examiner objected that the amendment to introduce claims to pemetrexed lacked support in the description and therefore constituted added matter. The description contained textual support (but not supporting data) for broad claims to an antifolate, but it did not even contain textual support for claims to pemetrexed. Rather than argue the point, Lilly opted for narrow claims to pemetrexed disodium in order to obtain rapid grant of a patent. It also reserved the right to file a divisional application, but apparently did not do so. </p>

In my judgment this is Actavis’ construction. Lilly deliberately limited the claims of the Patent to pemetrexed disodium. There was nothing to prevent Lilly seeking broader claims if it thought it was entitled to them. There is nothing in the specification or the common general knowledge of the skilled team to suggest to the skilled team that Lilly intended to use the expression “pemetrexed disodium” in anything other than its conventional sense or that it made some mistake in using that expression, and the prosecution history shows that the opposite is the case. Confining Lilly to the scope of claim that it chose with the benefit of skilled professional advice provides Lilly with fair protection, and does not expose Lilly to the risk of the Patent being invalid on the grounds of added matter and/or insufficiency. Construing the claim as extending to (at least) any form of pemetrexed which is pharmaceutically acceptable and sufficiently soluble would not provide a reasonable degree of certainty for third parties. Any other conclusion would fail to give effect to the Protocol and would be tantamount to treating the claims as a mere guideline. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In its judgment dated 3 April 2014 the Düsseldorf Regional Court (Judges Dr Voss, Dr Reimnitz and Dr Thom) held that the use of pemetrexed dispotassium would infringe claim 1 of the German designation of the Patent. In essence, it held that there was no literal infringement, but that there was infringement on the basis of the doctrine of equivalents. It went on to hold that there was a threat by Actavis Group PTC ehf to infringe the Patent by dealings in pemetrexed dispotassium, but not by Actavis Deutschland GmbH &amp; Co KG or Mr Petró. By contrast, it held that there was no threat by the defendants in relation to pemetrexed diacid or ditromethamine. Accordingly, it did not consider whether the diacid or ditromethamine fell within claim 1.</p>

Furthermore, its judgment is detailed, careful and clearly reasoned. Nevertheless, I am unable to agree with its conclusion with regard to pemetrexed dipotassium. I will not lengthen this judgment still further by giving an exhaustive explanation of my reasons for this disagreement. Most of them will be apparent from a comparison of my reasoning with that of the Düsseldorf Regional Court. I would, however, draw attention to the following points.</p>

In particular, although the Düsseldorf Regional Court had written evidence from Prof Ferry before it, it did not have the advantage which I had of hearing Prof Ferry being cross-examined on his written evidence. As I have observed above, there was some divergence between Prof Ferry’s oral evidence and his written evidence. Likewise, the Düsseldorf Regional Court did not have the benefit of the hearing the chemists cross-examined on their reports.   </p>

In particular, Lilly relied on the fact that 677 disclosed that pemetrexed could be used in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, including specifically potassium, as supporting its case. Furthermore, the Düsseldorf Regional Court accepted this argument (see page 42 of the translation). By contrast, Lilly placed no reliance upon 677 before me, no doubt anticipating the riposte that the skilled team would notice the contrast between 677 and the Patent and draw the conclusion that limitation of the latter to pemetrexed disodium was intentional.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Fourthly, in finding infringement by reason of equivalence alone, I respectfully consider that the Düsseldorf Regional Court has not given proper effect to the Protocol, but rather has treated the claims as a mere guideline. As the evidence of the German law experts (Uwe Scharen, a former judge of the Düsseldorf Regional Court, Court of Appeal and Bundesgerichsthof (Federal Supreme Court) and Professor Dr Klaus Melullis of Karlruhe Institute of Techology) filed by the parties before me confirms, German law addresses the question of equivalence by asking the three questions identified in the quintet of cases decided by the Federal Supreme Court on 14 March 2002 to which Lord Hoffmann referred in <span style="font-style:italic">Kirin-Amgen</span> at [75]. These questions are similar to the <span style="font-style:italic">Improver </span>questions, although, as Lord Hoffmann noted, there is a difference in the way in which the German courts formulate the second question. In particular, as the Federal Supreme Court (Judges Prof Dr Meier-Beck, Keukenschrijver, Mühlens, Dr Grabinski and Schuster) recently confirmed in its judgment dated 10 May 2011 in Case X ZR 16/09 <span style="font-style:italic">Occlusion Device</span> at [36], German law does have the equivalent of <span style="font-style:italic">Improver</span> question 3 (as the late Laddie J had concluded in <span style="font-style:italic">Celltech R &amp; S Ltd v MedImmune Inc</span> [2004] EWHC 1124 (Pat) at [59]-[63]). In the present case, it seems to me that the Düsseldorf Regional Court’s answer to question 3 simply reiterates its reasoning in answering question 2.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is worth elaborating on two points. The first is the penultimate point made by the experts under the heading “Doctrine of equivalents”. Where the claim is narrowly worded to cover specific means (“<span style="font-style:italic">moyens particuliers</span>”) rather than general means (“<span style="font-style:italic">moyens généreaux</span>”<span style="font-style:italic">)</span>, then the court must consider the function of that means and consider whether it is a novel function. If the function of the means is not novel then the claim monopoly is limited to the particular claimed structure. An example of this principle being applied is in the judgment of the Cour de Cassation (Supreme Court) in Appeal S 09-15668 <span style="font-style:italic">Institut Pasteur v Chiron Healthcare</span> of 23 November 2010. In that case the means in question was a specific means of DNA/RNA hybridization to detect HIV with a probe composed of a particular DNA fragment. The function of the specific means was known at the priority date and so the claim integer could not be extended to cover any other method of hybridization that achieved the same function. Another example of this principle being applied is in the judgment of the Tribunal de Grande Instance (High Court) of Paris in Case 09/01863 <span style="font-style:italic">Mundipharma Laboratories GmbH v Sandoz SAS</span> of 2 July 2010. In that case the integer that was said to be infringed by equivalence was the use of cellulose ether (the alleged equivalent being xanthan gum). The function of the cellulose ether was not novel at the priority date and as such the scope of the claim could not be extended to cover any means which achieved that function.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Conversely, if the function of the particular claimed means is novel, then even though the claim is explicitly drafted in a narrow sense, the claim will be treated as covering a means which performs the same function and which achieves a similar result. Thus in the judgment of the Supreme Court in Appeal No. 06-17915 <span style="font-style:italic">B2M Industries v Acome </span>of 20 November 2007 the function of the particular integer that was said to be infringed pursuant to an equivalent was held to be novel, and therefore because the means that was said to be equivalent to that integer performed the same function and produced the result sought by the invention the means was equivalent to that integer.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, the prosecution history is of particular relevance when the scope of the claims have been narrowed during the prosecution process, in particular where that narrowing was necessary to obtain the grant of the patent at issue. Both experts cited the judgment of the Cour d’Appel (Court of Appeal) of Paris in Case No. 08/00882 <span style="font-style:italic">Hewlett Packard GmbH v Agilent Technologies Deutschland GmbH</span> of 27 January 2010 as illustrating this principle.

It is common ground that there have been no Supreme Court decisions addressing issues of infringement by equivalence since Article 52 CIP came into force. Although there have been Supreme Court judgments addressing equivalence since 2010, these are all cases that were applying the law in force before the CIP, namely Royal Decree No. 1127 dated 29 June 1939 (the “LI”), and its implementing regulation Royal Decree No. 244 of 5 February 1940 (“the RI”), as amended by the Decree of the President of the Republic No. 338 dated 22 June 1979 (“the DPR”).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is a debate between the experts as to whether or not the enactment of Article 52 CIP changed the previous law. Prof Franzosi considers that it did, whereas Prof Guglielmetti considers that it did not. Both experts refer to the fact that the DPR was drafted by a commission chaired by Professor Giorgio Floridia following the ratification of the EPC 1973 by Italy in order to adapt Italian law to the Convention. The Floridia Commission considered that it was not necessary to amend the final part of the original wording of Article 5 of the RI in order to make it consistent with Article 69 EPC. On the other hand, Prof Franzosi states that Article 52 CIP was inserted as a result of his personal insistence with the commission which drafted the CIP because of the reluctance of Italian legal culture to accept the controlling role of the claims.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment it cannot be assumed that the enactment by the Italian legislature of a new statutory provision which more clearly reflects Article 69 and the Protocol than the old provision will have no effect on the law. On the contrary, it seems to me to be calculated to require Italian courts to focus more closely on what is required by Article 69 and the Protocol. This is particularly true with the recent addition of section 3<span style="font-style:italic">bis</span> to Article 52 CIP. As Prof Franzosi points out, this requires the court to consider equivalence on an element by element basis, dividing the claim into integers and considering whether or not each integer is present either literally or by equivalence. As is stated in an article commenting on the 2010 reform cited by Prof Guglielmetti in paragraph 38 of his first report, “The centrality of the claims is confirmed by these regulations”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Nevertheless, Prof Franzosi expresses the opinion that this jurisprudence does not correctly reflect the current statutory provisions because it pays insufficient regard to the role of the claims. In particular, it is his view that, if it is evident that there has been a conscious limitation to the claim, then the doctrine of equivalence is excluded. For the reasons given above, I consider that in future the Italian courts will be bound by Article 52 CIP to pay closer attention to the wording of the claims. Furthermore, Prof Franzosi was able to point to some recent lower court decisions which support this point of view. An example is Case 4114/2011 <span style="font-style:italic">EG SpA v AstraZeneca AB</span> (Ordinary Court of Turin, 1 April 2011), where the court held that EG’s product did not infringe a claim requiring a minimum of 99.8% enantiomeric excess of magnesium esomeprazole because this was clear limitation in the claim and the accused product did not have the required purity level (consistently with the decision of Kitchin J in <span style="font-style:italic">Ranbaxy v AstraZeneca</span>).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">So far as the prosecution history is concerned, it is common ground between the experts that (i) there is no doctrine of prosecution history estoppel and (ii) there is no clear rule as to the relevance, if any, of the prosecution history as an aid to interpretation of the claims. The Supreme Court has not opined on the latter point, and decisions of lower courts can be found going both ways. Prof Guglielmetti considers that the weight of authority points away from reliance on the prosecution history, whereas Prof Franzosi considers that there is a recent trend towards reliance upon it. Again, <span style="font-style:italic">EG v AstraZeneca</span> is an example of this.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment the Supreme Court can be expected, when called upon to consider this question, to adopt a similar position to that adopted by other European appellate courts on this issue. In short, I consider that the Supreme Court will not encourage reference to the prosecution history, but nevertheless will hold that, in an appropriate case, the prosecution history can be relied upon as an aid to construction of the claims, particularly where it is clear the applicant has intentionally limited the scope of the claims during the course of prosecution. This would accord with the argument advanced by Prof Guglielmetti in an article which he acknowledges in paragraph 29 of his first report.</p>

First, because on its face the Patent clearly demonstrated a conscious intention of the patentee to limit the claims to pemetrexed disodium.

In that case the Supreme Court considered a number of tests that had previously been applied, but did not settle on a definitive test. The experts are agreed that in a pharmaceutical case a test that is particularly likely to be applied is an adapted <span style="font-style:italic">Improver</span> test which is sometimes referred to as the “obviousness” test.

An “own act” can include an amendment to a claim, but it is not limited to amendments. It is agreed that this doctrine is applied restrictively, but there is a slight disagreement as to how restrictively. I shall adopt the summary given by the Spanish national group in its response to AIPPI Question 229 regarding the use of prosecution history in post-grant patent proceedings which is quoted by Prof Bercovitz in paragraph 72 of his second report:</p>

In my judgment the evidence shows that the doctrine is most likely to be applied in such a situation, but does not establish that it is limited to that situation. Thus the Spanish national group’s response to AIPPI Question 229 was that it did not matter why the amendments or arguments were made. Counsel for Lilly relied in particular on a passage from the decision of the Court of Appeal of Madrid in Judgment No. 292/2008 <span style="font-style:italic">Ros Roca Group SL v Sistemas y Vehícuols de Alta Technología SA </span>of 1 December 2009, where reference was made to amendments to overcome prior art objections, as in the case under consideration.

Even if the answer to question 2 is yes, I consider that the answer to question 3 is yes for the reasons I have given when answering the equivalent question under UK law. In so far as those reasons involve considering the prosecution history, I consider that the requirements for application of the “own acts” doctrine are met.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Actavis deny indirect infringement. Actavis point out that the issue only arises if the expression “pemetrexed disodium” in claim 1 of the Patent means pemetrexed disodium and not any form of pemetrexed that is pharmaceutically acceptable and sufficiently soluble. Accordingly, Actavis contend that they cannot be liable for indirect infringement because at no point is pemetrexed disodium used in the manufacture of a medicament by anyone. The fact that, when Actavis supply their product to third parties who reconstitute (or in the case of diacid, dilute) the Products with saline, there will be sodium ions and pemetrexed ions floating around, does not mean that those third parties are implementing the invention; they have not used pemetrexed disodium in the manufacture of a medicament as required under claim 1. It is no answer to this to say that pemetrexed ions on their own constitute an essential element of the invention, as this is just another way of saying that the claim does not require pemetrexed disodium, but merely requires any form of pemetrexed which makes pemetrexed ions available. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In seeking to characterise these rules, it seems to me that it is useful to start by considering the purpose of a claim for a DNI. Normally, courts determine claims by claimants seeking to establish that defendants are liable and that a particular remedy should be granted. A claim for a DNI is an unusual kind of proceeding, because the claimant seeks a declaration by the court that there is no liability. Other than that declaration, the claimant seeks no relief. Why should the claimant want to obtain a DNI? Leaving aside considerations of forum shopping, the usual reason why the claimant wants a DNI is to provide legal certainty. In particular, he wants to know whether it is safe to commercialise a particular product or process before he exposes himself to the possibility of a claim for infringement, and hence the possibility of being subject to an injunction and/or of paying substantial damages (or accounting for his profits). If the patentee were to acknowledge that his product or process did not infringe, the claimant would not need to bring a claim for a DNI, because the acknowledgement would provide him with sufficient legal certainty. If the patentee were to sue him and do so quickly, the claimant would not need to bring a claim for a DNI either, because he could obtain legal certainty by defeating the patentee’s claim. The claimant only needs to seek a DNI where the patentee declines either to give him an acknowledgement of non-infringement or to sue for infringement within a commercially acceptable time frame. This is particularly important where the patentee has a weak case and would prefer to rely on the uncertainty created by the absence of a decision than to obtain a determination by the court.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Against this background, it can be seen the rules identified in paragraph 213 above serve two main purposes. The first kind of rule serves to ensure that the claimant for a DNI has a sufficient justification for seeking an adjudication by the court. Justification, that is, not in terms of the substantive merits of his case, but in terms of needing the court to make a declaration rather than requiring the claimant to wait until the patentee decides whether or not to sue. Suppose, for example, that the claimant has devised a clearly non-infringing product, but has no intention to commercialise that product. In those circumstances, he has no need of the court’s assistance despite having an unanswerable case on the merits. The question whether he would infringe the patent is an academic question.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second kind of rule serves two objectives. First, it aims to avoid unnecessary litigation. If the patentee will give an acknowledgement of non-infringement, the prospective claimant for a DNI need not bring his claim. Counsel for Lilly submitted that the objective went further, and included giving the patentee the opportunity to bring a claim. Whatever may have been the thinking of the national legislatures in question, I do not consider that this is the true rationale. A patentee who wishes to sue will do so. He does not require a <span style="font-style:italic">locus poenitentiae</span> for that purpose. Again, therefore, the second kind of rule serves to ensure that the claimant for a DNI has a sufficient justification for seeking an adjudication by the court.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, the second kind of rule seeks to ensure that the dispute is sufficiently well defined for the court to adjudicate upon it. In the normal infringement scenario, one can determine the issue of infringement by reference to an actual product or process. By contrast, the claimant for a DNI frequently wants to obtain a DNI before he has a commercial product or process ready, because he wants to know whether it is safe to make the necessary investment. It follows that it may well be necessary to determine the issue of infringement by reference to what the claimant is proposing to do. For this purpose, it is necessary for the claimant to particularise what he is going to do.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus I would characterise the relevant rules in the following manner. They are rules which are designed to ensure that the machinery of the court is only invoked to determine disputes which genuinely require adjudication by the court and to ensure that the dispute is sufficiently well defined for the court to adjudicate upon it. They are not rules concerned with the substantive rights and obligations of the parties with regard to infringement of the patent in suit. In particular, the rules are not rules about who has title to sue in the sense of having a substantive right to bring a claim (as for example, is the requirement under English law that the claimant in a patent infringement claim be either the proprietor of, or an exclusive licensee under, the patent). Thus the evidence shows that decisions made under these rules that claims for DNIs are inadmissible do not give rise to any <span style="font-style:italic">res judicata</span> with regard to the substantive rights and obligations of the parties. Furthermore, the court can adjudicate upon the substantive rights and obligations of the parties with regard to the infringement of the patent in suit without these rules being engaged at all, namely if the patentee brings a claim for infringement. </p>

In that case Mr Wall was severely injured while riding a motorcycle in France as a result of a collision with a motor car driven by a driver insured by MPA. MPA admitted that the driver was negligent, that it was liable and that Mr Wall could bring proceedings against it in England. The only remaining issue was as to quantum. Mr Wall wanted to adduce evidence from a number of independent experts in different disciplines in the usual English way. MPA contended that expert evidence should be placed before the court in the same manner in which it would be in France, namely by a single agreed or court-appointed expert or pair of experts. The trial of a preliminary issue was ordered as to whether the issue of what expert evidence the court should order fell to be determined by English law or French law. Tugendhat J held that it was English law by virtue of Article 1(3) of the Rome II Regulation. The Court of Appeal dismissed MPA’s appeal. On the appeal, however, a further issue emerged, which was whether the applicable law under Article 15 included guidelines for the assessment of damages. The Court of Appeal held that it did. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On the first point, the Court of Appeal held that the expression “procedure and evidence” was to be given its normal meaning and rejected MPA’s submission that it should be narrowly construed: see Longmore LJ at [11]-[12], Jackson LJ at [40]-[41] and Christopher Clarke LJ at [47].  In this context, Longmore LJ specifically rejected MPA’s argument that “the aim of Rome II was to promote certainty and uniformity and discourage forum-shopping and that it therefore followed that an English court applying foreign law should ensure (or at any rate do its best to ensure) uniformity of outcome, irrespective of which country tries the … claim”. He went on to conclude that, given the exclusion of “evidence and procedure”, it was inevitable that trial of the same dispute in different countries might result in different outcomes (see [15]). </p>

There was a debate, however, as to whether the French law on the quantum of damages included judicial guidelines as to the assessment of damages, which a French court would take account of, but which were “soft law” rather than “hard law”. The Court of Appeal concluded that such guidelines were law, and so fell within the scope of the law applicable to non-contractual obligations. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As is common ground, the purpose of Article 15 of the Regulation is to determine the scope of the law applicable to the non-contractual obligation and thus to harmonise the differing national approaches to that question. It can be seen that some of the matters specified in the various paragraphs are matters that some national laws (such as English law) would have regarded as subject to the <span style="font-style:italic">lex fori</span>. As noted above, Lilly relies in particular on Article 15(c), and in particular the reference to “the remedy claimed”. This prompted Actavis to rely upon the other language versions of Article 15(c). I was provided in Annex H to Actavis’ Closing Submissions with a comparison table of the other language versions and literal English translations of the other language versions obtained by the parties. Many of the English translations are agreed, while a number are not. The disagreements do not affect the broad picture, however. The majority of the other language versions do not use a term equivalent to “remedy”. Instead, they use a term equivalent to “compensation”, “indemnity” or “reparation”. By way of example, I would instance the French “<span style="font-style:italic">la réparation demandée</span>” and the Italian “<span style="font-style:italic">l’indennizzo chiesto</span>”. Actavis contend that this shows that Article 15(c) is concerned with damage and compensation for damage. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Nevertheless, it seems to me that Actavis’ approach to Article 15(c) is unduly narrow. It must be interpreted in a manner which gives effect to the objectives of the Regulation. While the Regulation does not aim for uniformity of outcomes, it does aim to ensure a consistent application of the law applicable to the non-contractual obligation. I consider that it is well arguable that, as suggested by a minority of language versions, Article 15(c) extends beyond the assessment of damages and embraces the financial remedy claimed. On this basis, it would extend to the question of whether a proprietary remedy, such as tracing, is available. Coming closer to the present context, this interpretation of Article 15(c) would mean that the question of whether a successful patentee in an infringement claim can elect between an award of damages and an account of profits is governed by the <span style="font-style:italic">lex causae</span> rather than the <span style="font-style:italic">lex fori</span> (subject to the impact of Article 13 of the European Parliament and Council Directive 2004/48/EC of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual property rights).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On the other hand, it also seems to me that Lilly’s approach to Article 15(c) is too broad. “Remedy” in Article 15(c) cannot extend to any remedy. The question whether an injunction may be granted to restrain future infringement is clearly governed by the <span style="font-style:italic">lex causae</span>, as Sir Andrew Morritt C held in <span style="font-style:italic">OJSC TNK-BP v Lazurenko</span> [2012] EWHC 2781 (Ch) at [20], but that is because this is provided for by Article 15(d). In that regard, I consider that it is telling that Article 15(d) contains the qualification “within the limits of powers conferred on the court by its procedural law”. In my judgment this makes it clear that there is a distinction between the question of principle as to whether an injunction should be granted, which will be a matter for the <span style="font-style:italic">lex causae</span>, and the procedural conditions which must be observed, which will be a matter for the <span style="font-style:italic">lex fori</span>.  Thus the rule under English law that three clear days’ notice must be given of an application for an interim injunction, save where circumstances of urgency justify giving less notice or where it is justified to take the defendant by surprise by giving no notice at all, is a procedural condition which is a matter for the <span style="font-style:italic">lex fori</span>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have considerable doubts as to whether a DNI is a remedy in this sense at all. Under English law, it is little more than a formal record of the court’s decision on the substantive issue. I can conceive that, under some systems of law, one would not need or obtain even that much, but merely a judgment of the court. Even if a DNI is a remedy, and even if it is a remedy within Article 15(c), it seems to me that Article 15(c) should be interpreted as only having the effect that the question of principle as to whether a DNI is available at all is a matter for the law applicable to the non-contractual obligation. It does not follow that rules of the kind presently under consideration, which are essentially concerned with whether it is necessary or possible for the court to consider the substantive issue at all, fall within Article 15(c).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In this regard, it is worth emphasising that I have already decided that dealings by Actavis in their proposed products will not infringe the French, Italian and Spanish designations of the Patent. Thus I have already decided the substantive issue between the parties on the merits. Even on that basis, if a DNI was simply not available at all under, say, Spanish law, then there would be some logic in this Court declining to make a declaration that no Spanish court could make. It does not follow that it makes sense for this Court to try to apply the rules which a Spanish court would apply in order to decide whether it was necessary and possible to adjudicate upon the dispute <span style="font-style:italic">before</span> it made a determination on the merits.</p>

There is obviously room for a divergence of view as to whether rules as to limitation and prescription are substantive or procedural (as used to be the case under English law before the Foreign Limitation Periods Act 1984). Article 15(h) makes it clear that they are to be governed by the <span style="font-style:italic">lex causae</span>.

There have been many claims for negative declarations in relation to contractual liability under the Rome Convention and the Rome I Regulation.

This is particularly graphically illustrated by the debates with regard to the requirements under French and Spanish law. By way of example only, I would instance the issues as to whether it is possible to rely upon letters requesting the patentee to take a position sent during the pendency of the proceedings. One also gets entangled in questions of what evidence would be acceptable to the foreign court.

Lilly admits in paragraph 25 of its Combined Defence that it is possible for the party seeking the declaration to avoid this procedure “if the patentee has expressed his position irrevocably and unambiguously in a patent infringement action brought against the party seeking the declaration”.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Prof Galloux considers, however, that it is not necessary for the patentee to have expressed its position irrevocably or in a patent infringement action provided that the patentee has unambiguously expressed its position on the opposability of its French patent to the other party’s product. In support of his opinion Prof Galloux cited the decision of the Court of Appeal of Bordeaux in <span style="font-style:italic">Hembert v Composites Aquitaine SA </span>of 9 April 2002, in which a claim by Composites Aquitaine under Article L 615-9 IPC was held admissible where the patentee had sent letters alleging infringement to another defendant, to the Ministry of Industry and to the Maritime Prefect of Toulon, and the allegation of infringement had been widely disseminated amongst potential customers. (Prof Galloux also cited the decision of Court of First Instance of Paris in <span style="font-style:italic">SEB SA v Euromenage SARL</span> of 22 April 2003, but in that case Compania Menaje Domestico SL (“CMD”) had sent a request for an acknowledgement of non-infringement in respect of a modified product a few days after Euromenage had applied to join CMD as a third party to infringement proceedings brought by SEB against Euromenage in respect of a product supplied by CMD, and SEB subsequently alleged that the modified product also infringed.)   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The third issue is whether it is also possible for the party seeking a DNI to avoid the requirement to show that it has made serious and effective preparations for industrial exploitation if the patentee has unambiguously expressed its position on the opposability of its French patent to the other party’s product. Prof Galloux considers that this is possible, but as I understand it, on the basis that a DNI could still be obtained under Article 31 FCPC. I have already concluded that it is not possible to obtain a declaration under Article 31 FCPC if it is not available under Article L 615-9. Furthermore, I note that in the <span style="font-style:italic">Hembert</span> case the Court of Appeal went on to consider whether Composites Aquitaine had made serious and effective preparations, holding that the Court of First Instance had been entitled to conclude that it had. One can understand why the Court of Appeal was willing to dispense with strict compliance with the requirement for a “taking position” letter to be sent when the patentee had unambiguously alleged infringement in letters to other parties, but nevertheless required Composites Aquitaine to show that it had a sufficient interest in obtaining a DNI.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The fourth issue is whether it is possible for the party seeking a DNI to rely upon a taking position letter, and the failure of the patentee to give an acknowledgement of non-infringement within the following three months, sent during the pendency of the proceedings. Prof Galloux considers that this is possible in accordance with Articles 122 and 126 FCPC, and his opinion is supported by the decisions of the Court of First Instance of Paris in <span style="font-style:italic">Biberian v Commissariat a l’Energie Atomique </span>of 22 November 1996 and <span style="font-style:italic">Justamente v Hopital Broussais</span> of 28 June 2000 he cited. It appears to me that it is also supported by the judgment in the <span style="font-style:italic">SEB </span>case. Prof Azéma considers that this is not possible, and that it is necessary for the claimant to start a new action, but he does not address Articles 122 and 126 FCPC or the case law cited by Prof Galloux. I therefore prefer Prof Galloux’s opinion.        </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The fifth issue is what is meant by “industrial exploitation”. Prof Azéma considers that this means manufacture, whereas Prof Galloux considers that it includes marketing the product. Prof Azéma’s opinion is supported by three first instance decisions: <span style="font-style:italic">Boston Scientific SA v Palmaz</span> (28 October 1998), <span style="font-style:italic">Boston Scientific SA v Cordis Corp </span>(23 June 1999) and <span style="font-style:italic">Abbott Ireland v Evysio Medical Devices ULC </span>(14 January 2009). Prof Galloux’s opinion receives some support from the <span style="font-style:italic">Yamanouchi</span> judgment. In my judgment the superior French courts will conclude that marketing the product is enough for this purpose. Marketing an infringing product is a form of industrial exploitation and it is an act of direct infringement. Furthermore, there is no rational reason for restricting the availability of DNIs to manufacturers. </p>

Lilly contends that the seriousness and effectiveness of the preparations must be assessed at the date the action is commenced, whereas Actavis contend that it is possible to rely upon further preparations during the pendency of the proceedings. Prof Galloux’s evidence supports Actavis’ position, as do the decisions in <span style="font-style:italic">SEB</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Dijkstra</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Yamanouchi</span> cited by him.

For reasons that will appear, I consider that it is sufficient for me to deal with Actavis’ first three routes.</p>

Actavis contend that, by the date of the Sixth Action (20 December 2013), Lilly had unambiguously taken a position on the opposability of the French designation of the Patent to each of pemetrexed diacid, dipotassium and ditromethamine. In support of this contention, Actavis rely in particular on (i) Lilly’s counsel’s confirmation at the case management conference on 17 October 2013, which was formally recited in the order made on that date, that “it is Lilly’s positive case in these proceedings that Actavis’ proposed products fall within the scope of the claims of the foreign designations of [the Patent], whether literally or by equivalence”, (ii) Lilly’s pleading with regard to the scope of the claims of the French designation of the Patent in its Statement of Case served pursuant to that order on 8 November 2013 and (iii) Lilly’s statement in a letter from Hogan Lovells to Bird &amp; Bird dated 10 December 2013 that “It necessarily follows [from Lilly’s positive case on the construction of the claims] that Lilly considers that the products do fall within the scope of those claims …”. Lilly relies on the facts that (i) counsel for Lilly also made it clear that, as the recital to the order continued, “Lilly raises no positive case of infringement in respect of the foreign designations” and (ii) no allegation of infringement was made in the Statement of Case or in the letter dated 10 December 2013.</p>

It is immaterial that Lilly did not positively allege infringement (or threatened infringement) by Actavis. Furthermore, the reality of Lilly’s position was perfectly clear by that date from the fact that Lilly had (i) brought a counterclaim for threatened infringement of the UK designation and (ii) brought proceedings in Düsseldorf for threatened infringement of the German designation. The only reason why Lilly had not positively alleged infringement of the French designation was that it wanted, so far as possible, to preserve its position that Actavis should have brought the claim in France in accordance with French procedure rather than in England in accordance with English procedure, and thereby make it more difficult for Actavis to obtain a DNI even if they were right on the merits.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment the evidence demonstrates that Actavis had made serious and effective preparations to manufacture and market each of the products, and particularly the diacid, by 20 December 2013 and certainly by the time of the trial. By 20 December 2013 Actavis had concrete and well-developed plans to manufacture and market each of the products, had taken a number of steps towards implementing those plans and had invested a certain amount of time, effort and money in doing so. By the trial Actavis had taken further steps and invested a lot more money. By 20 December 2013, and still more so by the trial, Actavis had a developed formulation of each product which they could be reasonably confident would receive regulatory approval and which they could manufacture on an industrial scale, although further work remained to be done. This was particularly true of the diacid. Accordingly, I conclude that Actavis are entitled to a DNI pursuant to Article L 615-9 IPC. Even if only the intended manufacturer can obtain a DNI, Actavis Italy is the intended manufacturer and will, if necessary, import the product into France.    </p>

For the purpose of considering route 2, I shall assume that Lilly is correct that Actavis cannot circumvent the requirement of Article L 615-9 IPC for a taking position letter by relying upon Lilly’s statements in these proceedings because Lilly has not positively asserted infringement by Actavis.  Actavis contend that, by the date of the Sixth Action, more than three months had elapsed since Actavis’ taking position letter dated 16 September 2013, and accordingly Actavis had fully complied with the requirements of Article L 615-9.</p>

In closing submissions counsel for Lilly raised a new argument that Actavis could not rely upon this letter since it was sent during the currency of earlier actions, in particular the First and Third Actions, but this point is unpleaded and unsupported by the expert evidence. More than three months elapsed between the date of the letter and the date the Sixth Action was commenced. I have already held that Actavis had made serious and effective preparations to manufacture and market each of the products, and particularly the diacid, by 20 December 2013, and certainly by the date of the trial. Accordingly, I conclude that Actavis are also entitled to a DNI pursuant to Article L 615-9 IPC on this basis.</p>

Route 3 is essentially the same as route 2, except it relies upon the First and Third Actions and the contention that Actavis can rely upon a taking position letter sent during the pendency of those proceedings. I have concluded that Actavis are right about that.

They contend that none of pemetrexed diacid, dipotassium or ditromethamine fall within the scope of the claims of the Italian designation of the Patent. Lilly disputes this. This means that, objectively viewed, there is uncertainty. That gives rise to present, concrete prejudice to Actavis, because they need a determination of the issue in order to know whether they will be safe to launch their product.

Prof Desantes considers that it is not, relying in particular on the decision of the Court of First Instance of Bilbao in Judgment 156/02 <span style="font-style:italic">Teodosio v Metro Bilbao SA</span> of 24 June 2012 concerning a dispute as to whether the domain name metrobilboa.com registered and used by the claimant infringed the defendant’s trade mark METRO BILBAO. In that case the Court rejected the defendant’s argument that the claimant had not complied with Article 127.2 (which the Spanish trade mark law applies to trade marks) because the purpose of the notarised request was to allow the trade mark owner to take a position with regard to the activity in question, but there was no need for this in the instant case because the trade mark owner had already filed a complaint against the claimant with the World Intellectual Property Organisation’s Arbitration and Mediation Centre. </p>

In paragraph 118 of his second report he states that Article 127.2 has not been dispensed with in any other case and the decision “cannot be extrapolated to any <span style="font-style:italic">de facto</span> circumstance imaginable in which there has been no notarial request”. In paragraph 30 of his third report, he points out that there was no appeal, and so one does not know what the position of the higher courts would have been. He does not go so far as to say that the decision is wrong, however.  Similarly, Prof Arenas states in paragraph 57 of his second report that in that case “the purpose sought by the notarial request had been achieved by an equivalent channel: (i) the trademark holder was aware of the claimant’s activity; (ii) the trademark holder had ‘sufficient time’ to assess the infringement …; (iii) the trademark holder had an opportunity to file an infringement complaint”.</p>

The dispute is as to what circumstances suffice for this purpose. In my judgment, the evidence demonstrates that compliance with this requirement in Article 127.2 can be dispensed with, but only if the purposes which it serves have already been achieved before commencement of the claim for DNI. This will be the case if the patentee has been made aware of the product in question, has had at least a month to consider its position and has clearly taken a position on the opposability of its patent to the product.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not consider that this conclusion is contradicted by the decision of the Court of Appeal of Navarre in Judgment 130/2011 <span style="font-style:italic">Laboratorios Cinfa SA v Novartis AG </span>of 27 May 2011 which was relied on by counsel for Lilly. In that case Cinfa had sent a letter dated 16 April 2008 to Novartis stating that it had made serious and effective preparations to market generic valsartan in Spain and asserting that its product did not infringe Novartis’ patent. It does not appear that this letter identified the manufacturer of the active ingredient. Novartis replied asserting that the patent covered the marketing of such a product and formally requesting Cinfa not to market the product. On 3 June 2008 Cinfa commenced a claim under Article 127 requesting a declaration that valsartan manufactured by Química Sintética SA did not infringe the patent. Novartis objected that Cinfa had not complied with the requirements of Article 127. Prior to the trial, Cinfa sought to amend its claim to seek a declaration in respect of its own marketing of valsartan made by Química Sintética, but this application was refused and there was no appeal. The first instance court agreed with Novartis, holding that Cinfa only had <span style="font-style:italic">locus standi</span> to request a DNI in respect of its own activities and not in respect of manufacture by a different company. Cinfa’s appeal was dismissed. Among Cinfa’s arguments on appeal was that Novartis had given it <span style="font-style:italic">locus standi</span> by its subsequent actions and statements, namely, bringing infringement proceedings against Cinfa. The Court of Appeal rejected this argument on the ground that “The requirements for <span style="font-style:italic">locus standi</span> as claimant must exist on the date the complaint is filed, and this cannot be remedied subsequently ….”. It does not follow that a prior taking of position cannot be relied upon. </p>

Prof Desantes considers that this is the case, while Prof Bercovitz and Prof Arenas do not. In my judgment the logic which I have identified in the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Teodosio v Metro Bilbao</span> for dispensing with the requirement for a notarial request one month before the claim where the purposes of that requirement have already been achieved does not justify dispensing with the requirement for serious and effective preparations. This conclusion receives some slight support from the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Cinfa v Novartis</span>, in which the Court of Appeal held that, if Cinfa had wanted to obtain a DNI in respect of its marketing of the product “it should have been expressly requested in the petition section of the complaint, specifying the ‘serious and effective preparations’ in its complaint and accrediting the reality of the same at the evidentiary stage”.   </p>

Prof Bercovitz considers that this means that there must be a notarial summons (“<span style="font-style:italic">acta de requiriminto</span>”) in accordance with Article 202 of the Notary Rules and Regulations, although he accepts that a foreign notary, rather than a Spanish notary, can be employed for this purpose where the patentee is based outside Spain. Prof Desantes disagrees, and considers that Article 127.2 merely requires a notarial notification (“<span style="font-style:italic">acta de notificación</span>”). On this point I find Prof Desantes’ reasoning in paragraphs 21-24 of his fourth report convincing.  </p>

Prof Bercovitz and Prof Arenas disagree with this. Again, I find Prof Desantes’ reasoning convincing. It seems clear that the purpose of requiring the demand to be sent through notarial channels is to ensure that the claimant can prove transmission and receipt. If the patentee has acknowledged receipt, proof by notarial means is not required. As the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Teodosio v Metro Bilbao</span> shows, the Spanish courts will not insist upon compliance with pointless formalities.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The fourth issue is what constitutes “serious and effective preparations”. It is not disputed that “industrial exploitation” includes marketing a product. Prof Bercovitz considers that “serious and effective preparations” requires the preparations to have reached the point that the claimant has the capacity to proceed imminently with the exploitation. In support of his opinion, Prof Bercovitz argues that “serious and effective preparations” in Article 127 should be interpreted in the same way as those words have been interpreted in the context of a prior use defence to infringement under Article 54 SPA (similar to section 64 of the UK Patents Act 1977). This argument receives some support from the decision of the Court of Appeal of Barcelona in Judgment 375/06 <span style="font-style:italic">Rolabo SL v Medichem SA </span>of 20 July 2006. That was a case concerning the interpretation of Article 54. In the course of its judgment, the court referred to a number of other provisions of the SPA, including Article 127. On the other hand, Article 127 was not itself in issue in that case. More significantly, in <span style="font-style:italic">Cinfa v Novartis</span> the Court of Appeal of Navarre adopted the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Rolabo v Medichem</span> to the extent it held that “experimental acts” were not sufficient to constitute “serious and effective preparations". On the other hand, that passage was what an English court would regard as <span style="font-style:italic">obiter</span>, although I appreciate that Spanish courts do not make the same distinction between <span style="font-style:italic">ratio </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">obiter</span>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Against this, Prof Desantes argues that, while it is justified to interpret the words narrowly in the context of the Article 54 defence to infringement, the purpose of Article 127 is different and so it does not follow that they should be interpreted in the same way in that context. Prof Desantes points out that Article 127 is based on section 162 of the BIRPI (the predecessor to WIPO) Model Law for Developing Countries on Inventions. The commentary to section 162 states:</p>

It is possible that a person’s present or future activity may perhaps be an infringement, but that the person is not certain. In order to clarify the matter, he may avail himself of the procedure provided for in this Section. If the outcome is favourable to him, in other words, if the court’s finding is that the performance of the act in question does not infringe the patent, the person may engage in (or continue) his activity without risk, whereas he will discontinue (or forgo) the activity if the court’s finding is unfavourable to him.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Prof Desantes also points out that other commentators have interpreted “serious and effective preparations” in Article 127 more broadly. One suggests that merely experimental acts are not enough, but not a requirement of immediacy of exploitation. Another suggests that serious and effective preparations “may consist of tests following the trial period and technical and economical studies making this operation visible”.

The difference from route 2 is that, instead of relying on the starting of the Fifth Action more than one month after that letter, Actavis rely upon the amendments which Actavis made to the First and Third Actions on 22 October 2013 pursuant to the order dated 17 October 2013. The effect of the amendments was to introduce claims in relation to pemetrexed diacid and ditromethamine into the First Action and pemetrexed dipotassium into the Third Action more than one month after the letter dated 16 September 2013. This raises the question of whether Actavis had made serious and effective preparations by 22 October 2013. With slightly more hesitation than in the case of 20 December 2013, I consider that they had.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Given my earlier conclusions, I need to make clear the bases upon which I shall consider these arguments. So far as the French and Spanish designations are concerned, I have concluded that (i) Actavis will not infringe those designations applying the <span style="font-style:italic">lex loci protectionis</span>, (ii) on a proper interpretation of the Rome II Regulation the other conditions which must be satisfied for the making of a DNI are governed by the <span style="font-style:italic">lex fori</span> and (iii) applying English law Actavis are entitled to a DNI. It follows that Actavis succeed in the First and Third Actions, and the later actions were unnecessary. Even if I am wrong on point (ii), I have held that, applying French law, Actavis succeed on route 3. Again it follows that Actavis succeed in the First and Third Actions, and the later actions were unnecessary. If I am wrong about that, but right that Actavis succeed on routes 1 or 2, it follows that Actavis succeed in the Sixth Action, but not in the First and Third Actions. I shall therefore consider Lilly’s contention that the Sixth Action is an abuse of process on that assumption. Applying Spanish law, I have held that (subject to the Amendment Abuse Argument) Actavis succeed on route 3. If I am wrong about that, but right that Actavis succeed on routes 1, 2  or 5, it follows that Actavis succeed in the Fifth, Sixth or Ninth Actions, but not in the First and Third Actions. I shall therefore consider Lilly’s contention that the Fifth, Sixth and Ninth Actions are an abuse of process on that assumption.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It should be noted before proceeding further that Lilly advances these arguments in reliance upon the English law of abuse of process i.e. the <span style="font-style:italic">lex fori</span>. Lilly does not rely upon the laws of France or Spain for this purpose. It must therefore be assumed that the Fourth and subsequent Actions would not be struck out or dismissed as an abuse of process or on an equivalent ground applying French and Spanish law. As I understand it, the reason why Lilly contends that the relevant law is English law is because the court whose process Lilly claims is being abused is the English court. I am unable to understand why, if Lilly is correct that the relevant rules are substantive rules governed by the <span style="font-style:italic">lex loci protectionis</span>, the question whether it is legitimate for Actavis to try to ensure compliance with those rules by starting fresh actions during the pendency of earlier actions or by amending pending actions should be judged by reference to the <span style="font-style:italic">lex fori</span>. Be that as it may, I will consider the merits of Lilly’s arguments on the assumption that it is correct as to the applicable law for this purpose.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is convenient first to consider the Amendment Abuse Argument. This relates to route 3 in respect of the Spanish designation. As I have explained, route 3 relies upon the amendments to the First and Third Actions made on 22 October 2013. Counsel for Lilly submitted that route 3 failed because the amendments were an abuse of process. I do not consider that this argument is open to Lilly for the following reasons. First, the order giving Actavis permission to make those amendments provided that the amendments would be made “without prejudice to Lilly’s or Actavis’ ability to argue such points as they may have as to the effect of those amendments in respect of the Fourth Action”. Lilly’s purpose in seeking this qualification was, as counsel for Lilly made clear at the hearing on 17 October 2013, to ensure that it was not prevented by the amendments from arguing that the Fourth (or any later) Action was an abuse of process. Lilly did not resist the amendments on the ground that they were in and of themselves an abuse of process. Secondly, Lilly has not appealed or applied to set aside that part of the order of 17 October 2013. Thirdly, Lilly has not pleaded that the amendments were an abuse of process. Even if the argument is open to Lilly, I do not accept it. As I have pointed out, Actavis were given permission to make the amendments by an order of this Court. There is no dispute that this Court had power under the Civil Procedure Rules to give Actavis permission to make the amendments. Furthermore, viewed from the perspective of English procedural law, there was nothing abusive about Actavis’ application for permission to make the amendments, which is precisely why Lilly did not in the end resist it provided that permission was qualified in the way that I have described. Even if Lilly is right that no such amendment could be made under Spanish procedural law, and the claimant would have to start a new action, that is immaterial.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As counsel for Actavis submitted, however, it is not an abuse of process to bring a further claim on the same cause of action during the pendency of an existing claim if there is a good reason for doing so and case management tools like consolidation are used to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort and cost: see <span style="font-style:italic">Rozenberg v Nazarov </span>[2008] EWHC 812 (Ch) at [71]-[77] (Thomas Ivory QC sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge). A common example of this in the intellectual property field is where the claimant is relying upon a cause of action, such as secondary infringement of copyright, which requires knowledge or reason for belief on the part of the defendant. Prior to the CPR, it was common for claimants, where there was doubt that the defendant had the requisite knowledge or reason for belief as at the date of the writ, but it was clear that the defendant did have it at a later date, to issue a second writ and apply to consolidate the two actions or to have them heard together. Under the CPR it is possible to take the simpler course of pleading facts arising after the date of the claim form. If there was doubt about that, however, it would not be an abuse of process for the claimant to issue a second claim form in order to ensure that it was able to rely upon the defendant’s knowledge or reason for belief as at the date of the second claim form in the alternative to the date of the first claim form and then to apply for the two claims to be heard together on the same evidence.</p>

There is, and can be, no dispute that the First and Third Actions are properly constituted actions over which it has been decided that this court has jurisdiction. Those actions have whatever consequences in terms of <span style="font-style:italic">lis pendens</span> that they have.  If Lilly is correct in saying that the <span style="font-style:italic">lis pendens</span> consequences of those actions is to prevent Lilly from bringing actions in France and Spain and thus of depriving Lilly of the procedural protections to which it claims to be entitled under French and Spanish law, as to which I express no view, then that is a natural consequence of the existence of the First and Third Actions. It is not a consequence of the bringing of the Fourth and Fifth Actions. In those circumstances, I cannot see that the Fourth and Fifth Actions are an abuse. Actavis are simply taking ordinary procedural steps to overcome procedural obstacles raised by Lilly.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Lilly argues that this is wrong because Actavis should have discontinued the First and Third Actions before commencing the later Actions, and even before writing the letters upon which those Actions are founded. I see no reason, however, why Actavis should have been obliged to discontinue claims which were properly constituted, jurisdictionally well founded and had a perfectly good prospect of success. Even if Actavis should have discontinued the First and Third Actions because they were destined to fail, that would at best found an argument that maintaining the First and Third Actions was an abuse. It would not follow that bringing the Fourth and subsequent Actions was an abuse. So Lilly’s argument has to be that, given that the First and Third Actions were maintained, it was an abuse to bring the later Actions. But that simply amounts to saying that it was an abuse for Actavis to pursue an alternative case while maintaining their primary case, which is commonplace in English litigation (and in litigation in many other legal systems).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I would add two points. The first is that Lilly’s argument makes it clear that what Lilly is really complaining about is not the bringing of the Fourth and subsequent Actions during the pendency of the First and Third Actions, but the fact that Actavis have brought these proceedings before this Court. That complaint is not open to Lilly, however, because its jurisdictional challenge to the First and Second Actions failed and it has rightly accepted that this Court has jurisdiction over the Third and subsequent Actions. Furthermore, it is not an abuse of process for a claimant to bring a claim before a forum which he perceives to be more advantageous (e.g. because it is quicker) in order to forestall the defendant from bringing proceedings in a forum which the claimant perceives to be less advantageous (e.g. because it is slower) provided that the first forum is one which properly has jurisdiction in respect of the claim: see <span style="font-style:italic">Research In Motion UK Ltd v Visto Corp</span> [2008] EWCA Civ 153, [2008] FSR 499 at [12]-[17] (Jacob LJ) and<span style="font-style:italic"> Pell Frischmann Consultants Ltd v Prabhu </span>[2013] EWHC 2203 (Ch), [2013] ICR 153.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second point is that Lilly can only complain that it has been the victim of an abuse of process in this respect if it has been prevented by Actavis’ conduct from bringing infringement actions against Actavis in France and Spain that it would otherwise have brought. Lilly has not adduced any evidence, nor even asserted through counsel’s submissions, that it would have brought such actions but for Actavis’ conduct, however. By contrast, Lilly has brought and pursued a claim in Germany even though this Court was first seized. Lilly’s stance with regard to France and Spain is simply obstructive.</p>
