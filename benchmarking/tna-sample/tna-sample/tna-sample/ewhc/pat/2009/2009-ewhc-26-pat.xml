If you believe the advertising, the comfort of the seat is one of the most important factors.  But it is not just the advertising.  When Virgin Atlantic introduced its flat-bed seat into its Upper Class in November 2003 it achieved an increase in market share on its long haul routes of 12 per cent.  So the numbers tell the same story.  Virgin Atlantic’s flat-bed seat is known as the Upper Class Suite (or “UCS”) and is the commercialisation of a seat and seating system disclosed by patent EP (UK) 1,495,908 (the “908 patent”).  The UCS </p>

Virgin Atlantic allege that Contour has manufactured other seats (known as “Rock” or “Solar Eclipse”, and a derivative called “Solar Premiere”), or kits for those seats, that infringe the 908 patent; and also allege that in working up the detailed designs of those seats Contour and its external designers, Acumen, have infringed its unregistered design rights in parts of the UCS.  Contour deny all these allegations.   </p>

Mr Mark Vanhegan and Ms Kathryn Pickard presented the case for Contour.  The case was exceptionally well argued on both sides.  A mass of points were taken both in relation to the design right issues and the patent issues.  I have not found it necessary to deal with all of them.  But I have, I hope, made all necessary findings of fact.  The trial was mainly taken up with a detailed investigation of the question whether the Solar Eclipse was (or was based on) a copy of Virgin Atlantic’s UCS.  It is convenient to deal with that question first. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In the early inter-war years of long distance air travel passengers were able to sleep on long haul flights fully recumbent; and were also able to dine with each other face to face.  But the economics of air transport led the airlines to abandon that arrangement in favour of packing more passengers into their aircraft.  Thus the almost invariable arrangement of accommodation for passengers was for the cabin to contain forward facing seats arranged in columns and rows.  Depending on the class of travel, the width of the seats, and the pitch (or distance between them) could vary considerably, as the economy passenger, making his way through first or business class to the rear of the aircraft, knew only too well. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">For the first class passenger, all this changed in 1996.  In that year British Airways (“BA”) introduced a new seating system for its first class cabin called BA First, which allowed for a completely flat bed.  The seat had been designed by Design Acumen (“Acumen”), a design house, and was design engineered and built by Contour for BA.  It provided seats in individual “pods” or compartments formed by privacy screens.  Each compartment consisted of both a seat and an ottoman (or footstool) which could be used both as part of the bed when the seat was laid flat and also as occasional seating by a guest passenger (hence it is sometimes called a “buddy seat”); and each seat was at a slight angle to the longitudinal axis of the plane, facing towards the cabin wall.  This angled arrangement of seats is called a “herringbone”.  Where the seats face towards the aisle the herringbone is called an “inward facing herringbone”; otherwise it is called an “outward facing herringbone”.  The BA seating arrangement was an outward facing herringbone, which BA had adopted in preference to an inward facing herringbone because it gave passengers more privacy.  Acumen had proposed both an inward facing herringbone and an outward facing herringbone; and mock-ups of both arrangements were made.  It was the outward facing herringbone that was commercialised.  BA patented its seat and seating system following a patent application filed in December 1995, which disclosed both the outward facing herringbone and the inward facing herringbone.  I will revert to the details of this later. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">BA First was enthusiastically received in the design world.  Design Week gave it the award for “Product of the Decade”.  Acumen were also the winners of many design awards for BA First.  Mr Dryburgh, the managing director of Acumen, was justifiably proud of his company’s achievement.  In addition the launch of BA First caused a considerable stir within the airline industry itself.  All the main airlines decided that they needed to emulate BA’s ground-breaking idea; otherwise they were at risk of losing the highest paying passengers.  A number of airlines immediately adopted the outward facing herringbone layout, the use of an ottoman and privacy screens to provide competitive products.  These included United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AA), Swissair and many others.  The introduction of flat-bed seats was, at this stage, limited to first class passengers.  Because first class passengers pay such a lot of money for their tickets, the airlines could afford to be relatively generous with the space allotted to each passenger; mainly because the price of a first class ticket could be increased to counteract the loss of passenger numbers without adversely affecting overall revenue. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In 2000 American Airlines launched its Flagship Suite.  It was also an outward facing herringbone.  The particular innovation of this seat was that it was a swivelling seat.  This meant that the passenger could face forward for take off and landing; and swivel the seat into one position in order to work or eat at a table, and to another position when the seat was converted into a bed.  The swivelling seat was made possible because the aircraft in which it was installed had wide bodies.  Acumen designed this seat as well.  American Airlines also patented its seat and seating system.  Again, I will revert to the details of this later. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Then came the turn of business class passengers.  Once again BA led the way.  Both Virgin Atlantic and BA had been working on a new seat for business class passengers, and both were put into service at about the same time in 2000.  Virgin Atlantic’s seat was known as J2000.  The seats were arranged in conventional rows and columns.  Although the J2000 provided a bed, it did so at a slight tilt; and was in the nature of a reclining seat.  The foot of the bed had to be partially accommodated under the seat of the passenger in front.  The J2000 was a moderate commercial success, in that Virgin Atlantic used it itself, and also licensed its use to other airlines; but it was eclipsed by BA’s new offering. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">BA’s new offering was nick-named the Yin-Yang seat.  It was designed by a team led by Professor Darbyshire, who gave evidence in this case as one of Contour’s experts.  It had interlocking seats in a head-to-toe formation; one passenger sitting and sleeping next to the aisle and the other sitting and sleeping next to the window.  One of the two passengers faced forwards; and the other faced backwards.  This arrangement of seats provided good density of accommodation.  However, it had its drawbacks.  The passenger in the seat further from the aisle had to climb over the other passenger to get in and out of his seat; and many passengers did not like the feeling of travelling backwards.  It, too, was patented. </p>

These include the cabin width; the location of the seat tracks; the location of doorways, monuments (fixed installations such as galleys, lavatories etc.), and so on.  They are less important in the context of this case, because the seats and seating systems in issue were designed for the same (or similar) aircraft.  The word “monument” is used by some people in the aircraft design world in a wider sense, to denote anything fixed within an aircraft cabin that is not a seat.  In the wider sense the word thus includes things like bulkheads and partitions.  An aircraft cabin is also notionally divided into zones.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Since the airline industry is highly competitive, all airlines are constantly looking at their competitors’ offerings.  One of the most important parts of the offering for business class passengers is the Passenger Accommodation Unit (PAU).  So, typically, an airline will analyse the product of its closest competitor and try to make its own product better.  One of the first steps is to make a copy of the competitor’s Layout of Passenger Area (LOPA).  In the case of BA the LOPA for each of its aircraft is available on its website.  The same applies to other airlines too.  From this and other information an airline can study its competitor’s PAU.  It will also take photographs and make slides of the competing product.  Airline staff and their consultants will also fly on rival airlines and, within the constraints imposed by the presence of cabin crew, will take measurements of their rival’s PAU.  These measurements can be quite detailed, including for example the angle of the seat pans, and the width of the seat.  It will list the features of a competing PAU as a check list; and will, no doubt, add its own “wish list” of desirable features.  One of the processes will be an overlay of any new seat design over its nearest rivals, in order to see what effect a new seat will have on the use of space within the cabin and hence on the number of seats that can be accommodated.  Mr Moreno, Virgin Atlantic’s expert, said in his report that if he had been asked to design a new flat-bed business class seat in 2001 his first step would have been to review the seats that were already on the market and assess their advantages and disadvantages. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The idea of a herringbone arrangement of seats had been around for some time.  In pure design terms both an inward facing herringbone and an outward facing herringbone were known.  An inward facing herringbone gave the potential for greater seat density.  This is because the seats can be angled more acutely, and because access from the aisle into the seat is more efficient if passengers do not have to climb over or round the seat back.  Its drawback was that passengers faced each other across the aisle, thus reducing their individual privacy.  An outward facing herringbone, on the other hand, gave the passengers greater privacy, but was spacehungrier.  Until the advent of the UCS the perception in the industry was that passengers would not like an inward facing herringbone.  Since the passengers are the economic drivers, inward facing herringbones remained in the realm of theory.  This is borne out by Acumen’s experience.  They have worked on (or are working on) some twelve herringbone layouts.  All, with the exception of Solar Eclipse and its derivatives, are outward facing.  At the time of the events in issue Virgin Atlantic’s UCS was the only inward facing herringbone that had actually been commercialised.   </p>

The starting point for a seat design is to create the LOPA.  In creating a LOPA the designer is not simply working in plan.  He must take account of the curvature of the aircraft walls and must establish the distance that must be left between the seat and the sidewall of the aircraft in order for the seat mechanism to operate efficiently.  The design process operates in stages, which Mr McKeever described as follows: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.00in">Stage 2:  The minimum bed dimension is laid out in the aircraft LOPA to fit as many passenger places as possible.  There are a number of key dimensions.  Some are fixed, such as the width of the aircraft.  Others are variable within limits, such as the aisle width.  Acumen normally work to an aisle width of 20”.  One advantage of this is that it gives the designer much greater freedom of design in relation to the privacy screen.  The designer will subtract twice the aisle width from the aircraft width (because there are two aisles) and the result is the space left for the beds.  If the seating configuration is 1-2-1 (i.e.  one passenger in each column adjacent to a sidewall of the aircraft, and two passengers in the middle) then the space left for the seats is divided by four.  That dimension is the space within which the seats must be fitted. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.00in">Stage 3:  The minimum dimension plan shapes are laid out in the most space efficient layout; for example a herringbone layout for a bed seat.  This layout uses bed blocks, which is the shape of the bed in its extended position.  There is some freedom of choice for the angle of installation of the bed blocks, but since the object of the exercise is to pack as many seats as possible into a tight space, the freedom of choice is limited.  A gap is left between each bed to allow for some structure and privacy screens.  With rectangular bed blocks this may lead to clashes with the minimum legal aisle width; the aircraft sidewall and clashes between beds down the centre line of the aircraft.  The layout is likely to be designed for the most constricted part of the cabin first, which in many cases will be the central columns of seats rather than the outboard seats. </p>

Typically this results in rounded corners or asymmetric shapes.  At this or the preceding stage the designer must also consider the position of the seat within the bed block.  This is likely to be determined by the seat mechanism.  The seat should be positioned as close to the sidewall of the aircraft as possible, but must avoid the seat back hitting the sidewall of the aircraft when fully reclined. </p>

And although Laddie J. was right in saying that the defendant will not know in what the alleged (my emphasis) monopoly resides until the letter before action or the claim form, that does not mean the defendant does not know where he stands before then.  The man who copies a part of an article, exactly or substantially, will know what he has taken.

There is a danger that the ability of the claimant to select parts of his design which are small in comparison to the overall article will give rise to a distorted impression of what the defendant has done which comes close to reversing the burden of proof.  This concentration on relatively minor aspects of the overall design also had a tendency to make some of the witnesses more defensive than they might otherwise have been.

Two points arise.  First, although the Act allows design right to subsist in (and be claimed for) <span style="font-style:italic">part</span> of an article, the definition of reproduction speaks only of making “articles”.  There is, therefore, a linguistic mismatch between subsistence of design right and the right that it confers.  But it must obviously have been Parliament’s intention that if design right subsisted in part of an article (e.g. the teapot spout) the right would be infringed by incorporating a copy of that spout in another teapot, even if the infringing spout is not itself a whole article.  Second, even if the design has been copied, the infringing article must be produced “exactly or substantially” to the copied design.  Mere similarity is not enough.   </p>

The court undertakes a visual comparison of the two designs, noting the similarities and the differences.  The purpose of the examination is not to see whether the overall appearance of the two designs is similar, but to judge whether the particular similarities relied on are sufficiently close, numerous or extensive to be more likely to be the result of copying than of coincidence.  It is at this stage that similarities may be disregarded because they are commonplace, unoriginal, or consist of general ideas.  If the plaintiff demonstrates sufficient similarity, not in the works as a whole but in the features which he alleges have been copied, and establishes that the defendant had prior access to the copyright work, the burden passes to the defendant to satisfy the judge that, despite the similarities, they did not result from copying. </p>

But differences in the overall appearance of the two works due to the presence of features of the defendant's work about which no complaint is made are not material.  In the present case the disposition of the flowers and (except in one instance) the colourways of the defendant's design are very different from those of the plaintiff's design.  They were not taken from the copyright work, and the plaintiffs make no complaint in respect of them.  They make a significant difference to the overall appearance of the design.  But this is not material where the complaint is of infringement of copyright and not passing off.” </p>

In short the defence was that the designers of Rock and Solar Eclipse had no access to UCS and therefore could not have copied the designs.  That pleaded defence had to be abandoned in the light of disclosure of documents.  The position as it eventually emerged was rather more complex.  First, there are at least two kinds of design data.  Design data known as CATIA, which are three dimensional modelling data, are stored in a digital file.  It can be sent to a manufacturer who can use the file to make a mould or tool in order to manufacture the required component.  These data can be kept securely.  In addition there are two-dimensional design drawings.  These could not be kept securely once UCS had gone into production in the autumn of 2003.  Second, once Virgin Atlantic had entered into a licence with Air New Zealand in about June 2004, the UCS had to be modified in order to fit onto Air New Zealand’s aircraft.  A separate design team was created in order to deal with those modifications.  That design team (as well as the original design team) had access to the UCS design data (including CATIA).

There is no doubt that Mr Meade’s crossexamination of Mr McKeever was very effective and it did expose some inconsistencies and weaknesses in his evidence.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Moreno was Virgin Atlantic’s expert witness on issues relating both to the patent and to design.  Mr Moreno is a designer who has had some experience of aircraft seating design, though he came to that area relatively recently.  His company has designed and created two mock-ups for first class seating, and has designed an economy seat which will be released in 2009.  Apart from that he has made one unsuccessful pitch to produce a business class seat; and he has lectured about business class aviation.  I did not consider that his practical knowledge of the design of aircraft seating was equal to that of Professor Darbyshire.  Mr Moreno said in crossexamination that he understood his function on the design right part of the case to be that of pointing out similarities between the UCS and Solar Eclipse and to disregard any differences between them.  This, I fear, was a misunderstanding of his role as an expert, which was to look at both similarities and differences, and to come to a conclusion, based on both the similarities and the differences whether those similarities and differences led to an inference that one design had been copied from the other.  There were other flaws in his approach.  First, he discounted any design constraints imposed by the client’s brief.  While it is true that the requirements of a brief which ineluctably lead to copying provide no defence; in a case where it is not suggested that the general concept is one that is protected by design right those constraints must be taken into account to some extent.  In the present case Acumen’s eventual brief was to design an inward facing herringbone.  Mr Moreno considered, in my judgment wrongly, that that, in itself, was some evidence of copying.  Second, and following on from this point, his approach was that a designer should be as creative as possible; so that he tended to think that a design choice of a conventional way of designing something was itself evidence of copying.

In the case of an intricate product such an aircraft seating system, the elements to be manipulated (the seat mechanism, the IFE system, the side table and so on) will drive the form of the finished product.  The final design is more likely to be harmed than helped by the copying of someone else’s design data, especially if they are design data that relate to only a small part of the overall design. </p>

It knew that its main competitors were the BA First seating unit and the YinYang seat.  It was losing business to BA.  It knew that it had to provide a flat-bed seat in order to compete.  Virgin Atlantic completed a Design Business Case on 15 May 2000; and a Technical Specification by December 2000.  Within Virgin Atlantic the project was mostly referred to as “Chanel”, although it had other names as well.  On 16 February 2001 Design Q (a design consultancy) gave a presentation to Virgin Atlantic on the UCS; and following that presentation LOPAs were produced showing various different alternatives for possible layouts.  Various options were being considered at that stage, including an inward herringbone layout with no ottoman (Chanel No 5a), an angled “yin yang” type configuration (Chanel No 5c), a front and back facing side-by-side arrangement (Chanel No 5d), and a suite type arrangement (Chanel No 4b).  Virgin Atlantic originally feared that passengers would not like an inward facing herringbone because of the loss of privacy; but their market research suggested that the fear was unfounded.   </p>

The privacy screens for both the central and wall PAUs incorporated one continuous low section with a higher central section.   A translucent “visor” was attached to the higher section in order to provide further privacy between passengers.   The privacy screens were retractable along the curve of the chair shell.   The ottoman swivelled in order to change from an ottoman to a buddy seat and vice versa.  The foam mockups were similar.  The designers also experimented with the shape of the retractable privacy screen, using a “visor” type screen as shown in the 3D visualisations as well as a fuller sliding screen. </p>

The height of that shield remained constant rather than curving down towards the floor of the cabin as the shield wrapped around the ottoman.   The privacy screens also remained at constant height but curved very sharply down to the floor at their edge.

One of the suites had a functioning seat mechanism, but none of the other features (cocktail table, handset cradle etc) were actually working.

The CAD drawings and data which they worked on and generated were kept on a secure part of Contour’s computer system that could only be accessed by authorized team members.  These security measures changed later.  The first change was in July 2003 when the design team moved from their dedicated facility to new offices which housed other design teams as well.  The second change took place when UCS was publicly launched in November 2003.  At that stage the 2-D drawings were placed in Contour’s digital library and restrictions on access to them were lifted.  The restrictions remained in place as regards the 3-D modelling data. </p>

Initially, the team consisted of Mr Davies, Mr Simon Allen, Mr Dan Buckley and Mr Andy McDonald.  Each of them worked on a different aspect of the design.  It soon became clear to Mr Davies that this manpower was not enough.  Accordingly, some of Contour’s permanent staff were transferred to Project Malcolm and more people were brought in on a contract basis to work specifically on the project.  Mr Bruce Gentry was additionally involved in Project Malcolm in his capacity as the Civil Aviation Authority signatory at Camberley.  His role was to sign off all drawings for Project Malcolm in order to obtain regulatory approval from the CAA.  This required him to understand the designs in order to satisfy himself that they were worthy of manufacture at least for the purposes of testing.  Although Mr Gentry was also Mr Davies’ line manager, in practice Mr Davies was in day to day charge of the design project, both before and after the design team moved offices.  An e-mail from Contour to Virgin Atlantic which suggested that there was some substantive change in the management of the team at the time of the office move was little more than window dressing.  Over the course of Project Malcolm over forty engineers were involved, although only a few of them were on Contour’s permanent staff. </p>

First, it was intended to be located on the aircraft at a more pronounced angle to the central axis of the aircraft than previous seat designs.  This feature would present “challenges” in obtaining regulatory approval.  In the event these were overcome with the use of an airbag.  Second, it had a “flip over” feature of having the mattress on the rear of the seat, which had not been done before.  Previous seats had turned into beds by reclining the seat back.  Third, the paint finishes were more like those applied to cars rather than to aircraft; and fourth there were to be no visible fastenings on the seats. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In his witness statement Mr Higgins describes some of the drawbacks of the UCS seat.  The UCS seat is expensive when compared to other seats on the market.   It is a complicated design which requires the back rest to flip over so that the reverse side is used in lie flat mode.   This has the advantage that a contoured back rest can be used in upright mode and a separate lie flat bed surface can be used in lie flat mode.   The flip over seat involves more mechanics than a more traditional reclining seat, where the back rest simply reclines into the space behind it to form the lie flat bed.   While there are some advantages with the UCS flip over design, there are real problems such as the fact the passenger must rise from the seat in order to convert it into a lie flat bed, in addition to the extra cost and complexity which are caused by the complicated mechanics.  In addition a trolley service is not practical for UCS because the aisle width for UCS ranges from 15.5” on Boeing 747 to 17.35” on Airbus 330 and 340.   Trolley service requires the standard 20” aisle width.  In order to achieve this aisle </p>

The disadvantage of a shorter bed is reduced passenger comfort, while the disadvantage of a less acute angle of installation is fewer seats.  The disadvantage of not serving meals from trolleys is that more cabin crew are needed. </p>

Because the privacy screen (and its installations such as the IFE and reading light) was attached to the seat in front, if the angle of installation of the seat is changed the relative position of the screen and the passenger is also changed, by as much as six or seven inches.  In the context of a confined aircraft cabin, that is a lot.  This required further modifications to the design in order to accommodate different angles of installation.  This effect is not produced by a seat unit where the screen is attached to the seat that it serves (such as the Rock/Solar Eclipse seat). </p>

The cost of development of the UCS seat was of the order of £50 million.  The UCS seat was undoubtedly a success in the design world.  It won a large number of design awards between 2003 and 2005.  These included the winner of the Best Leisure Furniture Award in the FX International Interior Design Awards (2003), the winner of the IDEA Gold Award for Transport Design (2004), the Design Week Best Industrial Product Design (2004), sponsored by Anti Copying in Design and judged by Professor Darbyshire, and the winner of the IF Design Award for Transport Design (2004).  Just after the launch of UCS Mr Davies was quoted in Virgin Atlantic’s in-house magazine as saying that the UCS “pushed the boundaries” of business class seating, a view that he continues to hold.  One of the attributes that was specifically mentioned in some of the awards was the “innovative-inward facing spatial concept in a herringbone pattern”.  So, also, was the flip-over seat, and the size of the bed that it made.  One of the other innovative features of UCS was the angle of installation of the seats.  As mentioned, they were at 40<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">o</span> and 49<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">o</span> to the longitudinal axis of the aircraft.  This angle was greater than permitted by the regulations without additional passenger safety features.  Virgin Atlantic overcame the regulatory problem by using an airbag.  Although airbags were known in aircraft, they had previously been used for front row bulkhead seats.  The airbag that Virgin Atlantic used had to deploy asymmetrically.  It was developed by AmSafe.  Virgin Atlantic do not claim any intellectual property rights either in the airbag itself or the idea of the airbag. </p>

Part of the reason for doing this was to see whether the UCS seat could be licensed to other airlines, which would have helped Virgin Atlantic recoup some of its expenditure in developing the UCS seat.  Contour also assisted in making presentations to other airlines.  Presentations were made to Air New Zealand, Qatar Airlines and UAL in February 2004; and to Air India in September 2005.  Air New Zealand took a licence for the seat recorded in a written agreement dated 27 June 2004 in return for a substantial fee.  There were some features of the UCS which other airlines did not like.  Some did not like the flip over seat, because it meant that the passenger had to get out of his seat in order to turn it into bed mode.  Some thought </p>

They recorded that Cathay Pacific recognised that they needed a product to compete with BA and Virgin and described the three options.  Mr McKeever also described the three alternatives that Acumen put forward.  Two were adaptations of an existing Contour seat.   The third was a “blue sky” concept.  It was to be a seat bed combination.  At an early stage in the briefing Acumen were told that Cathay Pacific had expressed interest in a herringbone concept.  For the “blue-sky” part of the brief a number of LOPAs were prepared in late March or early April 2004.  Mr McKeever said that Acumen initially adopted an outward facing herringbone “even though Cathay had not voiced any preference between the two.” This was because of a perception of a cultural preference.  He said that Acumen’s realisation of the cultural preference came from research that Acumen had carried out earlier when working on BA First.  The cultural preference therefore led to an outward facing herringbone, where the passenger’s feet were not pointing towards the aisle.  But it also meant that if the herringbone were to be reversed, then a backshield for the ottoman became desirable.  Mr Dryburgh, on the other hand, said that the design team at Acumen went back to their earlier designs for the BA First seat.  That was when they had first realised the virtues of an inward facing herringbone, even though customer research carried out for BA at that time had meant that it was an outward facing herringbone that went forward.  Mr Dryburgh said that his initial thought for the Cathay Pacific project was to design an inward facing herringbone; but that he was told that would be unacceptable for cultural reasons, because it was offensive to serve passengers from the foot.  However, there is no trace in the case papers of an inward facing herringbone at the early design stages.  The options that were considered included a number of swivelling seats, some of which were in angled configurations, and some of which were in a forward facing configuration.   In some of the alternatives considered the bed configuration of the </p>

Nevertheless Mr Dryburgh’s proposal attached to his e-mail of 13 May 2004 says unequivocally that Acumen were “given the understanding” that an inward facing herringbone would not be acceptable to Cathay Pacific and that that was the reason why that avenue was rejected in the early conceptual thinking.  This is near contemporaneous support for his evidence.  I find, therefore, that Mr Dryburgh’s recollection is broadly correct, and that although Acumen did briefly consider an inward facing herringbone, it was discarded before it reached any design drawing and was not explored further in the light of the understanding that Acumen had.  That may well be why Mr McKeever either did not know of this understanding, or had forgotten it. </p>

In my judgment this criticism was misplaced.  First, there was no evidence that design right in the designs that Acumen looked at belonged to BA.  Second, Mr Dryburgh’s evidence was that the designs they went back to were designs that BA had rejected.  Third, any design house will draw on its experience in designing the kind of articles under consideration, and the customer will know that.  If you commission a chair from Hepplewhite you know in advance what sort of chair you will get, and you would be surprised to get something that looked like Chippendale.  Acumen were one of the leading designers of aircraft seating and over the years had built up a stock of valuable know-how.  I do not find it in the least surprising that they drew on that experience and know-how. </p>

These included both designs for a new first class seat and designs for a new business class seat; and a LOPA showing the layout of the cabin.  It is common ground that the business class seat and the LOPA showing it in situ bear no real resemblance to UCS.  No one alleges that this seat or this LOPA was a copy of anything.  The PAU was a “pod” consisting of a seat and a powered ottoman.  A privacy screen wrapped around the back of the seat (which abutted the aisle), and a separate low curved shield wrapped around the ottoman.  The privacy screen was not of a uniform height but curved down towards the ottoman.  The privacy screen was not straight in plan form, but met the sidewall of the aircraft in curve.  The curve of the ottoman shield in the vertical plane was not at a uniform height, but rose towards the middle.  The LOPAs for business class were all outward facing herringbones.  In an outward facing herringbone the passenger, at least in the outboard seats, can look out of the window.  There is therefore no need for an integral privacy screen to wrap around the ottoman; and thus the design did not have one.  The </p>

In plan form, however, the combination of the privacy screen and the ottoman shield resembled an inverted rounded J. The LOPAs showed three columns of seats across the aircraft cabin, each column being one seat wide (a 1-1-1 configuration).  The central seats adopted a modified angled “yin yang” concept.   Two central seats faced one way, while the next two seats faced the other.  Mr Meade pointed to the fact that Mr Dryburgh had referred specifically to Virgin in the context of the airbag.  I find it difficult to attribute any real significance to this reference as evidence of copying.  First, Virgin claims no rights in the airbag or the idea of the airbag.  Second, Mr Dryburgh’s reference was in the context of <span style="font-style:italic">outward</span> facing herringbones, whereas Virgin Atlantic’s case of copying is that it was an <span style="font-style:italic">inward</span> facing herringbone that was copied.  At its highest this seems to me to indicate that the commercialisation of the UCS had shown the airline industry that it was possible to have seats at an angle of greater than 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">o </span>without having to make passengers wear a three point harness.

Most of the changes consisted of clearer labelling of the parts.  Thus it was made clear that the privacy screen was partially retractable, that the ottoman was powered, and that the screen contained a monitor, table, cocktail table and reading light.   There was a dropping arm at the side of the seat to ease access to the “pod”, and the ottoman lifted to provide storage space underneath.   The privacy screen incorporated a “lift and drop” table positioned immediately above the forward edge of the seat pan and a 15” monitor directly above it also in the privacy screen.  On 8 April Mr Jones sent on the designs to Cathay Pacific as part of Contour’s proposal.  The seats were to be installed at an angle of between 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">o </span>and 50<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">o</span> from the longitudinal axis of the aircraft; and accompanying text to the “blue sky” concept said that due to the seat angle Contour would look at developing a new three point seatbelt harness for take off and landing.  It did not mention an airbag.  The seats were configured in an outward facing herringbone arrangement.  But the principle of an angle of installation greater than 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">o</span> had been established in Acumen’s design.  The price comparison between the various options indicated the likely price of the “blue sky” option based, as the presentation said, “on Malcolm without seat” for the furniture, and a separate price for the seat. </p>

The first two options, based on existing Contour seats, did not meet Cathay Pacific’s requirements, because they did not provide a completely flat bed.  The blue sky option was not satisfactory either, because it failed to meet Cathay Pacific’s requirement for passenger numbers.  Although the LOPA did show the required number of business class passengers, it only achieved this by using space that would otherwise be used for economy class passengers.  This may have arisen out of a misunderstanding between Contour and Acumen.  At all events, Mr Yeung asked Contour to think again.  A week later Mr Yeung sent another e-mail.  He was still very concerned about the reduction in seat count.  He continued: </p>

On the LOPA for the main deck of the 747 the seats had been installed at a more acute angle, which gave space for a 1-21 configuration, thus increasing the passenger count to 16.  It is notable that although Cathay Pacific had asked for the adoption of the “Virgin fishbone layout concept” which was the only inward facing herringbone then in service, Acumen in fact provided another outward facing herringbone.  It is not entirely clear why Acumen persisted with an outward facing herringbone in the face of the client’s requests; but the answer may be that they thought that an outward facing herringbone would provide better accommodation and facilities for individual passengers.

While this is, no doubt, a reference to the UCS it is presented as an alternative to the existing Eclipse mechanism; and the existing Eclipse mechanism is what was in fact used.  Indeed, the reference to the Eclipse mechanism suggests that the corresponding reference to Project Malcolm was a reference to the flip-over feature of the seat itself rather than the cabin arrangement.  The seat design that Contour had presented was in fact a “single pod type” seat, but it was not configured in a similar way to UCS, because it was not inward facing.  It is also clear from this report that Cathay Pacific had been preparing their own LOPAs, at least one of which was based on UCS.  It seems probable that Cathay Pacific gave the Contour team a copy of their in-house LOPAs at that meeting.  It showed an inward facing herringbone. </p>

Mr Higgins agreed that the briefing must have taken place on the basis of the inward facing herringbone LOPA that Cathay Pacific had supplied to Contour a few days earlier.  He also said that his understanding at the time was that Acumen would rework their existing design, but based on that LOPA.   However, he said that there was little guidance that could have been obtained from that LOPA, because it contained no dimensions, and in particular no aisle widths, and no station lines for monuments.  All that could be gleaned from it was that Cathay Pacific wanted an inward facing herringbone.  Mr McKeever recalls that in May 2004 Contour told Acumen that “Cathay wanted us to adopt an inboard facing herringbone layout to achieve maximum headcount in the same way that VAA had done”.  Mr Dryburgh explained that Cathay Pacific’s requirement for the pax count overcame their cultural resistance to an inward facing herringbone.  This LOPA was sent on 13 May, and I will revert to its details shortly.  For the moment I note simply that the inward facing herringbone enabled a configuration of 1-2-1 on the main deck of the 747 to accommodate 20 passengers, an increase of 4.  On the following day, 14 May, Mr Clarke e-mailed LOPA revisions “per the new layouts received from Cathay via Peter Jones.” These were the LOPAs based on the existing seats in a forward facing arrangement, and did not include the “blue sky” option.

However, neither Mr Dryburgh nor Mr Gentry had detailed information about UCS; and in my judgment their conversation was at a fairly general level.  What they seem to have discussed was whether an inward facing herringbone would work (that having been the subject of Mr Gentry’s “quick and dirty” investigations back in May 2003).  They also discussed the seat mechanism, but expressly rejected the Virgin Atlantic mechanism.  I accept Mr Gentry’s evidence that this was the only “info” that he provided to Mr Dryburgh. </p>

The passenger’s head was shown as protruding into the triangular space formed between the back of the seat and the cabin wall.  Mr Jones duly reported to Mr Yeung that the design was being reworked; and asked if the date for the presentation could be deferred for a week.  However, this did not prove possible.  But on 17 May Mr Jones e-mailed Mr Yeung to say that they could meet the deadline of 9 June for the presentation and had “styled a product based on the Blue Sky J Class LOPA you provided me in HK”.   In his evidence Mr McKeever said that reworking the original “blue sky” concept from an outward facing herringbone to an inward facing herringbone was “not a big deal”.  He said that in its work for BA Acumen had invented the herringbone and had proposed both inward and outward facing herringbones, albeit that it was only the outward facing herringbone that had been commercialised.  The starting point for both the original “blue sky” concept and the reworked version had been the same:  the standard Eclipse seat mechanism.  Acumen also carried over the same packaging proposals from the original concept to the reworked version and drew on their experience with BA in designing an inward facing herringbone.  He stoutly resisted the suggestion that the redesign made use of the UCS LOPA. </p>

The privacy screens were depicted as crude arcs; and the spatial layout was very poor.  Some seat units fouled the lavatories; and others were very wasteful of space.  The number of seats depicted matched the number that Virgin Atlantic accommodated in this part of the aircraft:  six in each of the two columns of seats adjacent to the aircraft sidewall, and two columns of four in the centre (6-4-4-6).  The aisle widths were very close to the aisle widths on the Virgin Atlantic LOPA.  The seat width, so far as it can be estimated, was 22”; and this seat width was carried forward into the other two May LOPAs.  The Cathay Pacific was not, however, the Virgin Atlantic LOPA.

The sidewall assessment required the use of the standard Solar Eclipse seat mechanism, but adapted to make it lie completely flat when in bed mode.   The seat mechanism had a protruding rear link; and in order to make the seat lie flat Mr McKeever thought that the rear link would have to be extended.  This in turn meant that the seat could not be as close to the aircraft sidewall as he would have liked; and also that when the seat was fully reclined in bed mode, there was a gap between the top of the seatback and the aircraft wall.  The sidewall assessment showed how close the seat could be placed to the sidewall of the aircraft, but it did not dictate the angle of installation.  Having ascertained how close the seat could be at an angle of 90<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">o </span>(the worst case) the seat could then be pivoted to the desired angle, which would essentially be determined by trial and error.  The object of the exercise is to have as many seats as possible, and therefore the designer chooses the steepest possible angle compatible with the width of the aircraft and the width of the aisles.  Mr McKeever deduced that the sidewall seat assessment must have been carried out before the production of the 13 May LOPA, since the angle of the seat and the seat positions were identical in each of the 13 and 14 May LOPAs.  In addition the 14 May LOPA was used to build the mock up presented to Cathay Pacific in June, and the sidewall assessment must have been done before then.   The sidewall assessment fixing the seat position must therefore have been carried out before 13 May, otherwise the seat position would have changed throughout the working up of the design.

The sidewall assessment showed the seat in elevation up against the sidewall of the aircraft.  It showed the backrest, the seat pan and an extendable footrest.  Projecting those lines dictates the position of the split lines when the seat is in TTOL mode.  That in turn has a knock-on effect on the size of the ottoman.

But their instruction was not that they wanted a copy of UCS.  Their instruction was that they wanted the same <span style="font-style:italic">concept</span>.  At most what Acumen took from that was the idea or concept of the inward facing herringbone.  The idea that the angle of installation of the seats should be greater than 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">o</span> had already been established in the outward facing herringbone that Acumen had proposed in April.  Moreover, Acumen had briefly considered (and rejected) the idea of an inward facing herringbone right at the beginning of the project.  In addition Acumen did not have access to a genuine Virgin Atlantic LOPA and the in-house LOPA produced by Cathay Pacific was far too crude and inaccurate to form a basis for copying.  Mr Meade submitted that Acumen also took the idea of incorporating part of the space behind the seat into the bed.  It is true that that idea was present in the 14 May LOPA.  But it is unlikely to have come from the Cathay Pacific in-house LOPA because that drawing was too crude and the seat positioned too close to the aircraft sidewall to enable that to be done.  It does, however, seem probable that Acumen knew that this was one of the features of UCS because it had been one of the features that had won such plaudits in the design press.  Nevertheless, since Acumen were instructed to use a standard seat mechanism, I do not find it difficult to find that a competent designer, embarked on an inward facing herringbone, would independently come up with that idea.  Virgin Atlantic invite me to infer that detailed 3-D design data was given by Contour to Acumen.  There is no positive evidence to this effect.  The inference is based on allegations about the insufficiency of Contour’s disclosure.  But Acumen has given full disclosure (despite not being a party to the litigation) and that reveals no such data.  I decline to draw that inference.  In addition, within the constraints of </p>

Although the seat positions in the 13 May LOPA were carried forward into the 14 May LOPA, that was the result of the sidewall assessment which had been independently carried out by Acumen on the basis of the standard seat mechanism.  As Mr Vanhegan submitted, any other conclusion necessarily entails that (at least) Mr Dryburgh and Mr McKeever were engaged in a dishonest conspiracy to mislead the court.  Having heard both of them give evidence, I do not believe that they were. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Contour produced a brochure showing the designs which Acumen had made for them, and a spatial mockup of the design.  A team from Contour and Acumen flew to Hong Kong to present the design to Cathay Pacific.   The design was now an inward facing herringbone.  The PAU consisted of a seat and an ottoman enclosed by a privacy screen.  Whereas Option 3 (presented to Cathay Pacific in April) had been an outward facing herringbone with the privacy screen wrapping round the back of the seat and a separate backshield for the ottoman, the new design had the privacy screen wrapping integrally round the back of the ottoman, and no privacy screen or shell round the back of the seat.  One reason for this change was that the shell at the back of the seat is designed to hide the seat mechanism which would otherwise be exposed to the aisle.  In an inward facing herringbone this is unnecessary, because the seat mechanism is hidden by the sidewall of the aircraft.  The position of the “lift and drop” table and the monitor were the same, relative to the seat, as they had been in the outward facing herringbone which had been the subject of Contour’s initial proposal to Cathay Pacific back in April.  The ottoman had a flip over seat, whereas the previous ottoman had not.  Behind the screen at the back of the ottoman (where there had once been a triangular protrusion) there was now a cocktail table, accessible from the adjacent seat.   The shape of the privacy screen and the ottoman, in plan but without the cocktail table, was rather like a soup ladle or reversed J. The length of the bed was given as 79”.  It had a generally flat headrest with rounded shoulders, and when reclined backwards fitted into a curved surround behind the seat.  Further drawings in the same brochure showed that in order to achieve the 79” bed length, it would be necessary for a passenger’s head to rest on the triangular area between the rear of the seat and the cabin wall.  At this stage in the project the Rock design used a reclining seat co-operating with the curved surround tailored to match the shape of the headrest in the standard Eclipse seat, whereas the UCS did not use a reclining seat in bed mode:  it used the flip-over seat.  The design of Rock in this respect was later changed in order to avoid infringing one of Virgin Atlantic’s patents (not the patent in suit).  Acumen had created two LOPAs; one based on a seat width of 20” and the other on a seat width of 22”.  The mock up was based on the 22” seat width design. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">On 22 June 2004 Contour were approached by Air Canada about the possibility of obtaining a licence for the UCS.  There was a tight timescale, because Air Canada wanted to launch in July 2005 which was just over a year away.  In view of the timescale for developing a new product from scratch, the use of an existing (and safety certified) product was attractive.  Mr Bettell of Contour immediately put Mr Palmer of Virgin Atlantic in touch with Mr Reeleder of Air Canada.  Mr Palmer emailed Mr Reeleder on the same day.  Mr Bettel had alerted Mr Palmer to a possible problem, namely that the UCS had not been designed for a Boeing 767, which was Air Canada’s principal aircraft.  Mr Palmer told Mr Reeleder that in installing UCS he could expect a 10 per cent loss of seats (about 4 seats) as compared with a traditional business class layout.  Contour supplied LOPAs to Air Canada showing UCS seats on Air Canada aircraft on 8 August 2004.  In parallel with these negotiations over a licence for the UCS, at some time in July Contour offered Air Canada the Rock seat which at that stage in their discussions was called the “Confidential Seat” or the “secret” seat.  Personnel from Air Canada arranged a meeting with Contour in early August 2004.  The purpose of the meeting was (among other things) to go over drawings and LOPAs for UCS in an Air Canada cabin and to look at renderings and LOPAs for the Confidential Seat.   The seat which Air Canada eventually used, based on the Rock seat, is called the “Solar Eclipse”.  On 23 September Ms Muklevicz, the Regional Sales Director of Air Canada, e-mailed Mr Higgins of Contour.  She said that Air Canada were “still very interested in either the Virgin Seat or the Rock seat, however, Robert Milton [the CEO of Air Canada] is finding it difficult to justify the VAA licensing fee”.  She asked for a price for the Rock seat and for help with speeding up its delivery.  At this stage, Mr Higgins was lukewarm about supplying Rock as opposed to UCS.  In his reply he proposed a number of modifications to the UCS in order to fit it onto a Boeing 767.  He also said that delivery of a UCS derivative would be quicker (by some six months) than the Rock seat.  At this stage, Cathay Pacific had not communicated a final decision about Rock; and if they had decided to select Rock, Contour had promised them exclusivity for twelve months.  Contour had not, however, given that reason to Air Canada.  On 29 September 2004 Mr Higgins sent Air Canada revised LOPAs.  These showed (among other things) the UCS at a different angle, which had the consequence that the ottoman size had to be reduced in order to accommodate an aisle width of 17”.  On 19 October 2004 Air Canada had a press launch for its new look, which included a new design and colour scheme for its fleet, new uniforms for its staff and new in flight entertainment systems.  It also said that it would proceed with the introduction of the newest generation of premium lie flat seating beginning as early as September 2005.  On 24 October 2004, a meeting was arranged in Canada between Air Canada and Virgin </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">Atlantic to discuss the licence arrangement.  The meeting went badly; and it seemed that the negotiations would flounder over the cost of the licence.  Until December 2004 Virgin Atlantic continued to attempt to persuade Air Canada to take the UCS.  Contour were also keen to help and offered a discount on the manufacturing price which would have amounted to some £3.75 million.  Nevertheless the price gap could not be bridged, and the negotiations failed.   </p>

He asked whether the angle of the Rock seat could be adjusted to allow for a 17 inch aisle, which could be a selling feature against the Virgin suite.  On the same day he sent Contour a preliminary drawing that he had produced himself with Virgin suite data that Contour had given him.  On 6 December Mr McKeever of Acumen was sent by Contour a .dxf file of the Virgin Atlantic LOPA for the A340300.  The significance of a .dxf file is that it enables a two-dimensional or threedimensional drawing produced on one CAD system to be read by another CAD system, and it contains digital data which can be manipulated (unlike a .pdf file which is simply a picture).  Mr Higgins accepted that it was quite wrong of Contour to have sent a .dxf file of Virgin Atlantic’s LOPA to Acumen.  In his reply of the same day Mr McKeever asked: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">A minute later Contour sent him all three.  These, however, were .pdf files.  In his oral evidence Mr McKeever said that he had heard that Air Canada had produced LOPAs with changes in the position of monuments; and that that is what he wanted to see.  He said that he had referred to these LOPAs as .pdfs “with the Virgin product” because this was shorthand for the latest LOPAs.  I found this evidence difficult to understand.  Air Canada was considering taking a licence for UCS, but that came to nothing.  UCS was never installed on Air Canada aircraft.  So any LOPAs produced with UCS were in the realms of theory only.  They were not LOPAs for aircraft that existed in the real world.  In fact Acumen already had LOPAs for Air Canada’s existing aircraft on their system.  Mr McKeever suggested that part of the exercise undertaken by Air Canada was to assimilate the layout of their various different types of aircraft, both for crew training and also for easier passenger orientation; and that when a new seat was installed this was an ideal time to make changes because the aircraft would be grounded for some time.  Even with this explanation I found it difficult to understand why Mr McKeever had specifically asked for files showing “the Virgin product”.  That said, there is no evidence that Mr McKeever actually made any use of these LOPAs, and I am not prepared to infer that he did.  At the stage that the designs had reached in December 2004 I cannot see how they would have been of any practical help; and although many more LOPAs were produced in the course of the project it was not demonstrated that any of them were copies of or influenced by the LOPAs sent in December. </p>

But for a brief to say that its objective was to produce a better product than the market leader does not lead to the inference that the market leader will be copied, particularly when the brief rejects one of its most striking and innovative features.   </p>

It described the product and the certification criteria which had to be satisfied.  Mr Higgins said that he expected that the basis of certification would be similar for the new seat and that “compliance would be shown by testing of the product plus similarity to the Virgin product where applicable (for instance performance of the airbag and occupant injury protection).” In fact it turned out that all the tests had to be carried out independently for the Solar Eclipse and that similarity to UCS could not be relied on to dispense with any testing.  Also in January 2005, following a presentation of the design for Solar Eclipse by Mr Higgins and representatives of Acumen,  Mr Gentry was appointed lead design engineer for the project, and Mr Allen also joined the design team to carry out work on the LOPAs.  Mr Gentry supplied him with a set of LOPAs that had been prepared by Acumen.  Throughout January Mr McKeever continued to refine work on the LOPAs.  Modifications included adjusting the aisle widths, making provision for trinket trays behind the seats, realigning seats to deal with changes in the position of monuments, and so on. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">mock up of Rock which Future Brand had compared with the UCS in actual service was not a fair comparison.  The mock up had been a spatial mock up only, and had not addressed matters of detailed styling.  That was yet to come; and Acumen had already come to the conclusion that the screen needed modification to reduce its bulk.  Mr Dryburgh explained that Future Brand were Air Canada’s consultants on colours and trim and that he regarded them as amateurs in the field of aircraft furniture design.  Although Acumen themselves had been coming to the view that the privacy screen was too bulky, he disagreed with the remainder of Future Brand’ comments.  However, Future Brand had the ear of some of the senior management within Air Canada, and carried political clout with the people who mattered.  Mr Dryburgh therefore felt that Acumen had at least to pay lip service to Future Brand’ comments.  But Mr Dryburgh resented having even to discuss UCS, and thought that Future Brand were obsessed with Virgin; and he was resistant to making changes simply to make Acumen’s design more similar to Virgin’s.  The frequent reference back to Virgin Atlantic’s UCS was by Air Canada was, however, understandable since they had been seriously interested in licensing its use.  It was therefore natural that when they were evaluating Acumen’s alternative design they were concerned that it should outdo UCS.  Mr Dryburgh accepted this, and that is why he thought that UCS was a natural comparator.  What, however, he adamantly refused to accept was Mr Meade’s suggestion that Air Canada’s instruction was to “take UCS” and seek to improve it with better or additional features. </p>

He noticed a discrepancy in relation to the Airbus A330.  Air Canada had specified monuments at a height of 39”.  But when Mr Allen checked the design data he had received from Acumen, he noticed that the screen height was 43”.  He mentioned this to Mr Gentry.  There was thus a potential clash between the two heights.  Mr Gentry asked him to recheck it.  Mr Allen offered the suggestion that the 39” mentioned in the monument specification might have been measured from a different point, which would have explained the discrepancy.  He thought that the height in the monument specification would have to be amended, although that was a matter for Air Canada.  He also thought that the height of 43” was more consistent with the physical mock-up that he had seen.  Mr Higgins commented on 1 February that “per previous discussions” the screen height should be “as Malcolm is at the area adjacent to the passenger in order to minimise risk on occupant safety testing”.  Mr Allen checked the height of the UCS screen, probably from 2-D drawings in Contour’s digital library, and reported that it was 40.7” above the plinth.  He attached drawings illustrating how the height of the Solar Eclipse screen could be lowered to conform to the height of the UCS screen.  In elevation the top edge of the privacy screen was broadly horizontal from the interface with the principal seat to the point at which it began to wrap round the ottoman.  From there it curved downwards before meeting a short vertical downstand.  The illustrations that Mr Allen produced were plainly not styling drawings, not least because they simply took a slice from the top of the screen which cut through the housing for the IFE monitor.  Mr Allen commented to Mr Gentry that, as Mr Gentry had suspected, a reduction in height would mean that the position of the monitor would have to be lowered.  What ultimately happened was that the height of the monuments was reduced to 41”; and they were slightly recessed in order to accommodate a 43” screen.  The screen itself was not lowered to the same height as UCS. </p>

To make the Acumen design “more virginesque” would therefore entail removing part of the screen altogether and, perhaps, having a separate ottoman with its own backshield.  The design team resisted this.  Thus when on the following day Acumen provided Contour with two new series of redesigns, Mr McKeever said in his covering e-mail: </p>

Acumen were quite irritated at having to produce two series of redesigns and hoped that Air Canada would choose one of the second series; and that is what happened.  Air Canada preferred what was called “Concept 3”.  This design retained the privacy screen that wrapped around the back of the ottoman.  The covering e-mail, in my judgment, shows two things which corroborate the evidence given by Mr Dryburgh and Mr McKeever.  The first is that Future Brand’s suggestion was (or was understood by Acumen at the time to be) moving towards a separate ottoman.  That is what “virginesque” or “a la virgin” meant in shorthand.  The other is that Acumen already had their own recommended approach for reducing the bulk of the screen where it wrapped round the ottoman.   </p>

It was attended by representatives of Contour, Acumen and Air Canada.  The meeting reviewed the mock ups which had been modified in the screen design.  Mr Dryburgh emphasised that Contour and Acumen had seat design expertise; and that Future Brand did not.  The meeting reviewed several styling concepts that Acumen had produced.  They discussed aisle width and noted that in plan view the Virgin aisle was narrower.  The day finished with a brainstorming session, which was later written up as part of the minutes of the meeting.  A significant part of the brainstorming session (to judge from the written record) was concerned with comparing Solar Eclipse with UCS.  The second day of the meeting was split into two.  One session considered issues of certification.  The other considered styling issues.   The overall purpose of the Camberley meeting was to prepare for another meeting with Air Canada in Montreal at which Acumen would have the chance to rebut Future Brand’s criticisms.   </p>

It began with a slide presentation by Contour of the advantages of the Solar Eclipse over the UCS.  These included:  wider aisles, wider access points from the aisle to the PAU; a longer suite; greater flexibility of the reclining seat; the provision of an adjustable leg rest; the provision of an electric pillow; the ability to turn the seat from seat mode into bed mode without the passenger having to get up from the seat; the ability to swivel the table so that a passenger could get out of his seat without having to stow the table; a greater volume of personal stowage space; dedicated laptop stowage; increased passenger protection from aisle traffic because of the integrated privacy screen and ottoman.  The advantages of UCS included a greater nominal seat width; a larger table; and a better headrest profile.  At the meeting Mr Bettell of Contour highlighted the benefits of the Solar Eclipse over UCS; and Mr Dryburgh presented in detail the differences between both and the reasons why the Solar Eclipse was designed in the way that it was and why it should remain as designed.  Despite Mr Dryburgh’s robust defence of Acumen’s design, it was decided that the screen shape would be reworked to provide more shoulder room.   </p>

But many of the examples he gave were of seats that were not fully flat beds (e.g.  Virgin Atlantic’s J2000), and he accepted in his oral evidence that in order to compete any new seat would have to be fully flat.  In cross-examination he also accepted that the conventional way of achieving this was by means of an ottoman or footrest.  Mr Moreno then suggested that the designer could use a fold down or powered ottoman.  In fact Acumen toyed with both of these; and as Professor Darbyshire pointed out a powered ottoman is likely to carry too much weight to be acceptable in business class.  Mr Moreno then pointed to a number of different shapes that had been used in designing ottomans.  But his examples were all outward facing herringbones or forward facing seating arrangements, where the design constraints are different.  This was an instance of Mr Moreno not giving sufficient weight to the practicalities of aircraft seating design as opposed to theoretical designs.  His approach in this respect significantly weakened the inference that he drew that what he saw as similarities could not be explained as the result of independent design choices. </p>

Part of the curve was also designed in order to blend with the tapered leg rest, which also had a curve.  When the design moved on from the Cathay Pacific pitch, the bed was lengthened slightly and this had knock-on effects on both the size of the cocktail table and the curve of the end of the ottoman where the radius was extended.

The ottoman (including its asymmetric shape) was always designed as fully integrated into the wrap-around privacy screen and unlike UCS was not conceived as a freestanding piece of furniture.  That part of the privacy screen that wrapped around the ottoman not only protected the passenger’s feet from aisle traffic, it also acted as the support for the cocktail tray of the next door passenger.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Dryburgh’s evidence was that a tapered ottoman was almost inevitable in an inward facing herringbone.  Whenever an ottoman is placed against an aisle or side wall, it has to be tapered in order to accommodate the straight line.  Professor Darbyshire broadly agreed.  He explained that it was almost essential to have an ottoman of some sort.  To try and achieve a flat bed using no more than a seat with an extendable leg rest was impractical.  First, the leg rest would have to cantilever so far that a robust (and heavy) mechanism would be needed to actuate it.  Second, the time that it would take to move the seat into bed mode (and vice versa) would be unacceptably long for a business class passenger.  Third, a cantilevered leg rest that did not protrude underneath the seat in front would be liable to be broken by someone standing or sitting on it.  Thus although it was a theoretical possibility it was a very unlikely design choice.  Professor Darbyshire then considered the shape of the ottoman.  His view was that although it was theoretically possible to have a symmetrical ottoman in an inward facing herringbone, it was a most unlikely choice for a designer who wanted to maximise the available bed space, to use the maximum space on the aircraft and at the same time meet regulatory requirements.  Thus an asymmetric curved ottoman was an obvious design choice given the constraints under which a designer of an inward facing herringbone was working.  One reason for this is that in the case of an ottoman bordering the aisle a curved end is likely to produce less disturbance for the passenger if the end of the ottoman is struck by a trolley being manoeuvred down the aisle.  In addition he considered that a competent designer did not choose the shape of the ottoman merely because it was aesthetically pleasing.  As he explained: </p>

Mr McKeever designed the height of the kick panel to correspond to the height of the cocktail table, the arm rest height and the top of the main table when stowed.  These correspondences between the kick panel and other elements of the PAU make it unlikely to have been copied from UCS.  None of the dimensions, radii or curvatures of the kick panel are the same as those of UCS.  In addition the overall shape of the curved top is similar to the freestanding backshield that Acumen presented to Cathay Pacific in April 2004.  Again Mr McKeever’s evidence on this </p>

As Professor Darbyshire explained UCS has a compound curve so that the screen curves both in horizontal section and also in a direction away from the passenger as one goes from the plinth upwards.  In other words in the vertical direction the UCS screen bends away from the passenger.  This gives the passenger a much greater feeling of space.  However, it is a much more complex screen to construct than one which is vertical with simple curves, like the Solar Eclipse screen.  He also pointed out that both the UCS screen and the Solar Eclipse screen had, in plan view, a curve which curves forward in the direction of flight in the area near the passenger’s head (albeit with different curves).  However, he demonstrated, convincingly to my mind, why the provision of a curve in that position in an inward facing herringbone would be obvious to any competent designer.  If the privacy screen were curved, a useful space would be created between the curve of the screen and the left of the passenger when seated, whereas if the screen were straight the same space would be behind the seat and essentially useless.   </p>

It is also taller than the UCS screen even after Future Brand’s intervention.  The UCS screen is continuously curved, whereas the Solar Eclipse screen begins as a curve, then becomes straight, but thickening in order to accommodate the monitor and table, and changes again into another curve in the opposite direction to the first curve to wrap round the ottoman.  The UCS screen ends just forward of the front edge of the seat pan and the ottoman backshield is a separate item.  As mentioned, the Solar Eclipse screen is integrated.  Moving up the screen from its interface with the plinth, the UCS screen is of a uniform thickness, whereas the Solar Eclipse screen changes with its height.  It incorporates projections and recesses at various heights.  Professor Darbyshire also pointed out that the actual curves of the UCS and the Solar Eclipse are different and considered that a designer who attempted to copy would make things more difficult for himself rather than easier. </p>

He wanted to make the screen as thin as possible, but had to thicken it in the central section to accommodate the monitor and table.  The outward face of the thickened section was angled towards the passenger so that it could accommodate the IFE handset and seat controls.  That central section has no curvature in order to maintain a constant tolerance between the deployed seat mechanism and bed cushions.  The height of the screen was determined by the size and number of components that it was required to house.  That was one reason why it was not possible to lower the height of the screen to the extent that Future Brand would have wished.  The screen was required to have a padded section on the top edge.  This was a regulatory requirement in order to prevent injury to passengers from head impact in the event of a crash. </p>

It is here I think that the elevations on which Virgin Atlantic relied give a misleading impression of the real article.

Acumen provided a number of different possibilities for Air Canada to choose from and in my judgment they were the product of independent design.  Mr Meade relied strongly on the statement by Air Canada that they wanted a more “virginesque” end to the screen.  But that overlooked a number of factors.  First, Acumen and Contour were very resistant to that suggestion and went out of their way to defend their design.  Second, Contour was alive to patent issues as one reason why Air Canada could not have a more “virginesque” design.  Third, the “virginesque” feature of the screen was that it did not wrap around the ottoman, and the wrap-around screen was retained in Acumen’s design.  Fourth, any attempt to incorporate a curve derived from the UCS screen would have aesthetically compromised the design.  Fifth, as Professor Darbyshire pointed out the transition from the mainly horizontal to the mainly vertical is often accomplished by a curve.  It is an obvious design choice.

Where the seating arrangement is an inwards facing herringbone, Mr Moreno also accepted that a privacy screen is required.  In the case of any seating arrangement which is not parallel to the seating tracks (which themselves are parallel to the longitudinal axis of the aircraft) a plinth is required in order to fix the seat and its accessories to the seating tracks.  So the mere existence of these features in Solar Eclipse is not evidence of copying:  it is evidence of satisfying commercial and regulatory requirements.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As I have said, in the case of angled seating a plinth is necessary.  The plinth in the present case was designed by Mr Allen.  The design of the plinth itself does not appear to have been any part of Acumen’s work, but was essentially an engineering issue.  In his report Mr Moreno did not give any evidence about the plinth or its significance.  In conceptual terms the Solar Eclipse plinth is different from the plinth in UCS.  Mr Allen explained this in his witness statement.  He said that the Solar Eclipse plinth operated on a different principle and was made to a different design as compared with the UCS plinth.  In the UCS, the primary fixing of the screen assembly and the rear console is to the seat structure itself, (rather than to the plinth), and it is the seat structure itself which is then fixed to the plinth.  The ottoman and ottoman backshield is an independent assembly which is independently fixed to the plinth.  In the Solar Eclipse, the seat structure attaches to the plinth separately to the other furniture in the unit, i.e.  the screen assembly and the rear console.  In addition the ottoman is a component of the screen assembly rather than being an independent assembly by itself.  The internal structure of the Solar Eclipse plinth did not use the same ‘hoop’ design as the UCS (which was a feature of the plinth design necessitated by the fact that the UCS ottoman had to be certified as a secondary seat).  The Solar Eclipse design only required a relatively low strength attachment for the ottoman as the attachment loads are shared with the screen assembly, which is also attached to another part of the plinth.  Once again this is unlike UCS where the screen assembly is attached to the side of the main seat structure and shares the same attachments to the plinth.  With no requirement for a high strength attachment for the ottoman the Solar Eclipse plinth employs a more open assembly of straight aluminium alloy structural beams arranged to provide maximum support to the seat only.  These are also much easier to manufacture than the curved composite beams used for the UCS hoop structure.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is not entirely clear what Virgin Atlantic’s case about the reading light is.  The suggestion that Mr Meade put to Mr McKeever in cross-examination is that this detail was copied from UCS when Acumen changed the original outward facing herringbone presented to Cathay Pacific in April 2005 to the inward facing herringbone presented in June.  In their final submissions Virgin Atlantic drew attention to what they said were differing accounts of how the final position of the reading light came to be determined.  In fact the accounts are not, to my mind, inconsistent at all.  The general location of the reading light on the screen to the left of the passenger (as opposed, for instance, to a light on a stalk) was a constant throughout Acumen’s design.  The precise location was partly influenced by wiring considerations.  In addition, there is no evidence that Acumen had access to the details of the UCS design (and the position of the reading light would not have been deducible from the Cathay Pacific LOPA, or, indeed from a genuine Virgin Atlantic LOPA).  As Professor Darbyshire pointed out positioning the light on the screen is an obvious place to put it.  Mr Moreno did not specifically comment on the reading light in his report.  However, he accepted in cross-examination that the shape of the elements housed in the Solar Eclipse screen (reading light, monitor and table) were of a different shape to the equivalent elements housed in the UCS screen and although some were in the same general area, they were in different positions.  Since the monitor has to be easily viewed and the table has to be used while the passenger is seated, it is not in the least surprising that they are in the same general positions. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The meeting of 8 and 10 March 2005 had established that there were to be no floor vents for decompression.  The venting was to be through the dados only.  In fact decompression vents in the floor would have been difficult (although not impossible) in the case of a seating system in which the seats were attached to plinths.  Venting via the dados made much better sense.  The same meeting had also recorded that “Virgin style” grilles were to be used.  Mr Gentry explained that the decompression vents are down at the interface between the floor of the aircraft and the side wall of the aircraft.   If you are going to put in a grille, the only way to get the air down to that vent is along the wall of the aircraft, downwards.   So it had to be in the position in which it was.  Decompression grilles were in a similar position in BA First and American Airlines.  Mr Meade relied in cross-examination on other PAU designs where a grille was concealed in the cabin furniture forming part of the PAU.  However, those designs were outward facing herringbones, where the cabin furniture was itself disposed along the sidewall of the aircraft.  Where the seating arrangement is an inward facing herringbone, all the cabin furniture is disposed inboard of the seat itself.  Thus such a solution is not practical.  Mr Moreno’s evidence in crossexamination was that the position of the decompression grilles was the “most convenient place” to put it.  I think he also grudgingly accepted that it was the “most </p>

One of his suggestions was that it could have been placed in the footwell.  Thus struck me as implausible, not least because a decompression grille in that area would be easily blocked.  Mr Moreno’s evidence on this question was unimpressive, and was one of the areas in which his lack of practical knowledge of the design of aircraft seating was most apparent.  Given the design of the other components of the PAU the position of the decompression units was the obvious choice.  It is possible that there could have been some fine tuning of the precise position of the grille, but general location was not an indication of copying. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Gentry explained the criteria for designing grilles.  If you imagine you have a throat for decompression which is, say, 100 square inches and that is the maximum air flow you can get through somewhere.   A grille has an efficiency, of say 70%.   So, therefore, if you cover that 100 square inch hole with a grille, you not getting 100 square inches.   You are only getting 70 square inches, but you may need all of that 100 square inches.  Accordingly in order to raise the efficiency of the grille you increase the surface area either by making the grille concave or by making it convex.  Contour had previous experience of concave grilles.  The problem was that with a concave grille there was a risk of debris accumulating in the cavity thus blocking the grille.  It was more sensible therefore to design a convex grille which reduced (even if it did not eliminate) that problem.   </p>

Accordingly any integer in that part of the claim cannot (or should not) be interpreted so as to claim some feature which is not found in the prior art.  In my judgment this overstates the effect of the division of the claim into these two parts.  The invention is defined by the claim:  not by a part of the claim.  The first sentence of rule 29 (1) makes this clear.  There is no requirement in rule 29 (1) that the characterising part of the claim should alone set out the inventive step.  I was not referred to any decision of the courts or the EPO to the contrary.

His reading of the patent in suit was conditioned by the instruction he had been given that it did not claim a flip-over seat.  Paradoxically, Mr Moreno’s comparative lack of experience in designing aircraft seating made him a better witness when it came to considering whether design changes were obvious.  When he considered the prior art citations in his written evidence he did so thoroughly and carefully.  His insistence, in relation to design right issues that a designer should avoid the conventional made him more susceptible to accept suggestions put to him in cross-examination about how a designer might “play about with” a piece of prior art.

Mr Moreno was, in my judgment, more equivocal about whether this was part of common general knowledge at the relevant date.  I am not persuaded that it was.  Thus I accept Mr Meade’s submission that although the idea of an inward facing herringbone may have been known it was not generally regarded as a good basis for further action.

The reason for the limitation is given by the patentee in paragraph [0005] of the specification, namely the publication after the filing date of the patent application of the American Airlines patent.  It was a novelty only citation.  The American Airlines patent disclosed a swivelling seat in an <span style="font-style:italic">outward</span> facing herringbone.  If Virgin Atlantic had intended the patent in suit not to encompass swivelling seats the swivelling feature of the seat, rather than the inward facing herringbone, would have been the obvious limitation to introduce into the claim applicable to the United Kingdom.  Since, however, Virgin Atlantic chose to limit the claim by reference to the inward facing herringbone rather than the swivelling seat, it must be inferred that swivelling seats were intended to be included in the claim. </p>

The conventional meaning of the word is “additionally”; and the context does not, to my mind, suggest that the patentee was using the word other than in its conventional meaning.  The fact that it is the seat unit, rather than the seat, which must “further” comprise the bed means seems to me to emphasise that the claim is speaking of something different from the seat itself.  I agree also with Contour that integer (e) also reinforces the impression that the bed means are not the same as the seat.  I also find it difficult to see how a simple reclining seat can extend the bed into an area behind the seat as claimed in integer (f).  This could only be achieved by reading additional words into the claim such as “the flat-bed extends into said rearward space (36) behind <span style="font-style:italic">the space that was occupied by</span> the seat <span style="font-style:italic">when in seat mode</span>”. </p>

Since one of the objectives of the interpretation of claims is to provide reasonable certainty for third parties, the way in which a real skilled third party interpreted the claim before any question of litigation arose is some indication of how the notional skilled reader would have understood it.  My construction also coincides with the interpretation given to the claim by Mr Chapman.  I should add that Mr Moreno had been instructed that the flip-over seat had been protected by a different patent; and so he approached the patent in suit on the basis of having been instructed that it did not bear the True Bed Meaning.  He did, however, agree that the patent was teaching that the disadvantage of a reclining seat not providing a flat surface could be overcome by the claimed invention.  That is some indication that, left to his own devices, he would have interpreted the patent in the way that I have.   </p>

This is consistent with the patent seeking to provide a high passenger density whilst also providing a substantially flat bed.  Thus if the seat when in bed mode uses any space between the sidewall of the aircraft and the seat back when in the upright position, it will fall within this integer.  This is illustrated by the BA First patent, and in particular by the cross section through the seat.  Figure 14 in the BA First patent shows the seat in seat mode. </p>

The foot-rest is not part of the seat itself, which claim 1 defines as consisting of the seat pan and the back-rest alone.  The foot rest is something that “is” positioned forwardly of the seat; not something which “is capable of being” positioned forwardly of the seat.  To my mind that suggests something which occupies a fixed position.  In addition the foot rest is introduced by paragraph [0022] of the specification.  That says: </p>

Each seat consists of a reclining seat, and extendable footrest, side privacy screen and a further privacy screen that wraps round from the front of the aisle.  The seats are swivelling seats.  The point of the swivel is that in take off and landing the seat is only slightly rotated so that “the inertia forces and accelerations … are not unpleasant for the passenger”.  The seat can then be rotated for the in-flight phase in order to provide adequate space for the lying function of the seat.  A significant proportion of the seat, when reclined, extended into the area between the aircraft sidewall and the seat back when in seat mode; but it was less than 50 per cent. </p>

This means not only that two adjacent passengers have to agree when to go to sleep, but also that when the seats are rotated into the sleeping position, the aisle all but disappears.  The patent portrays this as an improvement on BA First.  Mr Chapman had not picked that up when he read this citation, but fairly said that he “would have grinned” if he had.  It is impossible to imagine anyone in the real world taking this idea seriously, which may have a bearing when it comes to obviousness.  But buried away in the specification it is possible to find a disclosure of a single reclining pivotable seat.  Thus the patent explains: </p>

As an example, the advantages of the present invention will be gained by a first single seat unit rotated only sufficiently to allow the leg rests of said first seat or the legs of a passenger seated in said first seat to be extended into the aisle alongside a second seat positioned forward of said first seat.  Such a displacement resembles the fixed echelon position shown in [BA First].  However, the present invention offers the improvements of having additional aisle space available to aid passenger mobility during boarding, deplaning and meal service.” </p>

That is not an easy task.  Another is that where the skilled addressee is (or is a team that includes) a designer, to approach the prior art through the mind of an unimaginative designer is unreal.

If an expert approaches his own task in the manner set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Pozzoli</span>, he will almost inevitably expose himself to a charge of having approached the final question with the aid of hindsight.  That is indeed the charge that Mr Meade levelled at Mr Chapman.  To some extent that charge was made good by answers that Mr Chapman gave in cross-examination in which he accepted that he had not read the prior art with UCS out of his mind and simply asked himself what he would do with the disclosures of the prior art.  Instead what he had done was to isolate the differences between the cited prior art and the patent in suit and asked himself whether there was any technical reason not to make changes to the prior art to bring it closer to the patent in suit.  I say “to some extent” for two reasons.  First, there must be some direction given to an expert in his reading of the prior art, otherwise he will come up with modifications that are quite irrelevant to the dispute.  Second, Mr Chapman in fact began his report by setting out his initial reaction to the patent in suit (which he read before he had considered the prior art) with a view to explaining what the patent taught him that he did not already know.

Not only was this the result of BA’s research; it was confirmed by research carried out by United Airlines at about the same time.

Nevertheless it is convenient to take it together with Boeing, because Mr Vanhegan did not suggest that there was any material difference in their teaching.  Both used a swivel seat and neither had an ottoman.  Both taught that the swivel seat was an improvement over BA First; and that dispensing with the ottoman saved cabin space.  Airbus in particular taught that by using a swivel the pitch between seats could be made smaller, thus increasing cabin density. </p>

Mr Chapman said in crossexamination that there would be no reason to develop a seat that swivelled and then turn round and lock that out to make it fixed.  The only reason that he gave for removing the swivelling mechanism from an existing swivelling seat was that it would be worth saving the product if the swivel mechanism proved unreliable.  This evidence leads to the conclusion, in my judgment, that in the case of all the prior art citations where swivelling seats were used, it would not have been obvious to take out the swivel.   </p>

When the passenger wanted to sleep the seat could be turned outward in order to co-operate with an ottoman which supported the passenger’s feet.

They say that the priority documents and the parent patent application all claim a seating system in which a true bed is an essential component.  If the patent in suit claims a system without a true bed, then it has added matter.  It is, however, common ground that if the priority documents and the parent patent application disclose two discrete inventions (viz.  a true bed and a seating system with or without a true bed) then Virgin Atlantic were entitled to obtain two patents, one for each invention.  Mr Meade called these two inventions the “flip over seat” and the “space packing” inventions.  I will do the same. </p>

Although the details of these embodiments differ, the common thread is that in none of them does the seat pan form part of the bed.  Thus none of them describes a conventional reclining seat.

The use of the word “may”, Mr Meade said, showed that it was not necessary to have a flip over seat.  It is, I think, true that a flip over seat is not necessary to the invention.  The specification describes other forms of seat unit, including arrangements in which the passenger sleeps on the floor of the aircraft under the seat, but the common feature is that all of them use different surfaces in seat mode and bed mode respectively. </p>

Mr Vanhegan reasoned from this that the skilled addressee would therefore consider that all passenger accommodation units, seating systems and seat units described in the parent patent application were to be understood as comprising different surfaces which were used in seat mode compared to those used in bed mode.  I agree with this submission too.  Mr Meade’s contrary argument, in my judgment, paid far too little attention to the context in which the quoted passages on which he relied appeared.  As has often been said:  in law context is all.  It seems to me that the highest that Virgin Atlantic’s case can be put is that it would have been obvious to a skilled addressee, on reading the parent patent application, that the benefits of the described seating systems could have been transposed to a seating system in which the seats were conventional reclining seats.  But obviousness is not the same as disclosure. </p>
