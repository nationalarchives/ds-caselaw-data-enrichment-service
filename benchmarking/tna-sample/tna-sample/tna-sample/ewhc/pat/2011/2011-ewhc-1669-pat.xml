MedImmune is the exclusive licensee of the MRC’s interest in the Patents. MedImmune alleges that the First Defendant (“Novartis”) has infringed the Patents by sales of a pharmaceutical product whose international nonproprietary name is ranibizumab and which is sold under the trade mark Lucentis. Lucentis is approved for the treatment of an eye condition known as wet age-related macular degeneration, which can lead to loss of vision. Novartis disputes infringement and counterclaims for revocation of the Patents. The MRC has been joined to the claim so as to be bound by the result, but has not played an active part in the proceedings. Ranibizumab was developed by Genentech, Inc., which is not a party to the proceedings. </p>

Attention has focussed on the entitlement of the Patents to priority from the third of the priority documents listed above (“PD3”) since (a) MedImmune accepts that the Patents are invalid if they are not entitled to priority from that document and (b) Novartis does not rely upon any prior art which was made available to the public in the interval between the filing dates of the first and third priority documents. Novartis disputes both that the claimed inventions are disclosed by PD3 and that the Patentees have the right to claim priority from PD3. It became clear at an early stage of the trial, however, that the parties were not ready to contest the latter issue. Accordingly, it was agreed that that issue will be tried separately at a later date.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The structure of a protein can be considered at several levels. The primary structure is the linear sequence of amino acids. The secondary structure can be described as the physical appearance of individual sections (or segments) of the linear chain that arrange themselves in a particular way. These “arrangements” include so-called alpha helices (where the sequence forms a spiral formation in a given segment) or beta sheets (where the sequence forms into a series of hairpin loops in a given segment). These segments will be linked by intervening turns. These elements of secondary structure further fold upon themselves to create the tertiary structure which packs together the secondary structures and the amino acid side chains into stable structures known as domains. Essentially, a polypeptide chain folds down on itself to create as compact and as organised a structure as possible with the linear sequence of amino acids it contains (different amino acid residues favour different secondary structures and the side chain groups dictate the interactions that create the tertiary structure). Hence, the structure of a protein is largely dictated by its sequence of amino acids.  </p>

The exact sequences of the re-arranged genes vary from one antibody to another due to random selection of the mini-genes to be rearranged. In particular, this re-arrangement affects mini-genes that encode one of the complementary-determining regions or CDRs (as to which, see below) of antibodies, enabling a huge diversity in the sequences of these CDRs. The combination of different pairs of heavy and light chains (again, see below) also increases the diversity of the repertoire.

The immune system operates to improve the antibody’s ability to recognise and bind to antigen by further diversifying the B-cell clone that expresses the selected antibody. During this diversification the genes encoding the variable domains (see below) are mutated in many locations simultaneously (or “hyper-mutated”) to produce a range of antibodies. The higher affinity antibody-producing clones are favoured. In this way the affinity of the antibody response to the antigen is increased in a process called “affinity maturation”.

Thus, for example, a human being will have a large number of antibodies in his bloodstream, depending on the foreign materials (e.g. bacteria and viruses) which he has had to raise immune defences to. This will include many IgG molecules. The constant regions in one such molecule will be substantially identical to the constant regions in all the other IgG molecules his B lymphocytes produce. But the variable regions of the antibodies made to defend against, say, whooping cough will differ from the variable regions of the antibodies made to defend against, say, mumps. Indeed, because most foreign proteins have more than one epitope and the body’s defence mechanism will make antibodies against most of them, and because that mechanism is likely to make a number of different antibodies against each antigen, there will be a number of antibodies for each foreign protein, and each of them will have variable domains which differ from the variable domains of the other antibodies. It is the ability of an immune system to make variations in the variable domains which contributes to its ability to create bespoke antibodies which lock onto single epitopes.   </p>

A second antibody that binds to the antigen and which is linked to a reporter enzyme is then added to report the binding and therefore the presence of antigen. Alternatively, ELISA can be used to detect antibodies, in which case the antigen of interest is bound to a plate. A sample containing antibody of interest is then added, the desired antibody binds to the fixed antigen, and then a secondary reporter antibody is used to bind to and detect the presence of the first antibody.

The second option is to immunise the mouse first, and then extract the serum.

In 1990 an established technique for doing this was a method called “replica platelift”. In this method, the vector containing DNA for each member of the library is inserted into bacteria, which are spread onto a plate containing an appropriate growth medium. The bacteria grow into colonies, each colony expressing that particular member of the library in large quantities. Once the colonies have grown, a nitrocellulose filter is overlaid and the proteins of interest in each colony stick to the nitrocellulose and then can be probed with antibody or antigen probes (depending on whether it was an antigen or antibody library). Bound molecules can be detected by autoradiography. Clones showing a positive signal can simply be cut out and re-plated to grow more colonies and amplify the clone (and also separate out the desired clone from any others that may have also been accidentally re-plated). A variant of this technique involves plating out the bacteria at sufficiently high dilution for a uniform lawn of bacteria to grow, which is then pockmocked with holes (“plaques”) where the bacteria have been killed by bacteriophage (as to which, see below). This variant was known as “plaque lift”. </p>

They consist of a protein coat (capsid) encapsulating nucleic acid.  Many types of phage have been identified, studied and used in the laboratory. Each class of phage has different properties making them useful for different purposes.  Phage can have RNA or DNA genomes which may be in single- or double- stranded form.  Two classes are used in particular: (a) the lytic phage such as lambda (a well-known example of which is <span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:18.5pt;font-family:'Segoe UI Symbol'">λ</span>gt11) and T4, so called since they burst open (“lyse”) the bacterial host cells following replication to release the phage particles into the environment for infection of new hosts; and (b) filamentous phage (which do not lyse their host cells and are filament-like in structure) such as fd (or Fd) and M13. </p>

Monovalent display means that, statistically, of those phage expressing a fusion protein the majority only have a single copy present. In practice, if a population of phage is produced for monovalent display, about 10% of phage particles will display one copy of the fusion protein, a very small percentage will display two copies and the majority of particles will only have wild type coat protein (i.e. will be “bald” phage).</p>

How much easier phage display is than plaque lift is a matter of dispute to which I must return later. Secondly, the antibody is physically associated with nucleic acid encoding its sequence which is contained within the phage upon which the antibody fragment is displayed (this is sometimes referred to as “preserving the genotype-phenotype link”).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In my judgment the evidence in the present case shows that real research teams in the field to which the Patents are directed were teams of the kind contended for by Novartis. “Antibody engineering” was the title of an address by Dr Winter to the Royal Society in 1989 in which he discussed the both current state of the art and future directions (<span style="font-style:italic">Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. </span>B 324, 537-547 (1989)). He concluded with a section on “exploitation of antibody engineering” in which he described the </p>

The Banbury Conference in April 1990 was an early academic conference in the field, which was attended by some scientists whose interests extended beyond it; but the field was sufficiently well-established for the first commercial conference to be staged by IBC later that year. In 1990 the three leading teams in the field of antibody engineering were probably those led by Dr Winter at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology/CAT, by Professor Richard Lerner at the Scripps Research Institute (“Scripps”) and by Dr Andreas Plückthun at the Max-Planck-Institut für Biochemie, but there were others. Thus Professor Stefan Dübel (as to whom, see below) described himself as having “started research into antibody engineering and phage display” at the Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (“DKFZ”) in 1989. There were also a number of commercial enterprises in the field, for example at Genentech, Genex Corporation (“Genex”) and International Genetic Engineering, Inc. Furthermore, by July 1990 both SmithKline Beecham and Genetics Institute had placed advertisements in <span style="font-style:italic">Science</span> for “antibody engineers” and someone skilled in “antibody engineering/protein chemistry/cell biology” respectively. Indeed, it is noticeable that Dr Teillaud himself used the expression “antibody engineering” no less than three times when summarising “the antibody landscape as at July 1990” in his first report. Finally, I would add that in my view the specifications of the Patents are consistent with this characterisation of the skilled team.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The identification of the skilled team to which the Patents are addressed as corresponding in terms of its combined expertise with that of the actual teams in the field of antibody engineering leads on to a further point, as to which there is no real issue between the parties, but perhaps a difference of emphasis. As Novartis accepts, teams such as those at the MRC/CAT and Scripps included inventive people, but the notional skilled team from whose perspective the obviousness or otherwise of the Patents must be considered is deemed to lack inventive capacity. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In this connection counsel for MedImmune cited a long passage from <span style="font-style:italic">Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office</span> (6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> ed) at pages 182-184 headed “Definition of the person skilled in the art in the field of biotechnology”. In my view this passage must be treated with a little care since, as counsel for MedImmune accepted, it mixes statements of principle with statements based on the facts of individual cases whose priority dates go back as far as 1978. By November 1990, the field of biotechnology was much more firmly established than it was in 1978. Nevertheless, I accept that the tenor of the Boards of Appeal’s case law in this field is to distinguish between “routine experimental work” which does not require invention and “scientific research” which does, as can be seen from the following extract: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Expert witnesses in patent litigation stand in a rather unusual position. They are generally leading scientists or engineers in the field in question. Frequently they are academics. Sometimes they are consultants. In most cases, they will not have given expert evidence in patent litigation before, although there are exceptions to this. Not only that, but also they will generally have little experience of the patent system. Where do they have experience, it will generally be as inventors named on patents. As such, they may have had scientific input, but generally they will have learnt little about patent law in the process. In some fields, they may also be accustomed to using patents and patent applications as sources of technical information, but again without necessarily understanding much about patents themselves. When asked to prepare an expert report in a patent case, they will have to consider such questions as the identity and attributes of the person skilled in the art to whom the patent is addressed, the common general knowledge of the skilled person and whether something would or would not be obvious to that person in the light of particular prior art given the constraints imposed by the law of obviousness. Usually, this is not a task of which </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">For these reasons expert witnesses in patent actions require a high level of instruction by the lawyers. Furthermore, even if they are experienced authors, they need considerable assistance from the lawyers in drafting their report. In practice, most expert reports in patent cases are drafted by the lawyers on the basis of what the expert has told them and the draft is then amended by the expert. This, of course, requires the lawyers to understand what the expert is saying. It follows that the drafting of an expert’s report in a patent action involves a steep learning curve for both the expert and the lawyers. The lawyers are learning the technology and the expert is learning enough of the law to understand the questions he must address. It follows that a high degree of consultation between the expert and the lawyers is required. Frequently, the preparation of the report will involve an iterative process through a number of drafts. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is obvious that this process entails a risk of loss of objectivity on the part of the expert even if the expert is striving to remain independent and impartial. It is therefore crucial that the lawyers involved should keep the expert’s need to remain objective at the forefront of their minds at all times. If they cause or allow the expert to lose his objectivity, they are doing both the expert and their client a disservice. They are doing the expert a disservice because he may be subject to criticism during crossexamination and in the court’s judgment as a result. They are doing the client a disservice because partisan expert evidence is almost always exposed as such in crossexamination, which is likely to reduce, if not eliminate, the value of the evidence to the client’s case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I will illustrate this point by reference to two common traps for the unwary. The first lies in discussing the prior art. The expert will generally be asked by the party instructing him to express an opinion as to whether taking a particular step would or would not have been obvious to the skilled person at the relevant date in the light of certain prior art. Suppose the instructing party contends that the step would be obvious. The lawyers show the expert the prior art after having carefully explained to him the correct approach to this question, and ask him for his opinion. The expert expresses his genuine, independent and impartial opinion that taking the step would indeed have been obvious. Then the lawyers assist the expert to draft a report expressing that opinion. When drafting such a report, there is a natural tendency to focus on the parts of the prior art document which support the opinion which the expert holds. It is often the case, however, that there are parts of the document which point the other way or might be thought to point the other way or are equivocal. (Otherwise, it is unlikely that there will be a dispute.) It is important that the lawyers bring home to the expert the need to give a balanced account of the document in his report. The expert may think, for example, that such a passage is ambiguous and therefore best ignored; but if those instructing him allow him to pass over that passage in silence in his report, the inevitable consequence is that he will be confronted with that passage in cross-examination, asked why he did not mention in his report and accused of failing in his duty to the court. </p>

For example, he may have published a paper commenting on the invention or have been a named inventor on a patent application claiming a similar invention filed before or after the one in suit or he may even have given evidence in some form (such as a declaration filed with a patent office). The lawyers who are instructing the expert should make sure that the expert discloses such contributions and, where appropriate, explains them in his report. I am not suggesting that it is incumbent on the expert to carry out a search for such documents, merely that the expert should reveal what he is aware of. It should be brought home to the expert that the lawyers for the opposing party are likely to comb through his published papers and other publicly accessible records (such as patent office files); and that, if they find something relevant that has not been disclosed by the expert in his report, then the expert may be accused in cross-examination of failing in his duty to the court if it appears to favour the opposing party. If this is not made clear to the expert by those instructing him, then the expert may find himself in an uncomfortable position even though he had thought he was complying with his duty to the court (e.g. because he thought at the time of preparing the report that the material was not significant). </p>

It is regrettably true that from time to time an expert witness does succumb to the temptation of giving partisan evidence, and that is clearly unacceptable. But I wish to emphasise that the lawyers who instruct expert witnesses bear a heavy responsibility for ensuring that an expert witness is not put in a position where he can be made to appear to have failed in his duty to the court even though he conscientiously believes that he has complied with that duty. It is also important that courts should be cautious about criticising an expert witness purely on the basis of omissions from his report unless it is clear that the fault lies with the expert rather than those instructing him, bearing in mind that the court will not usually be privy to the expert’s full instructions (whatever may be the effect of CPR r. 35.10(4), which it is not necessary to go into for present purposes).                                    </p>

It is unfortunate that his report was not drafted in a manner which reflected this. For example, the report contained a lengthy and detailed consideration of the Patents before turning to a relatively short consideration of the priority documents.

In about December 1990 he read McCafferty and was “extremely excited” by it. As a result he attended a workshop on “Expression of heterologous proteins in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells” at INSERM in January 1992 which included a lecture by Dr Andrew Griffiths of the MRC/CAT team which published McCafferty. Following this, he attended a three week practical course at the MRC in September 1992, where he was intensively trained in generating scFv and in building a phage library for scFv. As a result of this experience, he “became convinced that the filamentous phage technique was a powerful and elegant technique for the selection of antibodies and antibody variants”. Subsequently, he sent a post-doctoral student to work in Dr Winter’s laboratory and organised a workshop at INSERM in March 1994, at which both Dr Winter and Dr Plückthun gave lectures. </p>

Not only that, but in addition he was drawn into the field by reading McCafferty and acquired all his initial experience from or with the MRC/CAT team. As with Professor Brammar, therefore, while Dr Teillaud’s evidence was of assistance to me in understanding the technical issues, it did not necessarily reflect the perspective of the skilled team, or even that of a member of the skilled team whose background was in immunology.    </p>

Although his English is fairly good, I did not always find him easy to follow either live or when reading the transcript. In assessing his evidence, I have made allowance for the fact that he was not giving evidence in his mother tongue and for my own difficulties in comprehension. Even making full allowance for those factors, however, I have to say that found him to have a tendency at times not to answer the questions put to him and to be slightly argumentative. Nevertheless, I am sure that he was doing his best to assist the court. </p>

Professor Brammar said in his first report that he agreed with this. Despite this, their reports did not really read as those of members of a team addressing separate areas of specialisation. Rather, each approached all the issues in the case from his own perspective with only occasional cross-references to what the other had to say.    </p>

Furthermore, although MedImmune’s team provided Dr Huse with no less than three bundles of documents which were proposed to be put to Dr Huse (on the evening of Sunday 16 May with Dr Huse beginning his oral evidence on Tuesday 17 May), the document which counsel was relying on was neither included </p>

In my view this error was avoidable and unfortunate, and I accept that it may have unsettled the witness and that due allowance must be made for this in assessing his evidence. I do not consider, however, that it meant that the cross-examination was unfair. Still less do I consider that the other matters relied on meant that the cross-examination was unfair. On the contrary, I consider that the cross-examination was conducted with courtesy and sensitivity and that the questions put to Dr Huse dealt with matters which it was counsel’s duty to investigate. </p>

So far as this is concerned, Dr Huse accepted during cross-examination that he had failed in his duty in leaving this passage out. His explanation was that he regarded the paragraph in question as ambiguous, that he did not agree with the concerns which on one view were raised in it and that he had advised Novartis’ representatives that Professor Smith should be asked about it. Counsel for MedImmune submitted that this explanation should be rejected as completely implausible, but when he put to this to Dr Huse in crossexamination Dr Huse stood by his explanation. I see no reason to believe that Dr Huse was lying about this. Counsel for Novartis submitted that, notwithstanding his admission in cross-examination, Dr Huse had not failed in his duty to the court, because he had in fact addressed the points which MedImmune rely on the passage as supporting elsewhere in his report (namely, in the context of discussing various comments made about Professor Smith’s work in the Patents). Counsel for Novartis also submitted that the cross-examination was based, and Dr Huse’s admission extracted, on an unfair premise given the evidence of Professor Brammar and Dr Teillaud about the passage in question during cross-examination. I do not accept the latter point, because Dr Huse signed his first report long before those witnesses gave evidence. </p>

The fault may have lain with the lawyers who assisted him to draft his report or there may have been a misunderstanding between Dr Huse and the lawyers. Given that he regarded the passage as ambiguous, and had told Novartis’ representatives of that opinion, Dr Huse may have received the impression that it was unnecessary for him to refer to the passage, and sufficient to deal with the substance of the points in the way in which he did.  </p>

The story which emerged in cross-examination was of some complexity, and I am not entirely confident that even now I have the whole picture. On any view, the fault for this cannot be laid wholly at the door of the witness: in addition to the error made by counsel to which I have referred above, the crossexamination was further marred by the fact that the granted patent which was put to Dr Huse was not included in the cross-examination bundles either and was only produced on the third morning of the cross-examination. </p>

This activity included filing continuations in the US, filing foreign applications, trying to persuade examiners of the patentability of the inventions and filing submissions in response to oppositions by four opponents (including CAT) to AME’s European Patent No 0 550 645 in which it was argued that the combination of Parmley &amp; Smith with Huse (as to which, see below) did not render antibody phage display obvious. Dr Huse’s evidence was to the effect that this was a business decision on the part of AME and his only involvement was to provide scientific input when called upon to do so. He also said that, after AME had been taken over by Eli Lilly in 2004, the patents and applications were abandoned on his advice. When it was pointed out to Dr Huse that US Patent No 6,893,845 had been granted to AME in May 2005 with a broad claim 1 (corresponding to claim 1 of the original application but with two additional limitations, the main one being to expression of “a fusion protein with the protein product of gene VIII of a filamentous phage”), he expressed surprise. As he explained in re-examination, however, claim 8 of this patent (corresponding to claim 16 of the original application with some additional limitations) was directed to what he had always regarded as being inventive. </p>

Dr Huse disputed this when it was put to him in cross-examination, saying he had tried to put himself in the position of the skilled person. I accept that he did his best to do this. As I shall explain in more detail below, however, Dr Huse had arrived at the invention even before reading Parmley &amp; Smith (let alone hearing Professor Smith’s talk at the Banbury Conference). It inevitably follows that his perspective was different to that of the addressee, and I do not think he was entirely successful in distinguishing between the two. I have borne this in mind in assessing his evidence, but I do not accept that it renders Dr Huse’s opinions worthless, as counsel for MedImmune submitted. </p>

As stated there, phage display was initially developed by Professor Smith. During the period prior to the filing of PD3, he published three papers on the technique. At the beginning of the trial it was Novartis’ position that Professor Smith’s work on phage display, including the gist of at least the first two papers, was common general knowledge. MedImmune disputed this. In closing submissions, Novartis maintained that the basic concept of phage display at a high level would have been common general knowledge, but did not press the contention that any more than that was. MedImmune disputed that even the basic concept was common general knowledge. I agree with Novartis on this point for reasons I will explain later. I also agree with Novartis, however, that it does not matter if MedImmune is right. This is nevertheless a convenient juncture at which to introduce Professor Smith’s work. I will have to return to this in more detail when describing the prior art relied on by Novartis and when discussing the case on obviousness.   </p>

The foreign amino acids are displayed on the surface, allowing fusion phage bearing antigenic determinants from a target gene to be purified in infectious form by affinity to antibody directed against the gene product. Here we introduce fusion-phage vectors that accept foreign DNA inserts with little effect on phage function; and describe affinity purification of virions bearing a target determinant from a 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">8</span> fold excess of phage not bearing the determinant, using minute amounts of antibody. These ‘antibody-selectable’ vectors are a promising alternative to conventional expression systems for using antibodies to clone genes, though the ability to isolate rare clones from actual libraries remains to be demonstrated.” </p>

For example, large separate heavy and light chain libraries have been produced from immunized mice and combined together in a random combinatorial manner prior to screening (Huse, W.D. et al., 1989, Science 246, 1275- 1281). Crucially however, the information held within each cell, namely the specific combination of one light chain with one heavy chain, is lost. This loses most, if not all, of the advantage gained by using immunization protocols in the animal. Currently, only libraries derived from single heavy chain variable domains (dAbs; Ward, E.S., et a1., 1989, supra.) do not suffer this drawback, but because not all antibody heavy chain variable regions are capable of binding antigen, more have to be screened. </p>

The intention of this was that, if the displayed antibody fragments retained their specificity, they would stick to the bound antigen. The plates were then washed (to remove unbound phage) and a sheep anti-phage antibody added (which should stick if the phage has stuck to the antigen). This is followed with a biotinylated anti-sheep antibody (which should stick to the sheep anti-phage antibody which in turn is bound to the antigen on the plate). Finally, a streptavidin/horseradish peroxidase complex is added (which should bind to biotinylated antibody through the streptavidin). After washing away unbound enzyme, the amount of bound phage is measured by looking at the increase in optical density of the plate upon incubation with a chromogenic substrate of peroxidase, which is proportional to the activity of the enzyme.  </p>

Thirdly, and as follows from the first two points, there is no example of the use of a phagemid incorporating the heavy and light chain genes of a Fab fragment.

The applicants have realised and demonstrated that in many cases phagemids will be preferred to phage for cloning antibodies because it is easier to use them to generate more comprehensive libraries of the immune repertoire. This is because the phagemid DNA is approximately 100 times more efficient than bacteriophage DNA in transforming bacteria (see example 15). Also, the use of phagemids gives the ability to vary the number of gene III binding molecule fusion proteins displayed on the surface of the bacteriophage (see example 13). For example, in a system comprising a bacterial cell containing a phagemid encoding a gene III fusion protein and infected with a helper phage, induction of expression of the gene III fusion protein to different extents, will determine the number of gene III fusion proteins present in the space defined between the inner and outer bacterial membranes following superinfection. This will determine the ratio of gene III fusion protein to native gene III protein displayed by the assembled phage. </p>

In some cases however, it will be important to display all the gene III molecules derived by superinfection of cells containing phagemids to have fusions (e.g. for selecting low affinity binding molecules or improving sensitivity on ELlSA). One way to do this is to superinfect with a bacteriophage which contains a defective gene Ill. The applicants have therefore developed and used a phage which is deleted in gene Ill.

Peptides can adopt a range of structures which can be different when in free solution, than when bound to, for example, an antibody, or when forming part of a protein (Stanfield, R.1. et al., (1990) Science 248, p712-719). Proteins in general have a well defined tertiary structure and perform their biological function only when adopting this structure. For example, the structure of the antibody D1.3 has been solved in the free form and when bound to antigen (Bhat, T.N. et al., (1990) Nature 347, p483-485). The gross structure of the protein is identical in each instance with only minor variations around the binding site for the antigen. Other proteins have more substantial conformation changes on binding of ligand, for instance the enzymes hexokinase and pyruvate dehydrogenase during their catalytic cycle,<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller;font-family:Arial"> </span>but they still retain their overall pattern of folding. This structural integrity is not confined to whole proteins, but is exhibited by protein domains. This leads to the concept of a folded unit which is part of a protein, often a domain, which has a well defined primary, secondary and tertiary structure and which retains the same overall folding pattern whether binding to a binding partner or not.

It is therefore envisaged that the majority of the resulting pUC 119 phage particles will have fewer gene III-antibody fusion molecules on their surface than is the case for purely phage system described for instance in example 2.

Previous studies had defined these positions as playing a major role in the differences of affinity of the D1.3 antibody for HEL and TEL. Three phage libraries differing by the number of mutated residues and/or their positions were prepared, mixed, and affinity-purified using TEL-Sepharose. Second and third rounds of adsorption/elution were performed and colonies derived from the last round tested by ELlSA for TEL and HEL binders.

Before turning to the issues, two points which are common ground should be noted. The first is that the claim is limited to use of phagemids (see integer [4] and [0145] of the specification). The second is that the claim covers the case where the range of binding specificities from which a desired specificity is selected consists of two binding specificities.      </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Integer [2] of claim 5 of 511 requires that the first step of the method should consist of “producing a population of filamentous bacteriophage particles displaying at their surface a population of binding molecules having a range of binding specificities”. The issue is as to the meaning of the words “a range of binding specificities”. Novartis contends that the skilled reader would understand the words “a range of binding specificities” to mean a range of specificities to different antigens, but not to cover a range of affinities for a single antigen. By contrast, MedImmune contends that the skilled reader would understand the words to encompass a range of affinities to a single antigen. It should be noted that this issue does not arise in relation to claim 1 of 777, since that contains the words “a range of binding properties”, and it is common ground that “a range of binding properties” includes a range of affinities to a single antigen. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In my judgment Novartis’ construction is the correct one for the following reasons. First, “specificity” is a term of art with a clear meaning in this field as I have explained above. So too is “affinity”. The skilled team would approach the Patents with those meanings firmly established in their minds as part of their common general knowledge. The skilled team would note that the specification of 511 uses the words “specificity” and “affinity” a large number of times and that on each occasion the words appear to be used in accordance with their conventional meanings. Indeed, the very first use of the word “specificity” in paragraph [0002] of 511 refers to the “high specificity to a given antigen” of monoclonal antibodies. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, the skilled team would be well aware that “specificity” and “affinity” are different properties of an antibody. Counsel for MedImmune pointed out that the two properties are closely related to each other. That is true, but nevertheless they are conceptually and practically distinct. The skilled team would note that the specification is clearly intending to distinguish between these two properties when it refers sometimes to “specificity” and sometimes to “affinity”. In these circumstances the skilled team would consider that the Patentees’ choice of the word “specificities” in claim 5 was deliberate and intended to reflect this distinction.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Thirdly, the skilled team would note that the specification twice refers to “different specificities” when describing the problems with the prior art which the invention aims to address. The first time is in paragraph [0009] (corresponding to the passage at page 3 lines 3-19 of PD3 quoted in paragraph 176 above). This paragraph is clearly referring to the problem of isolating a “desired specificity” from a repertoire of “different specificities”.  The second time is in the last sentence of paragraph [0013] (corresponding to the passage at page 4 lines 29-30 of the PD3, which is the last sentence quoted in paragraph 177 above). This clearly refers to the problem of screening “many different specificities”. The same point is repeated in paragraph [0014]. There is nothing in these passages of the specification to suggest that the Patentees are using the words “different specificities” as meaning anything other than specificities to different antigens. Again, this would confirm the skilled team in their understanding as to the reason for the use of the word “specificities” in the claim. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Fourthly, the skilled team would note that the specification says in paragraph [0025] that, if the problem of inserting a protein into a phage in such a way that the protein retains its biological activity can be solved for antibody molecules and fragments, it should provide a general method for “any biomolecule which is a member of a specific binding pair”. This is defined in [0052] as a pair that “have the property of binding specifically to each other”. Thus in generalising beyond antibodies, the Patentees use the same language and the same concept. </p>

This is reflected in a number of passages in the specification, among which I will mention four in particular. The first is in paragraph [0034], where, after describing two ways of creating a library having 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">14</span> combinations of heavy and light chains, the specification states: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">MedImmune’s argument to the contrary starts from the proposition that antibody phage display works purely on the basis of binding to the antigen that is being used to pan the library. Furthermore, when screening a library for binding to an antigen of interest, there is no interest in antibody specificities other than binding to that antigen of interest. This is true whether the library is created <span style="font-style:italic">in vitro</span> by mutagenesis or created from an animal (whether naive or immunised). As it was put in crossexamination and argument, phage bearing antibodies with other specificities than the one of interest “go down the sink”. In my view this point has little bearing on the present issue. It does not alter the fact that, as explained above, a key aspect of the invention is the ability to select an antibody which is specific to the antigen of interest from amongst a potentially large number of antibodies which are specific to other antigens.     </p>

It simply reflects the relationship between specificity and affinity as explained above. </p>

In the case of Example 28, this appears to be what is envisaged in [0396] (quoted in paragraph 239 above). Example 29 is concerned generally with increasing antibody diversity. While it talks about improving affinity as well as specificity, there is nothing to indicate that the Patentees contemplate selection merely on the basis of affinity as opposed to specificity. The best example from MedImmune’s perspective is Example 35, since it involves changing the affinity of a particular binding molecule to a particular antigen, but again there is nothing to indicate that the Patentees contemplate selection merely on the basis of affinity as opposed to specificity. </p>

Counsel for MedImmune pointed out that at [0145] the specification draws attention to the fact that the claims are restricted to phagemids, but in my view this would not make the skilled team think this was the only respect in which the claims were narrower than the disclosure of the specification. For example, claim 5 is also limited to Fab antibody fragments (see integer [5]), but the use of other fragments is disclosed (notably scFv fragments), yet there is no statement equivalent to that in [0145]. </p>

For that purpose, one would use the normal helper phage set-up. To pick out a low affinity antibody, however, there is an advantage to using the gene III deleted helper phage because that gives the most copies of the antibody on the surface and hence, it may be hoped, the highest apparent affinity.

The first is the passage in [0017] quoted in paragraph 217 above. This passage distinguishes the invention from the disclosure of Bass and the application by Protein Engineering Corporation (“Ladner”). In relation to Bass, it says that “a functional copy of gene III was always present in addition”. In relation to Ladner, it says “some unaltered gene III protein will be present”. It then says: </p>

Although counsel for MedImmune submitted that Novartis’s interpretation of integer [4] involved “mutilating the language” of it, it seems to me to be a perfectly natural reading. Nor was he  able to offer a coherent alternative reading of the language. Furthermore, he had no convincing response to the points made by Novartis in relation to the three passages referred to above. He did argue that the skilled team would expect that, if the Patentees wanted to restrict the claims to gene III deletion helper phage, the claims would say so in terms rather than in a roundabout way. I am unimpressed with this argument, however. First, the fact that the limitation could have been more clearly expressed is not persuasive. Secondly, the restriction to phagemids is itself expressed in a somewhat oblique manner. Thirdly, the claim does not explicitly refer to the helper phage at all. Fourthly, on Novartis’ construction the wording does have the result of confining the claim to the use of gene III deletion helper phage. </p>

The bald particles, (i) and (ii), will fall through the column, be washed down the sink, and are of no interest to someone implementing the invention. Those containing helper phage genome (i) and (iii), are not useful and fall out of the picture upon further passage through bacteria or upon characterisation of their DNA. Again, therefore, they are of no interest to the scientist. Thus from a technical perspective, it will be apparent to the skilled person that the only particles of interest are class (iv). </p>

Furthermore, MedImmune says that there is an alternative reading of the claim which avoids this difficulty and does no violence to the language. This is that the population referred to in integer [2] consists of just the class (iv) particles. In those circumstances, it will be the case that “each” particle in that population contains a phagemid genome encoding the binding molecule displayed by the particle on its surface as required by integer [4]. In addition, this reading of the claim is supported by the open language of “comprises” in integer [1], which admits of the possibility that other types of particles are also produced.               </p>

Secondly, there is no hint in the lengthy and detailed specification that the claim is to be read in the way suggested by MedImmune. Thirdly, if the claim is construed in this way, it means that there is no reference in the claim to the starting population, which would be strange. Fourthly, if the skilled team reads integer [2] as restricted to class (iv), it comes close to making integer [4] superfluous. Fifthly, I am unimpressed by the point about “comprises”, which simply allows for the possibility of additional steps in the method. Sixthly and most importantly, this argument does not really provide an answer to Novartis’ submission that the three passages in the specification discussed above clearly point to the claims being limited to the use of gene III deletion helper phage.                <span style="text-decoration:underline">Construction of claim 1 of 777</span></p>

Thus the skilled team would be aware that the Nterminus is needed for infectivity, and the C-terminus for morphogenesis. Furthermore, the skilled team would know that, when a phagemid system is used, the infectivity function of gene III will be provided by the wild-type gene III from the helper phage. They would appreciate that the only function that need be provided by the gene III fusion is the morphogenetic function of integrating the fusion into the phage coat. As Dr Logtenberg accepted, the skilled reader would therefore have understood that, if a truncated gene III protein which contained a C-terminal domain but not an N-terminal domain were used for the fusion, the wild-type copy would provide infectivity and the fusion to the truncated gene III protein would be displayed. In short, if the skilled team addressed its mind to this scenario, it would realise that it would make no difference to the way in which the invention worked if such a truncated gene III protein were used instead of a complete gene III protein. </p>

In the end, however, I am not quite persuaded by it for the fourth and sixth reasons given by Novartis. Given that the focus of 777 is phage, rather than phagemid, that use of just a C-terminal fragment would not work in phage and that there is nothing in the specification to suggest that use of such a fragment is contemplated, I do not consider that the skilled team would think that the Patentees intended to claim use of such a fragment.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">First, Novartis contends that PD3 does not expressly or implicitly disclose a filamentous bacteriophage particle containing a phagemid genome comprising nucleic acid with a nucleotide sequence encoding a Fab antibody molecule expressed from the nucleic acid and displayed by the particle at its surface as required by integers [3] and [4] of claim 5. There are two aspects to this contention. First, does PD3 disclose the use of a phagemid at all? Secondly, even if it does disclose the use of a phagemid, does it disclose the use of a phagemid to display a Fab fragment? In a nutshell, MedImmune contends that the use of a phagemid is disclosed in Example 1, specifically in the passage at page 25 lines 4-14 quoted in paragraph 195 above, and that the use of a phagemid to display a Fab fragment is disclosed in Example 7 when read in the light of Example 1. It is convenient to deal with these points in turn. </p>

As I have already said, the meaning of the paragraph at page 25 lines 4-14 is heavily disputed. There is no dispute that the passage is disclosing at least one alternative to the use of the two phage vectors described earlier in Example 1. A key point of dispute is whether the skilled team would read it as disclosing a single alternative or two separate alternatives or to be unclear in this respect. MedImmune says it discloses two separate alternatives (although on closer examination the first of these itself contains two alternatives), whereas Novartis says that it discloses a single alternative or at least is unclear. (I note that in the Patents, the passage in question was amended and divided into two paragraphs ([0236]-[0237] in 511), making it clear that there are indeed two alternatives. This is strictly irrelevant to the issue under consideration, however.)  </p>

Accordingly, MedImmune says that the skilled team would read the sentence beginning “For example” as disclosing a first alternative before the semi-colon and a second and separate alternative after the semi-colon.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I do not find these arguments persuasive. The fact that the document says alternative constructions will be apparent does not necessarily mean that the document is going on to give multiple examples. It could equally well give a single example. As for the semi-colon, a semi-colon is normally used to divide the items in a list when the list is introduced a colon. There is neither a colon in the sentence starting “For example”, nor any syntactical indication that it contains a list of items. Accordingly, I consider that the natural reading is that the semi-colon is being used as a punctuation mark which joins two linked statements. As a matter of punctuation and syntax, therefore, I prefer Novartis’ reading. At the very least, the passage is poorly expressed if it is intended to convey two separate alternatives.</p>

Therefore the next question is whether it makes technical sense to read the sentence in question as disclosing a single alternative, even if that is what the punctuation and syntax appear to indicate. Here I think MedImmune is on stronger ground. MedImmune says that the skilled team would conclude that the sentence made technical sense if read as disclosing two separate alternatives, but not if read as disclosing a single alternative. </p>

It is furthermore a problem discussed in PD3, but which is avoided by the use of fd-tet, as the readers of the document would understand. The sentence first suggests that M13 could be modified to avoid cell death. Professor Brammar’s evidence was that one way of doing this would be to make the same alteration to M13 as was made to fd to make fd-tet. The sentence then goes on to suggest that the host bacteria could be modified to avoid cell death. Professor Brammar’s evidence was that one way to do this would be to select for mutants of the <span style="font-style:italic">E. coli</span> host that are able to survive infection by a potentially lethal filamentous phage derivative. </p>

In addition to reading the sentence as a single whole, he was troubled by the reference here to “its gene III”. As he pointed out, this appears to refer back to “host bacteria” as well “M13”, but the host bacteria do not have gene III. MedImmune tries to answer this by saying it is obvious from the syntax that “its” relates back to the M13, since “its” is repeated and since “its” is singular but “bacteria” is plural. To my mind this is not obvious, and is another instance of the passage being badly written. Given that it does not make technical sense for “its gene III” to refer back to “host bacteria”, however, I consider that the skilled team would conclude that, although badly written, the first part of the sentence is conveying the two alternatives described in paragraph 311 above. I should make it clear for the avoidance of doubt that I do not consider that it discloses the particular implementations of those ideas described by Professor Brammar.  </p>

Cell death is not an issue in this scenario, because the helper phage has a wild-type copy of all the phage genes. Furthermore, MedImmune says that even if the skilled team found this passage as a whole less then completely clear, they would at least find the reference to pUC119/M13K07 clear. As all the experts agreed, that was a commonly used system in 1990. This would fit with the earlier statement that “alternative constructions will be apparent”.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Again, Dr Logtenberg’s difficulty with this reading was really linguistic rather than technical. As he pointed out, this part of the sentence begins “the modified fd gene III”, which appears to suggest an antecedent before the semi-colon, consistently with the use of the semi-colon. Again, as a matter of language I am sympathetic to this, but it does not make technical sense. From a technical perspective, the skilled team would appreciate that the authors must be referring back to what has been described previously in the specification and that they are referring to the antibody/gene III fusion. Next, as Professor Brammar accepted, the reference to “other modified protein” is somewhat confusing, since gene III is not a protein. But this is explicable on the basis that the authors mean a modified gene encoding another protein. Although it was suggested to Professor Brammar that the reference to “modified phage such as K07” was also confusing, he did not agree since M13K07 is indeed an example of a modified phage. Another point which I think Professor Brammar did accept is that the reference to “phage antibody genome” is somewhat inconsistent, since strictly it should say “phagemid antibody genome” if a use of phagemid is what is intended, particularly having regard to the definition of “phage antibody” given in PD3 page 6 lines 15-22 (quoted in paragraph 181 above) and the fact that a phagemid is not a virus. Given the clear reference to the pUC119 phagemid, however, I consider that the skilled team would conclude that this was merely loose use of language, consistently with the other infelicities in this passage I have noted. </p>

Nor was it an interpretation which counsel for Novartis pursued in his closing submissions.

The first is a decision of the Opposition Division dated 15 April 2002 on oppositions by four opponents (including, as noted above, Dyax Corporation) to 877. The Opposition Division held at [20.4] that “those embodiments of claim 1 relating to the use of phagemids and corresponding helper phages for phage construction … are disclosed in an enabling way in the first priority document”, specifically a passage at pages 2021 corresponding to the disputed passage in PD3. This supports MedImmune’s position, but it is difficult to place much weight on it for three reasons. First, it appears from the decision at [9.2(a)] that the opponents’ argument was that the disclosure of phagemid and helper phage was not an enabling one rather than that they were not clearly disclosed at all. The Opposition Division held that the disclosure was enabling since the pUC119/M13K07 system was common general knowledge. Secondly, the Opposition Division only quoted and considered the part of the key sentence after the semi-colon. This in itself removes much of the potential ambiguity in the passage. Thirdly, it is not apparent that the Opposition Division had the benefit of the evidence and argument on this point which I received.</p>

In those proceedings CAT relied on the Application as a novelty-destroying citation pursuant to Article 54(3) EPC. For this purpose CAT needed to establish that the Application was entitled to priority from the fifth priority document filed on 15 May 1991 (“PD5”). In this context there was an issue as to whether the disclosure of the Application and of PD5 was limited to five specific phagemids mentioned in them. The Board held that the disclosure extended beyond the five specific phagemids. In this context the Board said at [14.1] that it was important that at the end of Example 1 “the reader of [the Application] is informed in general that plasmids with a single strand replication origin, such as pUC119, represent a logical alternative in the structure. These vectors … are known as phagemid vectors”. The Board went on to note that the passages which supported this interpretation were also present in PD5. Although this decision again supports MedImmune’s position, it is even more difficult to place weight on it for the following reasons. First, there was no issue as to priority from the earlier priority documents, and in particular PD3. Secondly, on any view PD5 contains much more </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Novartis’ second objection arises out the introduction of the definition of the term “derivative”, which features in integers [4] and [5] of claim 8 of 511 and integers [11] and [13] of claim 1 of 777, in the Patents. Novartis contends that the introduction of the definition in and of itself broadened the scope of the invention. More particularly, Novartis contends that a specific instance of such broadening is that the Patents disclose and cover post-phage display mutation of the antibody fragment (i.e. by mutagenesis of the encoding DNA), when this is not disclosed by PD3. Although these points are closely related, it is convenient to consider them separately. </p>

It is also common ground that the definition of “derivative” in the Patents (at [0083] in 511, quoted in paragraph 219 above) is a very broad one.  Dr Teillaud’s evidence was that, at its broadest, the term “derivative” covered any molecule which was derived from the parent polypeptide, even including a molecule in which every single amino acid in the original polypeptide had been changed. As I understood him, he interpreted the definition in the Patent as extending that far as well. </p>

Surprisingly, the parties’ positions are the converse of this. Novartis’ position is that, in the general context of binding molecules such as antibodies, “derivative” was a term of art in 1990 which, absent anything in the specific context to indicate to the contrary, would be understood by the skilled team to indicate that the binding molecule had been altered in a manner which did not alter its binding properties.

Furthermore, there was a minor difference between Dr Huse and Dr Logtenberg as to whether the term would include removal of a glycosylation site, which on Novartis’ definition should really be excluded.

In my judgment this does not necessarily follow. It depends on how the word “derivative” would be understood by the skilled team in the context of PD3. If the skilled team would understand “derivative” in the context of PD3 to be intended to have a very broad meaning, then the introduction of the definition would make no change of substance to the disclosure. In order to demonstrate that there is a difference of substance, Novartis needs to show that the consequence of the introduction of the definition in the Patents, either by itself or in combination with other new matter, is to disclose something material to the invention which is not disclosed by PD3.

The first part of the paper after the summary quoted there is an introduction at pages 205-206. This begins with the observation that protein-encoding genes are routinely isolated from recombinant DNA libraries of 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">5</span> -<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"> </span>10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">6</span> clones in vectors such as lambda phage, using antibodies to screen plaques for the target antigen. It identifies two limitations with this: rare sequences are easily missed, and screening libraries larger than 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">6</span> clones is “an arduous undertaking”. The paper says it describes a class of filamentous phage vectors with the promise of isolating target clones from libraries of 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">9</span> clones. This is achieved by the use of “fusion phage”, first described in Smith, in which foreign DNA fragments are expressed as part of a fusion protein on the surface of the virions. Fusion phage bearing a specific target antigen can be selected by affinity to an antibody directed to that antigen much more easily and effectively than conventional screening of large numbers of clones. </p>

It then says that the paper reports improvements in the design of fusionphage vectors and in the method of affinity purification. The vector design was improved in two ways. First, the cloning site was moved from between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains, to 2-3 amino acids in from the N-terminal end, leaving the majority of the gene III sequence uninterrupted. Second, the parent vector used was fd-tet phage. A number of advantages stemming from these improvements are identified, in particular a reduction of the effect of inserts on pIII function. The procedure for affinity purification was improved by reacting the phage library with biotinylated antibody directed against the target gene product and then “panning” it on a streptavidin-coated plate. The authors call this “biopanning”, and say that it allows isolation of phage carrying a target insert from a mock library containing a 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">8</span> fold excess of phage without the insert. </p>

I also have construed the claims. For the purpose of considering obviousness, however, I think this is a case where it is useful to concentrate on the core inventive concept, which is the way in which both sides argued it. In this connection, it should be noted that MedImmune does not contend that claims 6, 7 or 8 of 511 are independently valid over claim 5, and accordingly it is only necessary to consider claim 5. Nor does MedImmune contend that claim 1 of 777 is inventive if claim 5 of 511 is not. Nor did MedImmune suggest that the limitations in claim 5 of 511 to phagemids and Fab fragments mattered for the purposes of obviousness. Nor did MedImmune suggest that it made any difference if I construed the claims as being limited to gene III deleted helper phage, as I have. Accordingly, the core inventive concept can be summarised as a method consisting of two steps: (i) producing a population of phage particles displaying at their surface binding molecules having a range of binding specificities wherein each particle contains nucleic acid encoding the binding molecule; and (ii) selecting particles displaying a binding molecule with a desired specificity by contacting the population of particles with a target epitope or antigen to which the binding molecule of interest binds. </p>

By that time Professor Smith had published Smith, Parmley &amp; Smith and Scott &amp; Smith. Counsel for MedImmune submitted that phage display was an unproven technique in November 1990, and no one had done anything of practical utility with it. I do not accept this. As counsel for Novartis pointed out, in addition to Professor Smith’s work, at least three other groups had published work on phage display by November 1990: de la Cruz <span style="font-style:italic">et al </span>(at the USA’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases),<span style="font-size:18pt"> </span>“Immunogenicity and epitope mapping of foreign sequences via genetically engineered filamentous phage”, <span style="font-style:italic">J.

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,</span> 87, 6378-6382 (August 1990). Furthermore, it is clear from the evidence discussed below that other groups were using the technique, including in relation to antibodies, but had not yet published their work. Accordingly, as I have previously said, it is likely that skilled teams in the field of antibody engineering were aware of the basic concept of phage display. In any event, I consider that the evidence shows that phage display was an established technique, although it is fair to say that it was not in routine use as at November 1990.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The second concerns the extent to which there was a need for an improved screening system for antibodies in 1990, and hence a motive to find one. Dr Huse gave evidence that it was possible to screen large libraries using plaque lift, whereas Professor Brammar’s evidence was that this was burdensome. While Dr Huse’s evidence is supported by the views expressed in Huse, looking at the evidence as a whole it seems to me that Parmley &amp; Smith is more representative of the skilled team’s attitude when it describes screening a library of 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">5</span>-10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">6</span> clones as “an arduous undertaking”. Furthermore, plaque lift did not give one direct access to the encoding DNA for the protein of interest. Thus I consider that PD3 and the Patents are accurate in saying that there was a need for a better screening system, and hence a motive to find one. Against this, counsel for MedImmune relied on evidence given by Dr Huse to the effect that the skilled team would hesitate before using a new screening system in preference to the tried and tested one. No doubt this is so, but it is beside the point if the skilled team is considering whether a proposal for a new technique is reasonably likely to work.  </p>

There is very little evidence on this topic. Although it is not the case that antibody phage display was the only available solution in November 1990, it appears that there were relatively few other potential solutions to the problem.         </p>

I nevertheless consider that it is important to consider it before turning to consider the Banbury Conference. This is for three reasons. First, Professor Smith’s talk built on Parmley &amp; Smith. Secondly, it is common ground that, if the skilled team were to consider implementing the proposal made by Professor Smith at the Banbury Conference, they would read Parmley &amp; Smith before going further if they were not already acquainted with it. Thirdly, Parmley &amp; Smith is central both to one of MedImmune’s attacks on Dr Huse’s objectivity and more generally to Dr Huse’s reasoning on the question of obviousness. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The following points should be noted about the disclosure of Parmley &amp; Smith. First, the authors’ underlying objective was to clone genes. The idea was that by the antigen-antibody binding one could pick out the DNA for the gene encoding the protein to which one had the antibody. Since the authors only used part of the coding sequence for the protein of interest, however, it would still be necessary to use that to probe a DNA library to obtain the complete sequence. On the other hand, the main focus of the paper is the improved fusion phage vectors and the improved affinity purification method. As the paper makes clear, the potential applications of these improved techniques go beyond cloning genes. In particular, the paper suggests that they could be used to create and screen an epitope library. </p>

Dr Huse’s evidence was that he got the idea in about the second half of 1988 from the combination of Smith (which discloses phage display) and Better (which discloses bacterial expression of Fab in the periplasm). As counsel for MedImmune pointed out, this is quite a leap. Furthermore, as I have commented above, it inevitably made it difficult for Dr Huse to read Parmley &amp; Smith through the eyes of an uninventive skilled person who had not had the idea before reading it. On the other hand, it does not necessarily invalidate Dr Huse’s analysis of the scientific content of Parmley &amp; Smith.

I do not accept this. It is true that in his report Dr Huse said that he had “been discussing early ideas for antibody libraries at around that time” and that it was apparent to him that phage display would be useful in that context, but (a) he did not refer to any of the library papers, (b) Dr Huse  started work on combinatorial libraries at Scripps in 1989 and (c) I do not read the sentence in question as saying that this made antibody phage display obvious, rather that it was an obvious application of it.

First, Professor Smith explicitly proposed phage display of antibodies. Secondly, he stated that he was going to try this approach by attempting to express an scFv on pIII. Thirdly, he discussed the possible problems that might be encountered, and potential solutions to those problems if they were. In particular, he discussed the possibility that the protein might not fold correctly, and a potential solution if it turned out that it did not. Fourthly, he suggested that (contrary to the view taken in Parmley &amp; Smith) breakdown might actually assist the experimenter rather than represent a problem.  </p>

Moreover, as counsel for MedImmune himself pointed out in another context, although the focus of the conference was “cloning the immune response”, some of those attending had wider interests. Furthermore, at least one of the attendees, namely Dr Huse, had already had the idea of antibody phage display. Yet further, another attendee, Dr Angray Kang, had either already started work on it or started shortly afterwards, as I shall discuss below. In any event, the fact that Professor Smith told the audience that he was going to do the experiment would be a sufficient explanation for none of them duplicating his effort. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">So far as the first point is concerned, Professor Smith explained that he had read Bird within days of publication on 21 October 1988. At that time, he was well aware of the work of Dr Winter’s group at the MRC/CAT, Professor Lerner’s group at Scripps and others to express recombinant antibody genes in bacterial hosts. One of the goals of that work was to be able to screen libraries of recombinant antibodies for the ability to bind any given antigen. The recombinant antibody constructs in that work were large (at least about 500 amino acids) and involved two polypeptide chains. Single-chain antibodies, in contrast, were much shorter (only about 250 amino acids) and comprised only one polypeptide chain. It was immediately apparent to Professor Smith that such simplified antibodies might be successfully displayed on phage display vectors such as fUSE5. Libraries of such constructs might be screened with immobilised antigen selectors, using the same affinity-selection approach that had worked in the case of phage peptide libraries. Affinity selection would substantially expand the scale on which recombinant antibodies could be screened compared to the screening approaches then in use. This provided a strong motivation to use larger inserts than Professor Smith had used in Parmley &amp; Smith, and he did not consider the recommendation he had made there against using larger inserts to be a deterrent. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Counsel for MedImmune submitted that these statements showed that Professor Smith was planning a substantial, lengthy and speculative research project, and thus that he himself did not have a reasonable expectation of success within a reasonable time frame. I do not accept this. These statements were made on 1 November 1988, some 18 months before Professor Smith’s talk at the Banbury Conference. By the time of the Conference, he had not only done further work on phage display (namely the Scott &amp; Smith work), his grant application having been successful, but also he had had more time to think his idea through. Moreover, the statements must be read in context. As can be seen from the quotation in paragraph 425 above, and is clearer still from the passages which precede it, Professor Smith was frustrated by refusal of his previous application, which had resulted in his laboratory being unfunded for over a year. It is clear that he did not think that the concerns raised by the reviewers had been scientifically well-founded. Although Professor Smith accepted in cross-examination that the project described in the application was speculative, at least so far as the antibody phage display was concerned, it appears from the document that it was the reviewers who had described his epitope library proposal as speculative, and that at the time Professor Smith did not agree with this. Finally, the time scale envisaged is clearly driven both by Professor Smith’s need for funding, particularly given the consequences of the refusal of the previous application, such as the need to train a new technician, and by the “much curtailed budget”, which only allowed for one research assistant. It also reflects the fact that he intended first to work on the epitope library, as indeed he did, and that at the end of the five years he hoped to be screening large libraries with multiple antigens. </p>

It remains the case, however, that he specifically addressed this concern in his talk, that it did not discourage him from carrying out the experiment and that he conveyed to the audience that it did not discourage him. Non-specific stickiness was another matter which he had in mind as being a potential challenge.

The project was started by a graduate student in the summer of 1990, and then carried on by Professor Smith himself with the assistance of a technician. Counsel for MedImmune understandably relied on Professor Smith’s explanation that he did not assign it to a PhD student because it was “pretty speculative” whereas “you want to give PhD projects that are a little surer than this was”. In some ways this is the best piece of evidence in MedImmune’s favour, but again it must be taken in context. I understood Professor Smith to mean that he would want to assign a project to a PhD student which was more clearly certain of success. (It appears that he did not have a post-doctoral student available to do the work at the time.) Professor Smith accepted that he could not confidently say in advance, “Oh yes, that is going to work”; but equally he was clear that he thought that there was reasonable likelihood of success. </p>

(It should be noted that four laboratory notebooks containing details of Professor Smith’s work during this period were lost by the US postal service later in the 1990s. This is one of the few experiments for which some records survive.) This experiment involved the antifluorescein scFv clone which Professor Smith had obtained from Genex and a mutant which did not bind fluorescein. Professor Smith panned these with fluorescein and rhodamine. The experiment was a success in that it showed that the fusion phage with the anti-fluorescein scFv was able to bind specifically to fluorescein rather than rhodamine, while the mutant did not bind to fluorescein.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Professor Smith’s evidence was that he was disappointed with the results, in that the discrimination between specific and non-specific binding was only about 100-fold. Professor Smith was disappointed because he had obtained higher levels of discrimination with his phage epitopes: he had obtained 1000-fold enrichment in Smith, and up to a million-fold subsequently. The fact remains, however, that the experiment worked. Furthermore, the claims of the Patents do not require any particular level of discrimination. Indeed, the result is very comparable to Examples 4 and 6 in the Patents, in both of which there is quite a lot of background noise. Although the experiment is not strictly comparable to Example 10, the level of enrichment achieved in the latter after one round of purification was only one order of magnitude better. Moreover, the first round experiment did not work when the initial ratio was 1:2.5 x 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">6</span>, but only when it was lower. In saying this, I am not overlooking the fact that Professor Smith’s experiment did not quite arrive at implementing the core inventive concept, since it does not appear to have involved selection by binding from a population with a range of specificities (or at least it is not clear that it did). It nevertheless demonstrated the principle of antibody phage display. </p>

It appears that this application was a continuation in part of an application filed by Charles Ladner and others of Genex in February 1987. Subsequently, for reasons that are unclear, Professor Smith was asked by Genex, and agreed, to become a co-applicant. In about 1991, Genex’s patent portfolio was acquired by Enzon, Inc. The declaration was submitted by Enzon’s attorneys in connection with a response to a rejection of the application by the examiner. Some time after 1995 the application was abandoned.

After George Smith's work displaying epitopes on phage for screening of epitope libraries with specific antibodies, the idea that antibodies, instead of epitopes, could be screened in this way seemed to us to be a straight-forward step to take at the time. All the essential elements of the techniques we proposed to use had already been published. For example, Plückthun and Skerra had already<span style="font-size:11pt"> </span>shown expression of soluble antibody fragments in E.coli (assembly of Fv fragments in the periplasm, and later, Fab assembly in the periplasm).” </p>

They made various preparations, such as designing and building a PCR machine, designing and creating oligonucleotide primers, isolating RNA from human blood and creating a cDNA library. They also requested antibody clones from both Dr Plückthun and Dr Winter, although they had no idea that anyone else was working on antibody phage display. Dr Winter sent them an anti-lysozyme scFv clone, although it was a lower affinity variant than the one they had requested. They used this as a model antibody in their experiments. </p>

By the middle of August 1990, they had created a phagemid vector and demonstrated the production of the scFv-pIII fusion protein. The phagemid vector was based on pUC119 with additional sequences coding for the scFv and gene III protein from M13 phage incorporated. Following the teaching of Parmley &amp; Smith, they inserted the antibody genes at 5’ end of the gene III sequence, so that the scFv was expressed at the N terminus of the gene III protein. By January 1991 they had successfully enriched the correct phage out of a large excess of other phage on a matrix presenting the antigen. </p>

Novartis submitted a witness statement from Dr Kang which dealt very briefly with this topic, and MedImmune did not require him to attend for cross-examination. All Dr Kang says that is that, in 1990 and early 1991, he worked in a team in the area of phage display and antibody engineering. Specifically, the team worked on assembling combinatorial Fab libraries on phage surfaces using phagemid vectors with helper phage rescue to select combinatorial Fab fused to gene VIII protein. This work was completed by late February 1991 and is described in a paper submitted on 6 March 1991: Kang et al, “Linkage of recognition and replication functions by assembling combinatorial antibody Fab libraries along phage surfaces”, <span style="font-style:italic">Proc.

I think that in concentrating upon the question of whether Professor Murray's invention could, so to speak, deliver the goods across the full width of the patent or priority document, the courts and the E.P.O. allowed their attention to be diverted from what seems to me in this particular case the critical issue. It is not whether the claimed invention could deliver the goods, but whether the claims cover other ways in which they might be delivered: ways which owe nothing to the teaching of the patent or any principle which it disclosed. </p>

As it seems to me, it consisted in showing that despite the uncertainties which then existed over the DNA of the Dane particle - in particular, whether it included the antigen genes and whether it had introns - known recombinant techniques could nevertheless be used to make the antigens in a prokaryotic host cell. As I have said, I accept the judge's findings that the method was shown to be capable of making both antigens and I am willing to accept that it would work in any otherwise suitable host cell. Does this contribution justify a claim to a monopoly of <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> recombinant method of making the antigens? In my view it does not. The claimed invention is too broad. Its excessive breadth is due, not to the inability of the teaching to produce all the promised results, but to the fact that the same results could be produced by different means. Professor Murray had won a brilliant Napoleonic victory in cutting through the uncertainties which existed in his day to achieve the desired result. But his success did not in my view establish any new principle which his successors had to follow if they were to achieve the same results. The inventive step, as I have said, was the idea of trying to express unsequenced eukaryotic DNA in a prokaryotic host. Biogen 1 discloses that the way to do it is to choose the restriction enzymes likely to cleave the Dane particle DNA into the largest fragments. This, if anything, was the original element in what Professor Murray did. But once the DNA had been sequenced, no one would choose restriction enzymes on this basis. They would choose those which digested the sites closest to the relevant gene or the part of the gene which expressed an antigenic fragment of the polypeptide. The metaphor used by one of the witnesses was that before the genome had been sequenced everyone was working in the dark. Professor Murray invented a way of working with the genome in the dark. But he did not switch on the light and once the light was on his method was no longer needed. Nor, once they could use vectors for mammalian cells, would they be concerned with the same problem of introns which had so exercised those skilled in the art in 1978. Of course there might be other problems, but Biogen 1 did not teach how to solve them. The respondents Medeva, who use restriction enzymes based on knowledge of the HBV genome and mammalian host cells, owe nothing to Professor Murray's invention.” </p>

The patentee had obviously not tried the invention on every plasmid, every bacterial host or every sequence of exogenous DNA.

There is no dispute that the present description provides a disclosure of the production of human t-PA in a recombinant system. However, in the Board’s judgement, the examples and the information given are not sufficient to allow a person skilled in the art, using common general knowledge, to perform the invention without undue burden in the whole area claimed, especially in consideration of the broad functional meaning attributed to the quoted parameter. Claim 2 leaves the skilled addressee guessing as to whether any derivative of human t-PA which fulfils only one of the functions typical of this molecule is a derivative meant by the claim. In this respect, the Board, in line with the quoted case law, considers the patent in suit to be insufficient and thus to contravene the requirements of Article 83 EPC. Furthermore, the area covered by the claim is not clearly defined, which is contrary to the provisions of Article 84 EPC.” </p>

This was an appeal by Bayer from a refusal of the application by the Examining Division. The application was founded on an appreciation that soluble guanylate cyclase could be stimulated in a mechanism independent of acting on the enzyme’s heme group. A screening method was disclosed which enabled the skilled person to find other molecules that worked in this way. Bayer contended that broad patent protection was appropriate. Claim 1 was a second medical use claim to “Use of compounds, which are also capable of stimulating the soluble guanylate cyclase independently of the heme group in the enzyme, to manufacture medicaments for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders such as angina pectoris, ischaemia and cardiac insufficiency”.

It is convenient to consider the objection on the assumption (contrary to my conclusion) that the claims are to be construed as MedImmune contends. On this basis, as discussed above, the claims extend to post-phage display mutation of (i) identifying a target, (ii) making an antibody library, (iii) screening that library by phage display, (iv) mutating the antibody fragment that is identified by phage display to improve its binding properties and (v) making that mutant in a recombinant system. Novartis says that the technical contribution of the Patents lies solely in step (iii), and that the Patents teach the skilled team nothing about steps (i), (ii), (iv) or (v). Furthermore, Novartis says that, even so far as step (iii) is concerned, the technical contribution made by the Patents is merely that screening by phage display is faster and easier than screening by plaque lift.

The first is that one of the advantages of phage display is that it makes it easier to screen large libraries. This is only a benefit when screening large naïve (or possibly immunised) libraries for the purpose of identifying new specificities. There is no need to screen a large library if all one is seeking to do is to improve the affinity of an antibody which has already been identified. As discussed below, the largest library screened by Genentech in the development of ranibizumab was 3.2 x 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">6</span>.

At its core, it is a technique for selecting a binding molecule of interest from amongst a potentially large population of other binding molecules. The technique does not depend on the precise identity of the binding molecule. On the contrary, part of the usefulness of technique is that it can be applied to a diverse range of binding molecules, fragments and derivatives. Nor does the technique depend on the precise application which the user has in mind. Nor does implementation of the technique for the purpose of a new application involve undue burden on the part of the skilled team. I accept that affinity maturation is difficult and potentially burdensome, but the claims do not require the skilled team to carry out affinity maturation at all, nor if they do to improve the affinity of the binding molecule to any particular extent. It follows that the present case is not on all fours with T1063/06, as counsel for Novartis submitted, but clearly distinguishable from it. </p>

In case G1/93, <span style="font-style:italic">Advanced Semiconductor Products</span>, the Enlarged Board of Appeal of the EPO stated (at paragraph [9] of its reasons) that the idea underlying Art. 123(2) is that that an applicant should not be allowed to improve his position by adding subject matter not disclosed in the application as filed, which would give him an unwarranted advantage and could be damaging to the legal security of third parties relying on the content of the original application. At paragraph [16] it explained that whether an added feature which limits the scope of protection is contrary to Art. 123(2) must be determined from all the circumstances. If it provides a technical contribution to the subject matter of the claimed invention then it would give an unwarranted advantage to the patentee. If, on the other hand, the feature merely excludes protection for part of the subject matter of the claimed invention as covered by the application as filed, the adding of such a feature cannot reasonably be considered to give any unwarranted advantage to the applicant. Nor does it adversely affect the interests of third parties.  </p>

Nor would it have gained any benefit whatsoever from producing other specificities inadvertently. Dr Logtenberg’s acknowledgement that it was probable that one would find another specificity if one searched the entire universe of antigens, including everything on the moon, is not enough to show that in the real world, or California to be more precise, Genentech did in fact produce another specificity.

They admitted the manufacture in Germany and the importation into and sale in the United Kingdom of the allegedly infringing compact discs. It was agreed for the purpose of the applications that the defendants’ manufacturing process included steps as claimed in the patents. The metallic layer (referred to as the “father”) was then used to produce a number of positive impressions (“mothers”) each of which was used to produce a number of negative impressions (“sons”). These were then used in the pressing process by which the compact discs were mass-produced. The defendants contended that there had been no infringement because the discs were not obtained directly by means of the processes claimed in the patents as required by section 60(1)(c). Aldous J held that the actions were unsustainable and must be struck out. In reaching this conclusion, he relied in particular upon an article by the late Dr Karl Bruchhausen expounding German law on the point published in 1979, two lengthy extracts from which Aldous J quoted in his judgment at 495-497.

This desire to ensure that the patent proprietor gets his due reward for the disclosure of his invention when his invention is taken advantage of in the territory of his patent through the sale of the end products is perfectly legitimate and commendable.

The Registered Designs Act 1949 and its predecessors encouraged lawyers to consider a design as something complete in itself and distinct from any article, but from the point of view of a bit designer the design exists only as a depiction of a bit that is to be made and used. There is no doubt that the criterion with which the claimed method is concerned depend upon the bit shape as a whole (I shall discuss this further when I consider insufficiency) and it follows, it seems to me, that there is no intermediate between this method and the resulting bit, which is as much the direct product of the design process as it is the product of the manufacturing process of which the design is part.” </p>

Glyphosate (which is sold by Monsanto under the trade mark Roundup) is a non-selective herbicide which works by inhibiting the enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (“EPSPS”), which plays an important role in the growth of plants. The patent described a new class of EPSPS enzymes, referred to as “Class II enzymes”, which were not sensitive to glyphosate. Plants containing such enzymes survived the use of glyphosate, whilst weeds were destroyed. The genes encoding these Class II enzymes had been isolated from three different bacteria, one of which was <span style="font-style:italic">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</span> sp strain CP4. Monsanto had inserted the CP4 gene (or to be precise, a gene with a single mutation in it referred to as the “RuR EPSPS gene”) into the DNA of a soybean plant it had called Roundup Ready or RuR soybean plant. As a result, the RuR soybean plant produced a Class II EPSPS enzyme called CP4R (also known as CP4-EPSPS), which was glyphosate-resistant. The RuR soybean was cultivated on a large scale in Argentina, where there was no patent protection for the invention. Cargill bought soy beans grown from RuR seeds, from which they or others manufactured soy meal which they imported into the United Kingdom.

Mr Prescott and Mr Howe accepted that a product can be further processed without losing its identity, in which event it remains the product obtained directly by means of the patented process. The question whether it has lost its identity depends on whether it no longer retains its essential characteristics. It is only for that purpose that a consideration of essential characteristics is appropriate. There is no free-standing “essential characteristics” test. Mr Prescott and Mr Howe further submitted that here there is no identity between the masters and the finished discs. Father, mother and son are each separate products with identities different from that of the master. However you look at it, the finished discs cannot properly be described as products obtained directly by means of the patented processes.’ </p>

The products of many, if not most, intermediate processes in chemical cases will suffer that fate. I take it that prima facie the phrase ‘directly obtained by means of the process’ means ‘the immediate product of the process’, or, where the patented process is an intermediate stage in the manufacture of some ultimate product, that product, but only if the product of the intermediate process still retains its identity. In most cases, the assessment will be a matter of fact and degree but not always - <span style="font-style:italic">Pioneer v Warner</span> was a strike-out case.  </p>

So far as the allegation of infringement is concerned, it is defined by the method claim 14 (new claim 5). This opens with the words ‘a method of producing genetically transformed plants …’ and the steps of the method commence with the insertion into the genome of a plant cell a double-stranded recombinant DNA molecule having the prescribed characteristics. This is hardly an everyday operation: it will have been carried out only on the parent of every strain of Round Up Ready soybeans. In fact, it appears to have been done once so far as this action is concerned: the plant identified in Example 3 and Table X of the patent as 13640/40–3 is the parent of all Round Up Ready soybean plants….  </p>

The meal comes from beans produced by a plant which contained the Round Up Ready sequence. It was the sequence that made the invention patentable, and the sequence has survived. Even though the meal comes from beans which are not the beans from the plant which underwent the original transformation, that is enough. I think this has nothing to do with the product of the process at all. It might be extravagant to say that the generation of plants producing the beans from which the <span style="font-style:italic">Podhale </span>meal was manufactured did not have an atom in common with the original transformed plant, but it must be close to the truth. I think that Monsanto’s argument confuses the informational content of what passed between the generations (the Round Up Ready genomic sequence) with the product, which is just soybean meal with no special intrinsic characteristics from one of the generations of plants. Put another way, it is difficult to see how anything has survived into the meal if the sequence has not. It cannot be told apart from non-Round Up Ready meal unless it contains traces of the gene, in which case other claims are relevant. What has not survived is the original transformed plant. I should add that I think it is dangerous to talk of reproductive material having in some way passed between the generations. While no doubt some reproductive material does pass between the first and second generations the same material does not pass further. Copies pass thereafter.” </p>

While it is true that, as Warren J noted in <span style="font-style:italic">Monsanto v Cargill</span>, the Court of Appeal considered that the Düsseldorf Oberlandesgericht in 1977 had articulated the correct test, even if it had not correctly applied that test to the facts of the case and that the Düsseldorf Oberlandesgericht referred in this context to the inventive concept, there is no reason to think that the Düsseldorf Oberlandesgericht was referring to anything other than the inventive concept of the relevant claim. Furthermore, as Pumfrey J noted in <span style="font-style:italic">Monsanto v Cargill</span>, the Court of Appeal accepted a submission the starting point of which was the correct construction of the claim in issue. </p>

Novartis does not dispute that, if MedImmune is right on construction, then the invention of claim 5 of 511 and the corresponding part of claim 1 of 777 was used by Genentech to produce ranibizumab. What Novartis is really saying is that MedImmune should have to sue Genentech for patent infringement in the USA, rather than Novartis in this country. While I agree that the patent system is territorial, it is not rigidly so: see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">Menashe Business Mercantile Ltd v William Hill Ltd</span> [2002] EWCA Civ 1702, [2003] 1 WLR 1462 and <span style="font-style:italic">Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd v Delta Air Lines Inc</span> [2011] EWCA Civ 162. There is nothing inherently objectionable about affording MedImmune a remedy in this country given that ranibizumab is sold here.

A patent for a product normally gives the holder the exclusive right to manufacture that product (subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations). In the case of patented material which is capable of reproducing itself, the value of the patent would clearly be eroded if it did not extend to future generations of such material. For example, if the purchaser of patented seeds were able to use the seeds produced by the crop grown from the purchased seeds, the value of that patent would be much reduced. Article 8(1) accordingly states that in such cases the protection conferred by the original patent extends to future generations of biological material derived through propagation or multiplication. Recital 46 expresses that principle in terms of the patent-holder’s entitlement ‘to prohibit the use of patented self-reproducing material in situations analogous to those where it would be permitted to prohibit the use of patented, non-self-reproducing products, that is to say the production of the patented product itself’. (With regard to seeds, as discussed above Article 11(1) derogates from that protection in prescribed circumstances and for a fee.)  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Court’s reasoning in summary was that Article 9 makes the protection for which it provides subject to the condition that the genetic information contained in the patented product or constituting that product “performs” its function in the “material … in which” that information is contained. It followed that the protection conferred by Article is not available when the genetic information has ceased to perform the function it performed in the initial material from which the material in question is derived. Furthermore, since it was clear from recitals 23 and 24 and Article 5(3) of the Directive that the patentability of a DNA sequence was subject to indication of the function it performs, the Directive must be regarded as not according any protection to a patented DNA sequence which is not able to perform the specific function for which it was patented. It followed that Article 9 did not accord protection to a patented DNA sequence which was not able to perform its function, as was the case with a DNA sequence such as that in issue when it was incorporated in a dead material such as soy meal. </p>

As counsel for MedImmune submitted, however, it does not necessarily follow that the Patents are caught by all the provisions of the Directive and in particular those in Chapter II. Novartis contends that (i) the Patents are within the scope of Article 8(2) and (ii) the effect of Article 8(2) is to circumscribe the protection conferred by the Patents, with the result that (even if they would otherwise infringe by virtue of section 60(1)), Novartis’ acts in relation to Lucentis do not infringe.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is convenient to begin with two preliminary points raised by counsel for MedImmune. First, he submitted that Chapter II of the Directive did not comprehensively regulate the protection conferred by patents for biotechnological inventions. In support of this submission, he pointed out that each of Articles 8(1), 8(2) and 9 concerns a specific type of patent and that those did not encompass all possible biotechnological inventions. In addition he relied on recitals (8), (13) and (46). In my view counsel for MedImmune may be correct about this, but it is unnecessary for me to decide whether he is or not since Novartis’ argument is squarely based on Article 8(2).  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, he submitted that, although Articles 8 and 9 of the Directive refer to “The protection conferred by a patent …”, this can only be ascertained by reference to the individual claims in accordance with Article 69 EPC and the Protocol on Interpretation. Thus Articles 8 and 9 only apply to claims within a patent which have the specified characteristics. Counsel for Novartis did not accept this, but did not advance any coherent argument to the contrary. I note that in <span style="font-style:italic">Monsanto v Cefetra</span> neither the Advocate General in his opinion nor the Court in its judgment referred to the claims of the patent in suit, but it appears to me that the explanation for this is that the claim in the underlying proceedings was for infringement of the product claims. As a matter of principle, I consider that the submission made by counsel for MedImmune is correct and I therefore accept it. It follows that the key question to be decided is whether either claim 8 of 511 or claim 1 of 777 is caught by Article 8(2). </p>

As he pointed out, the consequence would be that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to obtain patent protection for recombinant methods of producing proteins, since proteins are not “biological materials” within the definition in Article 2(1)(a), yet recombinant methods of producing them involve the production of biological materials.  </p>
