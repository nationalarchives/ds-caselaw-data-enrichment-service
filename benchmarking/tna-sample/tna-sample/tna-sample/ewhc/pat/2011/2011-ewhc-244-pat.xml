Eagle denies infringement and counterclaims for revocation of both the Patents. DataCard has applied to amend the Error Loading Patent, and it proposes to amend the RFID Patent although it has not yet formally applied to do so. There is no challenge to the validity of the Trade Marks. The issues relating to the Patents and those relating to the Trade Marks are entirely distinct. </p>

This is correctly presented as “DataCard”, but is often written as “Datacard” (or sometimes “Data card”) by third parties. DataCard uses a variety of product marks in conjunction with this house mark, often with subbrands as well. Thus one product referred to at trial was the DataCard ImageCard II Plus. </p>

In addition, Eagle sells printer ribbons and other related products. As well as selling printer ribbons made by the various printer manufacturers, again including Datacard, it also sells compatible printer ribbons i.e. ribbons that work in a particular manufacturer’s printer, but are made by someone else. The compatible ribbons sold by Eagle are made in China by a company called Kanon. Previously Eagle obtained compatible ribbons made in the USA by Sony Chemicals. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">There are a number of different types of printer technology. This case principally involves thermal transfer printing. In a monochrome thermal transfer printer, resin from a ribbon is melted onto the surface to be printed by a heated print head. In a colour thermal transfer printer, the dye from a ribbon is diffused into the surface to be printed by the print head. Thermal transfer printing is used in barcode label printers, card printers and photograph printers. It was also used for a time in fax machines before laser printing became affordable. </p>

One cylinder may be driven to advance the ribbon (usually the take-up cylinder) or both cylinders may be. A common way to drive the cylinder is by means of ribs on the inside of the cylinder which engage with splines on the outside of spindles or hubs on the printer.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">When loading printer ribbons into a printer by direct loading or using a carrier, a known problem at the time of the Error Loading Patent was that users would sometimes install the ribbon incorrectly, or at least begin by doing so. Sometimes this would be obvious, for example, where the ribbon was twisted through 180<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">o</span> or 360<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">o</span>; but in other cases it might be less obvious, particularly to an unskilled user, for example where it was installed upside-down or back-to-front. The evidence is that this became more of an issue in the card printer field from about 2000 as card printers became cheaper and smaller, and hence more likely to be used by unskilled users. </p>

I do not find this a helpful approach. It is frequently invoked and Mr Waugh Q.C. invoked it in this case in an effort to downgrade Rockwater's expert evidence on obviousness given by Professor Witz. Mr Waugh said his witness, Mr Nash, was more appropriately qualified than Professor Witz, and that the latter, because he had patents in his name, ‘was of an inventive turn of mind’. </p>

If it would be obvious to that team to bring in different expertise, then the invention will nonetheless be obvious. Likewise if the possessor of the ‘extra expertise’ would himself know of the other team's problem.

DataCard accepts that the team would have some general knowledge of the basics of RFID technology, but contends that it would not include a specialist in RFID tag design. Eagle does not go so far as to say that it would include a specialist in RFID tag design, but says that it would include someone with a reasonable level of knowledge of RFID technology. The difference between the two is really as to the level of knowledge of RFID technology that the skilled team would possess, and in particular the extent to which the skilled team would have the ability to design an RFID tag at least in outline. This is already quite a narrow difference, but it becomes even narrower when it is appreciated that DataCard accepts that the skilled team would have access to a manufacturer of RFID technology with the expertise to design and manufacture RFID tags for custom applications. </p>

As I have recorded above, by December 2001 RFID technology was being increasingly widely used in the printing industry. The invention purports to provide an improvement in the use of RFID technology in relation to printers, albeit that it does not specify what that improvement is. </p>

It follows that the RFID Patent assumes that the skilled team either has the necessary expertise itself to design and manufacture a tag, or can access the necessary expertise from an RFID tag manufacturer. Consistently with this, DataCard’s answer to Eagle’s insufficiency case (as to which, see below) is that the skilled team could get the RFID tag designed and manufactured by the supplier to which it has access as described above. </p>

That application has a priority date of 25 January 1999, however, nearly three years before the priority date of the RFID Patent. The application of RFID technology was developing rapidly during that period. Furthermore, Mr Klinefelter accepted the points I have set out in the two preceding paragraphs.

For example, if the problem is how to formulate a particular pharmaceutical substance for administration to patients, then it may be shown that the skilled formulator would as a matter of routine start by ascertaining certain physical and chemical properties of that substance (e.g. its aqueous solubility) from the literature or by routine testing. If so, it is legitimate to take that information into account when assessing the obviousness of a particular formulation. But that is because it is obvious for the skilled person to obtain the information, not because it is common general knowledge.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">A particular area of dispute concerns the extent to which RFID tags with circular antennae, and in particular circular antennae with central apertures, were common general knowledge in December 2001. Dr Schäfer exhibited to his second report illustrations of a number of examples of such tags. DataCard makes the point that none of Dr Schäfer’s examples had been used in the printing industry. That is a fair point so far as it goes, but they had been used in a range of industries including, for example, labelling CDs in public libraries. Furthermore, such tags would have been suitable for use in the printing industry. DataCard also makes the point that it has not been shown that such tags were available as standard products from the two largest suppliers of RFID tags, Phillips and Texas Instruments. In my judgment, this is immaterial. The evidence clearly establishes that such tags were readily available from a variety of smaller suppliers. Dr Schäfer’s evidence, which I accept, was that such tags were a standard type of product, albeit for custom applications rather than high volume products. It was also his opinion that the existence of such tags was something that the skilled team would have known about. In my judgment, the skilled team (or their supplier) would have at least have known, or found out, that tags with circular antennae and central apertures could be made to order.                </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">I do not accept this argument for a number of reasons. First, the argument places more weight on the words “wound onto” than they can properly bear. In context, I consider that they mean no more than “attached to”. The supply material is simply the print ribbon, which is the expression used for items 16 and 62 in the specification. It remains a print ribbon or supply material after it has been used. This is confirmed by the fact that claim 3 refers to “supply material … that had been used”. It follows that this integer can read onto the take-up cylinder. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in"><span style="font-style:italic">Step 4</span>. It is convenient to begin with two general points. First, as I have already pointed out, the specification of the RFID Patent does not identify the improvements over the prior art which the invention is claimed to provide. Still less does it identify the advantages of having a circular antenna which surrounds the aperture of the cylinder in accordance with claim 11. On the contrary, the specification suggests that the precise shape and position of the antenna is immaterial. At [0036] and [0056] the specification states that the tag may be located in different positions. As I have noted above, the tag depicted in Figure 5 is a rectangular tag positioned on one side of the aperture of the cylinder. (Indeed, as I shall discuss below, the application for the RFID Patent did not even include a claim to a circular antenna surrounding the aperture.) </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Secondly, counsel for DataCard submitted that the advantage described in [0036] (quoted in paragraph 54 above) was attributable to the feature of claim 11. He argued that, since positioning a circular antenna around the aperture means that the tag antenna is equidistant from the reader regardless of the rotational position of the cylinder, it avoids the need for the ribbon to be advanced for identification purposes. There are two problems with this argument, however. The first is that the specification at [0036] attributes this advantage simply to the presence of the tag, and not to the shape and position of its antenna. The second is that whether the advantage is obtained does not depend simply on whether the tag antenna is circular and surrounds the aperture. It will not necessarily be obtained if the antenna is positioned eccentrically with respect to the aperture. Conversely, one could obtain the advantage without having a tag antenna that is circular and surrounds the aperture. For example, one could achieve it using a rectangular tag positioned to the side of the aperture as shown in Figure 5 provided that the reader was aligned with the aperture. Indeed, provided that the tag had an adequate read range, it would not even be necessary to align the reader in that way. Thus having a circular antenna surrounding the aperture is neither necessary nor sufficient to obtain this advantage. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Eagle puts its case on obviousness in two ways. The starting point for the first way is that, as was common ground between the experts, at the priority date of the RFID Patent the skilled team would consider an HF RFID tag to be the most suitable type for use in a printer. Although the specific tag disclosed in Fargo is an LF tag, Fargo explicitly states that it is only an example and that a more powerful one may be used. Thus it would be obvious to use an HF tag instead. As discussed above, HF tags were larger than LF tags. Their size was comparable to that of the end of a typical card printer cylinder. Accordingly, it would be obvious to position the antenna so that it ran around the outside of the flange at the left-hand end of the cylinder shown in Figure 2 of Fargo in order to accommodate it within the space available. </p>

The obvious way in which to maximise the size of the antenna would be to run it round the outside of the end of the cylinder.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">DataCard has three main answers to this case. First, DataCard argues that the skilled team would not have any expertise in designing RFID tags. Accordingly, it would simply use an off-the-shelf HF tag available from one of the main suppliers, such as Phillips or Texas Instruments. As discussed above, tags with circular antennas surrounding an aperture were not available as off-the-shelf products from those sources. Although DataCard accepts that the skilled team would have access to a manufacturer with the expertise to design and manufacture such a tag, DataCard argues that the skilled team would not think it worth having a custom-made tag unless it appreciated the advantage in terms of avoiding ribbon wastage that would be gained from having a circular antenna surrounding the aperture. DataCard argues that that would require invention. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">So far as DataCard’s first point is concerned, I have already held that the skilled team would have sufficient expertise to design an RFID tag at least in outline. In my judgment it would have enough expertise to specify that the tag should have a circular antenna surrounding the aperture. But it would not matter if it did not, for two reasons. First, as I have already pointed out, Fargo itself discloses that the antenna is circular. As discussed above, tags with circular antennas were readily available from a variety of suppliers for custom applications. The only step which needs to be taken is to position such an antenna round the aperture. This would be an obvious choice even if the skilled team had minimal expertise in RFID technology. This is illustrated by one of the examples given by Dr Schäfer referred to in paragraph 79 above, namely the tag for use on CDs. This has a circular antenna surrounding the hole. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Secondly, even if the skilled team did not have the necessary expertise itself, it would have access to a supplier which did have the necessary expertise.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">As to DataCard’s second point, Mr Klinefelter explained that the reason why Fargo Electronics had used the TK5550 tag was that a member of his team had used that tag before.

As noted above, DataCard’s answer to this is that the skilled team could take the RFID Patent to an RFID tag manufacturer and get a suitable tag made for it. But as discussed above, this implies that the skilled team at least has access to a supplier with the necessary expertise. On that basis, I have concluded that claim 11 is obvious.

In case G1/93, <span style="font-style:italic">Advanced Semiconductor Products</span>, the Enlarged Board of Appeal of the EPO stated (at paragraph [9] of its reasons) that the idea underlying Art. 123(2) is that that an applicant should not be allowed to improve his position by adding subject matter not disclosed in the application as filed, which would give him an unwarranted advantage and could be damaging to the legal security of third parties relying on the content of the original application. At paragraph [16] it explained that whether an added feature which limits the scope of protection is contrary to Art. 123(2) must be determined from all the circumstances. If it provides a technical contribution to the subject matter of the claimed invention then it would give an unwarranted advantage to the patentee. If, on the other hand, the feature merely excludes protection for part of the subject matter of the claimed invention as covered by the application as filed, the adding of such a feature cannot reasonably be considered to give any unwarranted advantage to the applicant. Nor does it adversely affect the interests of third parties.  </p>

The application as filed discloses a circular antenna surrounding the aperture of the cylinder only in the context of the first embodiment described by reference to Figures 1-3. Nowhere does the application suggest that the feature of a circular antenna surrounding the aperture is of any inventive significance. It is true that, as counsel for DataCard pointed out, the application states at page 10 lines 25 (corresponding to the second sentence of [0048] of the RFID Patent quoted in paragraph 56 above) that “other locations of the tag are possible”. But it then proceeds immediately to describe an embodiment in which the tag does not have a circular antenna surrounding the aperture. Moreover, the passage at page 12 lines 7-13 (corresponding to [00556] of the RFID Patent quoted in paragraph 60 above) reinforces the impression that the precise shape and location of the tag is not of significance to the invention.   </p>

That is a classic intermediate generalisation.

It nevertheless denies infringement of those claims alleged to have been infringed pursuant to section 60(2). In addition, Eagle attacks the validity of the Error Loading Patent on three grounds: (i) obviousness over the Fargo Electronics Pro-L printer and its ribbons (“Fargo Pro-L”); (ii) obviousness over US Patent No. 6,257,780 (“Brother); and (iii) obviousness over Japanese Unexamined Patent Application No. H10-329378 (“Sharp”).

Likewise, the take-up cylinder 18 includes first and second ends 22a, 22b and is generally hollow from the first end to the second end. Preferably, the ends 20a, 20b, 22a, 22b of the cylinders 14, 18 are designed to facilitate loading of the cylinders 14, 18 onto a carrier 24 (to be later described in detail) in the proper orientation, thereby simplifying ribbon replacement. More preferably, a difference in the geometry of the ends of the cylinders 14, 18 is used to achieve the simplified replacement. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">In June 2002 there were three big players in the card printer market, namely DataCard, Fargo Electronics and Zebra (Zebra having taken over Eltron a couple of years previously). Mr Klinefelter agreed that these companies all looked at each others’ products to see what they were doing, and that smaller companies would look at the big players’ products. He also agreed that it would be routine for a skilled team starting to design a new printer first to carry out a competitive analysis of at least the major products on the market. That would include looking at how easy those products were for the end user to use, for example how easy it was to load the ribbons. On the basis of this evidence, counsel for Eagle submitted that at least the principal features, if not necessarily the fine details, of the big three suppliers’ principal models marketed prior to July 2002 would have been common general knowledge. </p>

Each of the models in this range had a carrier with spindles onto which the ribbon cylinders were loaded. The spindle assemblies included pins which extended beyond the end of the spindles. When the carrier was loaded into the printer, the pins rested on supports so as to align the carrier in the printer and keep the ends of the spindles stable. Accordingly, and as Mr Klinefelter accepted, anyone who carried out a competitive analysis would have been aware of that concept.  </p>

Indeed, he was unaware of any examples of carriers with spindles prior to the priority date. In my judgment this does not show that the concept was not common general knowledge. As I have observed above, Dr Schäfer was not properly representative of the skilled team. Albeit with some hesitation, I conclude that the concept was common general knowledge. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Counsel for Eagle also submitted that the arrangement used in an Eltron printer called the P310 was common general knowledge on the same basis. This arrangement was said to consist of cylinders the ends of which differed from each other directly loaded onto spindles with different ribs, as to prevent the cylinders being loaded the wrong way round. I say “said to consist” because Eagle was unable to produce an illustration of the arrangement. The best it could produce was an Eltron promotional document dated May 1999 which includes among a list of new features a “new ribbon system” which “can only be installed in one direction” with “new spindles &amp; cores designed with slots and grooves” with the benefits “can not accidentally reuse old ribbons or install new ones backward” and “easy to install, self-aligning”. Counsel for Eagle submitted that Mr Klinefelter had accepted that the P310 had had the arrangement I have described. Counsel for DataCard disputed this, submitting that Mr Klinefelter had merely acquiesced in an assumption which was put to him. As I read his evidence, however, Mr Klinefelter accepted that at some point the P310 had this arrangement, he just wasn’t sure when. The document suggests that it was available in May 1999. Mr Klinefelter had no alternative explanation of the contents of the document. Moreover, I think he ended up accepting that the arrangement was available by July 2002. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Even though Mr Klinefelter also accepted that someone doing a competitive analysis would come across the P310, however, I am not satisfied that it has been proved that this arrangement was common general knowledge. In my view a single commercial example is not enough for this purpose. The position is different in the case of the DataCard printers because that involved a range of four models (indeed, all bar one of DataCard’s printers at the time) with the same arrangement, and therefore it is much more likely that the skilled team would be aware of at least one of them. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Finally, Mr Klinefelter accepted that some of the prior art in this case showed  that a common way of addressing the error loading problem in printers with cylinders on hubs was to shape one end of one of the cylinders differently from the other three and to shape one of the hubs so that it only fitted into that end. In my judgment this evidence does not establish that this concept was common general knowledge either.                 </p>

According to the <span style="font-style:italic">Concise Oxford Dictionary</span> it means “pin or axis which revolves or upon which a thing revolves”. It is also common ground that, in the context of the Error Loading Patent, the word is used by the patentee to describe the object upon which the cylinders of the supply item are mounted. Eagle contends that any shaft on which the supply item can be mounted is a spindle for the purposes of the claim. By contrast DataCard contends that the term is limited to a member which supports the cylinder from one side and passes all the way through the cylinder. The basis for DataCard’s contention is that that is what is described and shown in the specific embodiments. DataCard has identified no technical or other reason, however, why the skilled team </p>

Eagle contends that it covers any object onto which the supply item can be mounted prior to installation into the printer, regardless of whether it is designed to be loaded by the user or pre-loaded at a factory. DataCard contends that it is limited to carriers in the sense described above i.e. ones loaded by the user.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Counsel for Eagle made three points with regard to the construction of the new features proposed to be introduced into claim 1 by amendment which I did not understand counsel for DataCard to dispute, but which in any event I accept. The first concerns integer [2]. As counsel for Eagle submitted, this merely requires the supply item to be <span style="font-style:italic">capable</span> of being loaded onto the spindles of an <span style="font-style:italic">otherwise unspecified</span> carrier. The second concerns integers [4] and [7].  As counsel for Eagle submitted, these merely require the presence of ribs on the interior of the cylinder that are <span style="font-style:italic">capable</span> of preventing rotation of the cylinder if the supply item is mounted onto an appropriate carrier. The third concerns integer [12]. As counsel for Eagle submitted, this merely requires that the cylinders have features which are <span style="font-style:italic">capable</span> of limiting how they can be loaded onto an appropriate carrier. This adds nothing of substance to the existing requirements of the claim. Underlying each of these three points is the fact that, even as proposed to be amended, claim 1 is a claim to the supply item. Claim 1 does not require the presence of a carrier, still less a carrier of any particular design.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.02in;margin-right:1.00in">“68. My Lords, the point is a very short one and in my opinion the Court of Appeal was right. The concept of an implied licence to do various acts in relation to a patented product is well established in the authorities. Its proper function is to explain why, notwithstanding the apparent breadth of the patentee's rights, a person who has acquired the product with the consent of the patentee may use or dispose of it in any way he pleases. The traditional Royal Command in the grant of a patent forebode others not only to ‘make’ but also to ‘use, exercise or vend’ the invention. Similarly, section 60(1)(a) provides that a person infringes a patent for a product not only if he ‘makes’ it but also if, without the consent of the proprietor, he ‘disposes of, offers to dispose of, uses or imports the product or keeps it whether for disposal or otherwise.’ Put shortly, the problem is to explain why, for example, a patentee cannot not complain when someone to whom he had sold the patented product then, without any further consent, uses it or disposes of it to someone else. The answer given by Lord Hatherley L.C. in the leading case of <span style="font-style:italic">Betts v. Willmott</span> (1871) L.R. 6 Ch. App. 239, 245 (which concerned the resale of a patented product) was that he did so by virtue of an implied licence.  </p>

Where however it is alleged that the defendant has infringed by making the patented product, the concepts of an implied licence or exhaustion of rights can have no part to play. The sale of a patented article cannot confer an implied licence to make another or exhaust the right of the patentee to prevent others from being made. A repair of the patented product is by definition an act which does not amount to making it: as Lord Halsbury L.C. said of the old law in <span style="font-style:italic">Sirdar Rubber Co.

I therefore agree with the Court of Appeal that in an action for infringement by making, the notion of an implied licence to repair is superfluous and possibly even confusing. It distracts attention from the question raised by section 60(1)(a), which is whether the defendant has made the patented product. As a matter of ordinary language, the notions of making and repair may well overlap. But for the purposes of the statute, they are mutually exclusive. The owner’s right to repair is not an independent right conferred upon him by licence, express or implied. It is a residual right, forming part of the right to do whatever does not amount to making the product.” </p>

Does this prevent re-stringing, even though the invention is said to lie in the features of the frame alone? Instinctively one would say not. Does it make a difference if what the defendant does is buy second hand racquets, re-string them and sell them in competition with the patentee? Instinctively, I can see no reason why the owner of the secondhand product should be making a new patented product when the original owner was not. Considerations such as these drive one to say that the relevant test ought to have regard to the part of the product in which the invention resides.  </p>

Moreover, even if the user started by loading the wrong cylinder onto wrong hubs, he or she would be likely quickly to appreciate the mistake. To that extent, the Pro-L arrangement would prevent erroneous loading. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in"><span style="font-style:italic">Step 4</span>. Eagle’s case as to the obviousness of amended claim 1 over Fargo Pro-L is as follows. A disadvantage with the method of loading the ribbon used in the Fargo ProL was that it was fiddly to fit the cylinders onto the four hubs inside the printer. A well-known and obvious alternative method of loading a ribbon in 2002 was direct loading onto two spindles in the printer. This was a method that was particularly popular with one of the “big three” manufacturers, Eltron/Zebra. There could be nothing inventive in the skilled team who had been tasked with designing a new printer in 2002 deciding to adopt this alternative approach as opposed to the Fargo approach of direct loading onto hubs. Once the skilled team decided to adopt the direct loading onto spindles approach, it would have been immediately apparent to them that the cylinders would need to have ribs on the inside so as to enable the spindles to drive the cylinders. At that point they would have arrived at a supply item within amended claim 1, because the geometry of the ends of the cylinders would be capable of limiting loading onto spindles on an appropriate carrier. The fact that there would be no carrier is immaterial. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">DataCard advanced five main arguments in answer to this case. First, DataCard argues that the skilled team would have no motive to change from the hub design of the Fargo Pro-L. In my judgment this does not assist DataCard. As discussed in paragraphs 94-95 above, the absence of motive is not conclusive. Changing from one well-known ribbon loading arrangement to another one is not something that requires a specific motive, because they are technically obvious alternatives to each other. Furthermore, in the present case there would be a motive, namely the desire for a less fiddly method of loading the ribbon. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">DataCard’s second argument is that, far from having a motive to change the hub arrangement, the skilled team would have a motive not to change it. This is that the main purpose of the Fargo Pro-L arrangement was to use the metal pins in the insert in one of the cylinders to identify the ribbon. In my judgment this does not assist DataCard either. Changing the loading method from hubs to spindles would not necessitate changing the insert, nor prevent the ribbon being identified by means of a Hall Effect sensor (assuming that the skilled team wanted to retain that method of identification rather than using an RFID tag instead).      </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">DataCard’s third argument is that, if the skilled team decided to change from hubs to spindles, it would be into a complete re-design of at least the ribbon-loading aspects of the machine. In those circumstances, why would the skilled team change one aspect of the loading arrangement (the hubs), but keep another aspect (the geometry of the ends of the cylinders)? DataCard argues that the skilled team would only do this if they appreciated the potential benefit from doing so, but that would require an inventive insight. I do not accept this argument. For the reasons discussed above, the advantage of the differential geometry of the ends of the cylinders in terms of preventing error loading when combined with suitable hubs would be apparent to the skilled team. It would not take invention to appreciate that precisely the same advantage could be obtained when replacing hubs driven by means of notches with spindles driven by ribs. Nor would it take invention to appreciate that, just as one pair of hubs has to be differentiated from the other pair, so too one spindle would have to be differentiated from the other. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Fourthly, DataCard relies strongly on the evidence of Dr Schäfer in crossexamination, and in particular his acceptance that it would not be obvious for the skilled team to go from the Fargo Pro-L to the arrangement shown in Figure 1 of the Error Loading Patent. Although I have taken it into account, in my judgment this evidence does not get DataCard home, for three reasons. First, as discussed above, Dr Schäfer was barely qualified to give evidence from the perspective of the skilled team. As such, his evidence on this topic carries much less weight than that of Mr Klinefelter. Secondly, the reason given by Dr Schäfer was that the two systems involved a different constructional principle, and therefore a wholesale re-design would be required. I am not persuaded by this for the reasons given above. Thirdly and perhaps most importantly, the question which Dr Schäfer was asked does not meet Eagle’s case. Figure 1 of the Error Loading Patent not only includes the supply item, but also the carrier. Even in so far as the supply item is concerned, it includes details not required by amended claim 1. Even though Dr Schäfer gave evidence after Mr Klinefelter, counsel for DataCard made no attempt to cross-examine Dr Schäfer on the case which had been put to Mr Klinefelter as set out above. </p>

Each end has grooves, but in one end of the take up cylinder these grooves are arranged differently from the other three ends. Each of the four spools has engagement notches that are designed to engage with the grooves on the cylinders. Three are designed to fit in the three similar ends, and one is designed to fit only in the different end. In addition, the other end of the spools has a support shaft, which is designed to fit into the cassette. The spool with the different notches also has a larger support shaft that the other three, so that it will only fit one way into the cassette (which has three small openings and one larger one).

Mr Klinefelter was asked whether there would be any technical reason why this obvious and well-known alternative could not be used with the obvious modifications to Brother referred to above, and he accepted that there were not.

The first objection is that it is impermissible because it results in the specification disclosing added matter contrary to section 76(3)(a) of the 1977 Act. Eagle argues that the only disclosure in the Application was of a specific carrier, but claim 11 incorporates the feature of a carrier stripped of the entire context in which it was disclosed and every feature of its construction. Although the application disclosed the specific carrier as being inventive (due to the arrangement of the pins on the spindles), there was no suggestion (and could be no suggestion) that the mere idea of having a carrier was inventive. Accordingly, Eagle says that this amount to an intermediate generalisation. I agree with this analysis.   </p>

It can therefore be the infringed pursuant to section 60(2) by the sale of any carrier, even if the carrier itself would not infringe claim 12.

It follows that when deciding upon the admissibility of any amendment to the claims of a patent which is proposed in opposition proceedings (whether or not such amendment involves a change of category of claim), what has to be considered and decided is whether the subject-matter which is protected by the claims, as defined by their categories in combination with their technical features, is extended. It is not necessary to consider the national laws of the Contracting States in relation to infringement when making such a decision, however.” </p>

In support of this submission, he pointed out that, although the amendment to section 75 of the 1977 Act by the Patents Act 2004 to introduce subsection (5) has curtailed the extent of the court’s discretion with regard to amendment applications, it has not removed it altogether: see <span style="font-style:italic">Zipher Ltd v Markem Systems Ltd</span> [2008] EWHC 1379 (Pat), [2009] FSR 1 at [197]-[220]. </p>

To allow new claim 11 to be introduced into the Error Loading Patent would defeat that policy. Accordingly, I decline to permit the amendment in the exercise of my discretion. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Eagle objects to new claim 13 on the same grounds as claim 11, as does the Comptroller. So far as added matter is concerned, claim 13 claims a carrier in accordance with claim 12, but this time with a generalised supply item. The supply item only has to comprise a supply and a take-up cylinder loaded onto the spindles. The supply cylinder (but oddly not the take-up cylinder) is required to have ribs to prevent rotation with respect to the supply spindle.  Eagle argues that this is another intermediate generalisation of the disclosure of the application. It takes the features of a supply item having supply and take-up cylinders, with ribs on the supply cylinder, and divorces it from the context of the embodiment in which it was disclosed. Again, I agree with this analysis. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">As to extension of protection, alternatively exercise of the court’s discretion, Eagle argues that the result of introducing new claim 13 would be that the sale of any supply item with ribs on the inside of the supply cylinder would infringe under s60(2) after amendment, whereas it would not before. Again, I conclude that this does not amount to extension of protection, but does mean that I should decline to permit the amendment in the exercise of my discretion. </p>

The way in which Eagle has used the trade mark has changed over time, and thus it is necessary to consider DataCard’s complaints chronologically. On the other hand, it is common ground that it is not necessary to consider the resellers’ websites separately, since there is no material difference between them and Eagle’s own website for these purposes. Eagle denies that it has committed any infringing acts, and in the alternative asserts by way of defence that it is necessary for it to use the trade mark to indicate that its ribbons are compatible with DataCard’s printers. It is common ground, however, that, if the uses complained of amount to an infringement, then Eagle is jointly liable for uses made by its resellers.  </p>

Moreover, a third party can use the trade mark to distinguish between the goods of the trade mark proprietor and other goods that may or may not be his own goods. If this analysis is correct, a party who is in the position of an intermediary or a marketplace operator also uses a sign ‘in relation to goods’ if he uses a sign which is identical with a trademark for the purpose of distinguishing between goods that are available through the use of his services and those that are not. </p>

The operator’s activity consists of storing and displaying listings that the users upload to its system and of running a system for facilitating the conclusions of deals. It is no more using trade marks than a newspaper publishing classified ads mentioning trademarks where the identity of the seller is not revealed in the ad but must be requested from the newspaper. Hence, even if the listing of trade mark protected goods by users of an electronic marketplace may have an adverse effect on the origin, quality or investment function of a trademark, those effects cannot be attributed to the marketplace operator unless national legal rules and the principle of secondary liability for trade mark infringements apply. </p>

In eBay’s servers the searches relate to the listings stored by the users of the marketplace, in the case of internet search engines to those internet pages they have stored in their servers. Therefore, as regards these functions, the use and display of third party trade marks is not use of a sign in the sense of Article 5(1) of Directive 89/104 for the reasons set out in the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Google France and Google</span>.

Nor, unlike in <span style="font-style:italic">Céline </span>(at [27]), does the Court say that use of a sign is liable adversely to affect the origin function if “consumers are liable to interpret it as designating the origin of the goods or services in question”.

It appears from [84]-[85] and [89]-[90] that this is a test of likelihood of confusion, but with a reversed onus i.e. the onus lies upon the third party to show that the use of the sign in context is sufficiently clear that there is no possibility of confusion on the part of the average consumer as to the origin of the advertised goods or services. </p>

I cannot believe that that is what the Court of Justice meant to say, however. Article 5(1)(a) contains no requirement for a likelihood of confusion, whereas Article 5(1)(b) does. The reason why Article 5(1)(a) contains no requirement for a likelihood of confusion is that a likelihood of confusion is presumed where a sign identical to the trade mark is used in relation to goods or services identical to those for which the trade mark is registered, as is required by Article 16(1) of the Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. That is what recital (11) of the Directive means when it says that “the protection afforded by the registered trade mark … should be absolute in the case of identity between the mark and the sign and the goods or services”. (In another sense, the protection is not absolute, of course, because it is subject to the defences under Articles 6 and 7 of the Directive.) Furthermore, in the case of Article 5(1)(b) it is clear from the Court’s earlier jurisprudence that the onus lies upon the trade mark proprietor to establish the presence of a likelihood of confusion, not upon the third party to establish the absence of a likelihood of confusion. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.00in">the average consumer of the goods or services in question. The case law of the Court of Justice suggests that the advertising function is most likely to be affected when the trade mark has been used by the trade mark proprietor in relation to prestigious goods that have a luxurious image and the third party’s use of the signs complained of either takes unfair advantage of that image or adversely affects that image by associating it with down-market goods, marketing methods or advertising: see Case C-337/95 <span style="font-style:italic">Parfums Christian Dior SA v Evora BV</span> [1997] ECR I-6013 at [39]-[48], Case C59/08 <span style="font-style:italic">Copad SA v Christian Dior Couture SA</span> [2009] ECR I-3421 at [52]-[59] and <span style="font-style:italic">L’Oréal v Bellure</span> at [38]-[50] and [62]-[63]. On the other hand, it appears from <span style="font-style:italic">Google France </span>that the mere fact that use of the signs complained of in advertising competitive goods or services causes the trade mark proprietor’s advertising costs to be increased is not enough to affect the advertising function.

Why should such confusion not be actionable? It falls within the scope of a contextual assessment of the use of the sign. It is surely capable of being damaging to the trade mark proprietor. For example, it may cause the consumer to obtain the goods from the same website the next time he or she orders those goods under the same mistaken belief. And why should it make any difference for these purposes whether the goods are labelled with a sign identical to the trade mark or merely one that is similar to the trade mark i.e. whether the case falls within Article 5(1)(a) or 5(1)(b)? </p>

It covers, in particular, cases where, by reason of a transfer of the image of the mark or of the characteristics which it projects to the goods identified by the identical or similar sign, there is clear exploitation on the coat-tails of the mark with a reputation. </p>

The Board of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Mango</span> also said that unfair advantage is the more likely where there is greater similarity of goods as well as where the mark is more distinctive, but that was a case where the mark was identical, and strongly distinctive, and the goods were not the same but they were in an associated or overlapping field.

It is common ground that resellers will be knowledgeable about printer ribbons, and in particular will be well aware of the difference between printer manufacturers’ own products and ribbons that are compatible with the printers. Accordingly, DataCard accepts that resellers are unlikely to be confused by Eagle’s activities. For that reason, I shall concentrate on the position of end users in the remainder of this judgment. </p>

The only prejudice to Eagle suggested by counsel for Eagle was that permitting the amendment might cause Eagle difficulties with regard to a possible defence that uses of the label in question were covered by a settlement between DataCard and Eagle of earlier proceedings dated 8 March 2007. It was not suggested that the settlement agreement would bar uses after that date, however, and counsel for Eagle accepted that Eagle’s position with regard to uses prior to that date could be protected by permitting Eagle to raise the point on any inquiry as to damages or account of profits.      </p>

In my view there can be no doubt that the sign which Eagle has used in the breadcrumb trail and Datacard icon on the website and on the box labels is “Datacard”/”Data Card”. As for the description of the ribbons on the website and in the email as “DATACARD PLUS-RIBBON”/ “Datacard Plus-Ribbon”, in my judgment this constitutes use of two signs, namely “DATACARD”/”Datacard” on the one hand and “PLUS-RIBBON”/”Plus-Ribbon” on the other hand. The average end user consumer viewing the website would already be familiar with the Trade Marks, but would not be familiar with the expression Plus-Ribbon. In my view the average consumer would appreciate, in particular from the use of the letters “TM”, that PlusRibbon was another trade mark of some kind. This situation is quite different to cases like <span style="font-style:italic">Reed</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Compass</span> where the defendant’s sign was a single two or three-word trade mark.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Although the facts of the present case differ from either of the situations which were in issue in <span style="font-style:italic">L’Oréal v eBay</span>, it seems to me that the analysis of Advocate General Jääskinen at [99]-[103] is more nearly applicable to both the DataCard logo icon and the breadcrumb trial than that at [119]-[200]. This is not a case where Eagle is simply storing and displaying listings uploaded by users, and providing search and display functions for those listings. Rather, it is using its website to advertise both DataCard’s products and its own competitive products. In my judgment it follows that Eagle’s use of the sign “Datacard” in both the icon and the breadcrumb was in relation to both DataCard’s products and its own. The former use is not objected to by DataCard (and in my view would be covered by Article 7 of the Directive), but the latter use is. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Counsel for Eagle relied strongly on the fact that there is no evidence of any actual confusion having occurred. He submitted that, if there was a likelihood of confusion, some evidence of actual confusion would have emerged. I have taken the absence of evidence of actual confusion into account, but in my judgment it does not lead to the conclusion that there was no likelihood of confusion. It is well established that it is for the court to decide whether or not there is a likelihood of confusion, and that it is not necessary for there to be evidence of actual confusion for the court to conclude that there is a likelihood of confusion. Furthermore, in the circumstances of the present case, I do not consider the absence of evidence of actual confusion to be compelling for a number of reasons. First, most of Eagle’s sales to end users take place via its resellers’ websites. There is no disclosure and no evidence from any reseller. Nor is there is any particular reason why a reseller should inform Eagle of an instance of confusion rather than dealing with the incident itself. Secondly, the quantity of ribbons sold to date is relatively small. Thirdly, even if consumers are confused, this may not manifest itself. Fourthly, as can be seen from the figures quoted in paragraph 301 above, many end user purchasers only make a single purchase. This makes it particularly likely that any confusion will go undetected. Fifthly, I agree with counsel for DataCard that Eagle’s disclosure does not enable one to eliminate the possibility that some confusion has in fact occurred. </p>

DataCard alleges that the use of the signs complained of takes unfair advantage of the reputation of the Trade Marks because Eagle represents that its Plus-Ribbbon products are of as good quality as DataCard’s ribbons, but in fact they are of lesser quality. I will deal with the factual issues relating to this contention in connection with Eagle’s Article 6(1)(c) defence below, but for present purposes I will assume that DataCard has established the facts alleged. Even on that assumption, I am unable to understand why this means that <span style="font-style:italic">the use of the signs complained of</span> takes unfair advantage of the reputation of the Trade Marks. The use of the signs complained of takes advantage of the reputation of the Trade Marks to sell Eagle’s goods regardless of whether the quality of Eagle’s goods is better, the same or worse than that of DataCard’s. The question is whether it is an unfair advantage. In the present case the advantage is taken intentionally, but Eagle says it is necessary to take that advantage in order to indicate compatibility with DataCard printers. If that is so, why is the advantage taken unfair? If it was deemed to be unfair, that would mean that it would be unlawful to sell ribbons of lesser quality than DataCard’s as compatible with DataCard’s printers even if the vendor expressly informed consumers that was the case and charged less for the ribbons than DataCard. In my judgment, the relevance of DataCard’s quality allegations is not to unfair advantage, but to Eagle’s defence under Article 6(1)(c).   </p>

Again, I will assume for present purposes that DataCard has established the facts alleged. Even on that assumption, I cannot see how there will be damage to the reputation of the Trade Marks in absence of any confusion as to the trade origin of the Plus-Ribbon products. DataCard contends that, if there is a problem with the ribbon, consumers may blame the printer and hence DataCard. But if the consumer is aware that the ribbon comes from a different supplier, why should the consumer blame the printer? The consumer may still ask the printer manufacturer or distributor to sort the problem out, because that is the most practical way forward from the consumer’s perspective, but it does not follow from such a request that the consumer thinks any the less of the printer or its manufacturer. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">So far as the first issue is concerned, DataCard contends that the use of the signs was not necessary. In particular, DataCard argues that the use of the signs in the context of the DataCard logo icon and the breadcrumb trail was not necessary. It seems to me, however, that the points relied on by DataCard in support of these contentions really go to the second issue and not the first. In my judgment it was necessary for Eagle to use signs identical to the Trade Marks to indicate the intended purpose of Eagle’s ribbons, namely that the ribbons are compatible with DataCard’s printers. There is no other realistic way in which Eagle could convey that information. And that must extend to enabling consumers to navigate Eagle’s website to find the type of ribbon they want. As Eagle demonstrated, use of icons and breadcrumb trails containing OEM trade marks is common amongst websites of this kind.  What DataCard is really complaining about is not the fact that Eagle has used the signs to indicate compatibility, but the manner of that use.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">As to the second issue, in my judgment it follows from my conclusions in relation to Article 5(1)(b) that Eagle’s use of the signs was not in accordance with honest practices in industrial and commercial matters. In short, the manner of the use gives the impression that there is, or at least may be, a commercial connection between the supplier of the Plus-Ribbon products (i.e. Eagle) and DataCard. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">DataCard also contends, however, that Eagle’s use of the signs was not in accordance with honest practices in industrial and commercial matters because of the quality issue referred to above. This contention is significant, because, if established, it would be an answer to Eagle’s Article 6(1)(c) defence even if the manner of Eagle’s use of the signs did not give rise to a likelihood of confusion. This would be particularly relevant if DataCard established its Article 5(1)(a) or Article 5(2) cases. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">As noted above, the starting point is that DataCard contends that Eagle has represented in various ways on its website that its Plus-Ribbon products are of as good quality as DataCard’s ribbons. Eagle does not dispute that such representations have been made. As Eagle points out, however, one needs to be careful about the meaning of such representations. I do not understand DataCard to allege that Eagle has represented that its ribbons will produce precisely the same colour shades using precisely the same heat settings as the corresponding DataCard ribbons when used in DataCard printers. If that is alleged, it has not been established. As Mr Runcie accepted, customers who adopt a quality standard will have tolerances. There is no evidence as to what those tolerances are. Furthermore, it is clear from the evidence as a whole that users of card printers understand that the settings may need to be adjusted to match the ribbon being used.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">DataCard relies on three matters as establishing that these representations are false. First, DataCard relies upon tests performed by one of its employees, Ron Dorling, in June 2009. This evidence suffers from a number of flaws. First, it is not clear precisely what Mr Dorling did. Mr Dorling was not called as a witness, nor was anyone with knowledge of what he had done. Mr Runcie relied on some contemporaneous documents emanating from Mr Dorling, but these do not contain a full or clear description of what he did. In particular, it is not clear that he printed the same image on two of the three sets of cards. Secondly, the results relied on are selective in that Mr Dorling tested Plus-Ribbons in eight different printers, but only disclosed the results for the worst example. Thirdly, it appears that Mr Dorling did not try to match the printer settings to the Plus-Ribbons. Fourthly, I was not shown the originals of the cards printed by Mr Dorling, but only photocopies. In my judgment this evidence is valueless. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Secondly, DataCard relies upon tests on two Kanon ribbons performed by one of Eagle’s employees, Stuart Parker, in February 2009. So far as print quality was concerned, Mr Parker’s conclusion was that the Kanon ribbons performed very well, </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.00in">but produced less vibrant colour tones and slightly more grainy images in some cases than the corresponding DataCard ribbon. He also found, however, that adjusting the settings enabled the Kanon ribbons more closely to replicate the colours. In my judgment this evidence does not establish a material difference in quality between Eagle’s ribbons and DataCard’s.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Mr Parker also conducted accelerated UV degradation tests using one hour’s exposure in an EPROM burner. His conclusion was that the Kanon ribbons produced cards which degraded in UV light much more quickly than the DataCard ribbon. This test clearly shows a material difference between the quality of the ribbons under the conditions of the test. Furthermore, Mr Rayner gave evidence that the test was the same test as had been used by Eltron due to the fact that Mr Parker had worked at Eltron. As such, it was plainly intended to be a realistic test. Nevertheless, Eagle contends that it does not constitute a realistic test for two reasons. The more important of these is that the source of UV used in the test emitted light in the UVC band. UVC is completely blocked by ozone and thus is not a component of sunlight. Accordingly, a card in normal usage would not be exposed to UVC at all. In answer to this, DataCard relied on evidence given by Mr Rayner that the test was intended to show what happened when cards were exposed to UV card readers. There is no evidence that these emit UVC light, however. The second reason is that a card would have to be exposed for over 13 years at the maximum safe level for humans to be exposed to sunlight for it receive the same amount of energy as it received during the test. I am less impressed by this point, however, since it is common experience that sunlight can bleach the colours of various materials under conditions that are perfectly safe to humans. Overall, I conclude that this evidence does not establish that cards printed using Eagle’s ribbons would suffer materially worse UV degradation than cards printed using DataCard ribbons under conditions that are likely to be experienced during normal use.      </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Finally, DataCard relies upon problems with a DataCard printer experienced by an end user, Thames Valley Chamber of Commerce. Again, however, DataCard did not call any witness to give evidence about this incident with knowledge of it. The only evidence about it consists of some emails from DataCard’s distributor Securit World. These show that the customer returned the printer to the distributor on three occasions. So far as the first occasion is concerned, there is no evidence that the customer had used a Plus-Ribbon. On the second occasion, a Plus-Ribbon was involved, but there is no evidence that the Plus-Ribbon was the cause of the problems. As Mr Runcie accepted, there are other possible causes. On the third occasion, a PlusRibbon was again involved, but again there is no evidence that the Plus-Ribbon was the cause of the problems. Again, there are other possible causes. </p>

The corresponding list in respect of the original DataCard ribbons has not been expanded.

Nor, for that matter, did DataCard rely upon it in support of its claims.  </p>
