Humira is the highest selling prescription drug in the world by global sales, achieving net sales in 2014 in excess of US$12.5 billion. Adalimumab is a fully human antibody that binds and neutralises the activity of TNFα. The basic patent for adalimumab (EP 0,929,578) and its associated UK Supplementary Protection Certificate (“SPC”) (GB/04/002) will expire on 15 October 2018. </p>

The Claimants indicated that they intended to add EP UK 2,940,044 (“the 044 patent”) in respect of RA to the proceedings, once it was granted. However, since commencement of proceedings AbbVie has disapproved of the text of the 656 and 322 patents, with the effect of revoking them centrally, and so abandoning them for all designations, and de-designated the 044 patent, for the UK only. AbbVie has also given undertakings, the effect of which, it claims, gives at least as much protection to the Claimants as the relief sought in the declarations. It also offered to pay the costs of the proceedings if its proposal was accepted and provided draft consent orders. </p>

The priority attack is not based upon an absence of disclosure in US 961. Rather, the Claimants challenge the chain of title by which Abbott Bermuda claims to be entitled to claim priority under Article 4A of the Paris Convention. This has resulted in a complex investigation, which has included issues of US and German law, as well as extensive evidence of fact, much of which has been the subject of cross-examination. </p>

A person who files a patent application for an invention is afforded the privilege of claiming priority only if he himself filed the earlier application from which priority is claimed or if he is the successor in title to the person who filed that earlier application. If he is neither the person who filed the earlier application nor his successor in title then he is denied the privilege. Moreover, his position is not improved if he subsequently acquires title to the invention. It remains the case that he was not entitled to the privilege when he filed the later application and made his claim. Any other interpretation would introduce uncertainty and the risk of unfairness to third parties. In reaching this conclusion I derive a measure of comfort from the fact that the Board of Appeal of the EPO has adopted the same approach to the interpretation of art.87 EPC in two cases: J-0019/87 and T-0062/05.” </p>

AbbVie argues that on both parties’ cases, when the PCT was filed on 5 June 2002, the inventors each still held legal title to the Invention. Under their EISAs, the US inventors had agreed to assign their rights to KPC or its nominee. This operated as an agreement to assign future rights which needed to be perfected before legal title was assigned. That had not been done by June 2002. Therefore, the US inventors held legal title on trust for KPC or its nominee. In relation to Dr Kempeni, it is common ground that in June 2002 he remained the legal owner of his part of the invention, but the Invention remained an unreported service invention which could be claimed by his employer, Knoll GmbH. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.02in">AbbVie’s case is that in June 2002 the three inventors who filed US 961 and who still owned legal title to the Invention filed a PCT Application claiming priority from US 961. This was permitted under Article 4A of the Paris Convention. Abbott Bermuda was also included as an applicant on the PCT Application. However, AbbVie submits that it makes no difference if there was an additional applicant, provided that the legal owners, who are entitled to claim priority, are applicants for the PCT Application; see <span style="font-style:italic">KCI</span> at [98]. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.02in">I do not accept this argument, for the following reasons. First, I do not consider that Article 4A permits both the original applicant and his successor in title to enjoy a right of priority. In my judgment, where a right to claim priority has been assigned, the assignor cannot subsequently make a claim himself. The Article contemplates a claim to priority either by the original applicant or his successor in title, and not by both. Once the right has been assigned there is no reason why the assignor should retain a right of priority. This is consistent with ensuring certainty as to who is entitled to apply, as referred to by Kitchin J in<span style="font-style:italic"> Edwards Lifesciences</span>. Looking at the issue as a question of substance rather than form, in the present case the inventors did not retain a substantive right as of 5 June 2002. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.02in">Secondly, the PCT Application identifies the inventors as the applicants for “US only” and Abbott Bermuda as the applicant for “all designated states except the US.” AbbVie claims that this makes no difference because, at the time when a PCT application is filed (the point when priority is assessed) it is a single international application. It only later transfers to the national phase. I do not agree. This argument was rejected by Arnold J in <span style="font-style:italic">KCI</span>. In that case, an issue arose as to whether Mediscus was a co-applicant (with KCI) for a European patent, since it was named on a PCT application as the applicant for “GB only”. Arnold J found that, since both of the patents in issue were European patents (UK), the only part of the PCT application which was material to the question of entitlement to priority of those patents was the part that related to the European patent.  It did not matter whether priority was validly claimed in respect of the United Kingdom national patent. </p>

What matters for the purposes of this litigation is whether priority has been validly claimed for the Patents, both of which are European patents (UK), in accordance with Article 87(1) EPC. The PCT is simply a mechanism for the central filing of multiple patent applications. Once an international patent application enters the regional/national phase, it is treated as a regular regional or national application. Accordingly, the only part of the PCT Application that is material to the entitlement of the Patents to priority is the part that relates to the European patent. Provided that priority has been validly claimed in respect of the European patent, it does not matter whether priority was validly claimed in respect of the United Kingdom national patent, if any.”  </p>

Furthermore, by 2003, Abbott Bermuda had ceased to exist, and therefore it is unsurprising that it was not the assignee. The 2014 assignment also post-dated the acquisition by Abbott Laboratories of BASF Pharma. Therefore, neither of them directly concern the relationship between KPC and Knoll AG. Nonetheless, I think that these documents are of some modest assistance to the Claimants.  Balancing their probative value against the evidence adduced by AbbVie, and the contemporaneous documents on which it relies, I do not accept the Claimants’ case on this issue. </p>

The Claimants allege that the Court ought to have been shown audits of patents or patent assignments relating to patents generally, or in the context of D2E7, to show a pattern of making applications and transferring them to Knoll AG. Finally, they allege that it was not established that the policy was in existence in March 2001. I do not agree. I found the evidence of AbbVie’s witnesses clear on this issue. They may not have known every detail, but I was left in no doubt that this was the policy upon which KPC and Knoll AG conducted their affairs, and that this continued to be the policy at the date of purchase of BASF Pharma by Abbott Laboratories. </p>

It is suggested that Dr Spigelman was not the best person to provide evidence on this subject.  I do not agree.

The Claimants’ main point on this issue, at the start of the trial, was that Dr Kempeni did not formally report the Invention to his employer Knoll AG. The Claimants relied on the decision of the German Federal Court of Justice in <span style="font-style:italic">Haftetikett </span>(BGH GRUR 2006, 754) which held that, in the absence of a formal report, notice will have been given if the employer had sufficient information to file a patent application.

The purpose of the APAs was to transfer only ex-US assets to Abbott Bermuda. If there had been intention to include US 961 in these agreements, it would have been recognised as a US asset and consequently would have been assigned to Abbott Biotechnology. However, it is necessary to have regard to the conclusion of Kitchin J in <span style="font-style:italic">Edwards Lifesciences </span>at [93], when considering Article 4A of the Paris Convention, that “successor in title” means “successor in title to the invention”. In my judgment, the Claimants’ submission confuses rights in the Invention, including the right to claim priority, with rights in US 961. US 961 was a United States patent application. However, this does not prevent the parties to the APAs from agreeing that all rights in inventions relating to D2E7 outside the United States should be transferred to Abbott Bermuda. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.02in;text-indent:0.5in">In 1996, Prof Edwards became aware of the antibody rituximab, which depletes B cells by binding to CD20, an antigen present on the surface of the B cells. In 1997, rituximab was licensed for use in B cell lymphoma and by October 1998 Prof Edwards had set up a small trial of rituximab in five RA patients, followed by a 22 patient study in about August 1999. In these studies, he investigated a number of doses and dosing intervals (including single doses, weekly dosing and dosing in alternate weeks), with and without the use of other known therapeutic drugs, such as cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids. In a subsequent study in collaboration with Roche Products, rituximab was administered in two doses, two weeks apart, with and without co-administration of methotrexate.  </p>

First, Mr Tappin QC, who presented this part of the case on behalf of AbbVie, alleges that there were some errors in Prof Edwards’ reports and oral evidence. For example, it is said when he came to give evidence he affirmed [69] of his second report which claimed that an abstract known as Rau (907) was not a double dummy study, even though he had already decided that this was incorrect, as he explained during cross-examination. AbbVie claims that this showed a lack of care in some aspects of his evidence. I do not accept this submission, and I consider the errors to be trivial, of the type that will inevitably emerge during a long cross-examination. I would certainly not describe his evidence as careless.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.02in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, it is alleged that he approached the case on the basis that the rheumatologist in the skilled team was someone of the calibre of himself, or Prof. Maini, or Dr Weinblatt, all of whom were world leaders in the field. This put the level of skill of the unimaginative skilled person far too high. I reject this submission. Prof Edwards explained that the number of skilled rheumatologists engaged in investigating dosage regimens for new RA drugs in 2001 was small, about 50 in academia and a similar number in industry.  Therefore, when asked to identify the skilled person, he considered that this notional construct would have been one of those individuals who was actively interested in the field at the relevant date.  The real question is whether, when assessing the question of obviousness, he was aware of, and applied the standard of, the unimaginative skilled person.  I am satisfied that he was aware of the standard, and did apply it, to the prior art which he was asked to consider. </p>

I was in no doubt that Prof Edwards knew a great deal about TNFα inhibitors, both now and in 2001, and was in no way distracted by his work on rituximab when considering the issues in this case. </p>

First, Mr Waugh QC submitted that in spite of her research experience, she approached the issues in this case from the perspective of the prescribing rheumatologist. She expressed a strong preference for personalised medicine, which could be tailored to meet the needs of patients on an individual basis. This is not, in fact, a criticism. Rather, it is an ideal goal, showing an admirable desire to improve the condition of every patient. However, I accept that this does not reflect the approach of the notional, unimaginative rheumatologist involved in the development of dosage regimens for D2E7. I accept the evidence of Prof Edwards, that the skilled clinician would be looking for a dosage regimen which would help the condition of the majority of patients, having regard also to cost considerations, patient convenience and, accordingly, patient compliance. This may explain why Prof Pope suggested two obvious dosage regimens in the light of Kempeni 1999 and Kempeni 2000, which </p>

She was very familiar with AbbVie’s case in relation to the dosage regimen claimed in these patents, having been involved closely with AbbVie’s various legal teams from around the world for a number of years. In the light of this, it is said that Prof Pope’s evidence was not as objective as that of Prof Edwards, and led her to try to defend extreme propositions, and to avoid direct answers to direct questions. It is also submitted that she failed to draw attention to material facts in her reports, which contradicted important parts of her evidence. </p>

The Patents Court is privileged to be educated in technical issues by leading experts, and generally such evidence is of great value. If an expert does not agree with the case advanced by the client, he or she will not be instructed. If an expert concedes a point in cross-examination, that concession will be seized upon by the opposite party, either as evidence of inconsistency, or as conceding a key point in the case. There is nothing wrong in instructing the same expert in several jurisdictions, who may thereby gain a greater awareness of the weaknesses, as well as the strengths, of the case which he/she is supporting. </p>

Prof Pope’s first report explains that, as one would expect, she had been properly instructed in these matters by Herbert Smith Freehills. However, it is not merely a question of an expert stating that he/she has read and understood the relevant duties. Rather, the expert needs to adhere to them strictly. This is likely to involve careful additions and alterations by the expert to draft reports, which are often worked on by many hands. Furthermore, if, during cross-examination, it becomes clear that some part of the expert report is mistaken, it is necessary to say so, rather than doggedly to adhere to the party line. </p>

However, unlike Prof Edwards, I do not consider that she was able to see the opposite side of the picture, or, on occasion, to deal properly with questions arising from her evidence, preferring not to give a direct answer to the question, or to say that she would pass it over to the pharmacologist. I am also concerned about the failure to mention in her reports that she had worked on a biologic for the treatment of RA known as anakinra, the history of which contradicts material parts of her evidence.

It was common ground that the rheumatologist would lead the team. The Claimants’ case is that the rheumatologist would have an understanding of pharmacology, including dose response relationships, and would have access to the input of a clinical pharmacologist as needed. In later stages of drug development and in using an existing therapy in a new indication, it is less likely that the rheumatologist would consult a clinical pharmacologist. AbbVie’s case is that the skilled team would have involved a pharmacologist who would be consulted by the rheumatologist on pharmacological issues. </p>

There are two major subgroups of arthritis – osteoarthritis and inflammatory arthritis. In osteoarthritis, the central process is the mechanical failure of cartilage and reactive overgrowth of bone. By contrast, in inflammatory arthritis either the synovial lining of joints or ligamentous insertions (or both) become inflamed as a result of immune system malfunction. As inflammatory arthritis progresses, the malfunctioning immune system attacks tissue in and around the joint, leading to inflammation, pain, stiffness and ultimately erosion of bone and cartilage. As there is no cure, long term treatment is usually required.  References to "arthritis" in this judgment are to inflammatory arthritis. </p>

I have limited the technical background section to issues relevant to the treatment of RA, as this is the only substantial technical aspect which is still in dispute. In RA, inflammation typically occurs in the synovial tissue lining the internal surfaces of synovial joints. Synovial joints affected are usually the small joints of the hands and feet, ankles, knees, hips, shoulders, wrists and elbows. The autoantibody in RA is known as rheumatoid factor, the presence of which is part of the usual disease criteria for RA. </p>

Methotrexate was originally used in oncology and as an immunosuppressant after transplantation. Amongst immunosuppressives, it was known to be inexpensive, relatively safe and reasonably well tolerated, at least at lower doses, with the most commonly reported side effect being nausea. Methotrexate became more widely used in the 1980s, with the recognition that RA had an immunological basis and that immunosuppressants were likely to slow disease progression. By 2001/2002, the majority of RA patients receiving DMARDs were receiving methotrexate. Roughly one third of patients were not able to take MTX due to either lack of efficacy or (more often) intolerance to the drug (the proportion remains the same today). </p>

In the 1990s, it became more common for rheumatologists to treat patients using a combination of DMARDs. Studies had shown the additive potential of combining certain DMARDs, and controlling the disease improved long-term outcomes. </p>

The generation of ADAs can lead to a reduction of the therapeutic effectiveness of a biologic. By the 1990s, efforts were being made to create biologic agents with a higher proportion of human sequence (as opposed to the early murine monoclonal antibodies), in order to reduce immunogenicity.

The systemic drug exposure is the total exposure that a patient has had to a drug at a given point in time.  If the dose is doubled, the patient will be exposed to double the amount of drug. Professor Johnston states that for drugs with linear kinetics, provided the approximate values of the volume of distribution and the rate of clearance are known, plasma concentrations can be predicted with reasonable confidence. Professor Boddy is of the view that the pharmacokinetics must be fully categorised for this to be the case. I deal with this dispute later in the judgment. </p>

If a drug is given by any other route (such as subcutaneous dosing) the rate and extent of absorption may vary, depending on factors such as drug solubility, blood flow at the site of absorption and the absorption site itself. The fraction of the administered dose that reaches the systemic circulation is referred to as the “bioavailability”.

Sometimes a drug can take longer to move in and out of particular tissues (for instance, a drug may be bound by proteins in the tissues), and the body acts as a two (or more) compartment system.

The maximum tolerated dose is the dose just below the point at which unacceptable adverse events occur (caused by toxicity). The therapeutic window is thus the range in which the drug can be both safely and effectively administered. Administering a drug at the upper end of this range is wasteful as more drug is being administered than is required to produce the target therapeutic effect, which is both costly and unnecessarily risks side effect. </p>

I have already referred to the evidence of Prof Johnston on this issue, which I accept. I also accept the evidence of Prof Edwards that when designing a dosage regimen for D2E7 the skilled person would be looking for a regimen which benefited the majority of patients, and could be adapted for a minority of patients.  For example, as Prof Edwards explained, a dosage regimen of 40mg sc eow of D2E7 would be likely to suit the majority of patients of average weight, but it might need to be adjusted to a weekly regimen for heavier patients. </p>

As explained in my First Report at paragraph 41, although ACR20 sounds modest, it represents a significant improvement for patients, especially for those patients with moderate to severe RA who may have failed to respond to a number of DMARDs.  To obtain ACR20 requires complete reversal of swelling and tenderness in at least some joints. The ACR50 and ACR70 response rates have a significant disadvantage in early studies because the numbers of patients achieving those responses are relatively small and therefore likely to be subject to more variation from trial to trial. Since the rates for ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 tend to follow similar relations when considered across drugs in the same class the ACR20 rate is a practical primary outcome measure. In 2001, ACR20 was generally regarded as the primary efficacy measure on the ACR scale for trials of new drugs.” </p>

Individually tailored dosing is more prevalent in early drug development when solutions are made up on site and administered i.v., or if there are toxicity concerns which require the administration of only the exact amount of drug required. As D2E7 has a wide therapeutic window, a fixed dose could be used (as was the case with etanercept).” </p>

I do not agree with this statement. The Skilled Clinician's preference would be to find an effective and safe dosing regimen that produces the best ratio of benefit to risk in as high a proportion of patients as possible (as I state at Paragraph 3.56 of my First Report). Professor Edwards describes essentially the same approach at the beginning of Paragraph 113: "the Rheumatologist would have wanted to administer the minimum amount of drug capable of producing the maximum therapeutic effect". This overarching aim of the Skilled Clinician would be the only consideration as to whether the ultimate regimen involved fixed doses or variable/weight-based doses; issues such as cost and convenience would not be relevant to the Skilled Clinician at this stage of the clinical trials.” </p>

His view is that the skilled rheumatologist would have considered it promising that the dose response plateau occurred at a relatively low dose, as this meant that a relatively small amount of D2E7 would be needed to elicit the full clinical response. I accept his evidence. </p>

In particular that abstract reports on the proportion of patients achieving the relevant DAS response in each arm, namely 19% for placebo, and 41%, 72%, 67%, 56% and 78% for the increasing treatment arms. So the relevant proportion at 1 mg/kg was 72%, and had plateaued. These would have been understood to be the data to which Kempeni 1999 was referring when it said that the “dose response reach[ed] a plateau at 1 mg/kg D2E7.” </p>

A non placebo controlled, open label study could not be relied on for that purpose. Of itself, it does not provide sufficient information to take forward 0.5 mg/kg every other week, either on an i.v. or subcutaneous basis, and that is not its purpose. However, Kempeni 1999 does not consider DE003 in isolation. Rather, it considers it in combination with the other trials that it reports, including DE001. I consider that the skilled person would draw the following, limited, conclusions from DE003: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.02in">First, the skilled person would understand that a two weekly dosing interval was used in the initial part of the DE003 study because this is roughly equal to the reported half-life of D2E7, and the half-life is often used as a starting point in informing the choice of dosing interval. As stated above, the half-life of D2E7 is reported by Kempeni 1999 to be on average 12.7 days. In practice, it would not be sensible to administer the drug once every 12.7 days, so the dosing interval would be rounded up to two weeks for convenience, as appears to have been done in this study. </p>

This provides some indication to the skilled person of the limit of the dosing interval with the doses tested, which lends some further support to a dosing interval of two weeks, when Kempeni 1999 is read as a whole, including Kempeni 1999’s description of DE001.  </p>

The skilled person would have expected from DE001 that the maximum therapeutic effect would be obtained even with 0.5mg/kg given every two weeks (once a half-life), so even the lowest dose in the DE003 study would produce the maximum response. DE003 would add little to this expectation, but it certainly would not detract from it. </p>

Provided that the two drugs do not interact with one another, the combination is unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of either molecule. I accept this evidence.

When designing a treatment regimen using multiple doses, less than 1 mg/kg could be administered to achieve the same therapeutic effect owing to the accumulation of drug (which occurs when patients are given a further dose before the previous one has entirely left their system). In 2001, and still now, it was generally understood that with repeated dosing once a half-life, this accumulation will mean that each dose is effectively equivalent to double a single dose (i.e. 0.5 mg/kg every half-life would accumulate to be equivalent to a single dose of 1mg/kg). As DE003 tested doses of 0.5mg/kg and 1mg/kg in a two week dosing regimen (in the first part of the extension study), those doses (particularly 0.5mg/kg) would have been of the most interest.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.02in">Fifthly, the rheumatologist's preference would have been to administer D2E7 in fixed doses (a fixed mg amount), rather than variable (mg/kg) dosing, because it is much easier and cheaper to prepare and distribute fixed s.c. doses, rather than preparing syringes with variable doses on a patient-by-patient basis. Individually tailored dosing is more prevalent in early drug development when solutions are made up on site and administered i.v., or if there are toxicity concerns which require the administration of only the exact amount of drug required. As D2E7 has a wide therapeutic window, a fixed dose could be used (as was the case with etanercept). </p>

They would have then multiplied up the amount of drug needed and picked a sensible round number based upon that calculation. With doses of 0.5mg/kg and 1mg/kg and an average patient weight of 72kg, multiplying by 0.5 and 1 would give 36mg and 72mg.

I do not accept this submission. In my judgment, it is important that two experts came to the same view based on the prior art independently of each other.

I also regard it as significant that Prof Johnston had no idea of the dosing regimen for Humira, and did not ask Prof Edwards about it. Indeed, he arrived at the 40 mg sc eow dosage regime from a consideration of Kempeni 1999, without any idea that D2E7 was Humira.  So he had no clue as to any target to aim at.  Furthermore, he did not regard the task as a difficult one, but considered that the conclusion came out of the data very simply. This, in my view, is powerful corroborative evidence of obviousness in the light of Kempeni 1999. </p>

However, as I have explained in paragraph 25 above, the 2.5 week average dosing interval in that study related to the entire patient population, the majority of whom had received doses (potentially multiple doses) of greater than 1 mg/kg (up to 10 times greater).

Prof Boddy was saying that there was insufficient information in the prior art, including in DE003, to perform the calculations illustrated by Prof Johnston’s graph (a contention which he elaborated at [21] and [25] of his evidence). Therefore, his point was not that an alternative graph, such as that shown in X/6, was appropriate, but rather that the whole exercise was unreliable. AbbVie’s case has now shifted, and it positively relies on X/6, which was not supported by its expert evidence. To that extent, Mr Waugh’s point is well founded. </p>

When asked where the peak would be for lower doses, his view was that the therapeutic effect would peak at the same time for all doses; 2/212-214.

If, in the light of the 10 day point, Prof Edwards had accepted that the dosage regimen that he considered obvious would be too low, then this would have clearly made the point that AbbVie now seeks to rely on.  In fact, that proposition was never put to him. Furthermore, subsequent to the cross-examination concerning X/6, he maintained his position that 14 days remained the reasonable period of administration; for example, at 3/272 – 275 and 3/315. Prof Edwards, throughout his evidence, made clear that 0.5 mg/kg every 14 days, or 40 mg sc eow would have been the obvious dosage regimen to pursue, and that he would have included doses of 20mg and 80 mg sc eow as comparators.  I should add that Prof Johnston also maintained his position as to this dosage regimen, in spite of the 10 day point, and it was not put to him that this was unsustainable. </p>

Therefore, if the skilled person had prepared the graph as shown in X/6, and had considered that 14 days was an inappropriate period for a 0.5 mg/kg dose, he would have been badly mistaken.

Prof Edwards explained that Weisman only reported on an open label study, even though an initial, blinded study was undertaken. This is a notable omission. The bias inherent in open label studies was well known. This explains why Weisman (and den Broeder) did not report on any dose response results in the conclusion, because they would not have been reliable. Prof Boddy accepted that it was basic knowledge that blinding in clinical trials was used to eliminate bias.

I do not accept that the skilled person would share these reservations, and, for the reasons set out above, I prefer Prof Johnston’s view. Furthermore, I have concluded that, on reading Kempeni 1999, the pharmacologist would conclude that D2E7 has simple pharmacokinetics and that it can be treated as a one compartment system.  </p>

My view is that the message is clear – that there were no material differences between the three treatment arms, and statistically they could not be separated. Prof Pope appeared to resist this during her cross-examination at 5/777, on the basis that the phrase “statistically equally efficacious” is meaningless, but I did not find her evidence helpful on this point. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.02in;text-indent:0.5in">First, there were obvious drivers towards bi-weekly, rather than weekly, dosing and I have accepted Prof Edwards’ evidence on this issue.  These included a preference for infrequent dosing as patients inherently dislike injections; the fact that fewer syringes would have to be filled, packaged, delivered and administered; the fact that experience with etanercept had shown the potential for injection site reactions; and the fact that a longer dosing interval would represent a practical improvement over etanercept (which was then dosed twice a week). In considering the dosing interval, the rheumatologist would have noted the information in Kempeni 1999 and repeated in Kempeni 2000. For the reasons which I have discussed above, the rheumatologist would have considered a one or two week dosing interval to be viable as an effective treatment and two weeks would have been preferred. </p>

In order to achieve that when a weekly dosing interval was increased to dosing every two weeks, the team would expect to approximately double the dose that was used every week (i.e. based on 20mg every week, 40mg would be given every other week). Kempeni 2000 reinforces Prof Edwards’ view arising from Kempeni 1999 that 40 mg given every other week would be an obvious dosing regimen to choose.  </p>

AbbVie made a series of applications, the effect of which, if successful, would have been to avoid a trial in the United Kingdom.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.02in">The Particulars of Claim in their original form in FKB1 sought to revoke two granted patents, namely the 656 patent and the 322 patent. The 656 patent claimed the use of adalimumab in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis by the 40 mg sc eow dosage regimen. The application for the 656 patent was filed on 5 June 2002. It was not granted by the EPO until eleven years later, on 9 June 2013. During the nine month opposition period following grant, fifteen oppositions were submitted. AbbVie eventually filed its observations in response to the oppositions, together with no less than nineteen statements of fact and expert reports, on 22 December 2014. On 24 April 2015 AbbVie requested the grant of a divisional from the 656 patent (“the Fourth Divisional Application”), having previously requested the grant of three other divisionals. Between August and October 2015 various opponents submitted replies to the observations filed on behalf of AbbVie. However, on 4 November 2015, six days after the Claim Form was issued in FKB1, AbbVie wrote to the EPO stating that it no longer approved the text of the granted 656 patent. Accordingly, the EPO revoked the 656 patent on 16 November 2015.  The Fourth Divisional Application, which claimed essentially the same subject matter as the 656 patent, was published on 4 November 2015. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.02in">FKB pleaded these facts by amendment to its Particulars of Claim. It alleged that AbbVie intended to delay the entry of competing Humira biosimilar products by prolonging commercial uncertainty.  FKB claimed that the purpose of abandoning the 656 patent was to avoid adjudication on its patentability by the UK court and the Opposition Division, whilst seeking to ensure that the subject matter of the 656 patent was maintained by the Fourth Divisional Application.  The object, according to FKB, was to prevent FKB from clearing the way in respect of its FKB327 biosimilar after expiration of the SPC for the basic adalimumab patent. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.02in">AbbVie disputed that there was any connection between its decision to abandon the 656 patent and the commencement of the UK proceedings by FKB. It claimed that a late insufficiency objection had given rise to its decision. This was strongly disputed by the Claimants in the evidence of their solicitors, who pointed out that the explanation, after so many years of opposition, was not credible.  The Claimants wished to cross-examine Ms Rich, who gave evidence about the insufficiency objection, which was relied on by AbbVie in its strike out applications in these proceedings. However, that evidence was withdrawn from the trial by AbbVie, who nonetheless continued to advance the same explanation, based on a letter from its Patent Attorney to the EPO. No witness statement was provided by the Patent Attorney, and the letter was not placed under a Civil Evidence Act Notice. So there was no evidence at trial to support AbbVie’s explanation. </p>

I do not consider that it was credible, for the reasons explained by Mr Inman in his evidence. Knowing that it was disputed, AbbVie took steps to ensure that it could not be tested in cross-examination. Furthermore, subsequent events have confirmed, in my judgment, that AbbVie has abandoned all relevant UK patent protection in order to avoid scrutiny by the UK Court, and to prolong commercial uncertainty as to the validity of those patents. The claim that the 656 patent was abandoned because of a late insufficiency objection needs to be considered in this context. </p>

Not only is there no evidence to support this assertion, but also there is a positive reason not to accept it. The Claimants rely upon a pending EP application (X3) with examples reporting clinical trials of the 40 mg sc eow regimen (plus a loading dose) for psoriasis, from which a further psoriasis divisional could be derived. I accept the Claimants’ submissions on this issue.  In the absence of any evidence from AbbVie, I am not prepared to find that it is impossible for any European patent rights to arise out of the 322 patent family, or other families which enable the same subject matter to be claimed. The filing of the Fifth Divisional Application shortly prior to withdrawal of the GB designation from the 044 patent lends further support to the Claimants’ submission.

As I set out in the FKB1 judgment, during 2015, Mr Gonzalez expressed AbbVie’s intention to seek injunctive relief to prevent “at-risk” launches of products which are biosimilar to Humira. Mr Inman stated at 5.41 that “FKB therefore takes AbbVie’s statements that it “intends to enforce [its IP] vigorously” and that it will “seek injunctive relief” to apply equally to its European Humira patent portfolio.” This was not challenged in reply evidence served on behalf of AbbVie. Given the commercial importance of Humira, it would be surprising if AbbVie did not intend to enforce patent rights which it may be granted in the future by seeking injunctive relief. </p>

I also consider it material that AbbVie called no evidence, whether from Mr Gonzalez or anyone else, to challenge the assertion of worldwide threats. Furthermore, I do not accept that all of the statements can be regarded as limited to the US, or as relating to commercial issues. I consider that Mr Gonzalez clearly represented that AbbVie would make every effort to enforce its patent estate against biosimilar competition anywhere in the world.  </p>

A claimant cannot seek an Arrow declaration simply because it would like to know whether a patent application in the course of prosecution will result in a valid patent. The course envisaged by the statute is that he should wait and see what, if any, patent is granted. The statutory remedy does not constitute a bar in principle to the granting of declaratory relief in appropriate cases, however. Where, for example, it appears that the statutory remedy is being frustrated by shielding subject matter from scrutiny in the national court, it should be open to the court to intervene.

Had the patents not been voluntarily dedesignated or revoked, FKB would have had the opportunity to seek findings of invalidity of granted patents in the usual way. Those findings would have gone a long way to establishing its freedom to operate before launch.

The undertakings are complicated and very long. They do not refer to anticipation or obviousness, and they do not acknowledge that the Claimants’ products were anticipated or obvious at the priority date(s). AbbVie undertakes not to obtain patent protection in the UK that would be infringed by certain dosage regimens, which is difficult to follow, as it begs the question as to whether such patent protection will be applied for, and if so, why it would not be infringed. This is clarified by the avoidance of doubt provision at the end of the undertaking, but none of this is easy to understand, particularly for companies seeking to do business with the Claimants in respect of their biosimilars. Such companies would need to understand why the undertaking is limited to patent claims which claim a priority date of 8 June 2001 or later and would also need to understand, and believe, that AbbVie has abandoned all existing patent protection to these dosage regimens in the UK. </p>

At [2.8(a) – (b)] of his eleventh Statement, Mr Inman expressed concern as to the “chilling effect” in the market, in the absence of a declaration, in that manufacturers of products are likely to find it more difficult to enter into an agreement with a prospective EU marketing partner, when despite the UK being patent free, the rest of the EU remained subject to the threat of potential patent litigation. He explained that, as a practical matter, due to the international nature of the industry, most biosimilar manufacturers will be unable to confine their manufacture and supply chain to within the UK, so the UK market may not be able to be exploited without being at risk of AbbVie’s patents in other jurisdictions. </p>

She stated that once manufactured or imported into the EU, a pharmaceutical product may be transferred to other countries for QA release in accordance with EMA requirements, and may be transferred elsewhere for filling into vials, packaging and labelling before being stored at a central distribution hub. An injunction obtained at any of these locations could disrupt the European supply chain, including supply to the UK market.

AbbVie did not rely on any evidence in answer to the evidence of Mr Inman and Dr Gilbert, and chose not to explore it in crossexamination. Mr Gonzalez’s threats of worldwide litigation are intended to have, and are likely to have had, a chilling effect on competition from biosimilars, including on third-party suppliers. That is likely to impede the Claimants’ ability to market successfully their products in the United Kingdom. I consider that the grant of declarations, in these circumstances, will serve a useful purpose. </p>

The Claimants submit that a declaration that a material part of AbbVie’s portfolio cannot be enforced in the UK would change the parties’ negotiation leverage and promote settlement on fairer terms. This, it is said, is of direct benefit in the UK (as well as the rest of the world) as AbbVie may seek to enforce other patents in the UK (for example formulation patents). </p>

AbbVie would need to take account of the fact that the Court has declared that it cannot prevent the marketing of the Claimants’ products in spite of AbbVie’s public statements to the contrary, which have extended to Europe in general.  </p>
