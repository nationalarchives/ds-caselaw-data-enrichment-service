Most of the relevant portfolio was acquired from Ericsson.  Unwired Planet’s business is licensing those patents to companies who make and sell telecommunications equipment such as mobile phones and infrastructure.  This action began in March 2014 when Unwired Planet sued Huawei, Samsung and Google for infringement of six UK patents from their portfolio.  Five were claimed to be SEPs (see below).  Unwired Planet contended their patents were infringed and (so far as relevant) essential.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The dispute was managed to consist of a series of trials, docketed to me.  First would be five “technical” trials relating to the validity and infringement/essentiality of the six patents (two patents are divisionals).  These were called trials A to E and were to run from October 2015 to July 2016.  The patent in trial A was patent EP (UK) 2 229 744 which is for an invention concerning poll triggers, the patents in trial B were divisionals EP (UK) 2 119 287 and EP (UK) 2 485 514 which are for an invention related to selfconfiguring networks, the patent in trial C was EP (UK) 1 230 818 which relates to inter-RAT handover, the patent in trial D was EP (UK) 1 105 991 which related to Hadamard codes, and the patent in trial E was EP (UK) 0 989 712 which relates to network messaging.  The 712 patent was not said to be a SEP.   </p>

The nontechnical trial was to address all the competition law issues as well as the FRAND issues (see below), injunctive relief (if any) and, by a later direction, damages for past infringements.  Finally, and only if necessary, there might be a further trial to deal with some outstanding questions including pass through licences.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">This judgment arises from the non-technical trial and relates to the patents which are or are said to be Standards Essential Patents or SEPs.  Part of the process of standardisation involves holders of patents which are essential to an international telecommunications standard declaring them as essential to the relevant standards body.  In this case that body is the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).  The ETSI IPR Policy requires that a patentee declaring patents as essential to a standard commits to licensing those patents on FRAND terms.  FRAND stands for Fair Reasonable And Non-Discriminatory.  The judgment mostly concerns FRAND. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">After proceedings began, in April 2014, Unwired Planet made an open offer to the defendants to license its entire global portfolio (SEPs and non-SEPs).  The defendants denied infringement/essentiality and contended the patents were invalid, counterclaiming for revocation.  So, they said, no licence was needed.  They also contended that Unwired Planet’s offer was not FRAND.  In addition, Huawei and Samsung raised defences and counterclaims based on breaches of competition law.  This involved both arguments about Art 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) relating to the Master Sale Agreement (MSA) whereby Unwired Planet acquired patents from Ericsson and arguments about Art 102 TFEU concerning abuse of dominant position.  The allegation that the offer was not FRAND was pleaded as a breach of competition law.  These allegations were the subject of counterclaims against other companies in what was then the Unwired Planet group (the ninth and tenth defendants) as well as against Ericsson, who were joined as the eleventh </p>

The terms of these and other licensing offers are difficult to summarise but at this stage it can be said that the SEP royalty rates in the July 2014 proposals were global rates of 0.2% for 4G/-LTE and 0.1% for other standards (i.e. GSM/UMTS).  The percentages related to average selling price (ASP) for mobile devices and revenue for infrastructure.  These offers and other of Unwired Planet’s offers also contained US dollar or sterling alternative figures which operated as a cap if the royalty expressed as a share of ASP would be a higher sum.  This is the last time I will mention them.  The caps did not play a significant part in this case.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Sometimes in this case the terms 2G, 3G and 4G are used to refer to different standards and sometimes GSM, UMTS (or WCDMA) and LTE respectively.  They are not the same but the distinction rarely matters.  In this judgment I have tried to use the terms which reflect the way the argument and evidence went in any given context but it is impossible to be consistent.  A complication is multimode handsets.  A 4G/LTE handset will usually be able to work on earlier standards (2G/GSM and 3G/UMTS).  It is therefore “multimode”.  There can be exceptions and so calling a handset 4G or LTE can be ambiguous since it probably refers to a multimode device but might not.  Again it is impossible to be consistent.   </p>

Unwired Planet’s June 2015 proposals included offers of a worldwide SEP portfolio licence, a UK SEP portfolio licence (the UK portfolio consists of more patents than just the five SEPs in suit) and per-patent licences for any SEPs the licensee chose.  The details do not matter at this stage but one point to note is that the royalties claimed for per-patent licences or a UK portfolio were higher than the global rate on offer.   The rates all scaled by reference to the same global rate proposals as in 2014, i.e. a global rate of 0.2% for LTE and 0.1% for GSM/UMTS. </p>

Huawei argued that the result it contended for followed from a combination of three steps: first, Huawei had stated that it no longer intended to maintain that Unwired Planet was obliged to offer per-patent licences, second, therefore the only thing on offer from Huawei was a UK SEP portfolio offer and Huawei had undertaken to accept whatever royalty rate the court set for that licence, and third, a licence of that scope was one of Unwired Planet’s offers.  Consequently, Huawei submitted, a licence of that scope must be the outcome.  This was so even though it was obvious that what Unwired Planet really wanted was a global licence and even though global rates and the FRAND status of global offers were at the heart of the dispute.

Huawei did not criticise these witnesses but they did point out a very odd aspect of Mr Bezant’s evidence.  In cross-examination Mr Bezant repeatedly stated that he was not attempting to value the Unwired Planet portfolio but only seeking to express a view on whether Unwired Planet’s various offers were or were not FRAND.  One aspect of this made sense in that Mr Bezant was presenting a range of licence rates with a view to explaining simply that a given rate fell within the range.  Huawei sought to suggest that this had something to do with the procedural argument about global rate setting and suggested that in that sense Mr Bezant was the same as Mr Lasinski (Huawei’s expert) in that he too was only concerned with what Huawei called “the binary question of whether Unwired Planet’s offers were or were not FRAND?”.  However, I do not accept these suggestions. The point is just as odd in the context of setting a UK only rate as setting a global rate and Huawei positively asked the court to set a UK only rate.  In the end whatever Mr Bezant’s purpose, or for that matter Mr Lasinski’s, they both gave evidence which is relevant to the question of the value of the Unwired Planet portfolio.  I suspect that what was really going on was that Mr Bezant was purporting to avoid answering the question of what in his opinion would be the correct FRAND rate for Unwired Planet. </p>

Its purpose was to develop technology concerned with how mobile devices (phones) could access the internet.  In 1996 Libris changed its name to Unwired Planet Inc. and launched its first commercial product, called up.link, which was a mobile network system.  In 1998 Unwired Planet was a member of the WAP Forum.  At the time WAP was an early approach to mobile internet access.  The WAP forum included Ericsson, Motorola and Nokia.  Between 1999 and 2001 what had been Unwired Planet was now called Openwave Systems Inc.  In 2002 Openwave was one of 200 companies to found the Open Mobile Alliance.  This group included the WAP Forum companies.  The general aim of both groups was similar, to try and come up with global standardised protocols for mobile internet and to lobby standard setting organisations.  Openwave continued to develop mobile internet technology but by the time Mr Robbins joined in 2011 the company’s success was uncertain.  That was because of a shift in the balance of power away from Openwave’s customers (carriers) and towards device makers like </p>

In November 2011 Openwave decided to sell its product business and concentrate on earning revenue from its intellectual property.  After the sale the business was renamed Unwired Planet and so Unwired Planet became a licensing business.  Unwired Planet was staffed by a small group of IP specialists and accountants.  The business had a portfolio of patents and applications, now called the Openwave Legacy Portfolio.  The portfolio consists of 140 implementation patent families.  Unwired Planet believed it contained significant value.   </p>

The transaction completed in February 2012. Since then Ericsson has remained active in infrastructure.  Its largest competitor is Huawei.  At the same time, Ericsson started thinking about selling some patents.  Ericsson’s motives for this come up later.  Part of this exercise involved identifying organisations which might take some patents from Ericsson with a view to licensing them to the industry.  The patents would include SEPs.  At some point before June 2012, Ericsson identified Unwired Planet as a possible candidate. </p>

During the negotiations possible royalty rates were discussed.  The evidence is clear that Unwired Planet did not see Ericsson’s actual royalty rates, because the licences were confidential.

The initial list of manufacturers did not include Huawei but by April 2013 Unwired Planet had identified Huawei as a company to be contacted by the end of June.  Unwired Planet decided to offer a flat rate of $1 per LTE multimode handset.  Taking a handset sale price as $200, that would be 0.5%.

The significance of this point is that while I accept Huawei’s case that this first approach from Unwired Planet to Huawei via Evercore concerned a purchase and not licensing (contrary to suggestions from Unwired Planet), nevertheless, as Unwired Planet submit, by 2013 Huawei ought to have known that they would need a licence from Unwired Planet to continue to use SEPs they had formerly licensed from Ericsson.  There is no evidence Huawei considered this point at the time at all and I doubt they did.   In crossexamination Mr Zhang made the point that since Unwired Planet were trying to sell the patents it had acquired from Ericsson, then from Huawei’s point of view it was not clear the patents would remain with Unwired Planet.   They might be sold on elsewhere.  That is true but it does not take away the force in Unwired Planet’s point that after early 2013 Huawei knew all they needed to know to appreciate that certain SEPs which they had formerly licensed were now held by a different company and, if and to the extent a licence was required, it would have to come from Unwired Planet or its successors.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The point of FRAND in standard setting is fairly easy to understand.  Standards exist so that different manufacturers can produce equipment which is interoperable with the result that the manufacturers compete with one another.  So the phone makers compete in the market for phones and the public can select a phone from any supplier and be sure (for example) that if it is a 4G phone, it will work with any 4G network.  As a society we want the best, most up to date technology to be incorporated into the latest standards and that will involve incorporating patented inventions.  While the inventor must be entitled to a fair return for the use of their invention, in order for the standard to permit interoperability the inventor must not be able to prevent others from using the patented invention incorporated in the standard as long as implementers take an appropriate licence and pay a fair royalty.  In this way a balance is struck, in the public interest, between the inventor and the implementers.  The appropriate licence is one which is fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory.  That way a standard can safely incorporate the invention claimed in a patent without giving the inventor or his successors in title unwarranted power over those who implement the standard.  Thus the public interest is served because telecommunication standards can be set using the best and most up-to-date technical expedients available and the inventor’s private interest is served because the FRAND undertaking ensures they or their successors will obtain a fair reward for their invention. </p>

Within the Directives, as an annex to the Guide to IPRs, is an IPR Policy.  The policy and the rules have been adjusted over time but none of the issues before me turn on any differences.  Article 4.1 of the ETSI IPR Policy requires members of ETSI to inform ETSI of "ESSENTIAL IPRs" in a timely fashion.  ESSENTIAL and IPR are defined terms (article 15).  A patent which would inevitably be infringed by operating in accordance with a standard is an example of an ESSENTIAL IPR.  By definition a SEP is an ESSENTIAL IPR.  Once an ESSENTIAL IPR has been declared by its owner to ETSI, the owner will be requested by ETSI (Article 6.1 of the ETSI IPR Policy) to give an irrevocable undertaking in writing that it is prepared to grant irrevocable licences on FRAND terms.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">ETSI was established in 1988 and the FRAND undertaking was developed by it with the close involvement of the European Commission, which reflects the importance of FRAND from the point of view of competition policy.  The first public formulation by the Commission of a specific requirement for FRAND terms in the context of IP and standardisation was in a paper “<span style="font-style:italic">Communication on Intellectual Property Rights and Standardisation</span>” on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 1992 (COM (92) 445 final at 4.3.3).  Nevertheless the concept has its origin in US anti-trust law (see <span style="font-style:italic">“A Brief History of FRAND: Analyzing Current Debates in Standard Setting and Antitrust Through a Historical Lens</span>” Jorge Contreras 80 Antitrust Law Journal 39 (2015)).  In the US it is sometimes called “RAND” rather than FRAND but there is no material difference between the two.  The idea of FRAND licences for patents essential to standards is not unique to ETSI. It is something other international SSOs require as well (e.g. the IEEE and ITU referred to by US District Judge James Robart in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Microsoft v Motorola</span> Case C10-1823JLR, 2013 US Dist LEXIS 60233 (W.D.

The authorities and the economics literature have identified a countervailing factor called “reverse hold up” or “hold out”.  The idea is that an unscrupulous licensee may use their economic strength to avoid paying anything to a patentee, unduly dragging out the process of licence negotiation, thereby putting the patentee to additional cost and forcing it to accept a lower royalty rate than is fair.

In my judgment what counts is that both hold up and hold out are possible and both concepts are relevant in analysing a given set of facts.  Unscrupulous behaviour by either the patentee or the licensee can lead to unfairness.  In order to arrive at fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory licence terms the patentee must not engage in hold up nor must the licensee engage in hold out.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">When talking about FRAND economists refer to the idea that the FRAND rate represents the rate which would be agreed “ex ante”, in other words before the patented invention is adopted into the standard.  This is another way of saying that the rate seeks to eliminate hold up and to that extent is uncontroversial.  In the concurrent evidence session Prof Neven explained that he did not regard FRAND as a scheme which meant the patentee could not appropriate some of the value that is associated with the inclusion of his technology into the standard and the value of the products that are using those standards.  Dr Niels agreed with that.  Neither side disputed this and to the extent it is a matter for the economists, I accept their evidence.  The economists’ opinions show that it is not necessary to deprive the patentee of its fair share of those two sources of value in order to eliminate hold up and fulfil the purpose of FRAND.  To that extent I may be differing from certain parts of the decisions in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Innovatio IP Ventures</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Ericsson v D-Link</span> in the US but it is not necessary to look into that any further since neither side before me took the point.  </p>

The first is whether making an ETSI declaration forms a contract at all.  The second dimension relates to Art 1121 of the old French Civil Code and the French law doctrine of <span style="font-style:italic">stipulation pour autrui</span>, in other words the law whereby third parties may acquire enforceable legal rights against one party to a contract.   The third dimension relates to the nature of any obligation which does arise, Prof Libchaber expressing the view that it is not the usual practice for French courts to compel a party to enter into a contract.

Prof Libchaber’s view is that that is not sufficient to support the theory that making a declaration triggers the formation of a contract under French law because the entry of the patent in the database is not the counterpart to a declaration but rather a tool designed to assist interested parties in finding out which patents have been declared essential and are said to be available to license.  His view is that it is artificial to analyse this as if it were a contractual advantage, and he doubted that a declarant would be able to compel ETSI to enter the declaration into the IPR database if this procedural step were not taken.   He also pointed out that while the registration procedure may be implicit from the Policy, it appears nowhere in the Licensing Forms and so while the registration of the patent in the ETSI database could be seen as an obligation on ETSI where the declaration is made by an ETSI member, there will be no such obligation where the declaration is made by a nonmember.  </p>

To that extent steps (i) to (iv) are too narrowly stated but the difference does not matter.  These are the provisions in the ETSI Directives to which the IPR Policy is an annex.  Article 3.1.2 explains that the database allows online access to declarations such as those in issue in this case.  The third sentence of the Article states as follows:  </p>

It shows that Prof FauvarqueCosson is correct to say that after receiving a declaration ETSI will include or maintain the declared essential patent(s) on the ETSI IPR database.  Moreover, as the statement explains, unless otherwise stated the owners of the IPRs on the database will have given a FRAND undertaking.  Article 3.1.2 is an express and public statement of what ETSI will do when it receives declarations.  In my judgment the fact it is not mentioned in the declaration form is irrelevant.  On its face this article applies whether the declarant is a member of ETSI or not and it would make little sense otherwise.  I am not persuaded by Prof Libchaber’s view that at best this might be applicable to members rather than non-members. </p>

However English contract law would not weigh up the relative values of the promise and the consideration for it and neither Professor suggested French law would do that either.  Prof Libchaber’s view is that a requirement to put the declaration on the database is not “sufficient” to support the contract but that was not because of its inconsequential nature, it is because of the Professor’s view that it is not the counterpart of the declaration but rather a tool to assist interested parties.  I accept that placing the declarations on the public database is a tool to assist interested parties but I do not accept that this is not a “counterpart” to the declaration.  If Prof Libchaber is just referring to the fact that the database is not mentioned in the declaration form then I have dealt with that point.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Considering the issue as a matter of substance, the placing of the declaration on the database is indeed the counterpart to the declaration because the purpose of the declaration from ETSI’s point of view is to provide information which will be useful to give notice to standard setters and implementers.  That information involves two important facts: first the existence of a patent which is, or at least which the owner contends is, essential to the standards, and second the fact that the owner is prepared to grant licences on FRAND terms.  A declaration to ETSI which is not made public on the database is much less useful.  Furthermore publication on ETSI’s own database of the assertion of essentiality and of the undertaking to enter into FRAND licences has a value to a patentee seeking to license its rights and obtain fair return for the use of its invention.  </p>

In the Article ETSI is offering to declarants to behave in a particular way if a proper declaration is provided.  It seems to me therefore that a person who provided a properly completed declaration form to ETSI would be entitled to expect ETSI to do what it says it will do in Article 3.1.2.  In that case ETSI is obliged by Article 3.1.2 to place the declared IPR on the database in a manner which shows that an undertaking has been given, i.e. not to “otherwise specify”.

Either choice has a clear effect – either the declaration will relate to IPRs contained in technical contributions made by the declarant or its affiliates or else it will relate to all its IPRs. There is nothing uncertain in either option but in any case a general declaration is not the only option available.  A declarant can list the IPRs to which the declaration relates and in such a case there is no lack of clarity at all.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The second point is about the standards to which the IPR is declared to be essential.  Declaring IPRs as essential to all ETSI standards is not unclear, it is simply wide.  And while a wide declaration like that may not help an implementer decide if they need a licence in particular circumstances, the database does not warrant that the IPRs are in fact essential in any case.  The implementer will always have to form their own view about that (or have the matter resolved in court).  I suppose a declarant could define the standards in an ambiguous way but regardless of how realistic the possibility is, it does not undermine the clarity or enforceability of the process itself.  Assuming the declarant identifies the relevant standards sufficiently then the declaration will be clear and the undertaking could be enforced.   </p>

If they do refuse it means that ETSI will know that there are patents alleged to be essential for which no FRAND undertaking is available.  This is vital information and the ETSI Directives have a number of provisions dealing with the possibility (Article 8 of the ETSI IPR Policy).  Broadly in that case ETSI will try and ensure that whatever the relevant technology is, it is removed from the standards. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Prof Libchaber does not agree with this.  He explained that the doctrine was not commonplace in French law because the conditions were rarely satisfied and there were two classic situations in which it applies – insurance (e.g. where a person takes out an insurance policy on their life, in which someone else is the beneficiary) and shipping (e.g. where a sender contracts with a carrier for the benefit of a recipient of goods).  Prof Libchaber’s particular objections were these. First he did not agree that a contract between the declarant and ETSI was formed at all.  I agree that such a contract is a necessary element for the doctrine to apply but I have already found that such a contract is formed.  Second he did not consider the doctrine applied because ETSI imposes no requirement as to what the terms of any contract between the declarant and ETSI were.  In other words, declarants can choose to declare IPRs to ETSI but not give a FRAND undertaking or do so conditionally.  Again I have addressed this already.  Prof Libchaber is right that a declarant can choose not to give the FRAND undertaking or to attach conditions to it.  However the fact that the declarant has options does not seem to me to undermine the existence of a legally enforceable contract at least in the relevant case, in which the declarant gives an unconditional FRAND undertaking.  Prof Libchaber’s view was that the doctrine could only apply if ETSI was imposing a particular obligation on the declarant instead of permitting them to choose between several options, but I do not see why that follows.  An insurer could provide an insured with different options such as levels of cover but that would not undermine the contract between the two once it was formed on the basis of whatever option the insured had chosen nor would it undermine the fact that the contract was for the benefit of a third party.   </p>

As for the terms of future contracts, the form makes an unambiguous reference to Clause 6.1 of the ETSI IPR Policy.  That policy expressly provides that a future licence will be available on FRAND terms.  The issue of what FRAND terms are is addressed below.  At this stage the key point is that (as I have found below) it is possible for a court to adjudicate whether a licence is or is not FRAND.  Whether terms are FRAND is an objective matter for a given set of circumstances and therefore whether a FRAND undertaking has been complied with can be determined as a matter of law.  In that sense the undertaking is legally enforceable.  Knowing that the licence will be on FRAND terms is all the parties need to know.   </p>

However that is no reason not to apply it to the relatively new problem of how to facilitate the setting of standards in rapidly developing areas of technology and balance the public benefit of access to the latest and best technology for these standards with the appropriate incentives for inventors and investors in technological innovation.  The FRAND undertaking sought by ETSI when a patentee declares its patents as essential to an ETSI standard is an undertaking given in terms to confer a benefit on third parties.  I accept Prof Fauvarque-Cosson’s analysis and find that the doctrine of “<span style="font-style:italic">stipulation pour autrui</span>” applies to the FRAND undertaking and renders it enforceable by third parties.  </p>

Prof Libchaber expressed the view that it is not the usual practice for French courts to compel a party to enter into a contract and that therefore the limit of the terms of Clause 6.1 as interpreted by a French court would be to impose an obligation owed by the declarant to third party implementers to make a good faith attempt to negotiate a FRAND licence. So he explained this is another reason why “<span style="font-style:italic">stipulation pour autrui</span>” does not apply, because for it to apply the right must be capable of specific performance, and on this analysis it is not.  He explained that to form a licence contract French law would require the parties to agree on both the IPR covered by the agreement and thle royalties to be payable.  If the royalty was not agreed, there can be no contract and a French court would not set the applicable price.  French law (Art L613-8 §5 of the Intellectual Property Code) requires an intellectual property licence to be in writing otherwise it is a nullity and so without a specific form, there can be no contract.

In other words, even if a patentee cannot be compelled to enter into a contract by specific performance of the FRAND undertaking, that undertaking can still have substantive legal effect.  As mentioned already FRAND is an objective standard.  Courts concerned with patent cases in a number of countries around the world have set FRAND rates and this court will do so too.  If a patentee refuses to enter into a licence which a court has determined is FRAND then, subject to the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Vringo</span> problem which I will consider below, a court can and in my judgment should normally refuse to grant relief for patent infringement.  The converse applies to an implementer who refuses to accept a FRAND licence.  In that case the normal relief for patent infringement should normally follow.  Thus there is no need for contract law to go as far as creating a power to compel parties to enter into FRAND licences against their will because patent law already has the tools available to give legal effect to the FRAND undertaking.  </p>

The circumstances are idealised in various ways – for example there is no hold up and no hold out.  The FRAND royalty rate arrived at in that way may not be the same as the rate actually decided upon by a court or an arbitrator and Prof Neven strikingly contemplated that the court’s judgment on a FRAND rate would inevitably be incorrect at least to some degree since it would always be an imperfect approximation to the “true” FRAND rate for a given circumstance since it would inevitably be based on limited evidence.  This illustrates an important aspect of the economists’ approach to FRAND.  For a given set of circumstances there is only one FRAND rate and, by parity of reasoning therefore, only one FRAND set of licence terms. </p>

That is this case.  Even if the dispute is only about a royalty rate then the problem still arises because if there can be a range of FRAND rates then asking if a rate is FRAND does not provide the court with a basis for resolving the dispute.  If there can be a FRAND range then in order to adjudicate that a particular rate is the “right” rate in the circumstances either there needs to be some further principle to apply aside from FRAND or the parties would have to agree to accept whatever rate the court chooses in the exercise of its discretion.  The equitable discretion relating to the injunction does not solve this problem.

At first sight it seems uncontroversial to state that the criterion which defines whether SEP licensing conduct does or does not amount to an abuse of dominant position in EU competition law (Art 102 TFEU) is whether the licence terms are FRAND as defined by the ETSI undertaking.  However if only one set of terms in given circumstances can truly be FRAND and if FRAND also represents the line between abusive and non-abusive conduct then every agreed licence in the entire industry is at a serious risk of being contrary to competition law and open to being unwound.  Simply as an illustration of the potential significance of this point, consider the impact of Huawei’s submission that the global nature of a licence means it cannot be FRAND because it amounts to illegal bundling.  All the numerous comparable licences in evidence are global.  </p>

Both economists agreed that for a royalty rate to amount to excessive pricing it would have to be substantially more than FRAND.  How much more that is will depend on all the circumstances but whatever it is, the point demonstrates that a royalty rate can be at least somewhat higher than the true FRAND rate and still not be contrary to competition law.  Therefore, as a matter of principle, the boundary between what is and is not a true FRAND rate as defined by the ETSI undertaking is not and cannot be necessarily co-extensive with competition law.  In other words the premise which I described above as at first sight uncontroversial, is not correct.  Competition law considerations may well indicate why a rate is not FRAND but in general and as a matter of principle, for competition law to be engaged, it will be necessary but not sufficient for a rate not to be the true FRAND rate.  Again, the logic applicable to royalty rates is applicable to any licence term. </p>

In my judgment the answer to this objection is that such an agreement has different effects from the point of view of competition law and the ETSI undertaking.  In terms of competition law, the fact that terms have been agreed does not and cannot mean that they avoid the scrutiny or effect of that law.  So, if the agreed terms are so far from FRAND as to contravene competition law, then that would no doubt make the terms unenforceable and have the other consequences of a breach of competition law.  However in terms of the ETSI FRAND undertaking, there is no reason why the undertaking should entitle either party subsequently to challenge agreed terms as being non-FRAND absent competition law considerations.  If parties agree licence terms then their rights and obligations under the ETSI FRAND undertaking will be discharged and replaced by their contractual rights under the licence.  Thus having only one set of true FRAND terms for a given situation would not create a practical problem for operators based on competition law nor would it undermine the purpose and efficacy of the ETSI FRAND undertaking.   </p>

Both parties would be entitled to insist on FRAND terms and neither would be entitled to insist on anything other than FRAND terms.

If the ETSI undertaking demands that offers made by a patentee must themselves consist of FRAND terms, then that would condemn patentees to always end up with negotiated rates below a FRAND rate.  Therefore it makes much more sense to interpret the ETSI FRAND obligation as applicable primarily to the finally agreed terms rather than to the offers.  In other words, it is an obligation to enter into FRAND licences.  The same logic also applies to implementers: an obligation on implementers to make FRAND <span style="font-style:italic">offers</span> as opposed to enter into FRAND licences would have them paying rates higher than the FRAND rate. </p>

Although the ETSI FRAND undertaking is an obligation imposed on the patentee, I agree with Unwired Planet that it also has the effect of creating an obligation applicable to the implementer, as follows.  Although some implementers are themselves ETSI members, the ETSI FRAND undertaking must work in the same way whether the implementer is a member of ETSI or not.  The implementer, as an implementer, owes no contractual duties to ETSI at all and the implementer has no duty to ETSI to offer FRAND terms to a patentee.  However the logic of the FRAND undertaking means that an implementer must negotiate fairly if it wishes to take advantage of the constraint which the patentee’s FRAND undertaking places on the patentee’s rights.  Just as an implementer is entitled to demand FRAND terms in a licence from a patentee subject to the ETSI FRAND undertaking, so a patentee is entitled to demand FRAND terms in the same licence.  In other words, an implementer who does not negotiate fairly is not a willing licensee and may ultimately be subject to an injunction. </p>

Both patentees and implementers should take a FRAND approach to the negotiation of a licence under a SEP or SEP portfolio governed by a FRAND undertaking.  The patentee is obliged by contract to take a FRAND approach to the negotiation and to grant a licence on FRAND terms.  The implementer must take a FRAND approach to the negotiation and accept a licence on FRAND terms if it wishes to take advantage of the constraint on the patentee’s rights imposed by the FRAND undertaking.  A FRAND approach to negotiation does not mean that parties cannot negotiate in good faith and a FRAND approach will allow for starting offers which leave room for negotiation.  The fact an opening offered rate is higher than the true FRAND rate does not mean of itself that a patentee has failed to take a FRAND approach any more than the converse could be said about an implementer.  On the other hand, making extreme offers and taking an intransigent approach which prejudice fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory negotiation is not a FRAND approach. </p>

That is the diversity of terms in the real agreements in the industry.  Does a conclusion that only one set of terms is FRAND mean that most or all of these agreements are not FRAND?  I have answered this already but given the importance of the point I will repeat the answer I have arrived at in a different way.  For concluded agreements between patentees subject to an ETSI FRAND undertaking and implementers, the importance of the FRAND undertaking will be historic.  The process aspect of FRAND was important in requiring both sides to approach the negotiations appropriately and the requirement that a royalty rate had to be FRAND would be something to be prayed in aid during the negotiations.  However once the agreement has been reached the contract must be the thing which governs the rights and obligations of the two parties with respect to each other while it is in force.  Competition law must leave latitude to the parties to agree and cannot draw the line between acceptable and unacceptable contract terms in the same place as the line between whether a term is ETSI FRAND or not.  </p>

However courts all over the world have now set FRAND rates.  I am sure the English court can do that as well.  I decided at the CMC in March 2015 that the court could declare that a given set of terms were FRAND and also, within that framework, can decide that certain terms need to be adjusted in order to make a set of terms FRAND.  I am sure this applies to a royalty rate.  After all, arriving at a FRAND royalty rate is not different conceptually from assessing what a reasonable royalty would be in a patent damages enquiry albeit the particular factors applicable in setting a FRAND royalty for a licence to be FRAND and their application may differ from assessing damages.  So the court’s jurisdiction is not restricted to the binary question of assessing a given set of terms but extends to deciding between rival proposals and coming to a conclusion different from either side’s case on such a proposal.   </p>

Huawei submitted that such a licence would be evidence of what a party was actually paying and as such was relevant.  Aside from certain aspects of non-discrimination which I will address separately, I do not accept that evidence of what a party is paying as a result of a binding arbitration will carry much weight.  If the licence is the product of an arbitration then the paying party has no choice.  A further difficulty with the particular licence in question is that the arbitral award has not been produced.  So although we know what the licence terms are, we do not know what the reasoning was which led to them.  As a persuasive authority an arbitrated licence without the arbitral award is not much use.

FRAND is supposed to eliminate hold up as well as hold out.  Different licensees will have differing levels of bargaining power.  That is another way of saying their ability to resist hold up and their ability to hold out will vary.  It would be unfair (and discriminatory) to assess what is and is not FRAND by reference to this and other characteristics of specific licensees.  In my view, it would not be FRAND, for example, for a small new entrant to the market to have to pay a higher royalty rate than an established large entity. Limiting comparable licences to those where Huawei or a similar company like Samsung is the licensee is therefore unjustified.  In my judgment the FRAND rate ought to be generally non-discriminatory in that it is determined primarily by reference to the value of the patents being licensed and has the result that all licensees who need the same kind of licence will be charged the same kind of rate. </p>

This worked because both sides agreed that the correct way to arrive at a UK portfolio rate was by starting from a global rate in effect as a benchmark and then adjusting upwards.  Conceptually the approach was common ground although the level of the correct adjustment was in dispute.  This approach, in which a rate is determined as a benchmark and then adjustments made as appropriate, is a useful way of determining what a FRAND rate or rates should be.  Arriving at a benchmark FRAND rate is a neutral way of making appropriate findings.  In this case it caters for the parties’ rival cases about what the territorial scope of the licence should be.   </p>

However it is not that simple.  Most of the time the concepts of non-discrimination, reasonableness and fairness relate to one another.  In that sense it is useful to characterise a royalty rate as FRAND rather than try to distinguish between something which is merely fair and reasonable as opposed to fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory.  The argument about non-discrimination treated it as a concept which would apply to reduce a royalty rate even if that rate was otherwise “FR”.  For want of a better expression, I will distinguish between a “hard-edged” and a “general” non-discrimination obligation.  The general non-discrimination obligation is the aspect of non-discrimination which I have mentioned already.  It is part of an overall assessment of the inter-related concepts making up FRAND by which one can derive a royalty rate applicable as a benchmark.  This rate is non-discriminatory because it is a measure of the intrinsic value of the portfolio being licensed but it does not depend on the licensee.  The hard-edged nondiscrimination obligation, to the extent it exists, is a distinct factor capable of applying to reduce a royalty rate (or adjust any licence term in any way) which would otherwise have been regarded as FRAND.  This will take into account the nature of the particular licensee seeking to rely on it.  </p>

Two approaches to this have been taken both in this case and in other cases.  One approach (referred to as “top down”) starts with a number representing what the appropriate total aggregate royalty burden should be for a given standard (call it T). One can take a view about what the total royalty burden for all the intellectual property relating to the standardised telecommunications technology in a handset should be and indeed various companies have made public statements about this.  Starting from this figure T one can then share out the royalty across all licensors in proportion to the value of each licensor’s patent portfolio based on assessing that value as a share (call it S) of the total relevant patent portfolio essential to that standard.  The FRAND rate is the product of the two (TxS).   </p>

The comparison with third party licences is indirect and the relationship between those licences and the value of the portfolio in issue will depend on the evidence.  In order to use them a view has to be formed about the relative value of the portfolios licensed in them as against Unwired Planet’s portfolio.  Since the relevant Unwired Planet patents all came from Ericsson, the Ericsson licences at one time included all the SEPs in issue.  That alone makes Ericsson licences relevant.  So if the rate for Ericsson’s portfolio is E and the relative value of Unwired Planet’s portfolio to Ericsson’s portfolio is R, the Unwired Planet rate is ExR.   </p>

One might think that in order to do this it would be necessary to examine the value of the contribution made to the standard by the invention claimed in each patent.  Obviously as a portfolio increases in size the burden of that increases too but one of the reasons this trial was docketed to the same judge who heard the technical trials was because I would be familiar with some of the patents chosen by Unwired Planet to litigate, which one might expect would be the good ones.  However the exercises conducted by both Unwired Planet and Huawei for this trial, subject to a point on Ericsson, have been based on categorising and counting patents.

To make a coherent system which works at all, let alone one which delivers the performance demanded of these systems, is difficult and demands insight and creativity on the part of the engineers involved.  It is unsurprising that many inventions (and therefore many patents and SEPs) will be involved.  Short of the disproportionate task of evaluating every single patent thoroughly in order to compare each one with all the others, one can only ever hope to analyse SEPs in broad categories and it is not meaningful to attempt to weigh the value of individual patents within these categories against one another.   </p>

However the Ericsson technique has problems if applied more generally and neither side suggested that it should be.  For one thing it is already at one remove from the legal rights, which derive from patents not technical contributions.  Also the technique cannot handle a portfolio of patents acquired after the standards were set – e.g. the Unwired Planet portfolio.  Ericsson have been closely involved in the standard setting process and that may be why they like this method, I do not know.

In any event there also needs to be some means for assessing the relative value of each party’s portfolio unless one has a figure for one or other party directly.  To achieve this takes one back to the Ericsson contributions technique and/or counting patents.  For a cross-licence between A and B, if A has 100 Relevant SEPs and B has 200 then the ratio is 1:2 and that allows one mathematically to derive figures for the underlying one way rates.

That is because in the unpacking process the experts use the methodologies consistently. One also needs to bear in mind that the numbers themselves are inherently uncertain.  I accept Mr Bezant’s evidence about that (which was not in dispute).   There is an exception on unpacking methodology which relates to the two <span style="font-style:italic">[…]</span> licences but for reasons addressed below, in the end that does not matter.   </p>

Mr Bezant and Mr Lasinski did not agree how best to deal with these but I am not satisfied it is necessary to delve into the minutiae to the degree necessary to resolve those arguments.  The relevant point is that they are all sources of uncertainty rather than automatic reasons for completely ignoring a licence.  That was Mr Bezant’s approach and if it is necessary to resolve a debate on that score at a methodological level then I prefer Mr Bezant’s approach to Mr Lasinski’s. </p>

One needs to cater for the different jurisdictions, divisionals and other things.  Some of this can be dealt with by focussing on families rather than patents (but that is not perfect either) however a very significant reason why one cannot just count up declared patent families is recognition of the problem of over declaration.  There was no dispute this exists.  The debate is as to its extent.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The over declaration problem is the following.  Very many more patents are declared to be essential than in fact are essential.  This can be for many reasons.  For ETSI members Art 4.1 of the IPR Policy requires members to declare essential patents in a timely fashion and creates an incentive to err on the safe side and so, if in doubt, declare.  Also determining essentiality for certain is not easy. The technology can be difficult and the patents and the standards can be hard to interpret.  Patent claims are also amended over time and in a single family the different national patents will vary in scope around the world; standards themselves can also vary over time.  Keeping track of all this would be time consuming and costly, and if reasonable royalty rates can be agreed without determining essentiality for certain, it is a disproportionate task. Notably also no-one tries to take account of validity.  Various studies have been done on overdeclaration and rates of over-declaration quoted in the literature.  Each side criticises the other’s counting techniques and specifics over over-declaration are addressed in the sections below dealing with the alleged flaws in the techniques.   It is just too difficult.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">A further point is that Unwired Planet’s approach only uses patent counting for the denominators.  The numerators, in other words the numbers representing Unwired Planet’s own Relevant SEPs for a given type of technology, are the result of a detailed assessment of the individual patent families.  Unwired Planet say that is the appropriate thing to do and it is inappropriate to take the approach advanced by Huawei by using the same counting technique for both numerator and denominator.   Huawei say the opposite and Unwired Planet’s approach is inconsistent whereas their approach is the correct thing to do.  I will deal with that at the same time as other criticisms, below. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Now the major differences between the parties can be seen.  Unwired Planet contend their patents represent 1.69% of the Relevant SEPs for handsets in LTE, in other words S = 1.69% whereas Huawei say the portfolio only contains 0.33% of those SEPs and so S= 0.33%.  In other words, on Unwired Planet’s case, the value of their patents for handsets in LTE is five times the value contended for by Huawei.  A dimension which I have not mentioned yet is how to deal with multimode devices, that comes in the next section.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">What accounts for the difference here is the degree to which the rival techniques reduce the number of relevant patents.  The starting points are similar but the end points are different.  Huawei suggest that the total number of patent families declared essential to 4G/LTE, making certain assumptions, is 6027.  Unwired Planet used a corresponding figure of 5917, produced in a different way.  However the outcome of the HPA, for the number of Relevant SEP families for 4G/LTE handsets is 1812 while Unwired Planet’s equivalent is 355.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The multimode tables above also include references to Unwired Planet’s 80:20 approach. That is addressed in the next paragraph.  In the course of writing this judgment a small point arose on the RAN infrastructure figures shown in italics in the table above on Unwired Planet’s case.  Huawei’s Databook produced in closing showed the 0.88% figure in the LTE/UMTS/GSM row and “not given” in the row for UMTS/GSM.  Although infrastructure weighting is not important, even bearing that in mind this did not make sense and after considering the written materials it seemed that there had been a muddle about numbers and about LTE/UMTS/GSM and UMTS/GSM.  I worked out that 1.88% would be the number for LTE/UMTS/GSM while 0.88% was what the number for UMTS/GSM would be.  I wrote to the parties.  0.88% is the right number for UMTS/GSM.  1.88% is what the LTE/UMTS/GSM number would be although Huawei rightly pointed out that Unwired Planet had not derived it before.  I will include 1.88% because it is simple maths, there was a muddle in Unwired Planet’s FRAND Statement of Case and because it cannot prejudice Huawei.  </p>

Both via the valuation experts and in their submissions both sides presented the court with a blizzard of figures.  The summaries in this judgment represent a small fraction of the numbers presented.  There was a somewhat larger blizzard from Unwired Planet than from Huawei but the difference was not significant enough to make a difference.  A frequent problem is in keeping track of the bases on which numbers are presented so as to try and make sure one is comparing like with like.  In practice, for example, it is impossible to ensure that on every occasion two rival figures are both based on the state of the Ericsson portfolio (pre- or post-MSA etc.), and multimode weighted or not, as well as many other more subtle factors.   </p>

It is not mathematically correct to say that 0.36 can be rounded to 0.40.  Nor is it mathematically accurate to say that 0.36 is less than 0.4.  However the assessment is not a purely mathematical one and the inherent uncertainties in the evidence are much greater than the difference between 0.36 and 0.40.  So I will try (a) to state numbers in the evidence in the form they appear, but also (b) to use two significant figures in giving my reasons but (c) not to get too hung up on it all.

Huawei contend the benchmark multimode 4G/LTE handset Unwired Planet rate should be 0.040% and Huawei contend that Unwired Planet’s share S of multimode LTE handset patents overall is 0.30%.  Conversely Unwired Planet contend the final royalty rate should be 0.13% and contend their share S overall is 1.25%.  The ratios of these two pairs of figures are close and the similarity can be expressed in terms of the implied total aggregate royalty burden T.

The figures in Huawei’s own claim are not closely internally consistent either.

At step (2) the way the standards are identified was changed in such a way as to incorporate more standards.  At step (7) a different approach entirely is taken to what Unwired Planet call applying essentiality filters.  In the Revised MNPA, instead of the three percentages at step (7), a figure derived by Dr Cooper was used based on a detailed analysis he carried out on a sample of Samsung SEPs.  The figure used is 16.6%. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The 80/20 approach seeks to attribute some value to the other handset patents in the residue.  It does so in a mathematically simple way by attributing 80% of the royalty to a company’s Relevant SEPs in these tables and 20% of the royalty to a company’s figure for the residue. </p>

The original produces a total of 3280 which Unwired Planet confusingly call the “Core LTE” (see step 5 of the Original MNPA table above).  From this 2071 were identified as having handset claims (see step 6) which leaves 1209 families as infrastructure only (3280 = 1209 + 2071).  From the 1209 Unwired Planet estimate most will be core network (i.e. not air interface or eNode Bs) and only 15% will be relevant infrastructure.  15% of 1209 is 181.  To this 181 has to be added the share of the handset families which also includes relevant infrastructure.  That is 1337 giving a total of 1518.  That figure is treated in the same way as the handset figure at step 7 to produce 306 as the number of Relevant SEPs for infrastructure.  As I understand it when Unwired Planet revised their approach to counting patents they did not revisit the numbers for infrastructure but simply reduced the infrastructure offer in the same proportion as the handset offer.  </p>

In its FRAND Statement of Case (para 132) Huawei had presented the HPA as something which was undertaken given the flaws in Unwired Planet’s methodology.  However during the trial it emerged that this was not true, as Huawei now accept.  The HPA was in fact carried out for the arbitration between Ericsson and Huawei which led to the 2016 Ericsson-Huawei licence and in which Dr Kakaes and Mr Lasinski were both witnesses.  Unwired Planet also submitted that the HPA depends on an extremely cursory 30 minute analysis and contains an inbuilt presumption of essentiality.  Unwired Planet ties this in to the arbitration point because, they submit, what also emerged was that in the arbitration the HPA was no more than a filter to identify patents that Dr Kakaes should look at properly.  They argued that for Huawei to put the HPA forward as the actual assessment of analysis was regrettably misleading.  </p>

Unwired Planet knew they needed to come up with some method of assessing the value of their patent portfolio by reference to the industry as a whole.  The original MNPA was devised with that in mind but as an exercise, its utility depends on its objective characteristics which are addressed below.

For reasons explained below I will not use the label “implied essentiality rate”. I will call these rates the “MNPA Relevant SEP ratio” for a given company.

Using the same approach, the MNPA Relevant SEP ratio for Unwired Planet is 12.00%.  That is different from the ratios for Unwired Planet’s portfolio deployed by Unwired Planet in argument because the 12% comes from applying the MNPA to both the numerator and the denominator (the numbers are 3/25).   </p>

One would expect that as portfolios get smaller the relative effect on the ratios of small changes in absolute numbers will increase.  That is borne out by Huawei’s analysis as a whole.  All the MNPA Relevant SEP ratios over 10.00% are in the smaller portfolios (below 100 in size).  The same point can be made another way – if the numerator for Unwired Planet had ended up at 2 instead of 3 the MNPA Relevant SEP ratio would have been 8.00% <span style="font-style:italic">[…]</span> rather than 12.00%.  So I accept that one cannot place much weight on the fact that a company with a small portfolio like Unwired Planet has an MNPA Relevant SEP ratio which is larger than the company from whom their patents were selected.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Nevertheless this still does not mean Huawei do not have a real point.  They do.  These numbers expose a fallacy in the way Unwired Planet present the results of the MNPA both in argument and in evidence.  Huawei’s name for this ratio (“essentiality rate”) was reasonable because Unwired Planet use similar language to describe the same thing.  Unwired Planet have presented the number produced by the MNPA which is used as a denominator as if it represents the number of “truly essential LTE patents” or words to that effect.  Unwired Planet’s FRAND Statement of Case calls this number the “True LTE handset pool”.  These descriptions are wrong and misleading.  The MNPA includes rates for the essentiality rate (28% in the original method and 16.6% in the revised) but it also has other features.  The justification for the cut offs in the method apart from the essentiality rate, such as the pre-2009 cut-off, is not essentiality.  It is an attempt to differentiate between the value to a licensee of two different categories of patents even though both may be truly ESSENTIAL within the meaning of the ETSI IPR policy.  That is a key conceptual difference between the MNPA and the HPA.  The reason different companies have different MNPA Relevant SEP ratios is not because their implied essentiality rates differ, it is because of the kinds of patents they have relative to things like the particular LTE standards to which they are declared, the priority date, and the presence of handset claims, differ.   So the low rate for Huawei relative to Samsung and Ericsson is explicable by the combined effect of steps (4) and (5) whereby families with no EP/US member and the pre-2009 cut off has more impact on Huawei than Samsung or Ericsson, which in turn is consistent with the phenomenon that Chinese companies have increased their patent filings outside China only in recent years.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The first point is about step (2).  The MNPA does not look at all patents declared to LTE in general, rather the MNPA takes a defined list of particular standards and deals with patents declared to those.  Unwired Planet started with a list of 49 standards from a licensing pool called VIA known as the VIA 49.  The VIA pool includes industry giants AT&amp;T and NTTDoCoMo.  Mr Saru was cross-examined about the decision to use it.  While I agree the choice had an element of being self-serving, I was not persuaded it was an unreasonable choice to make.  The list had been made by a third party.  Later in the proceedings following criticism Unwired Planet used a much longer list of standards but this did not make a major difference to the end result in the light of the other filters which were used.  By the closing there was less to this issue than at earlier stages in the litigation.  It is not in dispute that there is no generally accepted view of what constituted a correct list of LTE standards.  Part of Unwired Planet’s rationale for doing something along these lines was to focus on the parts of LTE which they thought licensees would be interested in.  That was not unreasonable.  I reject the point on step (2).  The other criticisms are lesser points in any event nor do they make enough of a difference to matter. </p>

Huawei disputed this, submitting that Dr Kakaes was obviously right not to agree in cross-examination that other markets such as China are not valuable and important.  Huawei pointed out that the MNPA excluded around 709 patents for having no US or EP member.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Dr Kakaes was correct in cross-examination, all the same the evidence was clear that the licensing rates in the US and Europe are higher than elsewhere.  Both the MNPA and HPA have a step like step (4) because it is a sensible thing to do.  The difference is that the HPA includes a family if it has a Chinese member even if there is no US or EP.  One can understand why that might be done given that Huawei is Chinese and also given the evidence that many Chinese companies will only file in China for many applications.  Based on Mr Cheng’s evidence I would expect Huawei today to file SEPs internationally once the first application was made in China, given their importance.  In the end I am not satisfied that this difference between the MNPA and the HPA makes any material difference to the issues I have to decide.  A serious player in the telecommunications market, including a major Chinese company, would likely file SEPs in the US and/or Europe.  A method which included Chinese patents when the family had no US or EP member at this stage would present a more complete picture of the landscape but the differences overall are modest.  In my judgment no significant systematic error is introduced by not doing so.  The nature of Huawei’s portfolio means that it will have an effect on that portfolio but I am not satisfied this matters.  If the differences between unpacking methods mattered, this would be important, but they do not.   </p>

Unwired Planet say the fundamentals of LTE as a system were determined in LTE Release 8 and that was fixed at the end of 2008.  So only patents with pre-2009 priority can be part of it.  A later dated patent could not be valid and essential to this “core” system.

It can be taken as the same as releases after and including Release 10 of LTE.   Release 10 was released in 2011 and enables downloads and uploads ten times faster than Release 8.  In the UK the network operator EE began implementing LTE-A in 2013.  The implementation was across the whole network.  On the evidence I find that the really important aspect of the releases after release 8 is a feature called carrier aggregation.  It is clearly significant, particularly relating to infrastructure and to network operators.  </p>

In his oral evidence Mr Saru distinguished between what technology has been released in a standard and what drives the market.  Huawei pointed out that Mr Saru accepted that this filter had been chosen by Unwired Planet knowing that it would have a relatively minimal effect on the Unwired Planet portfolio.  Unwired Planet sought to mitigate this on the basis that Mr Saru’s view was that it was simply a reflection of the fact that Unwired Planet had deliberately selected good patents which would be strong from a licensing perspective.  However I do not accept that that would justify the step even if it is really what Unwired Planet thought.  </p>

Nevertheless he also accepted that there are features in standards which are not commercially implemented, for a range of reasons, and implementers commonly will decline to license patents relating to features they do not implement.  Unwired Planet submitted that Dr Kakaes accepted that if it was possible to take account of these commercial realities then it was better to do so, and he accepted that the HPA did not try to do this at all.  The latter submission is correct.  The former submission does not precisely reflect what Dr Kakaes said in the cross-examination relied on but taking his evidence as a whole, a fair reflection of Dr Kakaes’ position was that it was reasonable to take account of the reality that there are features in standards which are not implemented.   </p>

However assessed today (2016/2017) the absence is significant given the way LTE-A has been implemented over time.  For LTE some value has to be given in assessing the FRAND value of a portfolio for patents essential to later releases (and which therefore may have been excluded by a pre-2009 cut off).  On the other hand, a method which gives equal value to any patent essential to anything in Releases 9 to 11 will inevitably overstate that value.  Release 8 is still the fundamental technology in LTE and while carrier aggregation is important in the later releases, other aspects are not.   </p>

Unless one is going to make a list of Releases 9 to 11 features and identify each patent relevant to that feature, which would be impractical, the only alternatives are broad brush.  One can include all patents knowing that this overstates the value of post-2009 patents, which is the HPA method, or exclude them all knowing this understates the same value, which is the MNPA.  The 80:20 approach by Unwired Planet is an attempt to mitigate this problem, among others, because it gives some value for patents put to one side by the pre-2009 cut-off.  In that sense the intention behind the 80:20 approach is sensible but I am concerned that it is so crude as to be arbitrary. </p>

Having listened to Dr Kakaes’ oral evidence on this I find that Unwired Planet’s approach was reasonable.

The question is - how big?  28% was derived from studies reported in papers by Fairfield/Goodman &amp; Myers on 2G and 3G.  Dr Kakaes criticised this because there were also similar studies from the same group (Fairfield) and other groups for 4G which gave higher essentiality ratios.  Mr Saru thought 28% was likely to be a ceiling and a lower percentage might be more accurate.

It will be recalled that Unwired Planet do this whereas Huawei do not.  Although superficially it might appear to be a sound criticism, in my judgment it is not a valid point in these proceedings.  Of course in general one usually seeks to compare like with like.  Therefore it is meaningful to present a ratio for Unwired Planet against another company or the pool as a whole based entirely on figures provided by the same technique – as in the HPA.  This is particularly so when the technique does involve some consideration of each patent rather than figures applied across the board as in the MNPA.  However it is also meaningful when one wants to make a comparison between an identified collection of patents and the pool overall to do what Unwired Planet did and analyse the identified collection individually while applying a broader brush technique like the MNPA to the wider pool, since after all it is entirely impractical to analyse the whole pool with that same rigour.  Moreover this is all the more legitimate when the identified portfolio is small, since an average is less likely to be accurate when applied to a small pool than a large one.   </p>

The problem is not with the concept that there are optional features to which SEPs are essential and mandatory features in a standard which are not deployed.  I have no doubt both exist (as Dr Cooper explained), albeit it is also true that some strictly optional parts of LTE are really important (e.g. MIMO as Dr Kakaes explained).  The problem is justifying deductions of this magnitude.  Combined together these two fractions reduce the denominator by over a quarter and therefore correspondingly could increase Unwired Planet’s royalty rate by a third (1/100 = 1%, 1/75 = 1.33%).  And in my judgment the problem is made much worse given the pre-2009 cut off and a limit on the number of standards considered at step (2).  Dr Kakaes was right that there was no reliable empirical basis for either fraction.  Mr Saru’s attempt to justify them in his oral evidence referred to his experience in a vague way and to informal calls to old friends.  That was hopeless. </p>

Dr Cooper was asked to review the findings of a sample of the patents which the HPA deemed to be essential to an LTE handset that had a pre-2009 priority date.  Dr Cooper randomly selected a sample of patents of a size that would allow him to draw conclusions with at least 90% confidence about the pool from which the sample was drawn.  This resulted in Dr Cooper reviewing 38 Samsung and 30 Huawei patents and he spent 5-6 hours per patent family.  He concluded that the essentiality rate of the Samsung patents (excluding optional features) was at most 16.6% and then revised that further to 15.9%. For the Huawei patents he concluded that the essentiality rate (excluding optional features) was at most 9.4%.   Unwired Planet used that 16.6% figure at step (7) of the revised MNPA. </p>

However I am satisfied that at best this would make little difference to the end result. At best the point changes the result for two patents. The impact of that can be seen from the fact that changing the result for one patent moves the answer from </p>

Second, there are patents which Dr Cooper found were not essential because they were not implemented (optional).  As Dr Kakaes explained that was not part of his approach.  If Unwired Planet had then tried to use the crude fractions for options applied in the Original MNPA as well there would be more to this point.  I find Dr Cooper was justified in doing this although one needs to keep in mind that excluded this way are LTE TDD, which is used in China, MIMO and carrier aggregation.  Third, there were cases in which Dr Cooper and Dr Kakaes maintained their disagreement about particular patents.  I am not asked to resolve technical disagreements at the level of individual patents.  Based on my assessment of both experts, I am sure the disagreement represents cases in which reasonable people can differ. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">A question was whether it was right to use a rate for Samsung as in effect an industry average.  Huawei submitted there was no empirical evidence that a rate for Samsung was representative of the industry as a whole.  The choice was Unwired Planet’s rather than Dr Cooper’s.  He explained that he would not expect the rates for different companies to be identical but he could not see an <span style="font-style:italic">a priori</span> reason why there should be big variations between companies.  In my judgment the evidence, as best it is, is that the rates for different companies can differ considerably (see the table above from the HPA) but there is no systematic reason why one company’s rate should be different from another.  In my judgment using a rate for Samsung as representative of the industry is not illegitimate given that Samsung is a major player.  I doubt Samsung has an essentiality rate which is significantly below average.  There are significant uncertainties in all these exercises and this is another but it does not render the technique meaningless.   Choosing to use the number derived by Dr Cooper for Samsung rather than Huawei was the conservative choice.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Huawei also submitted that it was inappropriate to use a figure derived from the HPA in the MNPA.  This was for three reasons.  First because the filters in the MNPA produce a different starting pool of patents from that in the HPA. Second because the different approach to LTE means many Samsung families found essential in the HPA would not have made it through the filters in the MNPA but were then chalked up as inessential.  Third because the way of identifying a family as a handset family differs.  In substance these are either another way of putting the detailed points I have already considered or they relate to the major sampling issue which comes next.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">For Dr Kakaes the key problem with Dr Cooper’s approach was that while a random sample had been taken from the pool which was sampled, the pool which was sampled was skewed.  This was in two respects: first the pool from which the sample was taken consisted of the patents deemed essential (and held by Huawei or Samsung); and second the pool was actually only a subset of that because it was also limited to patents which met certain MNPA filters such as the pre-2009 cut-off.  I have already dealt with the second point above but that does not address the first point.  As to this, Dr Kakaes acknowledged that there will inevitably be errors in the evaluation process in the HPA but he said those errors would point in both directions, i.e. essential patents could be deemed not essential as well as not essential patents deemed essential.  Therefore sampling only from the pool deemed to be essential was skewed.  To do something like this sort of sampling appropriately, a random sample should have been selected from the pool as a whole, before evaluation.  For Dr Kakaes this undermined the exercise entirely.  Dr Cooper had sampled from what Dr Kakaes called a very, very, very biased universe.   </p>

The other points taken by Unwired Planet (about the initial dataset and technology categories) are similar to the points I have rejected which Huawei took against the MNPA.  If the coarse filter point succeeds Unwired Planet do not need to place further emphasis on the other issues and if it fails, they are not significant enough to undermine the HPA outright.

He was simply emphasising that in parts some of the elements of the task may not be that difficult.  In his reports Dr Kakaes had emphasised that the analysis was not a rigorous and thorough assessment of essentiality of all declared SEP families in the relevant group, since carrying that out was not plausible without employing vast resources. The exercise was based on what he called a “relatively quick assessment”.  In my judgment, given the number of families to deal with, and the inherent complexities of the patents, standards and the task itself, it would not be possible to make a definitive assessment of essentiality for the number of patents in issue in the time available.

In this document, I use the term “is essential” (and similar terms) to mean that, after evaluation, we have determined that there is a reasonable basis for treating a patent as essential.

There is nothing wrong with that provided it is understood that that is what is happening.  It is a sensible way of proceeding.

At this point it emerged that he felt unable to give a full answer because of non-disclosure obligations he felt he owed Ericsson as a result of the arbitration.  Once in private and reassured that he could speak freely Dr Kakaes explained that the HPA, which he called the “study” was “just to figure out what the landscape is”.

In closing counsel for Huawei placed emphasis on the word “importance” in these passages and submitted that the further detailed study which Dr Kakaes was talking about was not a study of essentiality, it was a study of “importance”.  That is a term he had used elsewhere in his report as relating to the value of an invention, i.e. the importance to the standard of the technology covered by the patent.  In other words it is accepted (plainly rightly) that Dr Kakaes here was explaining that there was further detailed study and analysis of patents placed into the deemed essential pool by the HPA, but Huawei argues that the nature of that further study was about importance and so does not support the idea that the HPA was a coarse filter on essentiality on the footing that patents could always be weeded out later on more careful consideration of that aspect.   </p>

But I am not persuaded that this takes one as far as Huawei seek to go.  First of all, if it matters, Dr Kakaes did not say in these passages that “importance” was the only thing considered in the further study. Secondly, “importance” is concerned with evaluating the importance of the patent’s technology to the standard and therefore cannot help but traverse the same ground as essentiality.  The idea of undertaking a further study of importance without noticing whether a patent is essential is unreal. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The HPA was devised for and used in the arbitration and regrettably the court has not been presented with a full picture of the HPA.  I find that what we call the HPA was devised not simply as a scheme to produce an end result in itself, but as a form of filter or screen to produce a pool for further study.  That is consistent with all of what I know now.  On that basis there is nothing surprising about the idea that the evaluation would err on the side of essentiality since there was going to be a further detailed study which involved considering the patented technology and the standard.  Given that, there was no harm in including more patents in the deemed pool than would turn out to be essential on detailed study.  What one would seek to minimise was missing patents from the deemed pool which might be essential.  Unwired Planet’s characterisation of the nature of the evaluation step in the HPA is correct.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The task the HPA performs is an inherently difficult one.  The answers can only ever be approximate.  In the HPA the essentiality evaluation step is and was intended to be a coarse filter to screen out non-essential patents and to err on the side of including a patent in the deemed essential pool.  This does not mean the method is flawed or unreliable.  I am satisfied that the HPA has applied a consistent yardstick and produces meaningful results.  It is a reasonable attempt to deal with over-declaration and derive information about how many essential patents there really are.  When comparing large numbers on a like with like basis, the tendency built into the evaluation step matters much less.  However as an absolute value, the numbers from the HPA over-estimate the true number of essential patents.  In other words, if a number derived from the HPA is used as the denominator in a fraction in which the numerator is a number derived by considering the patents in more detail, the result will understate the significance of Unwired Planet’s patents.  Furthermore for smaller pools the coarse nature of the filter is likely to matter more and produce a greater uncertainty in the numbers.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">I can now return to the Revised MNPA.  To recap the point is that Dr Cooper performed a more detailed study of a sample of patents belonging to Huawei and Samsung which were in the deemed essential pool of the HPA.  Huawei submitted I should place no weight on Dr Cooper’s assessment because by sampling only from the deemed essential pool, the exercise was badly skewed.  Unwired Planet’s answer was that the nature of the evaluation step in the HPA meant it was reasonable to focus on patents which passed the filter and assume that those patents which were discarded as not passing the filter would not have been found essential by Dr Cooper.  I have accepted that this step of the HPA does increase the pool of essential patents and errs on the side of putting a patent in the deemed pool.  Accordingly, one would not expect there to be as many patents in the discard pool which would in fact turn out to be essential after a detailed 5-6 hour analysis, as there would be patents in the deemed essential pool which turn out not to be essential.  There will be errors going both ways, as the evidence established, but the inherent tendency built into the evaluation exercise means that it is reasonable to expect many fewer patents in the discard pool as having been wrongly rejected, than there are patents in the deemed essential pool which turn out not to be essential.  So while selecting only from the deemed essential pool will inevitably skew the result a bit, I am not satisfied that the skewing will be anything other than small.  It is a point to keep in mind when placing weight on the result but it is not strong enough to justify rejecting the approach.  </p>

The MNPA has flaws but, apart from one aspect of the Original MNPA, overall in my judgment the Original MNPA was and the Revised MNPA is a reasonable attempt to derive information which allows one to assess the strength of a portfolio of patents declared essential to LTE as against the industry as a whole, from the point of view of what licensees would be interested in.  There are two critical caveats.   </p>

A majority of the residue patents will not be essential at all but a good number will be essential to options and later developments of significance to LTE (e.g. carrier aggregation, TDD and later MIMO patents).  In terms of individual patents, given the different sizes of the two LTE pools using Unwired Planet’s figures, 80:20 makes an individual patent in the Relevant SEPs pool about 34 times more valuable than residue.  I think that is much too high.  That may be because the pool of Relevant SEPs is too small relative to the residue pool or because the 80:20 ratio is too generous to Unwired Planet or some combination of the two. </p>

For instance one could for example decide as a matter of judgment that 16.6% ought to be 28% (the figure used in the Original MNPA).  However the complexity of the 80:20 adjustment, layered on top of the multimode adjustment and, if one is considering R, also taking into account figures for Ericsson too, makes the Revised MNPA + 80:20 approach impossible to adjust in a credible manner.  The only way it can be adjusted would be so broad brush that it would be mere pretence to suggest it was more meaningful than doing my best to just choose values for S and R somewhere between the parties’ extremes. </p>

I have concluded that the right way to reach a conclusion is to apply adjustments to the figures derived from the HPA.  The basis for the adjustments is my qualitative evaluation of the evidence as a whole, primarily Dr Kakaes and Dr Cooper, and including the indications given by the Revised MNPA + 80:20 approach.

The number for 4G handsets is 1812 and is much too high.  The corresponding number in the Revised MNPA is 355 but that number is much too low if it is to represent all Relevant SEPs.  I think both values are out by about a factor of two.  Half of 1812 is 906 while twice 355 is 710.  Splitting the difference takes one to 800.  Standing back, about 800 is fair and in my judgment an appropriate figure for the pool of 4G/LTE patents.  Applying that as the denominator in a fraction to determine the share S which Unwired Planet’s patents represent from the pool gives 6/800 = 0.75%.  </p>

For 4G the Ericsson number given by the HPA is <span style="font-style:italic">[…]</span>.  Here another adjustment has to be made but in my judgment a smaller proportionate adjustment is needed here than the previous one.  Unwired Planet’s equivalent for the number of Relevant SEPs held by Ericsson is 34.  Unwired Planet’s denominator here (<span style="font-style:italic">[…]</span>) produces a figure for R for 4G alone of <span style="font-style:italic">[…]</span> which I find is an odd result even bearing in mind the small sample sizes.  Doing my best I think the right proportion is two thirds.  Applying the same proportionate adjustment to 2G and 3G produces the following table:  </p>

The major debate about this licence is whether any weight should be placed on the running royalty rates on the face of the licence.  Mr Lasinski said they were cosmetic.  The rates are expressed in cents per product but making sensible assumptions they compare favourably to a royalty rate of 0.2%.  The point is that the licence contains two lump sums adding up to $100 million.  On the face of the agreement <span style="font-style:italic">[…]</span> is defined as a prepayment of royalty while the <span style="font-style:italic">[…]</span> balance is attributed to the sale to Lenovo by Unwired Planet of certain patents.  On its own terms therefore no further running royalties will be due until the <span style="font-style:italic">[…]</span> is exhausted.  Huawei contend that Lenovo wanted to attribute the whole $100 million to royalty pre-payment but accepted the <span style="font-style:italic">[…] </span>split because they thought they were safe that <span style="font-style:italic">[…]</span> would not be exhausted during the term (5 years plus an additional possible 2 years).

There are also some Unwired Planet documents.  The import of the evidence is fairly clear.  I find that both Lenovo and Unwired Planet thought it was highly unlikely that the prepayment would be exhausted.  (Mr Robbins in cross-examination said “certainly unlikely”.) <span style="font-style:italic">[…]</span>.  Nevertheless it does not follow from this that Lenovo did not care what the running rate was.  That is for three main reasons.  First, it was not inconceivable that Lenovo’s sales would be large enough over the term to exhaust the royalty.  It was possible that they would be that large if Lenovo enjoyed a very high rate of growth, comparable to that of Samsung.  The running royalty will determine the rate at which the lump sum is used up.  <span style="font-style:italic">[…]</span>  For these reasons I find that the running rate was the product of genuine negotiation.  The <span style="font-style:italic">[…]</span> and, of course, the lump sum pre-payment itself, meant that Lenovo’s interests were protected to a high degree in any case but I find that Lenovo still had an interest in negotiating a lower rate.  Their interest was modest compared to the negotiation of the lump sums and other terms, but it was tangible.  </p>

Mr Bezant and Mr Lasinski were agreed about that.  As I understand the case presented by each side, neither party seeks to unpack a lump sum notionally attributable to the licence in order to generate a comparable royalty rate nor does either party seek to use a sum attributed to the value of the patents sold to generate useful evidence for the value of Unwired Planet’s patents.  Therefore it is not necessary to reach a view about what the proper attribution would be.  If I had to do so I would find the large majority of the value should be attributed to the patent purchase. </p>

This depends on Mr Ware’s evidence.  Huawei’s case is that the facts of what went on are now sufficiently clear to show that the wider factors make no material difference.

From about July 2014 PanOptis started having commercial discussions with Samsung.  They included the possibility of Samsung taking a licence under other PanOptis telecoms patent portfolios and by the summer of 2015 they included the possibility of a wider strategic partnership.  In July 2015 Unwired Planet approached PanOptis again, this time about purchasing the licensing companies themselves.

If it is sound evidence of the value of the Unwired Planet portfolio then that would reduce the fair, reasonable and generally non-discriminatory royalty rate.  My findings on the context in which the 2016 Unwired Planet-Samsung licence arose are as follows.  By the time it was purchased Unwired Planet was in serious financial trouble.  The only licence Unwired Planet had been able to agree was with Lenovo and Unwired Planet was engaged in very expensive multinational patent litigation in an effort to establish its rights. By late 2015 – early 2016 Unwired Planet was close to insolvency.  I accept Mr Ware’s evidence about what happened.  The price PanOptis paid for Unwired Planet was lower than the market value of the patent portfolio because of the serious financial difficulties Unwired Planet were in at the time.  As regards his discussions with Samsung, the picture Mr Ware painted of the reality of high level negotiations with that major multinational organisation was convincing and credible.  PanOptis had the ability and the means to buy Unwired Planet in any event but I find that the key reason why PanOptis did buy Unwired Planet when they did and for the price they paid was in order to build trust with Samsung and because Samsung were prepared to take a licence under the portfolio in a deal in which the cash component <span style="font-style:italic">[…]</span>.  The purchase was being “de-risked”, as Mr Ware put it.  The long term benefits to PanOptis which would derive from this were regarded by PanOptis as important and are in fact potentially very valuable.  The arrangements did not give PanOptis a contractually enforceable right to the benefits derived from building trust with Samsung but that does not mean it was not well worth doing.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The issue to resolve concerning the Ericsson-Huawei 2016 licence is the significance of the fact that <span style="font-style:italic">[certain]</span> terms were the product of an arbitration.  I can deal with this shortly because I believe the answer is clear.  Terms which were settled by an arbitrator are not evidence of what willing, reasonable business people would agree in a negotiation.  In that sense a royalty in the licence is not probative of the market value of the portfolio under licence at all.  Decisions of other courts may have persuasive value but that will largely depend on the reasoning that court has given to reach its conclusion.  An arbitral award is at least capable of having a similar persuasive value, but reasoning supporting the terms in this licence is not available.  I know that the arbitrators <span style="font-style:italic">[made findings about the effective royalty rate to be paid</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">…]</span> and I also know that this is not far above the <span style="font-style:italic">[…] </span>rate from the <span style="font-style:italic">[…] </span>licence <span style="font-style:italic">[…]</span>.

Mr Lasinski attributed this to the evolution of FRAND case law and the fact that there was limited guidance about FRAND before 2013.

He did not mean this as a legal opinion, rather it was based on his experience of the impact of the decisions in the licensing industry of which he was familiar.  They span a short time frame from April 2013 to December 2014.  He also referred to decisions outside the US, referring to <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Huawei v Interdigital</span> in China in 2013, <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Samsung v Apple</span> in Japan in May 2014, <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Huawei v ZTE</span> in the CJEU in July 2015 and <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">St Lawrence v Vodafone</span> on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2016 in the Düsseldorf District Court.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I accept Mr Lasinski’s view that there is some evidence of a decline in some rates over time and I am sure that at least part of the explanation is the emergence by 2013 of decisions in which courts were prepared to set FRAND rates, which in turn strengthened the bargaining position of licensees by reducing the power of the threat of an injunction.  However the trend is not simple since <span style="font-style:italic">[…]</span>.  In any event I am not convinced that one simply adjusts for all this by taking any rate derived before 2013 and halving it. The evidence does not justify such a simplistic approach.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I find that an appropriate rate to use as representative of the value of E of Ericsson’s 4G SEP portfolio in licensing a multimode handset is 0.80%.  That is arrived at by looking at the range of <span style="font-style:italic">[rates from] </span>the <span style="font-style:italic">[Q] </span>licence, starting from the top of that range, and adjusting upwards by a factor which is <span style="font-style:italic">[…]</span>.  I have arrived at this number and approach after considering all the material.  The main reasons for this are as follows.  The <span style="font-style:italic">[Q]</span> licence is the best place to start.  The <span style="font-style:italic">[range] </span>represents the payments <span style="font-style:italic">[the licensee] </span>will have been most concerned about and it makes sense to start there.  Taking the upper end of that range <span style="font-style:italic">[…] </span>is appropriate because Mr Lasinski’s preferred figure is <span style="font-style:italic">[…] </span>anyway and because of the existence of <span style="font-style:italic">[…]</span>.  So I derive <span style="font-style:italic">[…] </span>as the rate on which to place weight from the <span style="font-style:italic">[Q] </span>licence.  A further increase it is appropriate to take into account is in the other Ericsson licences and in particular the fact that all the <span style="font-style:italic">[…] </span>rates are much higher than <span style="font-style:italic">[…] </span>including the <span style="font-style:italic">[…] </span>rate which one would expect to be relatively low.  But it would not be appropriate to raise the <span style="font-style:italic">[rate]</span> up to the level of these other rates because of Mr Lasinski’s point about FRAND case law.  The figure for E for multimode 4G of 0.80% is more than <span style="font-style:italic">[…]</span> but less than <span style="font-style:italic">[…]</span>.  The final number was also derived as a number expressed to one decimal place (0.8%) to recognise the uncertainties but in keeping with the convention used in this case I have written it as 0.80%.   </p>

I find that the value for E for infrastructure should be the same as the multimode 4G and 2G/3G handset rates, i.e. 0.80% for 4G infrastructure and 0.67% for 2G or 3G infrastructure.  </p>

The issue is about how closely aligned the requirements of the non-discrimination limb of FRAND pursuant to the ETSI FRAND undertaking are relative to the corresponding requirements of competition law.  It is common ground that competition law (Art 102(c)) only prohibits discriminatory behaviour to the extent that behaviour is capable of distorting competition.  The question is whether that condition or something akin to it, which is not mentioned expressly in the ETSI FRAND undertaking, is nevertheless a relevant aspect of ETSI FRAND.

Huawei pointed out that both Mr Bezant and Mr Lasinski agreed that that non-discrimination obligation “means that licensors should treat similarly situated licensees similarly”.  Huawei submit that in the jargon of non-discrimination, Samsung are “similarly situated” to Huawei and so Unwired Planet are obliged to offer the same or similar rates to Huawei as they have extended to Samsung in the 2016 Unwired Planet-Samsung licence.  Unwired Planet do not accept the hard-edged point put by Huawei.  Their case is that Unwired Planet are not obliged to offer Huawei the same rate as the Samsung rate.  That is because Huawei are not “similarly situated” to Samsung; the Samsung licence is not an equivalent or comparable licence to the Huawei licence being considered; and, even if those two points are wrong, the non-discrimination limb of FRAND contains the same or an analogous aspect as the requirement in competition law only prohibits conduct which is capable of distorting competition.  Unwired Planet point out that Huawei have disavowed any attempt to conduct the economic analysis necessary to establish that in this case.  In reply Huawei submit that no such analysis is necessary, citing <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">British Airways v Commission</span> Case C-95/04 [2007] ECR I-2331.</p>

Third, transactions are comparable if “(a) they are concluded with purchasers who compete with one another, or who produce the same or similar goods, or who carry out similar functions in distribution, (b) they involve the same or similar products, (c) in addition their other relevant commercial features do not essentially differ” (relying on Article 2 of <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Decision 30-53 of the High Authority of the ECSC</span>, OJ 1953 L6/11, as amended by <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Decision 72/440/ECSC</span>, OJ 1972 L 293/39).

Huawei do have a far larger focus on infrastructure than Samsung but this does not justify a finding that Huawei and Samsung are not similarly situated.  Since this case is concerned with a worldwide benchmark rate it is appropriate to consider the worldwide position of the two undertakings. They are both very large multinational telecoms manufacturers active in the same handset and RAN infrastructure markets.  They are both in the top three handset vendors worldwide (the other is Apple) and while Huawei is the top 4G RAN infrastructure maker, Samsung is another major supplier in that market. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Unwired Planet’s approach was to argue that the factors in Mr Ware’s evidence which made the Samsung licence not a reliable comparable in the context of setting a FRAND rate were also relevant to non-discrimination.  Huawei’s argument was the same albeit from the other direction, in other words its case was that the Samsung licence was a reliable comparable for both purposes for the same reasons.  Both sides effectively equated the concept of an equivalent/comparable transaction in the context of nondiscrimination with a comparable licence used in the analysis of royalty rates.  Clearly the concepts overlap but in my judgment the two are not identical and the distinction is acute in the context of the Samsung licence.  Used in an assessment of an appropriate rate in accordance with the ETSI FRAND obligation, comparable licences act as evidence of the value of the property being licensed.  A FRAND rate could still be set even if no licences existed at all and even if there was no licence from Unwired Planet to Samsung.  Using that kind of evidence inevitably takes into account the general nondiscrimination aspect of the ETSI FRAND obligation mentioned already.  But a hardedged non-discrimination obligation, if it means anything, arises as a consequence of entering into particular transactions with particular licensees.  The issue is what effect in law arises from the fact that Unwired Planet have granted a licence to Samsung under the same portfolio.  The effect of this grant is that a major competitor of Huawei, one who is otherwise “similarly situated” to Huawei, has licensed the same portfolio.   </p>

It is in the end nothing more than a patent licence (with the associated assignment).  Unwired Planet’s or PanOptis’s motives for selling this licence cheaply on that occasion do not change the fact that they did sell the licence cheaply.  The consequence of the licence is that PanOptis has been able to enhance its general relationship with Samsung and therefore to have a relationship with Samsung which it does not have with Huawei, but I reject the suggestion that this means that the transaction has features vis a vis Samsung which make it different in any objective sense relevant in this context from the licence Huawei is entitled to.  </p>

The licensee (Samsung) is, at best, one of a handful of major licensees.  The licence is for the same portfolio and relates to the same acts.  It is contemporaneous.  I find that for the purposes of considering hard edged non-discrimination, the Unwired PlanetSamsung 2016 licence is an equivalent or comparable transaction to the putative licence under consideration in this case, the one between Unwired Planet and Huawei.  </p>

Some economists have proposed that it means only that all firms which use the standard be able to obtain a license, with no constraint as to the terms of the license. That of course allows different firms to pay different royalties but still have access to use of the patent.  </p>

It is not supported by either party before me.  I am not surprised.  If that is what the ETSI undertaking was supposed to mean it could readily have been written in that way.

Since the ETSI FRAND undertaking already obliges licensors to offer licences to everyone, it does not add anything to that.  It is also weaker than the benchmark FRAND rate approach, which at least applies to all licensees with licences of the same type.  The benchmark approach does not mean that all licensees must pay exactly that rate but it provides a benchmark against which such a rate can be judged.  In practice it will stop licensees having to pay much more than the benchmark set by reference to the value of the portfolio.  Competition law can intervene to penalise the imposition of excessive prices much higher than the benchmark FRAND rate.  Neither side supported this weak second version of non-discrimination.  </p>

Competition law does not seek to prohibit different prices being charged to different customers.  An important aspect of the way that result is assured in competition law is by the requirement that only terms which are sufficiently dissimilar to distort competition are prohibited.  In other words, the various elements of the competition law applicable discriminatory pricing operate as a whole to achieve a fair balance.  Splitting off some parts without the others is unbalanced and risks unfairness. </p>

Unwired Planet’s chart presents far too many rates from the same licence as if they were independent data points.  In Huawei’s pie chart here the area of the left circle is about $103 billion whereas the area of the right circle is $48 million and so, scaled with the left circle, the right circle should be tiny.  There is no question that the rates applied to Samsung under the Samsung licence are far lower than the benchmark rates derived above and lower still than the rates claimed by Unwired Planet in July 2016.  I will take it that the value of Huawei’s annual licensed revenues is likely to be about half Samsung’s.  </p>

A figure for Huawei’s profit margin was taken from public information as being between about $6 and $19 per device.  Counsel put to Dr Niels that in that context the difference in rates (<span style="font-style:italic">[…] </span>vs 75 cents) would appreciably distort competition.  Dr Niels did not agree.  He was prepared to assume the figures were correct but explained that one could not draw the conclusion that competition would be distorted because given the average selling price of the products (for Huawei assuming $164 to 185) the rate is very, very low.  He acknowledged the rate was a higher percentage of the profit margin but that did not change his view.  He said that no-one had done a detailed analysis of distortion of competition and to do that you would have to look at how the market works downstream and how operators set prices.

The example he gave, which he described as odd and without clear economic justification, was of a patentee with a patent in two jurisdictions which had been upheld in one but revoked in the other but insisted on being paid in both.  Stated that way the Professor makes an important point but one has to be careful with the example.  As soon as patent portfolios are being licensed it is not straightforward to say that a demand for payment for a portfolio licence is for payment for a given patent in the portfolio.  In the present case it is common ground that the licence will be for all declared SEPs even though the royalty is set by reference to a subset – the Relevant SEPs - and this applies to the UK only portfolio as much as to the worldwide portfolio.  In such a case the licensor is not really demanding payment for each declared SEP.  If one of the declared but non-Relevant SEPs in a portfolio was revoked, leaving Relevant SEPs behind, it would not change the benchmark royalty rate. </p>

Turning to the specific circumstances, there are three aspects.  The first is that Unwired Planet’s portfolio does not have patents in every state of the world.  The second is that Unwired Planet is engaged in litigation in this country.  Its stance is that if it is entitled to insist on a worldwide licence then it will do so and if Huawei refuses, an injunction should follow.  The third is that Unwired Planet is also engaged in litigation with Huawei in Germany and China on patents within the portfolio but in the licence Unwired Planet is demanding that Huawei should pay royalties for Germany and China.   </p>

It does not have much coverage in Africa and limited coverage in South America and Eastern Europe (but there are some patents in some states).  Nevertheless in my judgment Unwired Planet’s geographical coverage is very wide.  Although not directly relevant, the difference in coverage between Unwired Planet and Huawei is not so different.  Unwired Planet’s coverage today is 42 countries whereas Huawei’s is 51 on the same basis.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In addition to the well-rehearsed issue on China, there are two further aspects which Huawei draw attention to.  First, Unwired Planet’s coverage of 3G/UMTS and 2G/GSM is much weaker than for 4G/LTE, as Mr Saru accepted.  However, South America and South East Asia include jurisdictions in which Huawei makes a very considerable volume of sales, especially of 3G/UMTS and 2G/GSM equipment, in which Unwired Planet have no relevant coverage.  Also for countries where Huawei sells only single mode handsets rather than multimode, there are no grounds on Unwired Planet’s case for it to be receiving any royalties going forward at all.  Second, Huawei contend they manufacture handsets in Venezuela, in which Unwired Planet have no patents.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Unwired Planet’s response was to point out that one needs to consider manufacturing as well as sales.  A handset sold in a country in which there is no patent may still have been made in a patented country in which a licence was required.  The fee for the licence, which includes licence to manufacture, may well be a royalty calculated by reference to the sale price, with a royalty bearing event being sale.  That this would apply whether the sale happens to be made in a patented or non-patented country is not necessarily a problem given that manufacture needed to be licensed.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Where Unwired Planet’s coverage differs from that of Ericsson or Huawei is in numbers of patents.  Unwired Planet have many fewer patents in general and Mr Zhang and Mr Cheng both referred to the small size of Unwired Planet’s portfolio.  The portfolio is much smaller than that of the biggest players like Huawei, Samsung and Ericsson, but in my judgment it is not so small as to be a portfolio which can or would be treated in a different way from some of the larger portfolios.  The portfolio is large enough that it would be impractical to fight over every patent and neither party is doing this.  The explanation of coverage above has been given by reference to declared SEPs since they represent the property which would be licensed, even though it is the much smaller number of Relevant SEPs which determines the royalty rate.  The small size of Unwired Planet’s portfolio and the low number of Relevant SEPs is reflected in the FRAND royalty rates.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Before turning to the impact of the litigation, this is a convenient point to ask what sort of licence for Unwired Planet’s portfolio would be FRAND in terms of its geographical scope when applied to a multinational licensee like Huawei?  I will start by asking what a willing licensor and a willing licensee with more or less global sales would do.  There is only one answer.  Unwired Planet’s portfolio today is (and in 2014 it was) sufficiently large and has sufficiently wide geographical scope that a licensor and licensee acting reasonably and on a willing basis would agree on a worldwide licence.  They would regard country by country licensing as madness.  A worldwide licence would be far more efficient.  It might well have different rates for different regions and for different standards but that is another matter.  The employment of different rates would not lead the parties to abandon a worldwide licence and go for country by country licensing.  Assuming the licensee was a Chinese multinational like Huawei, they might well agree on different rates for China as for the Rest of the World but again they would not go for country by country licensing.  If the multinational had a significant manufacturing base in another country in which the portfolio was weak, again that could be taken into account.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">A point arose in the arguments on the terms of the UK only licence which Huawei called a manoeuvre.  Unwired Planet insisted that the UK only licence should have a term in it precluding entry into the UK of unlicensed Huawei handsets.  This seems to have caught Huawei by surprise but it really should not have done.  It was a manifestation of the point that the UK only licence is only a licence under the UK patents.  It illustrates one reason why country by country licensing is inefficient for goods like mobile telecommunications devices which will move across borders but I do not regard this as a major point in the present context.  It would have to be addressed but that could be done (see below the section on the UK only licence where it is addressed in context).  The real inefficiency of country by country licensing is the effort required to negotiate and agree so many different licences and then to keep track of so many different royalty calculations and payments.  No rational business would do this if it could be avoided.  </p>

A patent in one state is clearly separate from a member of the same patent family in another state.  They may have an entirely different scope.  However the way in which FRAND royalty rates are determined in practice treats these two distinct patents as a single thing.  It is common ground that the industry assesses patent families rather than individual patents within the family.  The FRAND obligation actually applies to patent families, for good reason.  It would be wrong to ignore this fact about how the licences are negotiated and agreed in practice.  Assessing portfolios on a family basis inevitably involves tying in a patent in one state with a patent in another. </p>

This insistence is clearly a form of tying in.  However again there is more to be said about this.  Take a SEP with family members in two countries.  If a multinational implementer sells in those two countries and needs a licence in one of them, the implementer probably needs a licence in both, hence the efficiency of this sort of licensing.  Of course portfolio licensing is more complicated still because patents in some states may not have counterparts in others, but for this purpose they are all SEPs.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The fourth part is competitive foreclosure.  Take the same example of a SEP with family members in two countries A and B and a multinational implementer selling in both.  If the implementer does need a licence in both then the licensor is the only source of that licence.  Tying in a licence under a SEP in state A with a licence under the SEP in the same family in state B does not preclude a third party from competing with the licensor in state B because the licensor is the only source of licences for this SEP in state B.  This is an aspect of the dominant position of the licensor.  It also helps explain the efficiency of worldwide portfolio licensing.  </p>

The Commission’s decision is firmly in Huawei’s favour.  However the decision is premised on the view that a licence limited to Germany is FRAND.  Making the sensible assumption that the GPRS “Cudak” SEP had counterparts outside Germany, that decision can only be on one of two bases.  Either national portfolio licences are FRAND and worldwide licences are not FRAND, in which case the majority of real licences are not FRAND because they are worldwide; or both national and worldwide licences are FRAND at the same time, in which case FRAND cannot be enforced save by imposing one kind of FRAND licence even if another more realistic kind is also FRAND.  I have already addressed these issues above and the answer I have arrived at is that there is only one set of FRAND terms in a given situation.   The Commission’s decision does not look at the matter in that way and, although they find in clear terms at the end of the quoted paragraph that Apple is offering to enter into a licensing agreement on FRAND terms, the Commission do not analyse the national/worldwide scope issue in the manner I believe is required.

What is more I can only say that having heard this trial, what seemed clear to me then does not seem to me now to be as clear cut.  I remain of the view however that UK court’s power to grant an injunction against an implementer will only arise once at least two conditions are satisfied - there must be a FRAND licence available for the licensee to accept (or subject to case management some proper means of settling one) and there must be a SEP held by the court to be valid and essential.

The essential difficulty is that if it is possible that both kinds of licence – UK only and worldwide – are FRAND in the circumstances of this case then FRAND cannot be enforced at all.  Unwired Planet submitted that a counterpart to the international coercion identified in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Vringo</span> was a similar kind of international coercion which was taking place in this case because the act of granting an injunction is no more an act of ‘coercion’ than the act of not granting an injunction. The FRAND commitment is a restriction on a patentee’s exercise of its patent rights and if, properly construed, it is a restriction that only requires a worldwide offer, and Huawei refuses or frustrates that, then not granting an injunction has the effect of compelling the patentee to either give up payment in other jurisdictions or accept a much lower rate because it cannot practically sue separately around the world. </p>

However Unwired Planet’s argument is useful in that it draws attention to the fact that it is necessary to identify the premise correctly.  If a worldwide licence is not FRAND then a putative licensee should not be coerced into accepting it by the threat of an injunction in one state.  However, if a worldwide licence is FRAND then the situation changes.  The logic of the FRAND undertaking applied in the context of patent rights is that the remedy of an injunction to restrain infringement, granted in respect of a patent found valid and infringed/essential, should present the licensee with a simple choice either to take a FRAND licence or stop dealing in the products.  Whatever the FRAND terms are, the remedy operates in the same way.  That is why the remedy is coercive.   </p>

There is necessarily a difference in scope and therefore risk between a national injunction on a single patent, possibly directed to a single release of a standard, on the one hand and a licence under a portfolio whether it is national or international on the other hand.

In <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">GAT v LUK</span>, the CJEU held that Art 22(4)’s predecessor, Art 16(4) Brussels Convention, applied whatever the form of proceedings in which the issue of a patent’s validity is raised, including, for example, if it were challenged as a defence or counterclaim to a claim for infringement. The CJEU’s reasoning had three parts: (a) first, it held that to decide otherwise would undermine the binding nature of Art 16(4) by allowing a party to circumvent the rules and have questions of validity determined in the wrong jurisdiction (b) second, this would undermine the predictability and certainty of the rules of jurisdiction laid down by the Convention and (c) third, it considered that to allow courts other than those of a State in which a particular patent is issued to rule indirectly on the validity of a patent would multiply the risk of conflicting decisions across jurisdictions.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In my judgment, the Brussels I Regulation and the CJEU case law cited has nothing to do with what the terms of a FRAND licence should be.  If a worldwide licence is FRAND then requiring Huawei to take and pay for one would not amount to determining questions of validity in relation to which courts of other Member States have exclusive jurisdiction under Art 22(4). Taking Huawei’s example of the on-going German proceedings, the German courts would remain free to determine the relevant patents’ validity.  A FRAND licence should not prevent a licensee from challenging validity or essentiality of licensed patents and should have provisions dealing with sales in non-patent countries.  So if the German courts decide all the relevant patents are invalid (or not essential), that would simply result in whatever consequences the worldwide licence provided for.  Since the licence is a FRAND licence those consequences are FRAND too.   The binding nature and clarity of Art 22(4) are not thereby undermined and, most importantly, there is no risk of the decisions in England and Germany conflicting. I reject Huawei’s fourth point. </p>

A difficulty could be that the offers concerned were never put together with fully worked out contract terms but that might not matter in practice since no doubt the big issue of the rate could be addressed and, on Huawei’s case, certain terms such as bundling SEPs and non-SEPs together were such that they could never be FRAND. </p>

In refusing this wide declaration I referred to the court not having the sort of open ended jurisdiction available in the Copyright Tribunal.  I allowed Unwired Planet to claim a declaration in narrower form which referred expressly to specific offers already made.  In allowing this amended claim I held that the court could declare that a given set of terms were or were not FRAND and also that the court could, within the framework of a concrete proposal, find that a set of terms which differed in some respect from the concrete proposal was also FRAND even if the terms as proposed were not.

Huawei referred to the odd aspect of Mr Bezant’s evidence but it does not bear out the argument.  The oddity of Mr Bezant’s approach is that it applies just as much as setting a UK only rate as anything else.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">It is true that fully worked out terms were only put forward openly after the start of the trial, as a result of me asking the parties to produce and engage with them.  That cannot make a material difference.  If Huawei thought they were prejudiced by the absence of such terms earlier in the action they could have asked.  But I am left with a set of worldwide terms proposed by Unwired Planet and no engagement with Huawei.  In other circumstances it might have been appropriate to hand down a judgment dealing with the big issues, such as rates, and then leave it to the parties to agree the smaller points or isolate the differences down to a few points.  That is often done in the Copyright Tribunal.  However this issue was discussed extensively during the trial.  This trial is meant to be the point at which the court decides whether to grant or refuse a final injunction against Huawei following findings of infringement of valid claims over a year ago.  The only way that can be done fairly is if at the point the injunction would bite a fully worked out licence is available in relation to which the court has decided FRAND, competition law, and equitably refusability.   These proceedings have gone on long enough.  There is no justification in allowing yet another round of evidence and argument and so I will do the best I can with the material. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">There is an issue about whether the Relevant SEP for 2G for China covers handsets rather than just infrastructure.  However given that the licence itself is a licence on declared SEPs and given the lack of development of the argument about this, a FRAND approach in this situation would be to include 2G handsets in the licence and treat the number of Relevant 2G SEPs as one.  There is also a question based on whether to count pending applications (which makes a difference for 4G in China).  A FRAND approach would be to include pending applications for Relevant SEPs in the scaling exercise.  Another point specific to China was the possibility of single mode handsets.  Given the way the multimode figures come out (see the table below) the FRAND approach would be to treat single mode handsets as the same as the relevant multimode (so a single mode 3G handset would be the same as a 2G/3G multimode handset).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The question turns to whether any other regions of the world should have lower rates than the benchmark rate.  Parties negotiating in a FRAND way would not try to divide up the world into too many categories since it risks being unworkable but there is at least one comparable licence in which the contract treats three regions of the world differently and that is a fair and reasonable approach. Outside China, a FRAND approach would be to divide the rest of the world into major markets (MM) and other markets (OM) by reference to the number of declared SEPs in force held by Unwired Planet in that country.  The three standards 2G, 3G or 4G would be treated individually.  A table setting out the numbers of declared SEPs held by Unwired Planet around the world is at Annex 1.  Bearing in mind that table, a FRAND approach would be to set MM countries for a given standard as those with more than a certain number of declared SEPs for that standard.  In my judgment a fair threshold for 2G or 3G would be 2 or more declared SEPs and for 4G would be 3 or more declared SEPs.  Any country below the threshold would be OM for that standard.  Based on the figures in Annex 1 this produces the following table of MM countries.  The remaining countries in Annex 1 are OM states for all standards as is the rest of the world.  </p>

So a 2G/3G multimode handset in a country which is an MM for 3G, the MM 3G rate is due.  For a 2G/3G/4G handset in a country which is MM for 4G, the 4G rate is due; while such a handset sold in a country which is MM for 3G only, attracts the 3G MM rate rather than the 4G OM rate.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The starting point to arrive at the FRAND rate for the MM countries would be the benchmark rate.  However the benchmark rate was set by reference to a number for Relevant SEPs focussed on the United Kingdom.  Applying that to all MM countries is too generous to Unwired Planet because the UK has more Relevant SEPs for 4G handsets than any other country.  The most any other 4G MM countries have (including applications) is 5 and they are the USA, France, Germany, India and Spain.  Of the other 4G MM states: Italy, Japan and the Netherlands have 4 Relevant 4G SEPs, Canada and Ireland have 3, New Zealand and Switzerland have 2, and Taiwan has 1.   The FRAND approach in the circumstances would be to set the MM rate as a single rate, for all countries including the UK.  In my judgment the FRAND approach would be to use a factor based on taking 5 as the number of Relevant SEPs for LTE.  The markets in which the number is 5 or more are some of the most valuable markets in the world.  The scaling for multimode will use the same approach as taken for China.  There is no need to make a similar adjustment to the benchmark for 2G nor for 3G.  This produces the following table:  </p>

The points they were able to agree upon as FRAND are just as applicable to a worldwide licence.  So a FRAND worldwide licence would license all acts which would otherwise infringe any of the relevant patents.  It would be for a seven year term from the effective date of 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January 2013 (when the 2009 Huawei-Ericsson licence ended) and therefore would expire on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2020.  It would contain a release for back damages on the basis that royalties were paid at the contract rate for the past period.  The royalty would be calculated as a share of a defined net selling price of defined end user equipment or infrastructure equipment.  The royalty would be payable on sale.  In the worldwide licence the rate will be determined by the territory in which the goods are sold, i.e. China, an OM country or an MM country for the relevant standard.  The licence would contain conventional reporting provisions, record keeping and audit.  The reporting would be quarterly with payment due a specified period after the report (there is a typo in clause 4.5 which should refer to report clause 4.7 not 4.6).  As a contract settled by the court its terms would not be confidential. </p>

The degree of uplift is in dispute.  It is clear that if the licence was to be only for one territory, such as the UK, then the rate should be higher than the benchmark rate.  That is because there are plainly significant efficiencies in global licensing.  Huawei refer to Mr Lasinski’s evidence in favour of an uplift of 50% (48.51%) which he derived <span style="font-style:italic">[…]</span>.  Unwired Planet contend the uplift should be much bigger but one needs to be careful to compare like with like.  Unwired Planet referred to two uplifts based on two different assumptions.  The first is the UK only uplift.  Unwired Planet contend this uplift should be 150% for handsets and 100% for infrastructure.  The second is on the assumption that all the SEPs in suit are valid and infringed.  It arises in this context because the SEPs in suit are UK patents.   </p>

So the licence must render lawful the roaming use of a Huawei product bought overseas and brought into the UK.  Parties taking a FRAND approach to this problem would not embark on trying to decide the legal issue posed by roaming if they could avoid it.  Both parties would see that the other had a point.  Something has to be done about it in order to ensure the licensee is fully licensed but a clause like Unwired Planet’s is not sensible.  Absent any other way of dealing with it the parties would agree a modest uplift on the royalty base to take roaming into account.  There is no evidence of how many international handsets enter the UK every day, whether for business purposes or carried by consumers, nor how long they stay here.  Absent any other figures, the parties would agree a simple percentage uplift on the total handset royalty to take it into account.  I think a fair, reasonable uplift is 4%.   </p>

The independent auditor will have full access.  If an underpayment is identified the parties can meet to discuss it.  The licensor needs to be allowed access to relevant information as long as the licensor keeps it confidential.  Huawei’s final proposal was to accept access by the licensor on that basis but to allow the licensee to limit what is provided to what the licensee considers reasonably necessary.  I think that is fair given that the independent auditor will have access to all information and could raise a problem if they thought the licensee had not given enough information to the licensor to address the underpayment.  So I accept Huawei’s wording.  </p>

Unwired Planet submit this is a typical and proportionate approach to running encumbrances upon the assignment of patents and argue that Huawei’s approach is much more onerous.  They say it imposes on Unwired Planet “a burden that engenders uncontrollable, unpredictable and potentially ruinous costs hanging over them” and that Huawei “have provided no compelling reason to do it”.

I share the view expressed by the Netherlands Government that the fact that an undertaking owns an SEP does not necessarily mean that it holds a dominant position within the meaning of Article 102 TFEU, and that it is for the national court to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether that is indeed the situation.  </p>

(Unwired Planet did not agree that Huawei was right about the implications of the Competition Act but I do not have to get into that.)  I do not believe Dr Niels was directly disagreeing with the Commission.  His point was that if one was considering market wide abuse then <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Motorola</span> para 240 and Guidelines paragraph 18 make sense.

It may turn out that at the stage of analysing the alleged abusive conduct with respect to the particular large customer, the power of that customer means there was no abuse, but that takes place at a different step in the analysis.   </p>

The SEP owner does not have to be in a dominant position for the FRAND undertaking to bite.  The FRAND undertaking is not imposed by competition law it is imposed by giving the undertaking to ETSI and arises from the standard setting.  The French courts are in a much better position than this court to rule on French law but having to rule on foreign law is not unusual.  This court has held that FRAND is enforceable in an English court.  The other FRAND decisions from other courts around the world show that other courts have enforced FRAND too.   </p>

Dr Niels pointed out that the undertaking means that the SEP owner cannot refuse to grant a licence.

Prof Neven summarised the point neatly as being that when assessing market power constraints which have been imposed precisely because the firm would otherwise enjoy such power, such as a FRAND undertaking, have to be ignored in order to avoid circularity.  However, putting the matter that way is too broad.  The problem some of these cases were concerned with was whether to lift the constraint in question based on an argument that, with the constraint in place, an undertaking was not dominant. So if it is not dominant, why have the constraint?  But that is not a reason to lift the constraint if the undertaking would be dominant without it, and that kind of reasoning is indeed circular.   </p>

Irrespective of its “independence”, it seems to me that when considering the specific position of an individual SEP owner’s conduct the only appropriate way to assess whether that SEP owner is in a dominant position as a matter of fact is to take the practical effect of the FRAND obligation into account.   </p>

It is no use pretending the obligation is perfectly enforceable and rigidly adhered to if that is not correct.  What matters here is how the SEP owners actually behave.

SEP owners and putative licensees are both well aware that the FRAND undertaking obliges the owner to grant licences.  Mr Lasinski’s evidence about the reduction in royalty rates before and after 2013 is evidence that the perception that FRAND is enforceable has increased significantly.  Behaviour has changed at least to some degree as a result of perceptions of the power of the FRAND undertaking.  For the period from 2013 to today, in my judgment the FRAND undertaking does operate as a practical constraint on a SEP owner’s market power, which is what it was intended to do.  In the relevant market FRAND does give buyers a form of market power they would not otherwise have which they can and do wield.   </p>

Perhaps an appropriate way to look at it is as a market for inventions.  The implementers can and do implement the inventions the subject of SEPs simply by making standards compliant equipment.  Unlike a market for goods or services, what the implementer actually wants is something it has ready access to, namely information, all of which is freely available in the standards.  Normally a seller of a product can restrict practical access to his or her goods without payment just by refusing to sell them.  The holder of an intellectual property right like a SEP cannot do that.  That is of course why the right to exclude given by the injunction plays such a significant part of intellectual property disputes, because it is the means by which the law seeks to put the intellectual property owner into the analogous position to an owner of tangible property such as a product or land.  It is sometimes said that a SEP owner is selling technology but this analysis shows that that is not accurate. </p>

As Prof Neven said, if, despite the FRAND commitment, the ability to exclude was available as a matter of course “you would expect to have hold up very, very systematically” and that would deprive FRAND of any meaning.

If they have to pay licence fees then they will of course do so, but the idea that implementers are all rushing to pay licence fees is fanciful.  The structure of the market inevitably gives rise to the possibility of licensees holding out.  </p>

Huawei contend that at paragraph 121-122 the CJEU had held that an “at risk” entry to a market is “not unlawful in itself”, and it is therefore for a patentee to “prove before the national courts” that there is actually an infringement.  Those paragraphs were concerned with a very different context from the present case.  <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Lundbeck</span> was about generic entry at risk into a patented market and agreements between the innovator and the generic supplier.  Paragraph 121 is about the effect of a presumption of validity.  Leaving aside the question of whether the Patents Court recognises any such presumption at all, the point in the paragraph is that just because there may be a presumption of validity that cannot be turned into a presumption of illegality of the generic products launched at risk.  That is unsurprising and not relevant.  The relevant part of paragraph 122 is concerned with the point that launching at risk as a type of conduct is not unlawful.  It is not suggesting that an implementer would not have been committing the tort of patent infringement from the outset if they did so, albeit that might only be established after the event.

The latter can be an abuse in the relevant circumstances but the former is not (see the judgment on the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> question, paragraphs 72-76).  The judgment is quite clear on this but the distinction is not an easy one since, at least in English civil practice, a claimant can, with the court’s permission, amend a claim after issue and before trial (or even sometimes after trial and before judgment).  It may be that in other European countries with different approaches to civil procedure such an amendment is more difficult but the judgment does not address this.  Prof Neven did not really agree with the CJEU on this.  His view was that even if the commencement of litigation did not involve the threat of an injunction, “by commencing proceedings before attempting to engage in the good faith negotiation that Huawei could have legitimately expected, Unwired Planet’s behaviour can, from that perspective, be seen as amounting to an abuse”.  Leaving aside whether that is what Unwired Planet did, the point is that Prof Neven’s approach would cover starting a claim for damages only.  The line drawn by the Professor here is much clearer but it is not in the same place as the line drawn by the CJEU.  I must follow the CJEU.  Although the distinction they have drawn is rather narrow and could lend support to a technical argument of the kind run by Unwired Planet here, in my judgment the point does not go far enough to do that.  </p>

First, on its own terms the Particulars of Claim does seek an injunction and the words of the qualification are against Unwired Planet because they do not squarely accept that Unwired Planet is under a licensing obligation at all.  I accept that submission too.  Unwired Planet’s characterisation of the qualification as simply one which only applied if Huawei is an unwilling licensee is not accurate.   The words “<span style="font-style:italic">insofar as the Claimant is and remains required to grant such a licence</span>” introduce a widely stated contingency about Unwired Planet’s position, irrespective of the status of the defendant, unwilling or otherwise.  If a form of words could have done the trick at all, this form of words did not achieve it.  </p>

One point was to remove non-SEPs (although Unwired Planet say that was always available in the April offer anyway).  In the same period Huawei’s Defence and Counterclaim was served.  In this document and amongst other things Huawei denied infringement and counterclaimed for revocation of all the SEPs, contended that Unwired Planet had acted in breach of Art 102 by commencing the litigation prematurely, stated (paragraph 54) that if contrary to its case any of the SEPs are valid and infringed then the patentee was not entitled to an injunction and its only remedy is damages equivalent to a FRAND licence fee, and stated (paragraph 56) that in relation to any SEP which is found to be valid and infringed Huawei will undertake to enter into a licence on terms found by the court or agreed between the parties to be FRAND.   </p>

In order to facilitate such frankness, what is said without prejudice is generally inadmissible before the court.  At the same time parties can also make open offers to each other which are admissible, assuming they are relevant.  If an open offer would be a good idea, the fact one is negotiating without prejudice is not a reason not to make it.

However by March 2015 the only open offers which had been made and which therefore could be admitted in court were Unwired Planet’s two offers of April and July 2014.

In my judgment without prejudice offers are not admissible to establish that the alleged infringer is a willing licensee.  An alleged infringer making an offer without prejudice makes it knowing it is not admissible in court and intending that to be the result.

Huawei were always free to make an open offer if they saw fit and they knew or ought to have known that.  It is also true that at the March 2015 CMC Unwired Planet changed their tune and submitted that the without prejudice rule did not apply to any licensing negotiations, but the point was not pursued.

There is no basis to criticise Huawei that it made an offer in those terms since that is what I directed all the parties to do, because they said they were willing to do so.  There is however a point to be made that that was the only open offer Huawei was willing to make at that stage.  In cross-examination Mr Zhang sought to justify the position on the basis that that is what the court order provided for.  That will not do.

The letter ends stating that “we suspect that Unwired Planet’s true motivation for making this suggestion is to try and set up an argument that Huawei is not a willing licensee because it has not agreed to arbitrate the dispute.

Nevertheless, the fact remains that as at February 2016 the only offer Huawei had been prepared to articulate in terms which Huawei was prepared to put before this court (i.e. on an open basis) was the one made pursuant to the court’s direction the previous year.

The distinctions are the essential nature of the SEP (para 50) and the irrevocable nature of the FRAND undertaking (para 51).  The court holds at paragraphs 52-53 that these two features mean that despite the exclusionary nature of the patentee’s right, implementers have a legitimate expectation that the SEP owner will grant licences on FRAND terms so that refusal to grant such a licence may in principle constitute abuse.   </p>

That gives implementers legal rights and obligations which the CJEU’s decision was not able to recognise.  The FRAND undertaking gives an implementer who is prepared to accept whatever terms are FRAND a right which amounts to a defence to the claim for an injunction.  That is because the implementer is entitled as a matter of law to be granted a FRAND licence and the wording can be settled by the court (or by an arbitrator).  Since the injunction relates to future activity, no injunction is ever likely to be warranted.

The CJEU notes the general secrecy about licences in this industry and points out that the patentee will be best placed to make an offer which is non-discriminatory, since the patentee will know what other licences it has concluded.

Only if the implementer does that can they rely on the Art 102 abuse defence.  This condition is not mentioned in Huawei’s distillation.  It should be.  I presume it was not included because Huawei’s position is that Unwired Planet never gave them a chance to do this before the proceedings were commenced.  That is understandable as far as it goes but putting it that way presupposes a narrow view of the CJEU’s decision that the whole scheme is a form of mandatory protocol which must precede issuance of a claim form, which has nothing to do with what happens once proceedings have been issued, and if proceedings are started without complying with the scheme to the letter, the scheme is no longer relevant at all.

Therefore a licence on FRAND terms may not contain a no-challenge clause (the contrary has not been suggested anyway given normal competition law principles).  It also means that reserving that right to challenge cannot be taken against an implementer.  Importantly the CJEU also states that instead of just reserving the right to challenge, the challenge can be brought “in parallel to the negotiations relating to the grant of licences”.  In other words starting a legal action is not the same as a refusal to take a licence on the part of the implementer. </p>

Challenges to validity and essentiality (infringement) are brought by bringing legal proceedings for revocation or a declaration of non-infringement.  So if the whole scheme from paragraph 60 onwards was intended to be mandatory before the commencement of legal proceedings by the SEP owner, the clear statement by the court that an implementer may bring the challenges in parallel to the negotiations would not be consistent with it.  Otherwise the scheme would have the effect that the SEP owner may not even issue a claim until the negotiation process leading to a counter offer had got that far, but the implementer could issue a claim for revocation and a declaration of non-infringement at any time.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The relevant referred questions are answered in paragraph 71, which in effect summarises the conditions discussed above.  In this paragraph and elsewhere the judgment does state that the implementer must express a willingness to conclude a licence “on FRAND terms” and the patentee must make an offer on such (i.e. FRAND) terms.  However the judgment does not suggest anywhere that the national court needs to examine whether the terms offered actually were FRAND or not.  What I believe the CJEU is getting at is that each side must make clear they are willing to conclude a licence on FRAND terms, since that is what matters.  The commitment to FRAND licensing is what counts.  And then the relevant party should put forward concrete proposals.  Whether a particular concrete proposal is actually FRAND is not what the CJEU is focussing on.  No doubt a prejudicial demand or a sham proposal may itself be abusive (that issue arises below) but that is another matter. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Notably in the first bullet point of paragraph 71 the CJEU expressly locates the SEP owner’s alert and FRAND offer to the implementer as being “prior to bringing that action”.  This supports Huawei’s strict submission about timing.  However it is also notable that paragraph 71 is expressed in clear terms as a statement that the SEP owner does not abuse its dominant position if it complies with what is stated.  The referred questions did not have to be answered that way round.  Having been through the court’s reasoning above it seems to me that, as one might expect, the CJEU has sought to express itself with care.  By answering the referred questions in a manner which states what is not an abuse, the court has deliberately not decided that any deviation from the scheme described of any kind will necessarily make it abusive to issue an infringement claim which includes an injunction claim.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">However, as mentioned above, paragraph 60 of the judgment is written the other way round, holding that a SEP owner will breach Art 102 unless they give notice before bringing a claim.  I have given careful thought to what this means for my interpretation of the judgment as a whole.   I cannot read the judgment including paragraph 60 as drawing a bright line whereby any deviation from the conditions set out in any circumstances is necessarily an abuse of dominant position.  That is just not what the judgment as a whole says.  Moreover paragraph 60 is not expressed by reference to the detailed conditions.  The paragraph simply provides that bringing an injunction claim “without notice or prior consultation with the alleged infringer, even if the SEP has already been used by the alleged infringer” is an abuse.  The paragraph does not mention offers for FRAND terms, they come in paragraph 63.   So the most the CJEU is saying in paragraph 60 is that an action brought without some kind of prior notice will be abusive.  What amounts to a sufficient notice in a given case ought to depend on the circumstances. </p>

Also relevant was the offer by Unwired Planet of some of those SEPs for sale to Huawei in 2013.  I reject Huawei’s attempt to dismiss these contacts as immaterial.  Also relevant are the discussions with the Huawei IP department which started in November 2013.  Although the discussions had not reached the stage of claim charts being provided, because the NDA had not been agreed, Huawei knew that claim charts would be coming.  The evidence was that negotiating parties wished to discuss the merits of the licensor’s claims before getting down to discussing money.  That is relevant because it shows that not discussing financial terms at that early stage was normal.  Also relevant is that throughout the period from the end of 2012 Huawei were making and selling 2G, 3G and 4G phones and infrastructure and they were not paying any royalty for patents they had previously licensed.  </p>

Dealings with Samsung were what drove Unwired Planet’s timing.  Nevertheless it made sense to include Huawei and Google in the UK in one set of proceedings.  If an action against Samsung had started in the Patents Court and some months later Unwired Planet had issued another action in the Patents Court on the same patents against another company such as Huawei, the proceedings would in all probability have been dealt with together at a single trial anyway.   </p>

They did not need to be treated by Unwired Planet as naïve.  From Huawei’s point of view, at the moment just before Unwired Planet issued proceedings against them in April 2014, Huawei had sufficient notice that Unwired Planet held particular SEPs and they knew or ought to have known that if the declared SEPs held by Unwired Planet were indeed valid and essential, then a licence was required.  They did not yet have claim charts.  All the same, for Huawei, the only realistic and foreseeable ways in which the existing contact with Unwired Planet was going to conclude would be by Huawei persuading Unwired Planet that they had no good SEPs or proving it in court or by Huawei taking a licence.  Huawei also knew that Unwired Planet wanted to license Huawei.  In these circumstances the information Huawei had by March 2014 was quite sufficient for Huawei to understand that issuing proceedings including an injunction claim did not represent a refusal to license.

Those terms included the royalty rate.  That is outside the letter of the CJEU’s scheme but only by a relatively short time.  It reinforces what was obvious in any case that the issuing of proceedings did not indicate that the SEP owner did not wish to license its SEPs to Huawei. </p>

I have been through the course of this litigation already.  A relevant point for this analysis is that in terms which are admissible in court, Huawei never subsequently made an unqualified offer to accept whatever were FRAND terms.  Huawei always reserved for themselves the right to say that a licence of worldwide scope was not FRAND.  Indeed, part of Huawei’s case was that a worldwide offer was contrary to Art 102. </p>

None of the worldwide rates offered by Unwired Planet in 2014-15 are FRAND.  They are all higher than the benchmark FRAND rate and higher than all the rates in a worldwide licence.  The offers in 2016 were not FRAND either although the 2G/3G offer (0.065%) was to all intents and purposes the same as the 2G rate (0.064%) but not the 3G rate.   </p>

The 2014 2G/3G offer (0.1%) is between about one and half (1½) times and six times the FRAND benchmark. </p>

Huawei are a large and sophisticated organisation, used to negotiating telecommunications licences and not unfamiliar with patent litigation.  To make an opening offer to Huawei which is between about 1½ and 3 times the upper level of the FRAND benchmark rate is not an abuse contrary to Art 102(a).

The rates a reasonable person would derive based on that information are much higher than the rates to be derived from the close analysis of the comparable licences which has been done in these proceedings. It was reasonable for Unwired Planet to set its offered rates by reference to that information.

This includes comparing the offer in 2015 which was for the five SEPs in suit with a benchmark for the larger UK portfolio but that is a minor issue.  For 4G the UK FRAND benchmark rate was about four times Huawei’s 2015 UK patent by patent offer and double Huawei’s 2016 UK portfolio offer.  For 2G and 3G the FRAND benchmark span is 0.032% - 0.13% and Huawei’s offers in 2015 ranged from zero to a rate 9 times less than the benchmark.  Huawei’s 2016 portfolio offer overlaps the benchmark at the lower end and is about three times less at the upper rate.   </p>

The outstanding issue relates to Unwired Planet’s 2014 offer which was for a licence under its whole portfolio, SEPs and non-SEPs.  Huawei say that to bundle the SEPs with non-SEPs was unlawful bundling or tying.  Huawei say the bundling of SEPs and non-SEPs poses two threats.  One is that one cannot tell in such a licence whether the SEP owner is complying with a FRAND commitment.  The other is that the practice can eliminate competition on the merits between non-SEP technologies.  I accept the second point, which is much stronger than the first.  I do not need to decide if the first point on its own is enough.  Licences can be drafted that way (cf Lenovo) but they do not have to be. </p>

There is clear evidence that in some cases the parties agree to a licence which includes both SEPs and non-SEPs together.

I am far from being convinced that a refusal of an injunction in 2017 would have been a proportionate remedy for Unwired Planet’s abuse on that assumption.  A single patent normally takes about one year to come to trial on validity and infringement in the Patents Court.  The abusive commencement of this action in April 2014 would have justified refusal of an injunction in April 2015 and no doubt for a good time after that but we are now two years on from that time, a year on from the finding of infringement and three years overall from the start of the proceedings.  Any prejudice to Huawei from the commencement of the proceedings has been outweighed by time and by Huawei’s stance in relation to a FRAND licence.  An appropriate alternative remedy might have been to refuse to award any damages to Unwired Planet for the proven infringements in the intervening period (and remove a corresponding term from the licence).  However I do not have to resolve those issues.  </p>

A willing licensor and willing licensee would have agreed on the very same licence I have found to be FRAND.
