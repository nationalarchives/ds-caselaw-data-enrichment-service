IONA is claimed by Illumina to infringe all of the Patents, whereas Harmony is claimed to infringe only Lo 1. Premaitha and TDL/Ariosa (“the Defendants”) claim that the patents under which they are sued are invalid. Dr Tappin QC, on behalf of TDL/Ariosa, took the lead in relation to Lo 1 and Mr Mitcheson QC and Mr Hinchliffe QC, on behalf of Premaitha, took the lead in relation to the other patents. Premaitha supported TDL/Ariosa’s challenges to validity and title of Lo 1. It advanced separate arguments as to non-infringement of Lo 1 by the IONA test. </p>

He had relied on Professor Hogge’s second report for information about the history of development in the field. Insofar as it was submitted that he lacked relevant expertise, I reject that suggestion. He is a preeminent geneticist who was very familiar with the genetic principles and tests of relevance to Lo 1.

I shall bear in mind that Professor Lovett was not working in the prenatal field in 1997 when assessing his evidence, although this needs to be balanced against his experience of genetic tests of relevance to Lo 1. Although at times he expressed his views forcefully, this was because they were strongly held. I do not accept that he lacked objectivity. It is true that he was reluctant to accept assumptions, but this was because he wished to make clear that he disagreed with them. Overall, his evidence was very helpful and his intention was to assist the Court. </p>

The general approach to treatment was to treat all mothers identified as Rh negative with anti-Rh factor antibodies (so called prophylactic anti-D), ensuring that any Rh positive foetal red blood cells are masked before an immune response can be raised against them by the mother's immune system, hence preventing issues with subsequent Rh positive pregnancies. This was, however, an inefficient approach as it inevitably involved treating Rh negative mothers carrying Rh negative foetuses, who did not need the treatment. There was, therefore, a desire to develop a way to screen for the Rh status of the foetus non-invasively – this would allow prophylactic anti-D to be given only to the Rh negative women who needed it (i.e. those carrying a Rh positive foetus). </p>

Work was on-going in 1997 to try to find ways to identify foetuses with possible sex-linked disorders. There was, therefore, a desire to develop a way to identify the sex of the foetus quickly, accurately and as early as possible in the first trimester. Further, in cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, treatment with dexamethasone is needed to prevent virilisation in girls. This medication can be stopped once the foetus is known to be male. In severe X-linked diseases for which the parents would typically elect termination, having a diagnosis as early as possible in the first trimester is valuable. DNA testing for the disease in such cases (which often took a week or longer) would only be done after the sex determination and could be omitted if the foetus was known to be female. Gender determination by ultrasound only becomes reliable for establishing the sex of a foetus from 18 weeks onwards.  </p>

This led to the development of what became known as the 'triple test'. Instead of involving an invasive test, measurement of the levels of these markers could be achieved using a simple blood sample from the mother at around 16 weeks' gestation. The triple test was the standard serum screening test for Down's syndrome for a long time (and was eventually offered to all pregnant women regardless of age in many countries).  </p>

It had also been discovered that foetuses affected by Down's syndrome could be identified using ultrasound scanning in what was known as the nuchal translucency test. By 1997 researchers had started to consider whether combining the nuchal translucency test with serum markers might give even more accurate results.  </p>

In fact, the concentration of foetal DNA in maternal plasma expressed as a % of total DNA has been measured as from 0.39% (the lowest concentration measured in early pregnancy), to as high as 11.4% (in late pregnancy), compared to ratios of generally around 0.001% and up to only 0.025% for cellular fractions (Hamada et al 1993).

It is discussed which types of cells may serve as a source of extracellular blood DNA (either trophoblasts, lymphocytes, or decidual cells), the significance of such DNA for pregnancy being appreciated<span style="font-style:italic">.</span>” </p>

It states that it is believed that the highmolecular component of extracellular DNA in the blood comes from living cells, and certain types of cells, especially lymphocytes, excrete extracellular DNA into their surroundings. It asserts that blood also contains “<span style="font-style:italic">low-molecular DNA</span>”, the content of which, in the blood of rats, increases after total x-ray exposure.

Two types of PCR primers were used to amplify DNA extracted from the blood sera: a pair of primers (B1 and C2) which resulted in the amplification of 239 base pair fragments from within each Alu repeat; and a single primer (Tc65) which resulted in the amplification of fragments flanked by two repeats with their 3’regions facing each other (referred to by Kazakov as "inter-Alu repeats”). </p>

In total, in excess of 500,000 Alu repeats are present in the human genome and they comprise approximately 10% of the human genome. Amplification of Alu repeats, or inter-Alu repeats, may be used to establish whether human DNA is present in a sample. Given that Alu repeats are so prevalent in the human genome, and the sensitivity of PCR, even a small amount of human DNA in a sample will be expected to be detected.   </p>

However, it would have been of interest to the notional skilled team for two reasons. First, it contained a new idea that extracellular DNA was present and detectable in the blood of pregnant women (in common with all other people). Even though the existence of extracellular DNA in human blood had been known to the scientific community for many years, this was not part of the common general knowledge of either member of the skilled team. Secondly, it contained the idea that some of the extracellular DNA in the blood of pregnant women could be of foetal origin. That would have been of significant interest to the skilled team because of its potential utility for prenatal screening and diagnosis. It provided a potential alternative to the foetal cells approach.   </p>

In particular, Kazakov suggests foetal trophoblast cells as one of the potential sources of extracellular DNA.

However, it would not have tried to repeat Kazakov’s experiments. The test to verify Kazakov’s theories was straightforward and well established: PCR on plasma / serum from a woman carrying a male foetus using the well-known and proven primers for Y chromosome DNA, which would have been expected to detect foetal extracellular DNA if it was present.  That could have been done quickly and easily, in parallel with work on foetal cells, and it would have succeeded. </p>

Examples are said to include foetal Rhesus D status (page 4 lines 815). The Lo 1 Priority Document says that this is possible because rhesus positive individuals possess the rhesus D gene which is absent in rhesus D negative individuals. Therefore, the detection of rhesus D gene sequences in the plasma and serum of a rhesus D negative mother is indicative of the presence of a rhesus positive foetus (with a rhesus positive father). The authors also propose the use of cell free foetal DNA in maternal plasma and serum for identifying foetal haemoglobinopathies (page 4 lines 16-21); and detection of paternally inherited DNA polymorphisms or mutations (page 4 lines 21- 5 line 2). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.02in;text-indent:0.5in">The first approach disclosed for achieving this is based on the hypothesis that the level of foetal DNA in maternal plasma and serum will be higher in aneuploid pregnancies than in normal pregnancies. Therefore, it is suggested that quantitative detection of foetal nucleic acid in the maternal plasma or serum could be used to screen pregnant women for aneuploidies (page 5 lines 7-18). Prof Oepkes explained at [9.41] of his first report that there is no evidence to support this hypothesis and the skilled person would not regard it as reasonably credible. Furthermore, the suggestion that levels of foetal DNA are higher in aneuploid pregnancies than normal ones has not been reliably and reproducibly established. He also explained at [12.2] – [12.4] that, despite the desire to use maternal plasma or serum as a means for detection of aneuploidies, this approach has not been successfully put into practice. I accept this evidence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.02in;text-indent:0.5in">The second approach in the Priority Document proposes the identification of a foetal marker on the chromosome of interest, and a foetal marker on a reference chromosome, and determination of the relative quantity of the two. The relative quantity will be different depending upon whether the pregnancy is normal or aneuploid. Ms Norbury and Professor Oepkes gave evidence that an attempt to use this approach for the detection of aneuploidies, using sequences that are paternally inherited and not possessed by the mother, would only be capable of working, if it worked at all, in detecting aneuploidies in which the extra chromosome was inherited from the father, which account for less than 10% of trisomy 13, 18 and 21. Even then, there would be very considerable difficulties in trying to put this approach into effect in identifying suitable foetal markers, and in carrying out successful quantitative assays. Professor Oepkes’ opinion, which I accept, was that this method would have been regarded as unworkable and implausible in practice. It has never been put into practice in spite of the desire to use maternal plasma or serum as a means for detection of such aneuploidies. </p>

In the present case, I released this judgment in draft, with four “confidential” appendices which I asked the parties to review and justify. Appendix 4 contained terms of certain licence agreements. Illumina was concerned during the trial that the terms were confidential to third parties.  Confidentiality is no longer maintained, and I have included this section in the public parts of this judgment. There was no dispute about the confidentiality of Appendices 2 and 3. As to Appendix 1, Illumina submitted that several features, claimed to be confidential, had been publicly disclosed by TDL/Ariosa at a hearing in the Barcelona Mercantile Court in May 2017, and the remaining features could be inferred from that public disclosure. TDL/Ariosa accepted that certain aspects were disclosed, disputed that some information would be accessible to competitors from the court file, and denied that certain features which were not disclosed could be inferred. The account of what was disclosed in the Spanish proceedings was anecdotal, and did not establish that a competitor of TDL/Ariosa could gain access to a clear description of the features of the IONA process as set out in Appendix 1. I accept TDL/Ariosa’s submission that nowhere has the information in Appendix 1 been disclosed as a combination; that it would be highly detrimental for its competitors to have access to this information; and that it is not practical to divide up the reasoning in Appendix 1 into public and private sections.  </p>

The purpose of the Polymorphic Assay is to determine the Foetal Fraction and it is not used for genotyping. The Polymorphic Assay involves looking at the relative quantities of the alleles in the sample at each SNP, and relies on the detection and quantification of maternal DNA as well as foetal DNA.

It is not limited to a particular method of detection which was known at the priority date. Nor does it require knowledge as to whether the method is looking at a foetal SNP of paternal origin. There are no such limitations in the claim. Claim 1 requires detection of the presence of a nucleic acid of foetal origin in the maternal serum or plasma sample. To fall within the claim, the nucleic acid so detected must be a paternally inherited sequence which is not possessed by the pregnant female. A method which is capable of detecting such a nucleic acid in the sample which has that property is covered by the claim and no element of knowledge is required. </p>

There is a claim for a declaration of non-infringement in respect of each of the two proposed versions.  Insofar as the IONA test includes sex determination, it infringes claim 8 if it infringes claim 1. The issue turns upon the proper construction of “detecting” and “detection” of a nucleic acid sequence that is paternally inherited and not possessed by the pregnant female. In particular, does the IONA test detect the Y chromosome in a male foetus? That depends upon whether the claim requires direct detection, or whether indirect detection is sufficient. </p>

However, I do not accept that this difference in reliability is significant. The XO syndrome, which, in the IONA method, could lead to an incorrect sex determination, is extremely rare. The IONA method is used to make a sex determination, which is provided to the mother, and is intended to be relied upon. Prof Avent explained that although XO syndrome occurred in about 3% of pregnancies, these were spontaneously lost very early in pregnancy within the first trimester. The IONA test is only given to women who are at least 10 weeks pregnant. Therefore the instances of XO syndrome amongst women to whom the test is administered is likely to be extremely small.

However, in case I am wrong, I will briefly summarise my view on this issue. Had I rejected Illumina’s primary case, it would have been on the basis that the Lo 1 Patent was limited to direct detection.  On that basis, I would not have been satisfied that the variant of indirect detection achieved substantially the same result in substantially the same way as the invention, nor that this would have been obvious to the person skilled in the art at the priority date. No evidence was directed to this issue by Illumina, and I would have required evidence in the circumstances of this case. </p>

The Opposition Division held that the patent specification did not disclose adequate information to enable this and the deficiency was not remedied by the common general knowledge.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.02in;text-indent:0.5in">Initially, I thought that this was a powerful argument.  However, as is often the case with arguments based on prosecution history, greater knowledge of the contents of the file suggested otherwise. The claim limitation which was made during the opposition proceedings excluded the detection of the presence of foetal sequences which are indistinguishable from those of the mother, which fell within the scope of claim 1 as originally granted. That was the context in which the Patentee’s representative made the statement cited above. The IONA test does not perform a method which detects the presence of foetal sequences which are indistinguishable from those of the mother. Instead, by looking at the total quantity of X chromosome sequences (without distinguishing those of the mother from those of the foetus) it detects the presence of the paternally inherited Y chromosome sequences, which are not possessed by the mother. No attempt is made by the IONA test to detect the presence of maternally inherited foetal sequences, which gave rise to the objection of insufficiency. Therefore, I do not accept Premaitha’s argument based on the prosecution history of the Lo 1 Patent. </p>

He explained that Illumina has no ‘Persons’ within the definition of ‘Affiliate’ over which it does not exercise control, and therefore no Affiliate may operate the licence without its authority. He further explained that there is no Person who exercises control over Illumina, since it is a publicly quoted company with no shareholder who has a controlling interest. Therefore, Illumina argued that there is no Person over whom Illumina might not exercise control, or who might themselves exercise control over Illumina, who could claim to be an Affiliate under the agreement. </p>

First, the PPA expressly confers a licence on Illumina and its Affiliates. Pursuant to the PPA, Affiliates of Illumina do not need authorisation from Illumina to operate the licence in respect of the Lo 1 Patent, because they are licensees in their own right. This appears clear from the wording of section 2.3(a). It is confirmed by section 2.1(a), which provides that the Illumina Parties, which means Illumina and its Affiliates, are to have an exclusive licence under the Pooled Patents. It is further confirmed by section 2.3(b) that the PPA is not a grant of an exclusive licence to Illumina alone, with a power to sub-license its Affiliates. Illumina and each of its Affiliates, from time to time, are licensees. Therefore, Affiliates do not require  an authorisation from Illumina Inc to exploit the Lo 1 Patent. Affiliates licensed by the PPA include not only Illumina Cambridge, but all other Affiliates of Illumina Inc, from time to time. </p>

I have considered these references, but I have not felt it necessary to set them out in this judgment. I set out below the way in which common general knowledge progressed between 1997 and 2006, which provides a technical background the Quake Patents.

The Poisson distribution is used to ensure than on average not more than one target sequence is present per vessel.  PCR is then performed in each vessel using primers to target a chosen sequence.  The quantitative element of dPCR relies upon the assumption that each vessel found to contain an amplicon of interest indicates that one copy of the target sequence was present prior to PCR.  For each vessel analysed, the target molecule will be identified as present or absent – i.e. “digital” results are produced.  Counting the number of positive results allows quantitation of the number of target sequences in the original sample.  </p>

In emulsion PCR, droplets are created in a microemulsion, each droplet acting as a reaction chamber and containing on average one template molecule, a paramagnetic bead to which PCR primers are attached and the necessary enzyme and reagents for PCR.  After amplification, copies of the template molecules will be attached to the beads and these can be harvested and probed to identify the target amplified.  The large number of droplets created in a microemulsion increased the throughput potential of dPCR by several orders of magnitude over manual pipetting into conventional wells.  Emulsion PCR would have been common general knowledge by 2006. </p>

Illumina contended that the Quake Patents constituted a radical departure from a settled way of thinking in the art, which persisted after the publication of Lo 1997 in the field of NIPD. This settled approach involved attempting to distinguish maternal from foetal DNA. One route being pursued was physical separation.  Attempts were made to isolate foetal cells found in maternal circulation, or alternatively to extract foetal DNA from maternal DNA. A second route was to distinguish foetal DNA from the maternal background by the use of foetal ‘markers’ which could be epigenetic, polymorphic or foetal-specific RNA. The Quake Patents adopted a quite different idea, namely that of detecting aneuploidy in a foetus by counting relative occurrences of sequences from potentially aneuploid and diploid chromosomes in maternal plasma, without differentiation between maternal and foetal DNA.  </p>

As aneuploidy is characterised by a difference in the copy number of the aneuploid chromosome then, in theory, this difference could be distinguishable if a sufficiently accurate method could be used. However, there was thought to be a significant hurdle in reducing the theory into practice as the foetal fraction presented in maternal plasma was believed to be very low. That hurdle was, in essence, a problem in counting the changes in copy number of the foetal chromosome with sufficient accuracy, which was beyond the capabilities of qPCR machines available.” </p>

For Down’s syndrome detection a sequence on chromosome 21 is chosen, along with a control sequence on a reference chromosome.  The DNA is then diluted and distributed into discrete samples so that on average each sample will contain not more than one target sequence. PCR is conducted on each well using primers for both the control sequence and the sequence that may be altered or found in different copy number in the foetus.

Each sample is examined for the presence or absence of a target sequence corresponding to the potentially aneuploid chromosome, and the presence or absence of a target sequence corresponding to a reference chromosome. The reference chromosome typically represents one which is highly unlikely to be subject to aneuploidy if the chromosome of interest is aneuploid in the foetus. The numbers are counted. In the case of foetal aneuploidy (for example Down’s syndrome), one would expect a small excess of the target sequences (from chromosome 21) over the reference sequence (e.g. from chromosome 12), even though the excess is in the minor fraction of cell-free DNA originating from the foetus.

Recent implementations of comparative genomic hybridization to microarrays containing genomic or transcript DNA sequence provide improved resolution, but are currently limited by the number of sequences that can be assessed (16) or by the difficulty of detecting certain alterations (9).

The approach is particularly applicable to the analysis of human cancers, wherein identification of homozygous deletions and amplifications has historically revealed genes important in tumor initiation and progression.  The method of the invention can be used with a variety of other applications.  For example, the approach could be used to identify previously undiscovered alterations in hereditary disorders.  A potentially large number of such diseases are thought to be due to deletions or duplications too small to be detected by conventional approaches.  These may be detected with Sequence-Based Karyotyping, even in the absence of any linkage or other positional information.” </p>

Amongst the paragraphs relied upon by Premaitha, all of which I have considered, it emphasised the summary of the invention in [0007]; the use of the method disclosed in Shimkets to detect aneuploidy, for example at [0014], [0049], [0063] and [0083]; and the reference to both cell and tissue in [0060]. It said that [0082] discloses that the samples may be obtained from amniotic fluid or CVS, both of which could be contaminated with maternal tissue or affected by placental mosaicism. It referred to [0090] which discussed the advantages of the Shimkets method and in particular its higher resolution than previously known methods. It pointed out that its application to the counting of mRNA and methylated DNA fragments is suggested at [0093] and [0094], which were both being used in the context of cell-free foetal DNA in maternal plasma samples at the priority date.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.02in;text-indent:0.5in">I have reached the conclusion that the Quake Patents are not obvious in the light of Shimkets, for the following reasons. First, Shimkets is not concerned with NIPD. Its approach is to test a foetal cell obtained using an invasive technique such as amniocentesis or CVS. Applying the <span style="font-style:italic">Pozzoli</span> approach, this is a profound difference to the claimed inventions of the Quake Patents. Considering the common general knowledge, I have referred to the three settled approaches that were applied at the priority date in NIPD. Shimkets would not prompt the skilled team to depart from any of these approaches. Shimkets disclosed the analysis of isolated foetal cells and the use of separately acquired information from a normal reference cell. It did not contemplate mixed samples other than in a pathogen detection system, and even in that context used a qualitative assessment made by looking for unique markers.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.02in;text-indent:0.5in">The Quake approach renders it unnecessary to extract a foetal cell, or to isolate or identify foetal DNA. There is no requirement to use reference information. The invention uses digital analysis on a mixture of foetal and maternal DNA, from plasma or serum, and considers the ratio of sequence reads or detections of individual target sequences from two chromosomes, both present in the mixture being tested. In my judgment, Shimkets would confirm the need to apply one of the settled approaches which was common general knowledge at the priority date in order to obtain a pure cell upon which Shimkets based his analysis, and would not suggest the Quake approach.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.02in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, in my view, Premaitha’s experts approached Shimkets from an incorrect starting point. When considering Shimkets, Professor Avent assumed that the skilled person would come to the document with the approach set out in [70] – [74] of his first report. That characterised the problem in the art as merely one of counting, to which the development of new technology, such as the 454 GS20, obviously provided a solution. He claimed that his ‘brute force’ approach was part of the common general knowledge. I have not accepted any of these propositions. Dr Erlich’s evidence proceeded on the basis that he was working in a skilled team with a clinician who took Professor Avent’s approach. I regard this approach as hindsight. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.02in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally, even if the clinician had referred Shimkets to the geneticist, I was not                        satisfied that the geneticist would have arrived at the Quake invention.  Professor Lovett was strongly of the view that the invention was not obvious, and provided detailed reasons, for example at [208] – [219] of his Second Report, which I found to be logical and coherent. Dr Erlich, whose frank and honest evidence did him great credit, referred during his cross examination to a proposal that he had made to Roche in 2008 or 2009, after the priority date. It appears that this concerned the use of sequencing machines for quantifying an allelic imbalance, which fell outside the claims of the Quake Patents.  </p>

Dr Erlich estimated that using 384 well plates, two lab technicians using 10 thermal cyclers running two PCR experiments per day would take 17 days to analyse a single sample, at a cost of approx. US$510,000.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.02in;text-indent:0.5in">Illumina submitted that if there are several target sequences on average in each sample, it will become more difficult (when using digital PCR) to detect the precise number of such sequences, even though in principle the Patent (and the application) teaches that multiple numbers of a sequence can be detected by increased fluorescence. It suggested that the Application made clear that the feature was not essential to the invention. It relied upon page 31 lines 24-25, which was part of the ‘specific applications’ in the disclosure and contained a protocol for preparation for trisomy with frequency analysis. The application referred to ‘<span style="font-style:italic">genome equivalents</span>’ as ‘<span style="font-style:italic">the entire genomic content of a single normal cell (46 chromosomes)</span>’. Illumina submitted that since there are two copies of a given target chromosome in each genome equivalent, there are at least two targets per ‘<span style="font-style:italic">genome equivalent</span>’.  Thus, any time the Quake patent refers to performing digital PCR with anything above a 0.5 genome equivalent of DNA per well, it is contemplating having, on average, more than one target per well.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.02in;text-indent:0.5in">Premaitha submitted that a key part of digital PCR is the process of limiting dilution.  This ensures that on average there is not more than one target sequence per well.  This dilution is critical to the method because it allows the subsequent counting of positive wells as it can be assumed that if the well is positive for a target sequence, there was only one target sequence present.  There is therefore no need to quantitate the amplitude of the positive signal.  Similarly, if sequencing is being used as the measuring step, the skilled person would be aware that it was crucial that only a single DNA sequence was present in each sequencing reaction (albeit that multiple copies of it could be present to increase the signal).  The skilled person would know that if there were more than one sequence present, the well would be uninformative.  Premaitha contended that the skilled person would understand that integer (a) of the claim was directed to such a limiting dilution step.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.02in;text-indent:0.5in">In digital PCR, samples are diluted, for example to about half a genome per well. As there are two copies of each autosomal chromosome, this dilution means that those wells which contain target sequences can be assumed to have one instance of the target sequence per well. However, this is not the case in massively parallel sequencing, in which each reaction contains only one DNA fragment or sequence, and not half a genome. Massively parallel sequencing is expressly disclosed at [0096] of the Quake Patent, and was the subject of claim 16 as granted. Claim 1 as granted covers massively parallel sequencing which does not require a dilution step.  Premaitha’s argument is even more difficult in respect of claim 10 as proposed to be amended, which is limited to massively parallel sequencing. </p>

The wells on the chip are, randomly, either empty or full. Premaitha argued that this was due to the loading process, but whatever the cause, the result satisfies the claim. Furthermore, not all DNA sequences are used in subsequent steps. Those wells that map to the Y chromosome and those wells which contain DNA that is unmappable are excluded from the analysis, as Dr Erlich explained at [249] of his First Report. Occupied wells containing target DNA (used in subsequent analysis) and occupied wells containing non-target DNA or unmappable DNA, vary randomly, due to the random nature of the distribution of ISPs, which also vary randomly. In my judgment, the IONA test satisfies this feature of the claim. </p>

Therefore, the polyclonal ISPs should not be taken into account when calculating the average number of target sequences per reaction sample. Once polyclonal ISPs are excluded, each sample in the IONA test contains on average considerably less than about one target sequence per sample. A calculation submitted on behalf of Illumina shows that the average is 0.73.  </p>

Dr Erlich explained at [225] – [234] of his First Report that the difference between them is manifested in how the sequencing libraries are prepared prior to sequencing. In random, or ‘shotgun’ sequencing, the sample DNA is broken up into fragments and adapter sequences are attached to each of the fragments of DNA so that PCR amplification of the whole genome library can occur and the library fragments can later be attached to a bead or site for clonal amplification and sequencing. In the case of targeted sequencing, specific sequences are pre-isolated before sequencing. Dr Erlich’s evidence, which I accept, was that both methods of sequencing were common general knowledge at the priority date.  </p>

It said that the IONA test is alleged to infringe the claims of Quake, which are directed to digital PCR, albeit digital PCR that uses direct sequencing in the measuring step.    The definition of “Verinata Exclusive Field” excludes (by operation of the definition of the term “Nucleic Acid Sequencing”) digital PCR and “similar nucleic acid amplification and detection procedures”, which are then defined in functional terms that map directly on to the claims of the Quake patents.  As such, Premaitha argued that digital PCR and similar nucleic acid amplification and detection procedures are not licensed to Verinata.

It provides methods for determining whether a nucleic acid sequence imbalance (e.g. chromosome imbalance) exists within a biological sample obtained from a pregnant female. This involves detecting an imbalance in sequences obtained from the potentially aneuploid chromosome compared to those from one or more euploid reference chromosomes. A pre-determined number of sequences are obtained by performing random sequencing on the DNA sample.  Each sequence is aligned to the human genome by a computer system. The number of sequences aligned to a potentially aneuploid chromosome is obtained, as are the number of sequences aligned to one or more second, or reference, chromosomes.  A parameter is determined from these amounts, the parameter representing the relative amount between the first and second amounts.  This parameter is then compared to a cut-off and based upon this comparison, a classification of whether a foetal chromosomal aneuploidy exists in the first chromosome is determined.   </p>

Of course, it could be said that they are all examples of sequencers which use emulsion PCR, although even this is not, in fact, correct (see below).

Paragraph [0192] appears in a section entitled “Massively Parallel Genomic Sequencing Using Emulsion PCR”, and it immediately follows that title. Even though it refers to the Illumina Solexa Sequencer, the disclosure, on its own, is not sufficiently clear. This paragraph is not a general disclosure but one which is confined to emulsion PCR.

In particular, Dr Erlich explained that digital RCD detects an over-representation of signal from the target sequence on the potentially aneuploidy chromosome. Detection of over-representation enables a conclusion to be reached as to the presence of aneuploidy or otherwise in the chromosomes of interest. The claims of Lo 2/3 are directed to digital RCD using random sequencing. This is taught as one of the alternatives in [0132] of the Priority Document. It is true that there is no disclosure of how to apply massively parallel genomic sequencing to the digital RCD method. However, the skilled person would have no difficulty in implementing the method, using common general knowledge.</p>

This was supported by the evidence of Dr Erlich at [242], [244], [438] and [441] of his first report and by the evidence of Professor Lovett at [165] of  his second report.

Therefore, the use of a random sequencing method at the priority date does not necessarily result in a fraction of the genome being sequenced. It is correct that Margulies sequenced a complete genome. However, this was a small bacterial genome whereas the Priority Document is concerned with the human genome. Dr Erlich explained at [267] of his first report that the bacterial genome sequenced in Margulies was 580 kbp, whereas the human diploid genome is about 10,000 times larger. The 454 GS20 sequencer would need to have been run for a vast number of hours to sequence the whole human genome, and the disclosure of the Priority Document would not be read as contemplating this. </p>

Margulies set out to sequence the entire genome of a bacterial genome. Paragraph [0132] of the Priority Document discloses the use of massively parallel genome sequencing to sequence human DNA in order to detect foetal aneuploidy. The detection of human foetal aneuploidy does not require sequencing of the entire genome, and this would be plain to the skilled person - it would be pointless. Therefore, I reject this attack on entitlement to priority. </p>

A print out from the Wayback machine of a previous version of Premaitha’s website (XX-A/3) as it stood on 18 January 2015 was put to Prof Avent.  This describes the IONA test as the “<span style="font-style:italic">first non-invasive in vitro diagnostic product for prenatal screening</span>” and “<span style="font-style:italic">a complete diagnostic system that is simple and standardised</span>”.  The website has now been changed to exclude reference to the word “<span style="font-style:italic">diagnostic</span>”. Professor Avent considered that this language was used because of the requirements concerning CE marking of a medical device in the EU.  IONA is approved under Directive 98/79/EC, which regulates in vitro diagnostic devices.  It was submitted that this was a description required for regulatory purposes in respect of a test which would not be considered diagnostic by the skilled team.  I do not consider that this meets the point.

The answer must be the punter. Where does he use it? There can be no doubt that he uses his terminal in the United Kingdom and it is not a misuse of language to say that he uses the host computer in the United Kingdom. It is the input to and output of the host computer that is important to the punter and in a real sense the punter uses the host computer in the United Kingdom even though it is situated in Antigua and operates in Antigua. In those circumstances it is not straining the word 'use' to conclude that the United Kingdom punter will use the claimed gaming system in the United Kingdom, even if the host computer is situated in, say, Antigua. Thus the supply of the CD in the United Kingdom to the United Kingdom punter will be intended to put the invention into effect in the United Kingdom." </p>
