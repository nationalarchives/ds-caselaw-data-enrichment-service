	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This case is about European Patent (UK) No. 2 393 259 entitled “Telecommunication and multimedia management method and apparatus”.  The defendant Voxer contends that a live broadcast feature offered by the claimant Facebook infringes the patent.  Facebook denies infringement and contends the patent is invalid.  The proceedings were started by Facebook as an action for revocation.  Voxer counterclaimed for infringement.  The matter has been tried under the Shorter Trials Scheme. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The application for the patent was filed on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2008 claiming priority from a series of US filings, the earliest of which was made on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2007.  This is the relevant priority date in this case.  The patent was granted on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2016 based on a divisional application.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Voxer made an unconditional application to amend the claims and then made a second unconditional application.  The latter is the only set of claims now in issue. They are set out in Annex A.   The amendments are objected to on added matter and clarity grounds, and on the basis that they fail to cure the invalidity.  The Comptroller has made adverse observations about the amendments.  Voxer contends that those observations essentially mirror and are based on points taken by Facebook in the litigation.  If the amendments are refused entirely then it is common ground the patent must be revoked.  It is conceivable that the only amendments which might be refused are to dependent claims, in which case, despite Facebook’s submission to the contrary, I believe the right thing to do in that case would be to invoke the partial validity jurisdiction under the 1977 Act, allow the allowable amendments, refuse those which must be refused and renumber claims accordingly.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In terms of independent validity, the focus of the case has been on claim 1.  Claim 5 is alleged to be independently valid and infringed.  The allowability of the amendments to produce claims 2, 3, 4, and 10 needs to be considered and claim 10 is said to be independently valid but not infringed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Voxer contends that the patent is infringed by the live broadcast feature offered to users via the Facebook website and through the Facebook and Instagram Apps as they operate on iOS devices (i.e. devices sold by Apple).  Infringement is advanced on a normal construction of the relevant claims and on the basis of the doctrine of equivalents in two respects.  Infringement under s60(2) is also alleged in certain respects.  On equivalents, in addition to its denial, Facebook also contends it has a <span style="font-style:italic">Formstein</span> defence.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Voxer had claimed there was infringement by the feature offered via the same Apps as they operate on Android devices.  However following clarification of how those Android Apps worked shortly before trial, Voxer withdrew the allegation of infringement.  I dismissed that infringement claim and granted a declaration of noninfringement. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Facebook challenges validity on various grounds.  The claims are alleged to lack novelty and/or be obvious over two items of prior art: WO 2006/121550 (Atarius) and US 2006/0003740 A1 (Munje).  Both were published before the earlier claimed priority date of the patent.  Facebook also alleges the claims are invalid for insufficiency.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Facebook called expert evidence from Dr Tim Kindberg.  Dr Kindberg is an expert in distributed systems and has 30 years experience as a platform and application developer.  His opinions essentially supported Facebook’s case.  He was a good witness, seeking to help the court with his answers to questions posed in crossexamination.  That does not mean I will necessarily accept everything Dr Kindberg said, for example I have not accepted some of his evidence about what was common general knowledge. </p>

His opinions essentially supported Voxer’s case. </p>

Facebook also submitted that he was at times internally contradictory.  The aspect where this point has significance arose from a contrast between his view about what was taught by the patent (which often focussed on conversations) and his broader view about the alleged infringement (which did not).  That is a specific issue I have taken into account where it mattered.  It is no reason to apply a general discount to his opinions. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.00in">The fact he could not recollect where a point of detail (half-duplex) had come from was not sinister.  Mr Unitt plainly knew what half-duplex communication was.  That was not something suggested to him by anyone else.  He did not think his use of it to characterise a particular point had been suggested by the lawyers, but given all the discussions which had gone on, he could not say with 100% certainty.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.00in">The fact he picked up some patent lawyer speak (such as the phrase “term of art”) and may have misunderstood it does not tell the court anything useful.  The idea that he can be criticised for expressing the view that something may involve “an inventive step over” a particular item of prior art is absurd.  There is a jargon in patent cases which experts inevitably pick up and use.   </p>

As Dr Kindberg put it, there would be an application programmer with experience in multimedia (voice and video) networking, streaming and messaging.  There would also be a back-end developer with knowledge of streaming protocols and responsible for server-side software.  I believe in substance these two amount to the same team/person as the one posited by Mr Unitt, who emphasised the need for experience in telecommunications networking, particularly voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), and the processing and management of media.  If there is a difference between them then I prefer Dr Kindberg’s formulation because it explicitly highlights the significance of application software (on a mobile device running on a phone or laptop) and of server-side software, and because it explicitly highlights video as well as voice.  </p>

However, his disagreement came down to a point about the skills of the team.  He agreed that the team would build a system with a user interface, but Mr Unitt’s conception of the skilled team was one with sufficient skills to build a workable user interface without input from a specialist.  I doubt it matters but if it does, then again I prefer Dr Kindberg’s formulation.  That is because I am quite satisfied that user interface development skills would be required of the skilled team (and did exist). </p>

Consider two mobile phone devices connected to the internet via wireless telecommunications networks.  For this purpose one can take all that network infrastructure for granted and ignore it.  An application on one device could communicate with a corresponding application on the other device by sending messages to the other device through the network infrastructure without the involvement of any intervening application on the network.  This is peer to peer communication.  The contrast is with the client-server model in which the applications on the devices each communicate with a special application server which exists somewhere in the network.  Each model has advantages and disadvantages.  There could be more than one application server on the network.  </p>

This emphasises the advantages which storage of the media created or received by the communication device provides.  There is another mention of a variety of modes of conversations – live or time shifted.  The invention is said to be applicable to phone calls, conference calls, instant voice messaging and tactical communications.  It also provides for the ability to seamlessly transition back and forth between the two modes. The advantages of local storage on the communication device itself are referred to in the penultimate sentence. </p>

The detail starts at paragraph [0026] with a section called “A. Functional Overview”.   This section is akin to the functional specification of an IT system.  According to paragraph [0026] the invention supports new modes of engaging in voice conversations and/or managing multiple simultaneous conversations.  This can use a variety of media types including voice, video and text.  Depending on their priorities recipients might participate in real time or be notified that a message is ready for later retrieval. </p>

Further, users engaged in a conversation can seamlessly transition from the live mode to the time-shifted mode and back again. This attribute also makes it possible for users to engage in multiple conversations, at the same time, by prioritizing and shifting between the two modes for each conversation. Two individuals using the system can therefore send recorded voice messages back and forth to each other and review the messages when convenient, or the messages can be sent at a rate where they essentially merge into a live, synchronous voice conversation. This new form of communication, for the purposes of the present application, is referred to as ‘Voxing’” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The first sentence in this passage is clearly talking about the same two modes of conversation which the previous passages have already referred to.  Those two being live and time shifted.  That matters because what had previously been referred to as a live mode now has the term “near-synchronous” applied to it – which conveys the idea that it is not necessarily fully “live” but perhaps somewhat stilted.  The sentence also tells the reader something about the use of the inverted commas around the word live – both here and in earlier paragraph [0022].  The term live is being used in a figurative sense to encompass communication which the skilled reader might think a pedant would not have regarded as fully live.   </p>

The skilled reader would regard the language “voxing” with some suspicion and as hype.  The idea of communicating by exchanging discrete recorded messages would not be seen as a new one.  It is voice messaging, which the patent itself acknowledges is known.  Therefore, whatever this new form of communication is, it must be more than that.  The characteristic of most apparent importance in paragraph [0028] is that the messages are recorded (saved) in a number of locations.

If either User delays their participation, for whatever reason, the Conversation drifts towards an asynchronous voice (or other Media) messaging experience. In alternative embodiments, Conversations can be optionally Tagged as asynchronous Messages only or synchronous Messages only. In either of these cases, the Conversation cannot drift between the two modes, unless the Tag is reset.

In this context two kinds of messages are referred to – synchronous messages and asynchronous messages.  The former are associated with the live real time mode and the latter with the time shifted mode or voice messaging.  However, I do not believe this would be understood as ruling out the idea that it is possible to have a live or a “near synchronous” experience using asynchronous messages.   </p>

This mentions advantages provided by storage of media in the user’s device.  In this passage there is a reference to “time shifted delivery” of a message as a result of lack of network connectivity.  Voxer points out that this usage encompasses network delay within the concept of time shifting.  Facebook says this should not be understood as use of the defined term, which relates to something a user does.  Facebook is right in a grammatical sense but looking ahead to the dispute about claim construction, if the answer is to be found in that kind of meticulous verbal analysis (which I doubt) the language of the claim is concerned with a time shifted mode and a time shifted message rather than being concerned with a user engaging in the act of time shifting.  There is another reference to a time shifted mode at the end of a later paragraph [0116] which confirms that the media can be retrieved from the local store or the one on the network.  </p>

It is the same mode whether it is called any of the following: live; “live”; real time; near synchronous or “live”; near synchronous “live”; near-synchronous real time “live mode”; a near synchronous, full duplex conversation (similar to standard "live" phone calls); near synchronous (i.e. live or real-time); or near real-time.

I will return to this below but at this stage it bears pointing out that there is a relationship between the answer to this question and the meaning of “time-shifted communication mode”.  Facebook argues that time-shifted communication mode refers to the same thing as what they contend is the meaning of time-shifting in the glossary in the patent (para [0038]).  The argument is that time-shifting does not mean just any shift in time between the utterance of a message and its rendering to be heard by the receiving user, it has a more limited meaning based on the glossary, of only a delay caused by a user choosing to render a message later than the moment in time it is received at that user’s device.  In my judgment that is wrong for three reasons.  First, the natural way the words themselves would be understood by the skilled reader would be as a reference to any kind of time shift.  Second, the reader would not think the words in the claim were intended to limit a time shifted mode in the manner alleged when the patent specifically describes a communication mode in which the delay is caused by the network (paragraph [0069]).  Third, the paragraph in the glossary makes sense as an explanation of what is possible without being seen as an attempt to put an artificial limit on the scope of what the claims mean by a time-shifted mode of communication.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I believe the distinction between the live mode and the time-shifted mode is simply a matter of the degree of time shifting.  Nearly live will still be within the live mode but appreciable time shifting, whatever its cause, will take the conversation into the other mode.  The claimed method requires the system to be capable of doing both.  Therefore, if there is a significant delay from the point of view of the experience of the participants that will be the time shifted mode not the live mode. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">On the other hand, if Facebook’s approach to time-shifted mode was right, that that mode is not characterised by the degree of time delay experienced, it would follow that the mode was instead characterised by user action.  In which case the distinction between the live mode and time-shifted mode would not be one of degree but one of kind.  That would be confusing and is another reason why I believe Facebook’s interpretation of time-shifting is wrong.  It would be confusing because, if the circumstances worked out appropriately, a mode in which the user was making an active choice to listen to an incoming message as soon after being told it was received as possible, would be a time-shifted mode even though the experience was nearly live.  Also, it could lead you to think that a message which had been delayed by a long time, say hours, but not due to any choice by the receiving user – might either have to be regarded as “live” even though no-one would ordinarily call it even “nearly” live, or would be a third mode of communication even though it is pretty clear the patent as a whole regards the two modes as covering a continuum. </p>

Rather than thinking of a conversation as a single synchronous event, the Patentee recognises that a conversation can be considered as being made up of a series of asynchronous messages between pairs of participants.  In this way, instead of two people (A and B) being in a single synchronous conversation, their conversation is treated as being made up of asynchronous messages from A to B and B to A. From a technological perspective, this enables A to transmit a message to B at any time irrespective of whether B is listening, and vice-versa.”  </p>

The fact that the different parts of that stream maintain the same time relationship that they had when they were uttered does not make them “synchronous” or “live”.  In order to work out whether the period of delay inherent in a method which works this way is suitable for supporting a live communication mode, one has to ask whether it is suitable for supporting a live mode of having a conversation.  To answer that one has to consider what would happen if the listener to the stream decided to reply to the “message” by sending back some kind of reply.  Even if the reply was instantaneous it would still have the initial period of delay built into it.   </p>

The purpose of storing persistently is so that the data which has been stored can be retrieved later by the user.  That might be shortly afterwards or a long time later.  Mr Unitt thought the term “persistent storage” was a term of art and referred to any storage in a non-volatile medium such as flash memory or a hard drive (which remembers even when the power is switched off), by contrast with storage in volatile memory (RAM) which forgets when the power is turned off.  I do not accept his evidence that it is a term of art at all, but even if it is, there is more to the point than this.  I agree that to satisfy the claim one would need to store the message in a non-volatile medium such as flash, but while that is a necessary condition it is not a sufficient one.  This claim language also requires that the message is kept in order that it can be retrieved later by the user.  That does not mean forever, but there must be a degree of persistence.  So merely putting the data in a buffer or other temporary store, even if that was in fact implemented using flash memory, would not satisfy claim 1. </p>

The storing also has to be done persistently, which has the same meaning and purpose as in the first clause.  Amongst other things this act of storing allows for a time-shifted retrieval from the local device.  The receiving, storing and rendering are done “as the media is progressively received in a real-time rendering mode”, in other words, there must be real-time presentation of the incoming voice/video stream.

Voxer contends that the inventors’ contribution is founded on the realisation that conversations need not be thought of as having synchronicity between the participants.  A better communication method can be achieved without trying to reproduce the ‘in the same room’ effect in which there is an immutable timing relationship (i.e. a synchronous relationship) governing the transmission of the various participants’ speech.  Rather, the patent treats the conversation as a series of directional messages between pairs of participants which do not have any fixed timing relationship between them.  From the perspective of a single participant, this allows the timing of their outgoing messages and the incoming messages to shift with respect to each other.  The claim embodies this by requiring that the outgoing and incoming message are ‘asynchronous’.  </p>

Contrary to Facebook’s case I do not agree that the fact the claim requires the messages to be asynchronous necessarily creates a fatal inconsistency between that and the requirement for a live communication mode.  That is because, as Voxer contends and the explanatory rider in claim 1 makes clear, the term “asynchronous message” in the claim does not mean a message which is in fact shifted in time or “asynchronous” in that sense, it means a message whose timing can be varied so that the media of an incoming message can be (but need not be) time shifted relative to the outgoing message.  This chimes with a passage in paragraph [0053] which provides that the conversation may flow between “near synchronous (i.e. live or real-time) and asynchronous (i.e. time-shifted or voice messaging modes)”. </p>

Paragraph [0053] does contemplate an alternative in which the messages are forced to be synchronous in nature so that the same room effect, as best it can be, is achieved all the time but that is not what the claim is focussed upon. </p>

Voxer’s case is that application servers without storage are not hops.  Voxer supports this with the submission that Mr Unitt’s evidence was that a hop in the patent means a “server with a capital S that includes storage”.  That was his evidence, but it is irrelevant.  Hop is not a term of art.  Voxer also submits that Dr Kindberg agreed in cross-examination that the hops in the specification included storage.  I accept that, but it does not mean that the word hop in the claim – which is obviously a metaphor – would necessarily be understood as excluding application servers which did not contain storage.   </p>

The objection to Voxer’s definition is that it is circular.  I do not agree.  What it requires is storage at each application server which has the capacity to undertake that storage.  If the server does not have that capacity, then it is not a hop.  But if an implementer had application servers in the path which did have that capacity, but did not store the messages at those hops, then the set up would be outside the claim at least on a normal construction. </p>

I disagree.  The skilled reader would understand that the live mode claimed in claim 1 has the meaning I have ascribed to it already.  It includes a situation in which the users perceive no delay at all, in other words they perceive the same experience as a traditional full duplex telephone call.  It also includes an experience in which delay is perceived albeit the delay is small and the experience is nearly live.

I reject this.  For one thing, as explained above, the reader would understand that in the specification (and claims) an asynchronous <span style="font-style:italic">message</span> is one which has the capacity to be time-shifted.  In that context (which is how it appears in claim 1) the word “asynchronous” is not being used to refer to the actual timing of a given message.  Whereas claim 4 is talking about the timing of an asynchronous message which has in fact been time-shifted in a particular way (due to network storage) with the result that it is not near synchronous at the first communication device.  Furthermore, as Voxer contends, some asynchronous messages may be in fact be close to synchronous (i.e. near synchronous) and other asynchronous messages may be further away from that (i.e. not near synchronous).  I reject this objection. </p>

The point being made here is a clear one in the sense that Facebook can imagine that Voxer might point to some transitioning between the two modes, say in a bit of prior art, and assert for some reason Facebook cannot predict that although it is a transition between the modes, for some reason it is not a seamless one.  Then Facebook would have the ability to say that such a narrow meaning is not clear.  However, there is no such point in the case and so this issue does not arise. In its written submissions (para 560 (d)) Facebook pretended that it was taking a wider and unconditional point that “seamless” was just ambiguous.

To extract those words from the authorities and then place emphasis on them in the way Facebook has, risks making a mistake.  There is no doubt that the law of added matter is there to protect third parties by limiting the patentee’s room for manoeuvre by reference to the application as filed.  It is also true that it prevents the patentee from obtaining certain kinds of different monopolies.  But some differences between the monopoly claimed in the granted patent as opposed to whatever was claimed or disclosed in the application as filed are unproblematic and lawful, and are not prevented by the law of added matter.  It is an error to focus simply on the idea of a difference in the monopolies and it is not what the previous cases were talking about.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not accept this.  Facebook’s real complaint is that Voxer asserts that the invention is not limited to what Facebook regards as the originally disclosed time-shifted mode but rather includes different and additional “time-shifted modes”, such as a mode where the media is not first stored on the first communication device and is then later rendered from that storage, but rather is rendered immediately on receipt from the network.  The construction of time-shifting which Facebook contended for and which I have rejected above would have meant that it excluded rendering a message immediately on receipt from the network and so Facebook’s added matter argument is presented as if it is related to its case on construction.  In fact I believe this added matter argument is wrong irrespective of the construction issue.  The glossary paragraph which Facebook relies on to support its case on the meaning of time-shifting (which is also in the application as filed at paragraph [0073]) positively describes a number of different things a user can do which are versions of time shifting.  That shows that whatever time-shifting means, to refer to “at least one time shifted mode” is not added matter.   </p>

It is the text which confirms that “asynchronous message” refers to a capacity of the message and not to whether the media of the message has in fact been time-shifted. This idea is said not to be disclosed in the application as filed.  I disagree.  In my judgment it is disclosed in the paragraph which is [0053] of the granted patent and [0095] of the application as filed.  This paragraph makes clear that even if the user experience of a conversation is that of a synchronous full duplex conversation, the messages which are used to convey the media will be what the patent calls asynchronous messages.  It also makes clear that when these asynchronous messages are used in a conversation the user’s choice can cause the experience to change from that of a synchronous full duplex conversation to a time shifted one.  The messages in both cases are always “asynchronous messages”.  In other words what the patent application calls “asynchronous messages” have the capacity such that the media can be time shifted or not.  Thus, the words of the rider in brackets do not add matter.  They are supported by the application as filed. The reader would not learn new information from claim 1 as proposed to be amended. </p>

It was said to be a squeeze on infringement but, while not impossible, squeezes between infringement and added matter are rare because claim scope is not the same thing as what is disclosed by a claim (see <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">AC</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Edwards v Acme</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Alcon</span>).  Moreover, comparisons with a granted claim are not relevant to added matter because what matters is the application as filed.  In this case no objection of extension of claim scope (Art 123(3) EPC) has been raised.  I reject the added matter argument because I can discern no material difference in disclosure between this proposed amendment and paragraph [0151] of the application as filed, which is the relevant paragraph. </p>

I reject this because the skilled reader would understand this feature of the claim to be referring to the same persistent storage as is described at length in the application and is also referred to in feature 1g and 1h.

Maybe it does not but I reject the argument that this idea in claim 3 amounts to added matter.  What claim 3 discloses is the idea that the method supports a time-shifted mode in which the first device plays the media of the incoming message out of storage on that device after the incoming message was received (e.g. because the user has chosen to do this) in a case in which the outgoing message and the incoming message are near synchronous at the first communication device.

There was a question whether transitioning between two conversations did or could result in a change of mode.  Voxer pointed out that Figure 13C of the patent (and in the application as filed) does show a switch between conversations which also changes the mode from live to time-shifted.  I agree that that is in Figure 13C but I do not agree that that is what claim 5 would be understood to be referring to.  A method where the first communication device could not seamlessly transition between the live mode and time-shifted mode of the same conversation, would not be within claim 5.

So far none of what has been described above mentions two people having a conversation.  That is not an accident.  In order for two people to have a conversation using this technology, the first user would have to broadcast a video stream I will call video stream A.  The second user could access video stream A as soon as it was available or choose to watch it at a later time.  However, they could not send a video back again until they stopped watching video stream A.  Once they chose to do so, the second user could then start broadcasting their own video stream, call that video stream B.  The first user could then, if they wished to do so, access video stream B as soon as it was available or choose to watch it at a later time.  And the process could continue.  That would be a form of conversation between the two users because of the semantic connection in the minds of the two users between the two video clips.  Nevertheless, there is no link between these two video streams A and B at a technical level.  This conversation is possible simply because everyone is able to broadcast a live video stream from their device in this system.  Notably in this conversation there would be a minimum of 20 second round trip delay from the point of view of the first user and their viewing/hearing any reply from the second user.   </p>

That is so.  It also amounts to a conversation of sorts and in that example the round-trip delay from the point of view of the first user is 10 seconds.  Its relevance will be considered below.  </p>

None of the relevant terms are terms of art.  Facebook contends that this sort of delay is not what the patent means by live, particularly when one bears in mind that in a conversation between two users there will be a 20 second minimum round-trip time.  Voxer’s retort makes the reasonable point that Facebook itself uses the word “live” to characterise the feature alleged to infringe, however as I have already explained in the construction section above, the word live used in that broadcast context is referring to a different idea. </p>

The reason is because one needs to ask whether this system would provide a live mode for having a conversation, and the answer is no.  The experience of a minimum of 10 seconds between whatever it is the broadcasting user wishes to communicate in their outgoing message and its receipt by the viewing user is too great a delay.  That is so even if one imagines the receiving user somehow replying instantaneously, i.e. Voxer’s example of a fan posting back a text request for the next track without using the live broadcast feature.   </p>

The line drawn by the patent is whether the system supports a live communication mode as the skilled reader would understand the patentee to have used those words to mean.  A minimum 10 second delay is just too big.  </p>

Nor is it right (as Voxer alleged in paragraph 63(b) of its written closing) that it is relevant that the viewer is able to participate whilst the message is still being sent.  That fact is an indication that the transmission is progressive but it does not establish that the method necessarily supports a live communication mode.  </p>

The fact the time shift is caused by the network and is not under either user’s control is irrelevant.  There are also then other time-shifted communication modes, because users can pause the stream and then start watching it again (introducing more delay) and users can also watch the broadcast much later if the broadcaster has chosen to make it available that way.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Facebook sought to make a complicated point about the fact that the stored “was live” broadcast could be different from the actual live data stream.  An example of why this might be so was because network quality might mean that the live stream a user received had had to be encoded at a lower bit rate (poorer quality) to accommodate that poor network connection whereas the stored “was live” video was high quality.  That makes no difference in my judgment because what matters is that the media – i.e. what the user watches – is the same media from the point of view of the user.  The fact the media may have been encoded in a different format, whether higher or lower quality or for some other reason, is irrelevant.  The fact there may be minor differences between the way the media appears to users on different occasions also makes no difference.   </p>

Voxer accepts that storage in the short-term RAM buffer does not satisfy the claim.  I agree.  Voxer relies on the temporary copy in the <span style="font-style:italic">tmp</span> directory.  Facebook says it is not persistent because Apple’s guidance information shows that the <span style="font-style:italic">tmp</span> directory is periodically purged by the operating system when the app is closed or inactive, and when that happens the data will be lost.  Moreover, says Facebook, that data is not accessible to a user.

One reason is in order to allow the broadcasting user to upload (share) a copy of the broadcast to the Facebook network in order to allow viewers to watch it if they wish.  Another reason is to allow the broadcasting user to “save” the video at the end of the broadcast.  As partly explained already, if the user chooses either of these options then the video file in the <span style="font-style:italic">tmp</span> folder will either be uploaded to the network for others to watch (in the first case) or be moved into local non-volatile storage outside the app (if “save” is selected) so that it can be accessed in the same way as other photos or videos saved on a mobile device. </p>

The fact the user may not realise that is happening is irrelevant, so also is the fact one can conceive of some circumstances in which the <span style="font-style:italic">tmp</span> file could be lost.  Looking at it the other way round, in a case in which the broadcasting user has chosen to upload (share) the video message to the network (and unbeknownst to the user that file came from the <span style="font-style:italic">tmp</span> folder), the reason that was possible is because the message had been progressively and persistently stored starting in the <span style="font-style:italic">tmp</span> folder. </p>

The cross-examination established that the following scenario occurs and is realistic.  A viewing user can be watching a live video.  As they do, the incoming stream is stored in the temporary cache.  The viewing user can pause and rewind. They can start watching the stream again without fast forwarding back to the live head.  In some cases, e.g. if the pause is for an appreciable time, then when the viewing user starts watching again what they will view will have come from the network.  However, there are circumstances in which, when the viewing user starts watching again after a pause or rewind, then the stream they see will be rendered from data in the temporary cache.  Thus, the storage in the temporary cache allows for later retrieval by the user, even if is only a relatively small period of time later from the user’s perspective.  That is enough to amount to persistently storing the incoming data. The fact it is later removed outside the user’s control is irrelevant.   </p>

That “use case” only emerged at trial.  In Voxer’s primary infringement case before trial the outgoing and incoming messages were entirely unrelated.  The point was simply that a mobile device running the app (or a personal computer logged into the website) could be used to send an outgoing message as called for by the claim and also, on another unrelated occasion, the device could be used to view a video broadcast by someone else.  Facebook took a point on this integer as a vehicle for submitting that in Voxer’s primary infringement use case there was no semantic connection between the incoming and outgoing messages.  Without that, it was said, they cannot be asynchronous messages because they have no relationship at all.   </p>

So far so simple.  However, as the rider in claim feature 1i makes clear (and was the case anyway from the specification – which is why the rider is not added matter), the timing shift in question which has to be possible in order to give the incoming message the relevant characteristic is a shift relative to the outgoing message.  It is not talking about a shift in timing inside a video stream within a single message, relative to itself.  </p>

This aspect of Voxer’s case on what a message is, what an asynchronous message is, and how the claim relates to a conversation, has the result that those concepts have a very wide meaning.  They read onto a technique which simply gives multiple users in a network the ability to broadcast live video streams to everyone else.  No skilled person reading the patent would think that that was “voxing” or was what the patentee had contributed.

The PoP servers will temporarily cache message data as part of the onward transmission process, but that kind of storing is not what the patent is referring to.

It does not arise.  But in case this matter goes further I will say that I was not convinced that the live broadcast feature, if it does not satisfy the claim in that respect, would infringe by the doctrine of equivalents.  I will assume in Voxer’s favour the second Actavis question.  The problem is the first and the third question, looked at together.  The skilled reader would understand that in order to allow time-shifting, some persistent storage of the message is necessary since otherwise, after it had been played it would not be available to be time-shifted.  There are only two places in which it could be stored – the local device or the network.  They are both clearly described in the patent.  The reader would understand the similarities and differences between them.  If one focusses on the similarities then one might say that it makes no material difference where the data is stored (Q1 in Voxer’s favour) but that indicates that it was all the more significant that the patentee, who plainly knew that too, positively chose to claim only local and not network storage (Q3 against Voxer).  Or conversely one might focus on the differences and conclude that it does make a material difference to store on the network rather than locally, since (for example) the network may not be available or there may network delays inherent in trying to get the data from the network.  Thus either way the equivalents analysis is against Voxer and there would be no infringement.  Put another way, and more briefly, this is an example of the “disclosed and not claimed” objection to equivalents.  </p>

The way the Facebook and Instagram Networks are set up in this connection is nothing more than an implementation approach which necessarily arises when one wants to deploy a communication method on a very large scale.  It is no doubt a practical necessity for Facebook to use multiple servers geographically distributed around the world.  In terms of the way the invention works what is necessary in such a system is that each relevant server (“hop”) that has a need to access the messages, is able to do so.  That could be implemented in the simple manner described in the patent (storage of identical copies at each hop) but it could also be done by using a distributed storage system which can be accessed by all the relevant servers.  The Instagram and Facebook networks achieve substantially the same result in substantially the same way as the invention. </p>

This was said to be supported by the point made by Arnold J as he then was in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Akebia v Fibrogen</span> [2020] EWHC 866 at paragraphs 452-545 that the reader must be deemed to be aware of the reasons why a narrowing amendment had been made and that the amendment in effect disclaimed all other ways of achieving the same effect.  I agree that the skilled reader will be deemed to know why an amendment has been made.  And I can also see that if the reason for the amendment (say) was to remove a particular thing from the scope of the claim because it was prior art, then one can see immediately why that might have a bearing on Actavis Q3 if the patentee was seeking to say that the introduced wording could not be strictly complied with in order to cover the very thing it was introduced to exclude from the claim.  However, added matter is a different kind of objection, as I have already explained above.  Although it affects the scope of the claim it is in fact concerned with disclosure, which is a different thing.  Its purpose as a legal principle is to protect third parties by holding the patentee to their disclosure.  Changes in claim scope are dealt with directly by different provisions.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">So imagine a case in which a claim on its normal construction is valid and not infringed, but a defendant’s device is (i) found to infringe by the doctrine of equivalents but also (ii) found to be obvious over the prior art.  Is the right answer that the claim is infringed but invalid because its proper scope, taking into account equivalents, encompasses something obvious over the prior art; or is it valid but not infringed on the footing that part of the law of equivalents mandates that if these are the facts the equivalents doctrine does not expand the claim?  Either answer can be justified logically.  Indeed, if the matter was free from authority, given the way the scope of the claim is defined in the EPC itself, one might think the invalidity approach is a purer application of the letter of the law.  After all it is how equivalents worked when they were taken into account as part of purposive construction before <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Actavis</span>.  </p>

In that case I would hold the CDN equivalents argument was not open to Voxer.  However, this does not arise in the present case.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">As the title suggests, Munje proposes a system for recording the PTT voice communications.  The problem Munje starts from is explained in paragraph [0005] as being that PTT communications are generally immediate and unannounced.  An end user of the mobile station may be busy or caught “off-guard” and not listening to the initial communication.  Therefore, the end user may not hear at least the initial PTT voice communication and so the “talk groups” (i.e. the people to whom the message is addressed) may have to respond to indicate that they did not hear the initial communication.  This is inconvenient and wasteful of bandwidth resources.  Hence recording the initial message(s) will address that issue.  The recording of the message is on the receiving user’s local device.  The purpose of that recording is to be replayed at a later date.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">However, it is also clear that Munje expressly contemplates the idea of recording more than the initial message or two.  It is true that the circular buffer memory idea (fig 5) as exemplified appears to hold perhaps two messages.  However, the “scrollwheel” or thumbwheel (fig 9) which Munje describes as a way of allowing the user to flip through the recorded messages and select the ones they want to reply to is an indication that more than one or two messages being stored is expressly contemplated by the text itself.  More importantly, the skilled team reading Munje would see at para [0074] a proposal to record both the outgoing and incoming PTT messages.  The stated purpose of doing so is because this provides in the memory “a more complete history of PTT voice communications”.  The outgoing message is stored simultaneously with transmission. </p>

One way of reading Munje is that it teaches storage in RAM because the replay contemplated is in a timeframe associated with the initial message.  Moreover, the circular buffer is something which, without more, would automatically wipe earlier messages when a new one came in.  I would hold that these two factors mean it is not within what the Voxer patent means by persistently.  The use of a circular buffer means that a stored message is liable to be lost to the system without warning and using RAM means that what had been stored would be lost when the power was removed.

I accept Dr Kindberg’s evidence that the way the PoC protocol works is by using a client-server model as follows.  Consider a client device A in which the user wants to send a message to two recipients B1 and B2.  The client device first establishes a connection with a “participating” server SA and passes the message to it.  That server SA then passes the message on to a controlling server X, which would then pass two copies of the message forward to a further relevant participating server(s) SB (one for recipient B1 and one for recipient B2).  Servers SB pass on the messages to the clients, if the clients are online.  This shows that the message is transmitted from client A without needing to first establish a connection with client devices B1, B2 etc.  I accept all this.

To the extent anything is asynchronous or in real time, or involves dividing a session or conversation into pieces, it is simply a function of a conventional PTT system.  In terms of motivation, the team would be motivated to build what they would regard as a modern (for 2007) PTT system.  It is a technically obvious thing to do, including with video.

As far as I can tell, if the skilled team did incorporate video conferencing into an instant messaging system using the Atarius archive approach it would exhibit many of the features relied on by Voxer as a basis for the infringement claim.  That is because a message can be a whole video stream.  The media would be transmitted progressively (and encoded and stored progressively).  The messages would be asynchronous because they can be time shifted.  It would be obvious to store on the local devices (both incoming and outgoing) for later retrieval and also to store on the network at the single server necessary.  It would have a live mode and a time-shifted mode.  As an instant messaging system, it would be set up to transmit even though no connection was made at the receiving device, although I am not sure how that would work with video conferencing was explained.  However, it is not necessary to examine this further since I was not persuaded the video conference aspect was obvious.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The issue about demarcating messages in video has more substance.  The starting point is to consider a conversation between two people by voice alone over a telecommunications system.  To the individuals it may appear as a continuous exchange, however the evidence of the experts was clear that the skilled team would know, as a matter of common general knowledge, that there were various ways of dividing up the audio into discrete messages from the point of view of the telecommunications system.  For example, in PTT the messages can be defined by a user’s command, e.g. holding down a button as the user speaks.  Another approach, not limited to PTT, would be for the system to detect silences greater than a prescribed threshold, for example between spoken words or phrases or by another participant starting to speak. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">However demarcating video into discrete messages is a different problem.  After all video is effectively continuous.  In cross-examination Mr Unitt agreed with Dr Kindberg that apart from a technique like PTT with a start and stop button which applied to the video to demarcate the message boundaries, it is difficult to see how the system could automatically demarcate messages within a live stream of video.  There will be specific examples in which the video stream has a natural break – such as halftime in a football match.  However in the general case, the only way the skilled team would be able to put the invention into practice for a video stream is by providing a user interface (such as a button) so that the user marks the beginning and end of the “message”. </p>

In other words it would not be open to Voxer to rely on any difficulties in demarcating video streams aside from a user’s command, when taking obvious steps over Munje or Atarius.  I have approached the case that way and in that sense the squeeze has done its job.  This point also explains why Voxer’s infringement case treats the entire video streams as single messages.  </p>

In my judgment, the term “asynchronous messages” in claim 1, to the extent it is a range at all, is not a range relevant in the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Regeneron</span> sense and so even if this point was open to Facebook, I would reject it.   </p>

I was not persuaded there was any relevant technical difficulty for the skilled team implementing video telecommunications systems whether over the prior art or in putting the patent into practice.  That applies whether the team is taking forward PTT, broadcasting, instant messaging or video and voice conversations.  There might have been some problem with persuading standard setters to modify standards but (a) I was not convinced and (b) that kind of difficulty is not relevant in this case.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I think Facebook may have been seeking to make a different point based on one of the issues in the infringement debate that the “was live” stream of a broadcast was different in some ways from the live stream.  So I think it may be being said that even if, when the live broadcast is still going, a user watching the “was live” stream can fast forward up to the live head of the live stream, that is not within the claim because the two streams are different.  I have rejected that already, but whether that rejection is right or wrong there is no insufficiency revealed.  </p>
