	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.43in;text-indent:0.5in">This is a patent action about DNA sequencing technology.  The patentee (Illumina) holds patents which derive from work by Solexa, a spin out company from Cambridge University which Illumina bought in 2007.  The defendants (MGI) are all companies in the Beijing Genomics Institute group.  MGI seeks to sell DNA sequencing systems in the UK.  Illumina contends that these systems infringe various of its patents.  In general, MGI denies infringement of any valid claim and contends the patents are invalid.  Following a launch last year, MGI gave undertakings limiting UK sales until this trial.   </p>

One system is called StandardMPS and the other is called CoolMPS.  Both use the azidomethyl group on the deoxyribose as a reversible chain terminator.  In StandardMPS the four nucleobases carry a different fluorescent dye molecule covalently linked to the base via a linker.  In CoolMPS the nucleobase is not covalently linked to a dye, rather detection uses four different antibody molecules, each linked to a different dye and each of which binds to a different nucleobase and the azidomethyl group.  There are various detailed infringement issues, including allegations based on the doctrine of equivalents.   </p>

In the two colour variant instead of four different dyes linked to the four nucleotides as in Standard MPS, only two dyes are used and detection occurs in two colours.  Just as two binary bits can encode four numbers, so two dyes can distinguish four nucleotides by putting one dye on one nucleotide, the other dye on another nucleotide, both dyes on a third nucleotide, and no dye on the fourth nucleotide. </p>

Prof Leadlay was the director of a major DNA sequencing laboratory at all material times.  The fact he was not doing the day to day work himself does not disqualify him from speaking about it.  As Prof Leadlay readily accepted, he was not trying to devise new sequencing machines.  That does not disqualify him from giving evidence.  Prof Leadlay’s experience and knowledge amply qualified him to assist the court on the issues relevant to the modified nucleotide patents.  The fact the professor had not read the papers such as Metzker and Canard which MGI wanted to say were common general knowledge did not demonstrate he was not in the relevant field.  For one thing that assumes the truth of a heavily disputed proposition MGI seeks to prove.  It may amount to nothing more than a consequence of the fact he was not trying to develop new methods himself at the relevant date.  It may serve as evidence contrary to MGI’s case.  In any case the submission is another instance of the frequent fallacy in patent cases that the only experts qualified to comment have to have been working on the very problem the patent sets out to solve at the relevant time.  That is wrong.  The expert’s particular area of interest and work may well be a factor to take into account, depending on the circumstances, but it rarely justifies a submission of the kind advanced by MGI here.  </p>

I do not accept this characterisation of the witness at all.  A particularly unfair submission is a criticism about evidence the professor gave in crossexamination about a conference in 1994.  Never mind the fact that given a 2002 priority date nothing useful was likely to be gained from considering who may or may not have attended a single conference in 1994.  The criticism is that Prof Leadlay “changed his tune” about who would have attended the conference when it was pointed out to him that the Metzker and Canard groups had presented at the conference.  However Prof Leadlay did no such thing.  I remember the oral evidence on this but I have taken the trouble to carefully re-read the whole of the relevant transcript.  The professor’s evidence was consistent throughout.  The fact he or his laboratory manager John Lester might have gone to it (but did not) is not inconsistent with his view that the skilled person, as the professor defined that person, would not have.   </p>

I will deal with the technical issues in context, but as a criticism of the witness this is also hopeless.  The answers the professor gave to the question about 1994 were cogent and not inconsistent with his views about the patent(s) in suit.  </p>

An issue relevant to obviousness was about the perceptions of the skilled person of the utility of Staudinger chemistry for reducing azides.  Counsel put to Prof Winssinger that Staudinger was thought to be slow at the relevant temperatures and Prof Winssinger said he strongly disagreed.  Counsel then put to the professor a scientific paper of his published in 2003 (Debaene and Winssinger) which involved the use of azides in the synthesis of peptide nucleic acids to mask the N terminus and used Staudinger chemistry for deprotection.  The questions made the simple point that on the face of the paper, it seemed that in 2003 Prof Winssinger had regarded the Staudinger reduction as attractive due to its mildness, but as having impractically long reaction times.  The professor did not accept that that was the right way to understand the paper.  I am not concerned about whether the professor’s explanation of the context of the work in the paper in fact shows that the issue about timing it mentions is relevant in the present case or not.  What troubled me was the blithe way Professor Winssinger treated something he had previously written (or at least was in his name).  Chasing through the chemistry led to tests carried out on two azaylide compounds 10 and 11.  They were part of the testing </p>

The paper records (p4447 lower LH side) that he and his co-worker were “pleased to observe that compound 10 was completely consumed after 1 hr” but then stated that “it was interesting to note” that compound 11 (tributyl azaylide) “did not react under these conditions”.  In other words, on the face of it, the fix was not so simple.  One of the two compounds worked but “interestingly” (in his own words at the time) the other did not.  In his answer (at T9/1044 lines 11-25) the professor did not face up to what had been written but instead sought to suggest it was not interesting at all but rather was just the result of the well established, text book, rules of organic chemistry.  This was not the first argumentative answer from the professor but is the clearest example and shows a lack of objectivity on his part.  He was arguing the case.  He was not there seeking to give candid and objective evidence. To reject the entirety of his evidence would be a disproportionate response but I am doubtful I can place much weight on opinions expressed by Prof Winssinger which are not backed up by other evidence such as contemporaneous documents. </p>

This is a legitimate submission and can be very telling in a specific instance.  However in the end both sides were able to make very much the same points, which were generic in nature.  For example while Illumina appears to have access to Prof Burgess who could give more direct evidence about the work published in Metzker (for example) since it came from his group but was not called, so it turned out MGI has access to Dr Metzker himself but did not call him either.  There was also a suggestion that Prof Church, some of whose papers were in the case, could have been called to say more by MGI or could have been asked about more by Illumina.  It is relevant to bear in mind that the court always controls expert evidence and the Patents Court in particular is astute to restrict overlapping expert evidence and to encourage cross-examination which is focussed only on the major issues.  This general approach to case management means that one cannot assume a party always felt free to call further experts or to ask further questions.  In the end I have decided to decide this case as best I can based on the evidence that is here, of which there is a lot, rather than speculating about why there is not even more evidence.  </p>

They are Maxam-Gilbert sequencing and Sanger sequencing.  MaxamGilbert sequencing is based on cutting the DNA strands using reagents which break the sequence at known places and analysing the results to deduce the original sequence.  The Sanger sequencing technique is different and supplanted MaxamGilbert sequencing.  Automated machines running Sanger sequencing were used in the human genome project in the 1990s.  Sanger sequencing is described in the Primer.  Starting from the double stranded DNA of interest, a single strand is taken and used as a template in the method.  DNA polymerase is used to add complementary nucleotide bases to the single template strand, one at a time.  The complementarity of DNA means that the particular nucleotide base added at a given stage by the polymerase enzyme will be determined by the template sequence.  So if the relevant nucleotide in the template is G then a C will be added to the growing complementary strand (G and C pair with one another).  The trick to Sanger sequencing is that the free nucleotides to be added are not in their natural form.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.43in;text-indent:0.5in">Natural nucleotides have the capacity to form chains by joining together.  Each nucleotide has a chemical group at the 5' position and another at the 3' position.  The chemical group at the 3' position is a hydroxyl (OH) group and the group at the 5' position is a triphosphate ester.  The two ends connect together to form a link in the chain called a phosphodiester bond, liberating a molecule called pyrophosphate.  A single strand of DNA therefore consists of a chain of these nucleotides and will have a “3' end” at one end of the chain and a “5' end” at the other end of the chain. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.43in;text-indent:0.5in">The way natural DNA synthesis works is that when a new nucleotide is added to the complementary strand, its 5' end is linked to the 3' end of the existing nucleotide which was already present.  Once incorporated the unused 3' end of that newly linked nucleotide is ready to connect to the next fresh nucleotide, and so the complementary chain will grow. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.43in;text-indent:0.5in">In Sanger sequencing the new nucleotides are not natural because their 3' ends lack the 3' hydroxyl group.  In the relevant naming convention it is called a dideoxynucleotide triphosphate (ddNTP).  The reason for that name is that one starts conceptually at RNA.  That consists of nucleotides called ribonucleotides (because they consist of a nucleobase and a ribose sugar moiety). It is <span style="text-decoration:underline">R</span>ibo-<span style="text-decoration:underline">N</span>ucleic-<span style="text-decoration:underline">A</span>cid.  Then one has DNA, which is <span style="text-decoration:underline">D</span>eoxy-ribo-<span style="text-decoration:underline">N</span>ucleic-<span style="text-decoration:underline">A</span>cid because each sugar lacks one of the oxygens (at the 2' position) found in ribose.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.43in;text-indent:0.5in">So in Sanger sequencing when a ddNTP is added, the chain cannot grow any further.  Since there are four nucleotides (C, G, A and T) one can make four mixtures whereby each mixture has all four of C, G, A and T nucleotides in it but in each mixture, some examples of one kind of nucleotide are in the blocked ddNTP form instead of the natural dNTP form.  Therefore when the DNA polymerase incorporates a ddNTP into the newly synthesised DNA strand, synthesis of the strand ceases (i.e. chain termination occurs). The Sanger sequencing process therefore results in the synthesis of a large number of copies of the template strand, which are terminated at random lengths according to the position at which a ddNTP is incorporated. A population of DNA strands of different lengths is therefore obtained, which end either with A, T, G, or C.  These DNA strands of different lengths are then resolved using manual or automatic approaches and the DNA sequence can be understood.  In a manual version of the process radiolabelled ddNTPs are used and the resulting radiolabelled copies of the template strand are size separated by gel electrophoresis.  The DNA sequence of the template strand is determined from the order of the bands in the gel, as shown below:  </p>

However well before the 2002 priority date some in the art had the idea of trying to do a kind of Sanger technique but with a chain terminator which was reversible.  If the blockage could be reversed after the identity of the added nucleotide had been confirmed, then the next nucleotide in the chain could then be added and the process repeated.   </p>

The fact the solution was obvious once you identify the problem does not prove a lack of inventive step in such a case.  In fact experience shows that real cases are often more nuanced in that there can be aspects of a problem which are not common general knowledge and so one cannot always draw a sharp line between problem invention cases and other cases.  </p>

Common general knowledge is not a phrase used in the Patents Act or the European Patent Convention. It would be difficult to define the person skilled in the art in this case, or the common general knowledge, because so far as I know there is no recognised profession or calling of designing folding attic stairways. At the date of the patent nobody seems to have done it in the British Isles except the Claimant and perhaps one other company. There must have been one or more companies in America, I suppose. It is unfair to define an art too narrowly, or else you could imagine absurd cases e.g. “the art of designing two-hole blue Venezuelan razor blades”, to paraphrase the late Mr T.A. Blanco White. Then you could attribute the “common general knowledge” to that small band of persons who made those products and say that their knowledge was “common general knowledge” in “the art”. That would have the impermissible result that any prior user no matter how obscure could be deemed to be common general knowledge, which is certainly not the law.  </p>

Related to this, in his fifth report, the professor sought to clarify something he had said earlier on this topic which Illumina contended was in fact a shift, related to the same point.  It is necessary for experts to explain who they think the skilled person is, not least in order to explain the basis on which they are giving their evidence.  However while the expert and other evidence is critical to resolving a dispute about the identity of the skilled person, in the end the identity of that person is a matter for the court, applying the law to the facts to reach a conclusion. </p>

Illumina’s formulation was not very different.  It was the identification of a successful reversible blocking group for the 3' position for use in sequencing by synthesis.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.43in;text-indent:0.5in">Pyrosequencing works because the pyrophosphate released as a nucleotide is incorporated into a complementary strand can be detected by generation of light.  The technique uses natural dNTPs.  The way it works is that the growing strand is exposed to a single type of dNTP at a time – C, G, A or T.  You will know which of those has been added to the strand because when that happens the pyrophosphate is released and that can be detected by generation of light.  Once the pyrophosphate is detected, a solution of a different dNTP is added and the process repeated.  A drawback is that as described one cannot tell the difference between adding a single nucleotide and adding two or more of the same nucleotide.  In other words it is vulnerable to repeats.  In fact there is a way of addressing that by measuring the intensity of the light flash generated following pyrophosphate release but that is not relevant.  </p>

For example there is no evidence of job advertisements seeking “sequencing by synthesis” engineers nor are there textbooks or conferences specifically direct to the topic.  (The conference in 1994 put to Prof Leadlay was not one.)  However it is clear and I find that a wide range of independent scientific groups, both academic and in industry were interested in and looking directly at this area.  This state of affairs had existed for some years.  The fact that sequencing by synthesis using reversible chain terminators had not succeeded by the priority date is highly relevant but not determinative.  By 2002 there was live interest from a number of people, and real research was underway at independent centres.  Papers were being published by groups of workers, referring to the work of others.  As a discipline in its own right, distinct from Sanger sequencing, sequencing by synthesis was at a nascent research stage, with pyrosequencing the most advanced technique.   </p>

I accept his summary, from which much of what follows is based.  The authors prepared eight dNTPs with seven different types of 3' modification.  Each modification put a different protecting group on the 3' oxygen.  One group tested was a methyl and that was used for two bases (hence eight dNTPs with seven modifications).  They conducted a series of experiments they called termination assays.  These were an attempt at one cycle of stop start DNA synthesis using a DNA template.  The eight dNTPs were tested with eight different DNA polymerases.  The results are tabulated in table 2.  Of the seven types of 3' modification tested, only three of them (3'-O-methyl, 3'-O-allyl, and 3'-O-(2-nitrobenzyl)) showed termination activity. The other types of 3' modification tested in the termination assay either showed no termination activity or caused inhibition of the polymerase.   </p>

One in the Journal of European Chemistry refers to combinatorial DNA sequencing.  It reports tests using photolabile 2-nitrobenzyl 3' blocking groups and concludes (in the abstract) that both nucleoside triphosphates and the DNA polymerase enzyme must be modified if the proposed technique is to be viable.   The other, in the journal Nucleotides and Nucleosides, notes that several groups have been interested in the technique this group calls BASS.  The paper reports tests with two photolabile 2nitrobenzyl 3' blocking groups but they do not achieve incorporation.  Further experiments are in progress.   </p>

It is a paper in Nucleic Acids Research by Professor Church and Dr Mitra which proposed a new technique using numerous PCR colonies or “polonies”.  This included the suggestion of using a high throughput sequencing method such as pyrosequencing but also described a new sequencing by synthesis idea called FISSEQ (fluorescent in situ sequencing extension quantitation).  This technique would employ fluorescently labelled nucleotides.  They would not be blocked.  As in pyrosequencing, a buffer with one type of nucleotide would be added at a time to a system with the DNA template strand and polymerase.  Therefore when the buffer added contained the type of nucleotide which was added to the growing strand, incorporation would be detectable by fluorescence and the cycle repeated.  Like pyrosequencing this is vulnerable to repeats but also like pyrosequencing, as Prof Church himself explained, intensity could be used to try to count the number of nucleotides incorporated.  </p>

MGI’s characterisation of the “problem to be solved” was the identification of a reversible chain terminator which could meet the requirements for use in sequencing by synthesis.  A critical question is whether that problem or something like it was part of the common general knowledge of the skilled person.  The reason this is critical is that the evidence of Prof Marx that the invention was obvious was based on an approach made clear in his evidence and cross-examination.  His approach was that the skilled person looks at Zavgorodny with the specific aim in mind of finding a blocking group he might be able to use in a reversible chain terminator sequencing process.  Moreover the questions put to Prof Leadlay were on essentially the same premise (that the skilled person came to the cited art interested in taking forward sequencing by synthesis with a new reversible chain terminator). </p>

One group (Amersham) was interested in making modifications at the 4' position.  The other group was Genovoxx.  Their approach, based on their patent application, was to avoid pursuing a 3' modification and instead put a sterically demanding group on the base to prevent incorporation.  Prof Marx accepted that this approach of Genovoxx was a fair reflection of the attitude of those in the art at the time.  I infer that Genovoxx were well aware of the earlier proposals to use reversible chain terminators at the 3' position, and did not lack ideas for alternative groups at that location, but took an entirely different approach.   </p>

By 2002 azides had come to some prominence in biochemistry in general as a result of the work of Prof Carolyn Bertozzi in California.  The Bertozzi group had used methods referred to as Staudinger chemistry, exploiting a selective chemical reaction between an azide and a phosphine, to produce a stable covalent linkage to join two biological moieties.  They specially engineered a phosphine which, on reducing the azide by the Staudinger reaction, trapped the resulting amine in an amide bond thereby linking the two moieties.  They demonstrated that this so-called 'Staudinger ligation' could be performed on the surface of cells (Bertozzi 2000) and on intracellular proteins (Bertozzi 2002).  </p>

The idea of incorporating the detectable label into the blocking group instead is also mentioned (paragraph [0023]).  Further details of suitable labels and linkers are given in a passage from paragraph [0063] to [0090].  The preferred detectable labels are fluorophores, which can be detected by fluorescence.  The linker may be a ‘cleavable linker’ which is described at paragraph [0068] as being one which ensures that the label can, if required, be removed after detection, avoiding any interfering signal with any labelled nucleotide incorporated subsequently.  At paragraph [0077] the specification explains that a ‘cleavable linker’ does not require the whole linker to be removed.  Part of it can remain attached to the base.  Examples of suitable linkers and their method of cleavage are given. </p>

Prof Marx did not accept that because of the quality of the data as summarised above.  He was prepared to accept that the third cycle of incorporation of the T nucleotide was a step which had not been shown before but he would not accept it was an important or significant development.  This was the least persuasive part of Prof Marx’s testimony and on this topic I preferred the evidence of Prof Leadlay.  Prof Leadlay’s view was as follows.  The data shows that modified nucleotides with a 3' azidomethyl blocking group may be used for controlled, one at a time, incorporation of nucleotides into a polynucleotide.  The 3' azidomethyl modified nucleotides were incorporated by the polymerase, resulting in chain termination.  The blocking group and fluorescent label are capable of being removed using a water-soluble phosphine to regenerate the 3' hydroxyl, allowing further rounds of incorporation of 3' blocked nucleotides in a stepwise manner.  I accept this evidence. </p>

The worst one was for compound 24 (G) but it was not so bad that the skilled person would think it would not work.

There is an issue about the scope of this claim – does it cover a system in which some of the nucleotides are modified (as required by claims 2 to 5) and some are not?  This is best dealt with along with infringement. </p>

In the context of this case the third sentence is significant.  It draws attention to the azidomethyl group, saying it is of special interest and can be removed under very specific and mild conditions.  However it is important to appreciate that the reference to “special interest” is not an assertion about sequencing by synthesis reactions.  Zavgorodny is not suggesting that this group is of “special interest” in that context.  The skilled person would understand that what Zavgorodny is talking about is in the context of its use as a synthon, a chemical intermediate.  Protecting groups are a routine tool in synthetic chemistry.  It would be an exercise of hindsight to read that as a disclosure concerned with sequencing by synthesis or reversible chain terminators.  Whether it is obvious to employ this group as a reversible chain terminator is a different issue.  At this stage I am concerned with that Zavgorodny actually discloses.   </p>

So, for example, “mild conditions” is not a reference to their being mild relative to the stability of DNA.  Whether the conditions happen to be mild vis a vis DNA is a different question.

Claim 1 claims a nucleotide (i.e. with the 5' phosphates) with an azidomethyl group at the 3' oxygen whereas Zavgorodny 1991 discloses a nucleoside with such a group at the 3' oxygen.  However in order to render claim 1 invalid the skilled person has to make the claimed molecule and for that to happen the skilled person has to have a reason to do so.  As a result the inventive step(s) of all the relevant claims of the modified nucleotide patents stand or fall together.  If performing sequencing by synthesis using a nucleotide with an azidomethyl blocked 3' oxygen as a reversible chain terminator is obvious over Zavgorodny 1991, then claim 1 also lacks inventive step because it would be obvious to make the relevant compound.  If that exercise was not obvious then none of the claims, including claim 1 of 578, are obvious for the converse reason.  Another way of approaching the same question would be to ask whether it was obvious to the skilled person given Zavgorodny 1991, with a reasonable prospect of success, to try out a sequencing by synthesis test using a nucleotide with an azidomethyl blocked 3' oxygen as a reversible chain terminator.   </p>

They would see the reference to removal using mild and specific conditions and that Zavgorodny regarded the azidomethyl group as of special interest.  In my judgment the most likely thing such a skilled team would think having read Zavgorodny is that this paper on synthetic chemistry had nothing to do with their focus on sequencing by synthesis.  To the skilled person the concept of protecting groups in synthetic chemistry is commonplace.  At most Zavgorodny would be seen as something to add to the organic chemist team member’s general toolbox concerning chemical synthesis (see Prof Marx in cross-examination at T6/729).

That is why the “pyridine point” raised by Illumina is a bad point.  It is true that the skilled person would be unlikely to want to use the particular removal conditions referred to in Zavgorodny (triphenyl phosphine in aqueous pyridine).  That is because pyridine is known to denature DNA.

Therefore the selection of an azidomethyl blocked nucleotide for use in such methods is not justified by any useful technical property and so the claim is broader than that which is justified by the patentee’s contribution to the art.  MGI referred to the (unchallenged) evidence of Prof Marx that the skilled person would not think that nucleotides with 3’O-azidomethyl groups would be useful in either the PCR or phosphoramidite method.  MGI contended that in Prof Leadlay’s written evidence he had said that he saw no reason why the skilled person would seek to use the claimed nucleotides in such methods.  In response Illumina relied on evidence given by Prof Leadlay that there was utility in using nucleotides with 3’O-azidomethyl groups other than in a RCT sequencing by synthesis reaction.

The short answer to it is Prof Leadlay’s evidence about using an azidomethyl group in Sanger sequencing.  That would be a way of carrying out a sequencing reaction, using the method of claim 6, without having a detectable label linked to the base of the modified nucleotide.  The labelling could be at the 5' end of the strand instead.  I find it would work.  It is true that using an azidomethyl group in this way does not involve taking advantage of its reversibility, but that does not matter.  It does take advantage of its blocking facility.  The method would work and therefore this aspect of the claim has utility.  It is enabled by the patent.  The claim does not exceed the technical contribution.  On that finding <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Regeneron</span> (see below) is not relevant.

That is because the claim is to a method of controlling incorporation of a nucleotide in sequencing reaction.  Although it is a part of a sequencing reaction, the claim is not focussed on the detection step and therefore there is nothing untoward about the fact that the claim does not refer to linkers or detectable labels at all.  There is no assertion or promise that the claimed method will work in any situation defined by reference to the presence or absence of features which are not mentioned.  All that is required for success is that the nucleotide which is incorporated has a 3' Oazidomethyl blocking group and that the incorporation blocks the next nucleotide.  There is no suggestion that that does not work.  However since the argument was not put this way and since the point fails on the facts, it is not necessary to examine this any further.  </p>

MGI says that this claim is open ended in terms of the length of the nucleotide to be sequenced and submits that the data in the patent only present results for a limited number of cycles, as shown in figures 5 and 6.  Therefore, it is said, the monopoly claimed exceeds the technical contribution and the specification does not enable the skilled person to perform a sequencing method across the breadth of the claim without undue burden.  The same point is made about claim 7 of claim set A in its amended form (limited to a sequencing reaction).  The issue can be decided by reference to claim 12.

In fact all of MGI’s insufficiency arguments were pleaded as squeezes with obviousness.  The way MGI puts the read length argument as a squeeze is clearest in the opening skeleton (para 198).  The submission is that the modified nucleotide patents do not disclose anything to suggest to the skilled person that they could achieve read lengths longer than that they would expect could be achieved on the basis of Zavgorodny, even in respect of the exemplified embodiment, let alone across the scope of the claims.  The reason MGI put it as a squeeze is I think because it has not sought to call evidence directly to show how difficult it may or may not be, starting from the patent, to carrying out sequencing.  Rather it relies on Prof Marx’s evidence about the quality of the data in the patent itself.   </p>

The claim was to a transgenic mouse.  The utility of the transgenic mice was their ability to generate a diverse variety of chimeric antibodies.  By the time the case reached the Supreme Court, it was not in dispute that the relevant claim extended to a range of types of mice.  The different types were characterised by the number of different human antibody gene segments which had been inserted into the mouse, replacing murine gene segments.  For example there could be from 1 to 125 of one kind of gene segment (human heavy chain variable segments).  The claim claimed a range of types of mice.  The range encompassed mice with all 125 of those segments and also any number of segments including just a single segment on its own.  The relevance of having a high number of segments was that a larger repertoire of segments gives much greater diversity of antibodies.  The patent’s idea of replacing certain mouse antibody genes <span style="font-style:italic">in situ</span> was called the “Reverse Chimeric Locus”.  It solved a problem of immunological sickness in the mice which would otherwise have occurred and which had hampered the ability to generate antibody diversity.  </p>

The problem was that as a matter of fact the only thing a skilled person could make based on the patent’s disclosure and the state of knowledge at the relevant time was a mouse with a few segments.  This was a very small part of the range, and was the least beneficial part of the range denominated by the number of human variable segments incorporated (paragraph 58).  The skilled person at that date could not make a mouse with the whole of the human variable gene locus inserted in it.  That came later.  The transgenic mice which incorporated the whole locus did benefit from the Reverse Chimeric Locus idea and so in that sense it could be said that what the invention contributed had indeed led to the ability to make a mouse with the whole of the human variable gene locus inserted in it.  The Court of Appeal had held the claim was therefore sufficient.  However the Supreme Court held (Lady Black dissenting) that the claim was insufficient because it was not possible at the time to make the type of mice claimed which had more than a few human segments inserted. </p>

For relevant ranges the law as explained by Lord Briggs is that all types or embodiments across the scope of the claim, as that scope is denominated by that relevant range, must be enabled.

The functional definition was essentially that the product would be oxygen permeable.  The problem was that the patent did not enable the skilled person to predict whether a contact lens made with any particular silica hydrogel would satisfy the requirements of the claim without actually going to the trouble of conducting clinical testing.  Not surprisingly that was held to be unduly burdensome and insufficient.  In terms of legal principles, Jacob LJ expressly followed the EPO line of authority on undue burden and functional features, including para 2.2.1 of <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Unilever/Detergents</span> (T435/91), which was also cited by Lord Briggs in Regeneron at paragraph 37.

Quite the contrary.  This is made clear in paragraph 89.  There Jacob LJ is contemplating what would have happened if success had been easy to predict.  The consequence would have been that the claim was not insufficient.  On the facts of that case it would have been obvious but that is another matter.

However if the range is not a relevant range then no difficulty of that kind arises.  That is the point Lord Briggs is making at paragraph 42.  Separately and in either case, the standard being applied is one of no undue burden. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.43in;text-indent:0.5in">To take an example mentioned in argument in this case, say an inventor invented a new teapot which was inventive and useful because its spout was shaped in a new way so as not to drip.  The claim would be to a teapot with the spout shaped in that special way.  The claim might well not say anything about the material from which to make the teapot, because it is irrelevant to the invention.  Equally the claim might refer to “a tea pot made of any suitable material”.  There would be no difference between a claim which expressly said that or one which was silent.  Either way the claim can be said to encompass a range of teapots made of different materials.  Now the patent needs to enable the skilled person to make the product.  In the example I will assume the skilled person could choose, identify and test suitable materials at the priority date without an undue burden.  China would work and chocolate would not.  However the claim would be infringed later on even if a teapot was made using a new inventive form of Pyrex glass which had not been invented at the teapot patent’s priority date.  Furthermore in my judgment this fact, that the claim covers types of teapot which it does not enable, does not reveal some insufficiency.  The fact that the skilled person could not make such a teapot at the priority date of the teapot patent does not matter.  What does matter is that the descriptive feature of the claim, which is at least implicit in the claim, that the teapot has to be made of a suitable material, is not a relevant range in the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Regeneron</span> sense.  However note the potential for error here.  The material from which a teapot is made is plainly crucial to its function as a teapot.  There are materials which are not suitable to use for teapots.  That is not the kind of relevance which <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Regeneron</span> is referring to.  Relevance in the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Regeneron</span> sense is a much more particular concept which depends on examining all the circumstances, and depends not simply on the invention (that is to say the claim as drafted) but also on what I can only think of calling the essence or core of that invention (closely related to the technical contribution and/or the inventive concept).  Although the invention in this example is (by definition) a teapot since that is what is claimed (s125, 1977 Act), nevertheless the value, utility and purpose referred to by Lord Briggs in principle (vii) are concepts which in this example would be focussed on the shape of spout.  In fact I doubt this teapot example has much of a relevant range (of spout shapes) at all.  On the facts of <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Regeneron</span> itself the range of numbers of segments was clearly relevant to the essence of the invention since it was the means for getting high antibody diversity, whereas different kinds of mice was not.  In other words when applying this test one may need to examine the essence of the invention as well as the claim language itself. </p>

The claim does not expressly prohibit any such substitution.  Unsurprisingly Prof Leadlay agreed with Prof Marx that it was possible to make additional modifications to the nucleotides beyond the 3'–O–azidomethyl group that would prevent their being incorporated by the polymerase and so make them unsuitable for sequencing.

Prof Leadlay did not accept that the cleavage conditions described in the patent were necessarily so severe as to be incompatible with the sequencing method.

However beyond the simple fact of being suitable, their individual type does not significantly affect the value of the method to achieve the purpose for which it is being carried out.

Or similarly, that it is not open to hold (as I have) that the common general knowledge of the skilled person was that the technique of sequencing by synthesis using reversible chain terminators may well be something which could not be made to work, among other reasons because it was not reliably repeatable, because all that one needs to do to make the claimed invention work is sequence one nucleotide, and that was feasible based on Metzker.  Neither point is right.  There is a technical advance for the reasons already referred to.  Essentially, the azidomethyl blocking group does meet the stringent requirements referred to in the patent.  As for the common general knowledge, the state of the common general knowledge is a matter of fact unaffected by the scope of the claim.  The fact that armed with the patent the skilled person only has to sequence one nucleotide to satisfy claim 12 does not mean the common general knowledge changes.  Nor does it, in fact, alter the reasons why an azidomethyl blocking group was not obvious over Zavgorodny.  </p>

I am quite satisfied on the evidence I have heard that the skilled person armed with the patent, willing to make the invention work, would be able carry out repeatable sequencing by synthesis using a 3'–O– azidomethyl blocking group.  They would be able to run the sequencing process for substantially more cycles that the few shown in the gels in the patent.  It would require the optimisation work described by Prof Leadlay and I have accepted his evidence.  There would be tests to perform and a lot of work but none of it would represent an undue burden.  The professor was not asked where a limit might be and MGI did not set out to establish that.  MGI’s sole case on the evidence was based on Prof Marx’s criticisms of the quality of the data in the patent but as I have explained already, I do not accept them.

Claim 9 adds to the sequencing method claims of 289 (claim 6 of claim set B et al) a requirement to remove the blocking group using a water soluble phosphine.  Illumina seek to amend that claim to add the words “under neutral, aqueous conditions”.  MGI says this amendment adds matter.  The reason why is a bit of a paper chase.  It is true (as Illumina points out) that there is textual support for the amendment at p43 ln 10 of the application as filed (this happens to be the same text about removing the azidomethyl group which has been quoted above from the priority document P2).  The same passage also seems to have become para [0103] as granted in 289.  However MGI says that in the application as filed there was also a limiting definition of an aqueous solution.  It was at p5 ln 26-34.  The definition places a lower limit on the amount of water in the liquid of at least 20%.  This definition has not been carried forward into the granted patent.  Therefore, it is said by MGI, whereas in the application as filed “aqueous conditions” would be understood to be at least 20% water, as amended the claim will add matter because it uses the general phrase and could be understood to envisage aqueous conditions with less than 20% water.  </p>

No evidence has been drawn to my attention which is said to have a bearing on the issue.  I say this because I believe some evidence was required.  While the definition passage which MGI relies on is indeed not in the specification of 289 as granted, that passage is in the specification of 578 (at paragraph [0015]), which of course is also based on the same application as filed.  Its context (as it is in the application as filed) it is part of a section (from paragraph [0014] as granted of 578) which is addressing what is said to be a method of deprotection using a water soluble transition metal catalyst.  Perhaps that is not relevant to the claimed method (I do not know but there are notably fewer references to transition metal complexes in 289) but it would then explain why the passage was deleted (presumably without objection from the examiner) when the 289 specification was drawn up.  Furthermore if MGI’s objection to the claim amendment was a good one, then that removal from 289 of that passage discussing transition metal catalysts has had the consequence that the other passage which refers to aqueous conditions to deprotect the azidomethyl (now at [0103] of </p>

That would require evidence.  There is none.  Second it must be remembered that coverage is not the same as disclosure of information.  Even if the claim could be said to cover solutions with less than 20% water, I am not satisfied there is a disclosure of such a solution by the amendment.

That all very well (and is the right thing to do) but the court ought not be in doubt about what the consequence would have been if the amendment was not formally allowable.  Presumably there is somewhere an attack on validity to which this is an answer.  No amendment should be permitted without the patentee explaining with reasonable specificity what the purpose of the amendment is.

These antibodies have detectable labels.  There are four kinds of antibody/label conjugate in order to detect the four kinds nucleotide.  Thus the antibody which binds to a 3'-Oazidomethyl blocked nucleotide in which the base is A has a different label from the antibody which binds to the one with base C, etc.  Once the antibody binding step has been carried out, the excess antibodies are washed off and the detection step occurs.

In that conjugate structure the nucleotide is linked by the antibody to a label.  Therefore since the required thing in the claim has been incorporated, the claim is satisfied.

However I do not agree that that leads to the conclusion that the skilled reader would think that a characteristic about the nature of the chemical bonding had to be read into the term.  The skilled reader would understand the expression “linker” as a general one and one which is defined functionally.  It is anything which links.  No doubt, as the skilled reader would see from the patent, the examples the patentee could think of when the patent was written were indeed covalent but the reader can also see that the patentee has used the broadest language available to define that which links the label to the base.

Here the patent is indeed contemplating what it calls multi-component labels, and in those instances the detection of the label moiety occurs by non-covalent binding of a detector molecule to a label molecule.  One example given is using a streptavidin molecule to bind to a biotin label.  However there is nothing here to suggest that the mode of attachment of the biotin label moiety to the base is any different from any other teaching in the patent.

The fact that as granted what is now claim 3 (claim set A, which was claim 7 as granted) had a counterpart claim which referred to linking the detectable label through the blocking group (claim 8 as granted) makes no difference. </p>

MGI suggested that the skilled reader would take it that the patentee was aware of and contemplated antibody detection but did not claim it.  I do not agree that that is a fair way of putting it.  MGI here is relying on the same paragraph [0066] (of 289) which refers to biotin and antibody detection.  As MGI was at pains to point out when considering normal construction, this paragraph is not concerned with alternatives to the conventional kinds of linkers described elsewhere.  The non-covalent interactions here, between the streptavidin detector and biotin label or between the antibody detector and dinitrophenol label, are not examples of non-covalent linkers.  Therefore they would be within the claim even if it was limited to covalent linkers.   </p>

There is nothing in the specification which would lead the skilled to think that the reason for limiting the linkers to covalent linkers was anything to do with that sort of consideration.

MGI says it is obvious over the prior art Buechler.  Before going further it is convenient to deal now with two issues of principle arising from the relationship between Buechler and the common general knowledge.  One of the submissions is that the content of Buechler (see below) adds little or nothing to the common general knowledge.  Arising from that Illumina submitted it was relevant to consider the obviousness case over Buechler as amounting to an attack based on common general knowledge alone.  This was said to have two consequences.  First Illumina referred to the caution in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Apimed v Brightwake</span> [2012] EWCA Civ 5 at para 54, citing <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Abbott v</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Evysio</span> [2008] EWHC 800 (Pat), about hindsight combinations of common general knowledge unencumbered by detail which might point the other way.

Nor does Buechler include or leave out any detail driven by those sorts of hindsight considerations.</p>

If Buechler does not add significantly to the common general knowledge then evidence addressed to the rhetorical question – if it was obvious why was it not done before? – could be relevant.  Illumina contended that there was evidence that those working in the sequencing by synthesis field at the time, before the relevant date, and therefore without knowledge of the invention, were not concerned about photodamage.  Illumina based this submission on certain prior published scientific papers.  These papers had not been relied on by Prof Greenberg but counsel put them to Prof Johnsson in cross-examination.  When I deal with the common general knowledge, it will be convenient to address these papers at the same time.  They are not necessarily common general knowledge as such but they illuminate the common general knowledge thinking and motivations of the skilled person and so it makes sense to approach the matter in that way.  </p>

Shorter wavelength means higher energy and so, since blue light has a shorter wavelength than red light, it follows that blue light photons have higher energy.  Fluorescence occurs in the following way.  An incoming photon of light is absorbed by the fluorophore molecule.  The energy of the photon causes the excitation of an electron from its ground state.  The electron is now at a higher energy level.  The excited electron may then drop to a somewhat lower energy level by a process called internal conversion.  This does not involve the release of another photon.  Then the electron may drop back to its original ground state, releasing a new photon.  The release of this new photon is the flash of light called fluorescence.  The energy of the new photon is lower than and different from the energy of the original incident photon.  The corresponding difference in wavelength is called the Stokes shift.   </p>

The fact that a later paper showed that the group did not end up finding incomplete extension when they developed the method further does not matter.  This leads to another piece of speculation, one might ask whether the absence of an express reference to photodamage in the original paper was because there was in fact no risk in their conditions anyway or was it because there was a risk but they did not realise it?  Further, and not a major point, MGI are entitled to note that the original paper did recognise a potential problem, which was something which could have been caused by photodamage, although they did not spell that out and one is again left to speculate.   </p>

What matters is that the technique involves multiple rounds of illumination to cause fluorescence and includes a deliberate photobleaching of some of the fluorophores.

The authors added the oxygen scavenging system to protect the Cy3 dye which was subjected to repeated illumination.  The dye was required to fluoresce on its own or act as a donor in the FRET system, but as I say that detail does not matter.  Illumina are entitled to point out that the paper does not say in terms that a concern about photodamage was a reason for the oxygen scavenging system.  But as Prof Johnsson pointed out, the oxygen scavenger system would have the effect of reducing photodamage too.  Illumina submits that Prof Johnsson agreed it was difficult to infer that the authors were concerned about photodamage.  I do not accept that submission (based on one answer in a passage) fairly summarises the professor’s view as a whole.  Prof Johnsson knew that he was being asked to speculate about the authors motives.  His view was that photobleaching and photodamage go hand in hand, that there was a clear possibility of photodamage occurring and that the system the authors used would act to reduce both.

The paper was put by counsel to Prof Johnsson on the footing that the authors did not appear to have had any concerns about photodamage.  However the professor pointed out to the cross-examiner that they had done the scanning in conditions which scavenged radicals because they used buffers including ethanol.  His view was that ethanol was a common general knowledge radical scavenger, and known to reduce photobleaching rates for rhodamines.  Nevertheless, as the professor accepted, one again has to speculate about the authors motives.  Ethanol might have been used simply as a washing agent (based on a later paper from the Ju Group).  </p>

The inventors found that at around cycle 8 to 10 the sequencing cycles had to stop due to loss of signal.  However the inventors also found that if they moved to a different part of the array which had not previously been scanned with the light source used to trigger the fluorescence and detect the nucleotides, the signal was restored, indicating that the problem was being caused by photodamage to the nucleic acid templates.  Prof Greenberg’s view was that this was an elegantly designed experiment and one which would not have been obvious to the skilled person. </p>

Results of an experiment comparing the system using a buffer with ascorbate and one without are presented in figure 2.  The case with ascorbate is clearly better although there was a disagreement between the experts about how surprising the degree of difference was.  I am not persuaded by Prof Greenberg that the skilled person would draw that conclusion from the data presented in the patent.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.43in;text-indent:0.5in">It bears spelling out that the purpose of the buffer is to prevent photodamage to the DNA strand rather than photobleaching to the fluorophores.  Every time the fluorophores are illuminated (once per cycle) a fresh lot of reactive oxygen species will be generated which can then go on to react with other molecules.   However at every cycle of this process the old fluorophores are washed away and fresh fluorophores are added in the form of fresh labelled nucleotides.  Therefore an individual fluorophore molecule does not experience more than one cycle of illumination.  However the DNA strand remains in place all the time and so, as the complementary strand grows and the cycles repeat, the DNA will have been present for an increasing number of illumination events, each generating some reactive oxygen species.  Note that this explanation follows from what is in the patent, it does not mean that the skilled person, without hindsight, would necessarily see this or think it through in this way.  A common slip in patent cases is to equate the fact that the invention can be explained after the event with obviousness.  They are not the same. </p>

The method of claim 1 has essentially the same two steps as the first two steps of claim 12, i.e. incorporation of a labelled nucleotide first and determination of the identity of the incorporated nucleotide second.  However there is an important difference between the specification of the 412 patent as compared to the modified nucleotide patents in the way incorporation is defined.  Unlike the wide definition in the modified nucleotide patents (“becoming part of” a strand), paragraph [0033] of the 412 patent provides a different and narrower definition: “the term ‘incorporation’ of a nucleotide into a nucleic acid strand or polynucleotide refers to the joining of the nucleotide to the free 3’ hydroxyl group of the nucleic acid strand via formation of a phosphodiester linkage with the 5’ phosphate group of the nucleotide.”  </p>

One was the same kind of point made for the modified nucleotide patents, namely that the examples in the specification are all cases in which the nucleotide acted on by the polymerase has the label already linked to it.  In the case on the modified nucleotide patents this did not help.  If it were not for the narrow express definition in the 412 patent it would not help here either, but along side that definition it is supportive.  </p>

Prof Greenberg’s view was that how the labelling was achieved was immaterial to the second (detection) step (which he called imaging).  MGI contended (closing para 189) that the skilled person would understand that there were technical reasons why labelling with the fluorophore after incorporation may affect photodamage.   </p>

This evidence does not support MGI’s case on normal construction.  In my judgment Prof Greenberg’s evidence referred to above represents the thinking of the skilled person reading the patent.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.43in;text-indent:0.5in">MGI made the same point here which it did for the modified nucleotide patents, that if the idea underlying Cool MPS (using antibody labelling) had been suggested then the skilled person would think it was difficult to raise antibodies.  I have preferred Prof Leadlay’s view to the contrary over Prof Johnsson’s view on that score.  In the 412 case MGI also referred to what was similar evidence from Prof Marx, that to make it work would require significant research.  The fact that MGI called similar evidence from two experts does not improve it.  I do not doubt that the work would be significant but I still prefer Prof Leadlay’s evidence.  In my judgment the team would be confident it could be done.  Therefore this line of thinking does not assist MGI on the third <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Actavis</span> question. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.43in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally MGI repeated the point that the antibody method “could affect” the extent of photodamage.  As explained already, this evidence (in an annex to Johnsson 3) is in fact that the method potentially could reduce photodamage.  That is not a reason which supports MGI’s case on equivalents at all.  I remind myself that this issue arises because MGI’s Cool MPS antibody method contains ascorbate in the buffer.  Using that additive, to reduce the risk of photodamage, is the essence of the invention of the 412 patent and claimed in claim 1. </p>

The reason why skilled person would think that strict compliance with the normal construction of “incorporation” was essential is because the specification has gone out of its way to define that term in a clear and simple way.  It is not necessary for the skilled person to speculate about why the patentee may have done that, the fact is that it has been done.  The Cool MPS system is in fact an immaterial variant to the invention claimed in claim 1, but the patent is deliberately drafted in such a way as to exclude it. </p>

It is concerned with the stabilisation of biological reagents conjugated to fluorescent molecules.  Buechler states that a problem had been encountered with the stability of these conjugates such that the fluorescent signal would decrease with time; and it was presumed that this was caused by uncoupling of the fluorescent molecule from the reagent but the mechanism was not known.  Buechler reports that “for the first time” the mechanism of this degradation has been identified.  It is photodamage to the conjugates caused by reactive oxygen species such as singlet oxygen and free radicals.  The solution is to use an “oxygen depleting system”.  One of the agents mentioned is ascorbate. </p>

Prof. Greenberg’s view was that it was difficult to draw firm conclusions from them because of flaws in the methodology, including the changing of multiple variables at once.  The major point is that experiments use various approaches, individually and together, to deplete oxygen.  They include argon purging, adding a glucose oxidase system and adding ascorbate.  It can be said that there is never a test with results presented which nails down ascorbate alone as an effective agent in those conditions.  That is true up to a point but in my judgment the skilled person would not seek to draw conclusions from that experimental data in that way.  The key thing is that the skilled person would see, from Buechler as a whole, that the authors had identified that the cause of the problem Buchler was concerned about was photodamage caused by reactive oxygen species which were produced by the fluorescent molecules responding to light.  The skilled person did not need Buechler to tell them that if that was the problem then one obvious approach to addressing it was to add ascorbate.   </p>

The one example which does not involve storage is example 10 but again here the test is between the assay conducted in the dark (dim green light) against the assay conducted under white room light and the illumination being examined was ambient room light. </p>

It is manifest that the conditions are quite different in terms of time and illumination intensity.  That is not how the skilled person would think.  What the skilled person would see in Buechler was a teaching that in the context of bioassays using fluorescent conjugates, there was photodamage to biological molecules in an <span style="font-style:italic">in vitro</span> context.  That included a risk of damage to nucleic acids.

This materially assists MGI’s case.  Since, as they were, the mitigation steps were very well known and have no serious drawbacks associated with them, this case is not about a problem where the solution requires any effort to find, is hard to do or comes with significant downsides.

The skilled person would know there was an appreciable risk of photodamage to the DNA given that it will be in the presence of fluorophores and repeated, relatively intense, illumination.  One way in which a skilled person could mitigate that risk to some extent would be to select a dye regarded as very bright and photostable but it was equally obvious to choose a moderately bright and photostable dye.  Either way it would be obvious to add ascorbate to the relevant buffers in a sequencing by synthesis reaction.  The skilled person would have no doubt that whatever conditions and materials were chosen, some reactive oxygen species would be generated.  Ascorbate is a well known antioxidant, known to mitigate the inevitable risk.   </p>

In my judgment this is an example in which the presence of four options does not make any one of them less obvious.  For the fluorescence chemist member of the skilled team, the obvious one to look at would be photodamage.  Moreover even without doing the experiment described in paragraph [00005] of the patent, which Prof Greenberg had characterised as elegant and non-obvious, the simple and obvious test for the skilled person, especially for a skilled person having read Buechler, would be to add ascorbate.

The added matter argument here is an intermediate generalisation point directed to something missing from claim 1 as granted (and dependent kit claim 15).  Claim 1 is set out above.  What is absent from it is essentially any reference to the character of the illumination needed to cause the label to fluoresce (such as being intense).  The allegation is that the application as filed (published as WO 2006/064199) only discloses the method of claim 1 together with the requirement that the detection step includes repeated or prolonged exposure to intense illumination.  MGI refer to p3 ln3-8 and ln12-18 of the specification in the application and also to claim 1 as filed (at p50 ln3-8).  As a matter of the words in the document, MGI is correct.  The argument then goes that the difference between the disclosure in the application and the claim as granted is not trivial because although in sequencing by synthesis one generally would use intense illumination, Prof Johnsson explained that that is not necessarily the case.  The precise intensity required will depend on the equipment used and the time of illumination and, he said, “I do not think that intense light would strictly be necessary”.  Thus argues MGI the application discloses the invention as applicable to a sub-set of sequencing by synthesis processes, namely those which include exposure to intense illumination, whereas the teaching of the granted patent is that the ascorbate containing buffer can be applied to all sequencing by synthesis processes.  This is said to be new information and added matter.    </p>

Common functional groups are carboxyl groups and amino groups.  They join together to form an amide bond.   When the target biomolecule had one of them it was well known to put the other on the dye to create the amide.  The ortho-carboxy group in rhodamines was used for this purpose.  One way of activating it was to use N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) to form a reactive group called an NHS ester which would react readily with an amine.  Commercial dyes would often be available in a variety of different activated or functionalised forms to allow for conjugation to different biomolecules.   </p>

There was a modest dispute about how long linkers would be as between Prof Johnson and Prof Greenberg.  I find that as a matter of common general knowledge, a linker of 3-6 carbons long was common but other lengths were also common general knowledge. </p>

Those properties include the absorbance and emission wavelengths, quantum yield and extinction coefficient, and more generally the brightness, photostability and tendency to quench.  In the end the evidence was clear.  The skilled person knew that the spectral properties of xanthene based dyes can be altered by changes or substitutions on the xanthene core.  That is because they affect the delocalised system in that core.  So a linker which affected the delocalised system in the xanthene core may affect the photochemical properties of the dye.  The skilled person also knew that changes made further away from that xanthene core were less likely to make any change to the spectral properties of the system while changes closer to the core were more likely to have an effect.   </p>

The characteristics of individual moieties within a chemical structure are influenced by their environment.  Molecules can be drawn out flat on a page but as the skilled person knows they are in fact three dimensional structures which can move.  Parts which look remote on the page can interact with more distant parts because the whole molecule can adopt a shape in which that is true.  Given a known fluorescent molecule and a new molecule derived from that known fluorescent molecule e.g. by adding a linker of some kind to it, and given the photochemical properties of both forms, the skilled person can rationalise whatever differences do or do not exist in the photochemical properties by reference to those structural changes.

Based on Prof Johnson’s evidence, I find that it would be obvious to use a secondary amine here to avoid spirolactam formation.  A linker 3-6 carbons long would be a sensible choice here, as Prof Greenberg accepted.  All options (3, 4, 5 and 6 carbons) are obvious.  It would be an obvious option to have a suitable functional group at the other end of this linker in order to link to the next thing.  So a carboxyl group would be used to link to an amine group.   </p>

The question is whether the claimed molecule makes a technical contribution over Milton.  The submission is that the specific rhodamine dye claimed in the 415 patent within the molecule of claim 1 does not provide any technical advance over Milton’s teaching to use rhodamines in general.  The dye in the claim has no beneficial properties over rhodamines in general.  It is an arbitrary dye.  These are MGI’s submissions.  </p>

It is an effective sequencing reagent.  The beneficial properties are that it can be used in a sequencing by synthesis scheme of the kind described (fluorescent detection, 20 cycles, 1% error rate etc.).  The dye fluoresces, the linker can be cleaved, and the nucleotide can be incorporated by the DNA polymerase.  Milton’s results did not demonstrate that all this would happen for any given choice of combined molecule.  For example, there were not 20 cycles in Milton, nor four nucleotides at once with different dyes, and the detection used radiolabelling not fluorescence.  Milton did not show that the Cy3 dye would fluoresce in the conditions required.  There is valuable technical information in the 415 patent which was not made available to the public by Milton.   </p>

This <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Agrevo</span> objection is not based on the proposition that it was obvious to come up with this particular molecule or obvious that it would have those properties.

His view was that the linker and fluorophore would not be considered as two elements in isolation and that due to the number and complexity of all the factors at play, it was (and still is) difficult to predict how, and the extent to which, these properties would be affected.

The dye fluoresces satisfactorily in the 415 patent because in fact the linker and nucleotide do not interact with it in an unfavourable way.  They could have but they do not.  The dye/linker combination, which is different from the one tested in Milton, does not in fact prevent incorporation of the nucleotide with the DNA polymerase.  It might have but it did not.  In this sense the circumstances are quite different from <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Sabaf</span>.  There was no suggestion there that combining the primary air flow from above with a flame spreader using the Venturi effect was even capable of having an unfavourable interaction.  The designer in that case would have regarded the two parts as entirely functionally distinct before putting them in one oven.   </p>

There is nothing inherent in either element to mean that it is incapable of interacting with the other element.  The dye part is not <span style="font-style:italic">a priori</span> immune from the effects of the linker or the nucleotide.  The skilled person would hope the molecule worked satisfactorily because the two elements did not interact but they would need that to be demonstrated by an experiment testing the combination as a whole.  That means that the collocation principle does not apply.   </p>
