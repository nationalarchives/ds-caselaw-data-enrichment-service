Karlsson was referred to in Stjernschantz and the attack over it was closely related to that over Stjernschantz.  It was a pragmatic decision by the Defendants to drop it in the light of the way the evidence had gone; it was reasonable to run it up until then. </p>

I found her extremely precise and clear in her answers and she was plainly doing her best to help the Court from a position of independence.  However, although I have said above that it was forgivable for the medicinal chemists to give evidence which veered into the usual territory of the pharmacologist, I felt that in Dr Redshaw’s case this was accompanied by not tackling the medicinal chemistry content of Stjernschantz at all fully.  There was no malice in this and it seems to have been a consequence of the way she was instructed, which also, in my view, was without malice and with the perfectly laudable aim of cutting down duplication.  Nonetheless, the effect was that I do not think Dr Redshaw approached Stjernschantz in the way that an open-minded medicinal chemist without knowledge of the invention would have done.  They would have read the whole thing and focused on all the medicinal chemistry content.  I will have to return to this theme below. </p>

Instead, what is important is the expert’s ability to see and explain things from the perspective of that notional person, and their reasons are particularly important.  In the present case, I found Dr Krauss (even allowing for the issues mentioned above) and Dr Cavalla better able to do this than Dr Wilson and Dr Redshaw, and their reasons more convincing.  One reason for this may be Dr Krauss’ real-world experience with prostaglandins, but I do not reach my conclusion merely because he had it and Dr Wilson did not, although that is one factor. </p>

Stated generally the law is clear that patents are directed to those likely to have a real and practical interest in the subject matter of the invention.  This language is based on paragraph 81 on the judgment of Henry Carr J in <span style="font-style:italic">Garmin v Philips</span> [2019] EWHC 107 (Ch) in which the judge summarised the law in this area.  The real practical interest in the subject matter includes devising the invention itself as well as putting it into practice and so, as was highlighted in <span style="font-style:italic">Schlumberger v EMGS</span> [2010] EWCA Civ 819, the concept of the person skilled in the art actually applies in two distinct circumstances.  In a proper case they may be two different persons (or teams).  One person skilled in the art is the person to whom the patent is addressed and whose attributes, skills and common general knowledge will be necessary to implement the patent.  As Illumina submitted that person is always going to be the appropriate skilled team from the point of view of addressing sufficiency, since the patentee is entitled to put together his invention by combining any skill-sets he likes.  As Pumfrey J said in <span style="font-style:italic">Horne Engineering v Reliance Water Controls</span> [2000] FSR 90 (quoted in <span style="font-style:italic">Schlumberger </span>at para 51): </p>

If the design and manufacture of folding attic stairs in particular was an established field then there is nothing unfair in defining the skilled person that way.  But if not then the wider definition (general carpenter plus metal fabricator) is appropriate.  In other words the width of the field in which the skilled person operates for the purposes of obviousness (aka the “art in which the problem lay” (per <span style="font-style:italic">Schlumberger</span>)) is ultimately governed by what was actually going on up to the priority date.

The avidity of a drug to bind to a receptor is termed affinity. The efficacy of a drug is a measure of a drug’s ability to induce a response – the greater the maximal response, the more efficacious the drug. A drug which mediates a full response when bound to a receptor is a full agonist, a drug which mediates a partial response is a partial agonist and a drug which binds to a receptor and elicits no response is an antagonist.  </p>

Potency is often expressed as an EC50 value, meaning the molar concentration of a drug to achieve 50% of that drug’s maximal effect. The lower the EC50 value, the more potent the drug. Compounds with a high potency for a particular biological target are often attractive candidates for drug development because they can be therapeutically active at low concentrations reducing the risk of side effects caused by interactions between that drug and the biological targets responsible for side effects. </p>

Prodrugs are used in several scenarios but usually to improve the bioavailability of the active drug. In this context, often a prodrug is created to mask a charged, or polar, group which could impair the uptake of the molecule into the body. The chemical structure of the drug is therefore modified to create a prodrug to allow for example, the prodrug to pass through certain barriers in the body, such as lipophilic membranes.  The concept of using prodrugs was well known in respect of topical drug delivery, including ocular drugs.  A common method of preparing prodrugs to increase permeability through membranes is to form an ester of the parent drug.   </p>

In other words, it was known to be very selective, and indeed more so than PGF<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span><span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Segoe UI Symbol'"></span>.  This profile made it highly relevant for classification, and so, for example, it is specifically mentioned in the TIPS supplement, and in Dr Coleman’s chapter in Hansch, <span style="font-style:italic">Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry</span> (1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Ed, 1990) it is described as “diagnostic in establishing whether FP receptors exist in any particular tissue”. </p>

Many synthetic prostaglandins have been observed to lower intraocular pressure, but such compounds also produce the aforementioned side effects. Various methods have been used in attempting to overcome the ocular side effects associated with prostaglandins. Stjernschantz et al. (EP 364 417 A1) have synthesized derivatives or analogues of naturally occurring prostaglandins in order to design out selectively the undesired side effects while maintaining the IOP-lowering effect. Others, including Ueno et al. (EP 330 511 A2) and Wheeler (EP 435 682 A2) have tried complexing prostaglandins with various cyclodextrins. </p>

I am not saying that they would look up all the references in the paper by any means (there are 61), but unless they acquainted themselves with the Coleman classification then I do not think they could follow Table III, which is plainly material teaching about latanoprost.  For these reasons, I think the dispute about whether the Coleman classification system was CGK is not very important, although it might be said that the skilled addressee would feel more at home with the teaching if they already knew to what reference was being made. </p>

Whereas the prodrug esters of PGF<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2alpha</span> do not significantly reduce the adverse effects in the eye, partial substitution of the omega chain with a phenyl ring dramatically reduces the ocular side effects of PGF<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2alpha</span>-ie. Such substitution totally eliminates the superficial irritating effect of PGF<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2alpha</span>ie in the eye. This is probably due to a conformational change of the omega chain in the prostaglandin molecule, or steric hindrance, which enables a discrimination between different prostaglandin receptor subtypes. The most optimal chain length to which the ring structure is attached seems to be 5 carbon atoms (17-phenyl-18,19,20-trinor). The biologic activity of these compounds may further be altered by substitutions in the phenyl ring. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.50in">Dr Redshaw considered Stjernschantz only rather briefly.  She picked up the analysis only at page 701, dealing with substituents on the phenyl ring.  Based on that, she suggested that the skilled team would look to compounds with high affinity and selectivity for FP receptors, and would not be guided by, or limited to, what the SAR work in Stjernschantz supported.  Indeed, she was quite critical of this part of Stjernschantz’s work, which seemed to me rather inconsistent with the Defendants’ overall case that Stjernschantz was a high quality publication, recognised as such. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.50in">I found her analysis very limited and not a good basis for the proposition that the skilled addressee would just switch to other, quite different compounds.  I did not think it properly reflected how a medicinal chemist would approach Stjernschantz; they would read the whole of it carefully and suggest specific, rational, structural changes based on the SAR work done. </p>

When that is done, I think the answers given were not really supportive of the Defendants’ case, and certainly not enough to undermine the evidence that Alcon’s experts had given in their written reports, which in general they continued to support and which I preferred over that of the Defendants’ experts. </p>

But the answers were also on the assumption, which he had not accepted, that the relevant side effects were entirely down to activity at FP receptors.  Even leaving that aside, his acceptance of what was put was limited. </p>
