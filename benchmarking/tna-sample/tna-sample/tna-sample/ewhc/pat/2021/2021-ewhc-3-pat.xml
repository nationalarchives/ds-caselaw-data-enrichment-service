	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">The Patent was filed on 17 May 2013 and has a priority date of 25 May 2012. It is entitled “Comfort layer for a collecting bag” but, as its claims make clear, it is limited to ostomy bags. An ostomy (or stoma) is an opening in a human body created surgically to allow the discharge of body waste (faeces or urine). An ostomy bag connects to the stoma to receive such waste. It includes a pouch made of a layer of impermeable material (the barrier film) with a flange which allows the bag to be connected to the stoma. The Patent concerns a further layer which can be added to such a bag and which is known as a comfort layer. As its name suggests, a comfort layer is intended to make wearing an ostomy bag more comfortable. I will say more about such bags later when dealing with the common general knowledge in this case. </p>

However, she was far more familiar with diapers, feminine hygiene and adult incontinence products (many of which she has designed) and often her evidence as regards the qualities (such as comfort) of a particular material was based on her familiarity with those products. As a result, in giving evidence with regard to ostomy bags and the ostomy bag market, she relied on information provided to her by Coloplast’s solicitors or derived from her own researches in 2019 and 2020 after being instructed as an expert in this case rather than on any personal involvement in the ostomy bag market as at the priority date of 25 May 2012.

In my judgment, this means that she was able to provide me with expert assistance with regard to certain matters that are central to this case, namely the nature and characteristics (particularly bonding characteristics) of those same materials when used in ostomy bags.

I have no hesitation in rejecting this criticism. The product involved was not in issue in the action and it had not been previously tested. Accordingly, when Ms Becke was asked during cross examination whether it would meet the peel strength requirement in claim 2 of the Patent (a strength of “above 5N/12.5mm width”), she used her hands as a means of testing that peel strength.

However, some colostomy bags (used where the user’s output was more liquid) were drainable as, typically, were ileostomy and urostomy bags. Drainable bags have a tap or a foldable opening at the bottom of the bag which allows the contents to be discharged and the bag to be re-used which, again depending on the user’s needs, was typically between four and six times a day.  </p>

Such covers were widely available, almost as clothing accessories, from a range of suppliers. By 2012, such removable covers were still in use but less extensively because by then it had become common for ostomy bags to have their own integrated comfort layers (i.e. a comfort layer bonded to the barrier film to form an integral part of the bag). The idea of an integrated comfort layer had been a key element of the Watkins patent (the application for which had been published as long ago as 17 June 1981). The concept, therefore, of adding a comfort layer to an ostomy bag (whether removable or integrated) was common general knowledge as at May 2012. </p>

However, in the course of cross-examination, Mr Campbell asked Ms Becke about a statement in a 1986 book called Stoma Care Nursing by Catherine Elcoat that “One or two appliances feature a woven backing to prevent sweating”. I can see that this statement may be referring to the existence of ostomy bags with woven integrated comfort layers, although it is hardly conclusive. However, neither expert appeared to be aware of the book and there was no evidence as to the book’s circulation or provenance and, as Mr van der Leden (Salts’ own expert) rightly said in his initial report, the fact that something is mentioned in a textbook or journal does not make it common general knowledge. In my judgment and particularly in view of the clear evidence of Mr van der Leden quoted above, the statement in the 1986 Elcoat book comes nowhere near to proving that the existence of ostomy bags with woven integrated comfort layers was common general knowledge at the May 2012 priority date.  </p>

Even if those particular publications were not common general knowledge as at May 2012, the fact that they provided for the use of a woven integrated comfort layer shows that that was a possibility in the minds of those designers of ostomy bags and, I assume, of their employers (being, in the case of Dircks, Hollister, a major ostomy bag manufacturer). If that possibility was in their minds at those dates, notwithstanding the lack of actual bags embodying that idea, then in my judgment it is probable that it would also have been in the mind of the skilled person (being someone also involved in the design of ostomy bags) as at May 2012. </p>

First, a woven material was typically “much more expensive” than a non-woven. Second, when using wovens, “you need much more plastic, which is not so very good for the environment”. Third, non-wovens are adaptable and can, as Ms Becke said, “be highly engineered and functionalised” to meet specific needs and uses (e.g. single or multiple use).

Mr van der Leden stated that wovens were typically much more expensive than non-wovens and Ms Becke accepted that they were at least twice the price. In closing, Mr Lykiardopoulos pointed out that this needs to be kept in perspective given that a bag would sell, typically, for £2-£4 and that the cost of the non-woven element was only some 2 pence per bag (i.e. around 0.5% - 1% of the sale price). In the absence of any evidence as to the manufacturers’ profit margins, it is difficult to know how serious an issue this would have been in the mind of the skilled person.

Ms Becke was less convinced by this. She commented that it depended on the weight of the woven used and that designers would, in any event, look to compensate by making other adjustments. She also considered that any environmental concerns would have been focused more on the PVDC in the barrier film than on the material used in the comfort layer. Nevertheless, as Mr van der Leden’s figures (and, indeed, the figures mentioned in the Patent) show, the weight of wovens when used for this purpose does appear to have been greater than the weight of non-wovens. Accordingly, I accept Mr van der Leden’s evidence that designers in 2012 would have believed that, typically, use of a woven fabric was likely to involve using more plastic than use of a non-woven and that this was undesirable for environmental reasons. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">There is, however, a dispute as to whether it was common general knowledge that polypropylene was being used for a comfort layer. Coloplast’s case (which, in cross examination, Mr van der Leden was inclined to accept) was that in 2010 it had decided to switch from polyester to polypropylene for some of its products. Moreover, Dircks (at [0016]) and Willis (at [0011] and [0023]), both expressly refer to polypropylene as a preferred material for the fabric comfort layer. Despite this, Mr van der Leden’s evidence was that as at May 2012 he was unaware of such use and he explained that Coloplast’s products using polypropylene may not have been widely available on the market at that date as its old stock made of polyester was still being sold off. </p>

However, most manufacturers tended to buy materials “off the shelf” and tended to be reluctant to change if it would mean changes to their existing production methods (which would typically involve what Ms Becke referred to as “experimentation”) and to their production machinery in which they may have invested significant sums. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In my judgment, the skilled person would have had the knowledge needed to manufacture an ostomy bag with an integrated comfort layer. He or she would have known that, typically, a bag was made of two layers of barrier film (which would form the collecting pouch) and an external comfort layer. As Mr van der Leden said in his first report, “Typically, these barrier film and comfort layers were attached together, and the pouch was formed, by welding all layers simultaneously around the periphery of the pouch”. This would, most often, be by heat or radio frequency (“RF”) welding although ultrasound could also be used. The use of peripheral welding was almost universal. Whilst Dircks and Willis had envisaged a different approach (one whereby the comfort layer was attached across the entire, or substantially the entire, surface of the barrier film as opposed to just the periphery), that method appears never to have been popular not least because it was uncomfortable for users as the surface of the comfort layer suffered from the problem of retained moisture. Mr van der Leden described bags that had been made in this way as “lousy”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">As at 2012, the weld area around the perimeter of a typical ostomy bag was typically film-like or glossy in appearance and somewhat rigid in feel. This was perceived to be something that users liked because it gave them reassurance that the weld was secure and, therefore, that the bag would not fail. However, the skilled person would have been well aware that the nature and appearance of the weld was dependent on the welding conditions being used and on how those conditions operated in relation to the particular materials being welded. For example, the skilled person would have known that if a pouch was welded at too low a temperature, the appearance of the material in the weld area would be less affected (and would be less film-like or glossy) but the weld might be weak and the layers at risk of separating. If, on the other hand, a higher temperature was used, it was more likely to alter the appearance of the material in the weld area (so as to become more film-like or glossy) and, if the heat was too great, to damage the barrier film. At either extreme, there was a risk that the bag would be unfit for purpose. However, between these two extremes, it was common ground that the skilled person could adjust the welding conditions or parameters and could vary the materials used depending on what he or she was trying to achieve, whilst still creating an ostomy bag with a secure weld. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">It is also common ground that if the chosen material was polyethylene or polypropylene then, as those materials have a relatively low melting point, the weld zone created in the welding conditions typically used in making ostomy bags would result in a weld with a glossy, film-like appearance and a somewhat rigid feel. This was because under those conditions, more of the fibres making up the comfort layer would melt and mix with material from the outer layers of the barrier film (which contained EVA) so that, on cooling, the resulting mixture did not have a fibrous appearance.  </p>

As a result, the surface of the polyester comfort layer would retain much of its structure and appearance and, therefore, be less glossy or rigid.  </p>

Rather, as I have already indicated, it was common general knowledge that the end result would depend on the material chosen (e.g. polyethylene, polypropylene or polyester as mentioned above), on the thickness or weight of such material and on how the skilled person decided to adjust the three key welding parameters of time, temperature and pressure. For example, Mr van der Leden was clear that in the case of polypropylene, “a hard welding zone was not necessarily formed, but it depended on the specific welding conditions … used, and which could be adjusted by the skilled person.” Equally, Ms Becke was adamant that where polyester was used, if the purpose was to reassure users that a weld was secure, then it was perfectly possible (presumably by adjusting the welding parameters) to achieve a hard, glossy welding zone.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Paragraph [0003] sets out the background and the difficulties that the invention is said to overcome. It starts by noting that, in the field of ostomy care, a comfort layer for a bag comprises a non-woven material typically made of polyethylene, polypropylene or polyester. It then asserts that, typically, such non-woven comfort layer was heat welded to the barrier film in a process that caused its fibre structure to melt and that “experience shows” that this resulted in a “relatively hard or non-flexible welding zone”. To the extent that this suggested that such a result was inevitable then, for the reasons set out above, it was incorrect as the experts agreed that the appearance of the weld zone would depend on the welding conditions and the materials used. Indeed, as Mr Campbell pointed out, the Dansac Novalife is an example of a polyester nonwoven comfort layer which did not have a relatively hard and non-flexible weld zone. Having said this, I do not think that anything really turns on this inaccuracy, particularly given that, whatever was theoretically possible, the Dansac Novalife bag was the only bag in evidence whose weld zone did not conform to the description in paragraph [0003]. Further, it appears from the statement of Vigdis Hannestad that the Dansac Novalife bag had a comfort layer which had been changed in November 2011, in which case, as Mr van der Leden accepted, “it might well be the case that the skilled person was not aware of it in 2012”. Mr Campbell suggested that Coloplast’s own pre-priority date bags with polyester non-woven comfort layers may have resembled the Dansac Novalife bag. However, in the absence of any evidence in relation to the construction or appearance of such bags, this was mere speculation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">According to paragraph [0003], the attachment between the non-woven comfort layers and the barrier film was relatively strong in terms of the strength required to peel the layers apart (“peel strength”) but, in some cases, the material would break instead of being peeled apart if submitted to such a test. The problem (paragraph [0003] explained) was that the strength of the fibres had been compromised or greatly reduced by being melted and this left </p>

In the worst case, it was said, “such a failure may result in the collecting bag being torn up and open and consequently leaking its contents.” I will return later to the issue of strength. However, as Mr Campbell points out, no evidence was adduced of actual failures occurring or that the skilled person at the time would have thought that such failures were a particular problem with existing bags.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Finally, paragraph [0003] noted that the welding process left the zone or area of the welding quite visible due to the mixing of materials in that area, “thus compromising the visual appearance of the bag”. Mr Campbell criticises this on the basis that visual appearance is not an issue given that the bag is worn under clothes. Again, I cannot see that much turns on this but, for what it is worth, I reject this criticism. I have no doubt that the aesthetic appearance of the bag was of real importance to many users. Indeed, Mr van der Leden gave evidence of this and went on to comment that “ladies who want to be a little bit fashionable” would want the comfort layer to match other items of clothing. As Ms Becke said, aesthetic appearance is important to user dignity. </p>

Indeed, it would seem that the only situations falling outside its scope would be the extremes where the attachment was either of only one fibre filament of the comfort layer or of 100% of those fibre filaments. The skilled person would know that the former situation could not realistically be called an “attachment” and would also know that it was unlikely that the latter situation would be achieved when making an ostomy bag, particularly in the case of a polyester comfort layer. Thus (aside from the reference to the use of a textile (woven) material), the vast majority of (and probably all) ostomy bags with integrated comfort layers at the priority date would have fallen within this claim. Mr Lykiardopoulos accepts the width of this claim and points out that it was the role of claims 2 to 4 to limit the scope </p>

I do not see that this makes claim 2 arbitrary. Claim 2 requires that the attachment made in accordance with claim 1 should be such as to give a peel strength of more than 5 N/12.5mm width and there was no evidence to suggest that this was not a valid technical requirement for an ostomy bag. It is not, for example, like a requirement that the bag be coloured green or blue.  </p>

In my judgment, that is not how the skilled person would read claims 3 and 4. Under claims 3 and 4, the surface of the comfort layer outside the weld zone is not being compared with the unembedded fibres in the weld zone. Rather it is being compared with the surface of the comfort layer in the weld zone. The skilled person is being told to ensure that there are sufficient unembedded fibres such that the overall surface of the comfort layer in the weld zone will have the same tactile/visual characteristics as in the rest of the comfort layer. If there was any doubt as to this, then the fact that claims 3 and 4 are a statement of the obvious when construed in the way suggested by Mr Campbell is a reason why the skilled person would conclude that that was not its intended meaning.  </p>

This is not a case where the idea was to use a material in an unanticipated or unexpected way. Rather, the idea was to use a material (a woven) that was well known to the skilled person and to use it in a way that was known to be possible, a way that had, in fact, been expressly anticipated by persons involved in the design of ostomy bags (as evidenced by the Watkins, Dircks and Willis prior art). This suggests that the idea was not inventive.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Second, the skilled person would not have seen the use of a woven material for an integrated comfort layer as being unlikely or difficult to achieve in technical terms. There was no suggestion that the techniques used to weld a non-woven material would not have worked in respect of a woven material with, if necessary, some adjustments and experimentation in order to ascertain the appropriate combination of material (e.g. polyester, polyethylene or polypropylene) and welding methods (heat, RF or ultrasound) and welding parameters (temperature, time and pressure). Those techniques were common general knowledge. Indeed, the Patent does not set them out and must therefore proceed on the assumption that the skilled person would be well aware of them and would be able to use them in respect of a woven material to achieve a product meeting claims 1 to 4. Using those techniques, it was routine to achieve partial embedding (i.e. less than 100%) of the fibres of the comfort layer in the barrier film (claim 1) and a peel strength of more than 5N/12.5mm width (claim 2). Further, as I have found, the skilled person would have known that the weld zone did not have to be glossy and rigid and that it was possible to achieve a comfort layer surface with the same tactile and visual characteristics in and out of the weld zone (claims 3 and 4) by adjusting the choice of materials and welding conditions (for example, by using a woven polyester welded at a temperature below its melting point or by RF welding). Again, this suggests that the use of a woven in the way described in the Patent was not inventive. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Third, the reasons why woven materials had not been used previously were not technical but were commercial. They were the greater cost of woven materials over non-woven, the costs associated with changing machinery and systems set up to deal with non-wovens so as to deal with wovens and (probably, to a lesser extent) environmental concerns because the use of wovens typically involve a larger quantity of plastic. For the reasons set out by Laddie J in <span style="font-style:italic">Brugger</span>, the fact that, for commercial reasons, people had not previously used wovens for integrated comfort layers does not suggest that such use would be inventive. It simply shows that such use was commercially unattractive (see also Jacob LJ’s “could/would point” referred to in paragraph 93 above).  </p>

On that basis, he submitted, the question had to asked “what has changed?” The answer, he said, was two-fold. First, that no-one had previously thought of using a woven in this way and that “using very wellknown materials in a way not thought of before is the stuff of invention”. Second, that the Patent had disclosed that there were advantages associated with the use of a woven material, advantages that had previously not been appreciated.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">I reject these arguments. In my judgment, on the basis of Mr van der Leden’s evidence, it appears that companies such as Coloplast and Salts are now prepared to use a woven fabric because, with appropriate marketing in more affluent markets such as the UK, they have decided that the commercial disadvantages of using a woven could be overcome. As regards Mr Lykiardopoulos’ reference to the 24% figure, even assuming that was not an attempt to raise an unpleaded “commercial success” argument, I do not see how it helps Coloplast. Again, on the basis of Mr van der Leden’s evidence, the current success of the parties’ woven products could well be due to commercial factors such as marketing and to the efforts of sponsored stoma nurses. It does not mean that the idea underlying the Patent must have been inventive. </p>

I do not accept that this was inventive. In my judgment, the skilled person would have been well aware that, whether using a woven or a non-woven material, it was possible to achieve a weld with a sufficient peel strength and without the need for a hard and glossy weld zone. It was a relatively simple matter and depended on the nature of the particular material and the welding parameters used. The reason why the weld zones of ostomy bags before May 2012 had typically been hard and glossy (and had typically involved a greater degree of embedding of fibres of the comfort layer) was not because the skilled person thought that they had to be hard and glossy in order to achieve sufficient peel strength.

In this regard, I accept Ms Becke’s evidence that such objectives could be seen as desirable. Indeed, Salts’ own advertisements from 2010 and 2011 referred to its ND13 ostomy bags as having “soft edges for increased comfort” and a </p>

Similarly, Coloplast’s advertisement for its SenSura Mio product made with a woven integrated comfort layer included what Ms Becke referred to as a “beautiful” photograph of the surface of the comfort layer demonstrating more clearly than words the attractive visual effect where the surface of the weld zone matches that of the rest of the comfort layer. Having said this, I do not accept that the idea of using a woven material to achieve these objectives was inventive or that the Patent taught the skilled person anything in this regard. In my judgment, the skilled person would have been well aware that, whether using a woven or a non-woven material, it was perfectly possible to change the tactile or visual characteristics of the weld zone depending on his or her choice of material (polyester, polypropylene or polyethylene) and of welding parameters. For example, Mr van der Leden’s evidence (which I accept) was that avoiding having too sharp or rigid a weld “was easy to manage, by changing the temperature, dwell time and pressure”.  </p>

Rather, such non-use was far more likely to be referable to the fact that there was not thought to be any problem associated with the tactile or visual characteristics of existing bags with non-woven comfort layers. In this regard, Ms Becke admitted that, despite her researches, she had been unable to find any evidence of any complaints based on a lack of softness. Mr van der Leden’s evidence was that “I have never seen anyone who was interested in the appearance of the weld” and that “there has never been so much attention about the weld zone as I saw in the past week here”.  </p>

It was unclear whether Salts accepted that a woven integrated comfort layer did offer greater resistance to external forces given that, in closing, Mr Campbell pointed to Professor Barron’s evidence that: </p>

The experts agreed that wovens have a greater inherent ability to resist tearing than non-wovens. If this is so, I cannot see how that position would be reversed simply as a result of their being bonded to a barrier film. Further, if that was Professor Barron’s view, then it was not supported by the other experts. Mr van der Leden (Salts’ other expert) stated that “I fully agree that this woven comfort layer is stronger, is more resistant to anything…” and Ms Becke was also clear that non-wovens were less strong than wovens. It would also be contrary to the evidence of Ms Becke and Mr van der Leden to the effect that an ostomy bag with a woven integrated comfort layer would stay in better condition than one with a non-woven integrated comfort layer. Finally, it would be difficult to reconcile with Salts’ advertisements for its Confidence BE product which, as Mr Lykiardopoulos pointed out, mentioned that “The new and improved textile fabric has been designed to look great, no matter how long it’s worn”.  </p>

This was not a case where the idea solved an unrecognised problem. Rather, the reason for such non-use was that there was no real need to provide for a greater resistance to such forces. The only documentary evidence suggesting that there was any problem with existing comfort layers was the comment in Dircks (at [0007]) that non-woven comfort layers “can snag on clothing at times” and Salts’ advertisement referred to above suggesting (indirectly) that ostomy bags with non-woven integrated comfort layers did not stay in as good a condition as those with woven integrated comfort layers. It is true that Ms Becke said that she believed (based on her experience with other products) that snagging and pilling in particular were an issue. However, she accepted that, despite her efforts, she had been unable to find any evidence of tearing, snagging or pilling occurring in real life but simply general references to “user comfort”.

I should note, however, that I do not accept Mr Campbell’s argument that the Patent is invalid insofar as claim 4 was referring to a characteristic that was aesthetic rather than technical. As Mr Lykiardopoulos said, the technical contribution was the use of a woven material. If that contribution had been inventive, then the fact that it had only had an aesthetic result would not have prevented the grant of the Patent. The Patent would have been to protect the technical idea that led to that aesthetic result and not the result itself. It is not like, for example, an idea that a bag should be blue in colour. Similarly, I do not see that it matters that the claims themselves do not expressly suggest that use of a woven integrated comfort layer provides greater user comfort and/or resistance to tearing, snagging and pilling. Again, had the technical contribution (the use of a woven) been inventive, there was no need to spell out in the claims the benefits that that contribution would provide. </p>

Having described earlier attempts to solve these problems by the use of removable fabric covers or of integral covers attached to the device by adhesives, Watkins went on (at page 7) to teach a different solution (reflected in its claims 5 and 6).

He also argued that if the skilled person did decide to follow Watkins, the obvious material to use would have been a non-woven polyester given that “Watkins teaches that the same material should be used for the comfort layer as for the flange… and only a nonwoven material is disclosed for the flange”. However, he then submitted that most manufacturers (Coloplast and Dansac being the exceptions) were not interested in using polyester because “it would not fit their existing processes”. Overall, his position was that there was “no reason on reading this 30-year-old document why the Skilled Person would switch to using a polyester comfort layer”.  </p>

Rather, the question is whether, on reading Watkins, the relevant step would have appeared obvious to the skilled person or whether it required any degree of invention and, in answering that question, the focus must be on technical issues and on whether the step had added something to the existing stock of knowledge. As Birss J pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic">Hospira </span>(see paragraph 94 above), “… the well-known 9 ½ inch plate is not something a skilled person would make. It is more accurate to say that it is not patentable because the skilled person could make it without any inventive step.” Similarly, as Aldous LJ pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic">Asahi </span>(see paragraph 95 above), “If the step from the prior art lacked invention, then it mattered not whether anybody would have thought of implementing it.”  </p>

A skilled person looking at Watkins (a “brilliant” or “foundational” patent) on the priority date in May 2012 would have noticed that Watkins specified the use of a non-woven for the flange but repeatedly referred to the use of a “woven or non-woven fibre material” for the integral cover. In view of this, it is difficult to argue that the idea of using a woven material (something expressly disclosed in Watkins) was nevertheless inventive.

In this regard, I reject Mr Lykiardopoulos’ submission that, in using a woven (or for that matter a polyester), the skilled person would be doing something differently from the common general knowledge and, hence, that such use was inventive. As I have found, the possibility of using a woven was common general knowledge and the skilled person would have known that the reason why it had not actually been tried in the 30 years since Watkins was because there were commercial disadvantages and because there was no particular problem with existing ostomy bags with non-woven integrated comfort layers.  </p>

In my judgment, the skilled person would have known that, in implementing Watkins using polyester and RF welding (as envisaged by Watkins), the resulting product would meet the requirements of integers 3.1 and 4.1 because the fibres of the comfort layer would not melt and would only be partly embedded.

Nor does Coloplast rely on the fact that Watkins provides for the comfort layer to be attached by RF welding whereas the claims of the Patent simply require it to be “attached”.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">On this basis, the only issue as regards obviousness over the Dansac Novalife was whether the step from using a non-woven to using a woven as the material for the integrated comfort layer was an inventive step. As Mr Lykiardopoulos submitted, this really raises two separate questions; first, whether it was obvious to change from a non-woven to a woven and, if so, second, whether it was obvious to do so in such a way as to ensure that the tactile and visual characteristics of the comfort layer remained the same in and out of the weld zone (i.e. whether in a way that still satisfied claims 3 and 4).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">As to the first of these questions, Mr Lykiardopoulos argued that the skilled person would not think of making any such change and would not want to make such a change. Indeed, he submitted that the only reason to make a change would be to meet the claims of the Patent which would involve improperly applying hindsight. He relied on Ms Becke’s evidence that the skilled person would have had no motivation to make a change from a nonwoven to a woven and on Mr van der Leden’s evidence that neither he (Mr van der Leden) nor the skilled person would have considered changing the Dansac Novalife so as to use a woven.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">It seems to me that, as was the case with regard to Watkins, this approach places too much emphasis on whether the skilled person would have made a change (i.e. on what he would have done or not done) rather than on asking the statutory question, namely whether the step involved was inventive. Given my finding that it was common general knowledge that a woven fabric could be used for an integrated comfort layer, I do not accept that the skilled person would have seen this change as inventive. I accept that Mr van der Leden said that he (and in his view the skilled person) would not have thought of changing the Dansac Novalife and would not have wanted to change it. However, he also made it very clear that this was because the existing product was perfectly satisfactory (“so nice, so soft”, “the softest pouch in the business”), because a change would involve time and expense and because wovens were more expensive. In other words, for commercial reasons. In giving her evidence as regards the Dansac Novalife, Ms Becke accepted that using a woven would be more expensive and that existing examples where wovens were used involved using more plastic and to that extent were less environmentally friendly. In these circumstances, the fact that the skilled person would not have thought of changing and would not have wanted to change the Dansac Novalife product does not mean that he or she would have regarded such a change as inventive. It was simply that he or she would have seen a change as commercially unattractive and unnecessary. </p>

He also referred to Mr van der Leden’s evidence that to change the comfort layer of the Dansac Novalife from a non-woven to a woven would require tests as well as changes to production lines. He argued that it was only the teaching of the Patent that would tell the skilled person that he or she should seek to satisfy claims 3 and 4 and that, without that teaching, it would not have been obvious to use a woven in such a way as to satisfy claims 3 and 4.  </p>

In my judgment, the idea of using a woven in way to satisfy claims 3 and 4 was not inventive. As I have already found, the skilled person would have been well aware that it was possible to change the tactile or visual characteristics of the weld zone depending on his or her choice of material (e.g. polyester, polypropylene or polyethylene) and of welding parameters (heat, pressure, time). The skilled person would have known that if the woven material was made of polyester, then under normal welding conditions, the result would satisfy claims 3 and 4. </p>

This is because the Dansac Novalife as it stood clearly satisfied those claims. Even if the skilled person was motivated to change one aspect of the prior art (i.e. to change the non-woven for a woven), that does not mean that he or she has to change another aspect. There is no reason to assume that in deciding to change to a woven, the skilled person would also decide to abandon the existing (attractive and notable) characteristics of the surface of the comfort layer in the weld zone, let alone to decide to go back to the hard glossy surface that was typical in bags other than the Dansac Novalife.

In contrast, Mr van der Leden said in oral evidence that there had been embedding and that his view in this regard had been confirmed when, sitting his hotel room during the trial, he had cut up a sample ND13 with scissors, evidence to which Mr Lykiardopoulos objected on the basis that it was an impermissible experiment. </p>

I also find that there would have been nothing inventive in the idea of carrying out the welding in a way that would satisfy claims 3 and 4. That was simply a matter of applying the common general knowledge and was relatively simple to achieve, particularly in the case of a polyester comfort layer under typical welding conditions. Given this, I do not think that it matters which welding method had been used to make the ND13 or how many fibres in the ridge section of the ND13 had been embedded.

As Mr Lykiardopoulos says, the skilled person looking at Dircks in May 2012 would have seen that it departed from much of what was conventional in ostomy pouch design. In particular, at [0013]-[0014] it taught the use of a laminated structure consisting of “three distinct material layers”, a fabric layer, an adhesive layer and a film layer. It stated that “the adhesive layer is between and preferably co-extensive with the facing surfaces of the film layer and the fabric layer. The suitably thick, co-extensive adhesive layer adds bulk to the thin film layer and penetrates the fibers of the fabric layer.” In effect, unlike most bags, in which the comfort (fabric) layer was attached around the edge of the bag, Dircks taught full face attachment of the comfort layer and the use of an adhesive layer.  </p>

This was a matter of dispute between the experts. Ms Becke’s evidence was, in effect, that although material from the adhesive layer would have bonded with adhesive outer layer of the barrier film, it would not have mixed with it (there would still have been a “distinct line” between them). Hence, the material in which fibres from the comfort layer would have become embedded was material from the adhesive layer and not from the barrier film. In contrast, Mr van der Leden (whilst admitting that Ms Becke knew “much more about how polymers are made and how they react to each other”) believed that, in implementing Dircks (particularly in the case of a thin adhesive layer), fibres of the comfort layer could end up embedded in the barrier film. </p>

In my judgment, whilst it is true that the materials used for the sample were not those specified in the preferred embodiment of Dircks, they were within the parameters of the Dircks disclosure. Mr Lykiardopoulos also argued that it was impossible to draw any reliable conclusions from these SEMs. Whilst I agree that (as I have already mentioned) the process leading to the creation of this SEM image was very much less than ideal, I do not feel that I can reject Professor Barron’s evidence as to what they show. In this regard, I note that the A,B,A,B,A sequence which he was able to discern was consistent with what might occur if 2 pieces of barrier film material made up in accordance with Salts’ Notice of Experiments were welded together.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="8">
		<p class="footnotedescription"> i.e. a barrier film made of 5 layers - (i) EVA (an adhesive); (ii) EVA; (iii) PVDC; (iv) EVA and (v) EVA.

On being heat welded, the adhesive layers (A) will merge to form the sequence of A,B,A,B,A to which Professor Barron referred. </p>

The problem being that the “‘fuzzy’ non-woven or fibrous or fabric-like exterior surface of body collection devices” tended to provide a weak point of anchorage. To address this, Willis taught using either a 3-layer laminate (as taught by Dircks) or a 2layer laminate (dispensing with the separate adhesive layer) and to apply heat to a selected part of the surface which would result in a film like surface where an attachment could be made. In this sense, Willis was teaching the opposite to the Patent. It sought to make specific areas of the comfort layer more rather than less film-like. </p>

Indeed, Ms Becke accepted that, depending on the nature of the welding processes used, one would get partial embedding. Further, it was clear from Willis that this was likely to be the case given that the “fuzzy” quality of the surface with which Willis was concerned would have been a result of partial embedding.

The comparison is a strict one but the relevant disclosure can be implied, in the sense that it is something that the skilled person would take for granted (a stricter test than the “obviousness” test considered above).

Mr Campbell then points out “An argument of intermediate generalisation succeeded” in para.4.2 of that decision. However, the argument that succeeded in para.4.2 of the Opposition Division’s decision did not relate to claim 1 as it was before me but instead to a proposed amended version of claim 1 as set out in an auxiliary request intended to counter a novelty challenge to claim 1. The proposed amendment involved adding a passage to claim 1 to reflect five out of the six features disclosed in the paragraphs of the application which I have summarised in paragraph 192(b) above. The point that the Opposition Division made in para.4.2 of its decision was that in omitting one of those six features, the proposed amendment was adding matter to the claim because it was not making that claim in the full context in which it had been disclosed. As para.4.2 deals with a different (proposed) version of claim 1, I do not see how this helps Mr Campbell.  </p>

In effect, claim 1 is now to be read as including a requirement that the material in question should be a woven (and not just a textile). However, I do not see that this involves adding anything to claim 1. Rather, it narrows it. </p>

For the reasons set out below, I reject these criticisms. Indeed, with regard to the second criticism, it is interesting that, giving evidence with regard to the Dansac Novalife bag on which the location of the weld zone is perfectly apparent, Mr van der Leden was able to say with certainty that “you cannot see the difference between the weld and the non-welded area.” Clearly, his view of the test to be applied was different to that of Mr Campbell. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">As a cross check, I have looked at the samples of other sample products included in the trial bundles (such as Coloplast’s “Original” SenSura Mio product and Salts’ ND13 product) where a non-woven fabric has been used for the comfort layer. With these products, the surface of the comfort layer in the weld zone clearly has a uniform or continuous mass appearance which is quite different to its surface outside the weld zone.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">I should note, in response to a further point raised by Mr Campbell, that my assessment of the tactile and visual characteristics of the comfort layer of Salts’ Confidence BE products is unaffected by the colour of the relevant product and applies equally to the product in the colour black. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">For the reasons set out above, whilst I reject Salts’ claims that the Patent was invalid on the grounds of novelty, insufficiency or added matter, I accept Salts’ claim that the Patent was invalid in the ground of obviousness because the concept relied on by Coloplast under the Patent was not an inventive concept. The idea that a woven material could be used as the material for an integrated comfort layer of an ostomy bag in a way that fell within each of claims 6A, 6B and 6C of the Patent was obvious over the common general knowledge of the skilled person and also over the specific prior art disclosures relied on by Salts. </p>
