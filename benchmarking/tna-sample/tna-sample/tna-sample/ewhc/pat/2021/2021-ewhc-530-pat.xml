	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.03in">Over the course of four days in October and November 2020, I heard the trial of a patent claim brought by Neurim Pharmaceuticals (1991) Limited (<span style="font-weight:bold">Neurim</span>) and Flynn Pharma Limited (<span style="font-weight:bold">Flynn</span>) against Generics UK Limited and Mylan UK Healthcare Limited (collectively, unless the context otherwise requires, <span style="font-weight:bold">Mylan</span>). The issues before me concerned the validity of a patent, EP (UK) 1,441,702 B1 (the <span style="font-weight:bold">Patent</span>).

I do not propose, in this <span style="font-weight:bold">Consequentials Judgment</span>, to repeat the Judgment, which I take as read for the purposes of this Consequentials Judgment. I also propose to adopt the terms and abbreviations used in the Judgment, as set out in Annex 1 to the Judgment. </p>

At first sight, to a reader of the Judgment only, that might seem surprising. Apart from one point – the question whether Flynn was an exclusive licensee within the meaning of sections 67 and 130 of the Patents Act 1977, which I shall term the <span style="font-weight:bold">Exclusive Licence Point</span> – I found in favour of the Claimants and concluded that Mylan’s challenges to the validity of the Patent all failed, and that Mylan was either threatening to, or was, infringing the Patent.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.03in">There was, from the Claimants’ perspective, considerable urgency in ensuring that Mylan did not infringe the Patent. The threat to the Claimants’ United Kingdom monopoly, arising out of the Patent, and the threat to the market that the Claimants’ had established in reliance upon the Patent, were – to the Claimants – both obvious and urgent. The urgency was exacerbated, in the Claimants’ eyes, by two factors: </p>

In short, as part of its preparations to bring a rival product to market, Mylan should – according to the Claimants – have “cleared the way” by having the issue of the Patent’s validity and any separate questions of infringement resolved well-before there could be any question of actual or imminently threatened infringement. </p>

In fact, although there was a clear suggestion by Mylan that the sale of Infringing Products was imminent – and certainly that was the Claimants’ concern and understanding – the importation and/or sale of Infringing Products did not occur until rather later in the year, towards the end of 2020, in about September.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="4">

These were obviously matters of extreme commercial sensitivity, and Mylan was (in my judgment, properly) circumspect in what is said.

The deadlines for these two stages are within two months and within four months of the written decision under appeal.

Mylan’s skeleton has this sentence at the end of paragraph 3: “Neurim has appealed that decision, and a hearing has been fixed before the Technical Board of Appeal for 17/18 December 2020”. I regret that I did not pick this up or, if I did, I have forgotten that I did. It does seem to me that this sentence is nothing to the point. The pre-trial review was concerned mainly with the mechanics for trial, particularly in the COVID-19 circumstances that prevailed. Neither party sought to apply for an adjournment, or even suggested that that was a matter I should consider. As a counsel of perfection, I should have raised this of my own motion in light of the half-sentence in Mylan’s written submissions and – to be clear – I failed to do so. But, as is clear from the substance of this Consequentials Judgment, the point to which I attach significance is the decision of the parties not to raise the matter formally – by way of application to adjourn or for directions – so that the interplay between the EPO Proceedings and the UK Proceedings could be explicitly handled. That did not happen. Notwithstanding the terms of Mylan’s skeleton, and the Claimants’ point on the draft judgment, I have retained the wording of the draft judgment because this reflects (for better or worse) my understanding at this and other times. </span>

		<p class="footnotedescription" style="text-align:justify"> I.e., the Convention on the Grant of European Patents (Munich, 5 October 1973, as revised by the Act revising Article 63 EPC of 17 December 1991 and the Act revising the EPC of 29 November 2000) </p>
	      </authorialNote> On this basis – even if I found the Patent valid, which is the conclusion I reached, that decision would be “trumped” by the decision of the Technical Board of Appeal. On the other hand, if the appeal before the Technical Board of Appeal had succeeded (and the Patent found to be valid) then a decision by me to revoke would have continued to stand (albeit only in the United Kingdom), notwithstanding the outcome in the EPO. One can therefore see exactly why Mylan, in particular, would have wished to hold the trial before me, because it enabled Mylan to take two shots in short order at revoking the Patent. </p>

In these circumstances, it is difficult to set out in writing precisely the wording of the orders that I made, given that no order was formally drawn (not because of any “slip”, but because the parties were at odds on the substantive wording).  </p>

The Claimants’ position was that the 16 December 2020 Orders operated perfectly well on their own terms, and that the provisions in those orders (particularly the “sunset” provisions regarding the injunction) anticipated the fact that the appeal before the Technical Board of Appeal in the EPO Proceedings might fail, and that there was no need to re-visit the 16 December 2020 Orders at all. </p>

Clearly, it cannot be in every case that a litigant should be entitled to ask the judge to think again. Therefore, on one ground or another, the case must raise considerations, in the interests of justice, which are out of the ordinary, extraordinary or exceptional.

Where an opponent raises a variety of grounds of opposition, the practice of the EPO is to decide the issues in a given order.

If, on the one hand, it should be before oral proceedings have taken place in all, or some, of the other cases in the board’s list of pending cases, then clearly there would be a possible argument that the board was giving unfair preference to this case, in which oral proceedings on the issue giving rise to the appeal have already taken place and that issue has been decided, over other cases which have also been pending for four years and in which oral proceedings have not yet taken place. If, on the other hand, the board were now to treat this case as a newly-filed appeal for the purpose of the undecided issues, the parties might, indeed in the currently prevailing conditions probably would, have to wait another four years for a final decision.

To this extent, therefore, I reject the contention made by Neurim that the 16 December 2020 Orders cannot be revisited because the “UK proceedings are separate and distinct from those at the EPO”. They are, of course, separate and distinct, but that does not mean to say that they do not inter-relate and are not inter-connected. They obviously do and are. Equally obviously, the extent to which that inter-connectedness should affect matters like orders as to costs is a matter untrammelled by case-law, and something to which I will come.  </p>

All I am saying is that such subsequent determinations can (but need not necessarily) justify such a review or variation. Whether they in fact do so, will depend on all the circumstances. Suppose – as had originally been anticipated – the appeal to the Technical Board of Appeal had not taken place in December 2020, but in the first quarter of 2022. By that time, the 16 December 2020 Orders would have been formalised and an injunction enjoining Mylan against infringement would have been operating for 14 months; Mylan would, in accordance with those orders, have delivered up or destroyed infringing product; and Mylan would have paid substantially all of the costs of the proceedings. I hesitate to say what the appropriate orders and directions would be in such a case – and, fortunately, these are not matters that I have to consider. But, in those circumstances, I would have been very hesitant about using the CPR 3.1(7) jurisdiction and would probably have considered that the most appropriate course would be for the 16 December 2020 Orders to be appealed to the Court of Appeal and for the Court of Appeal to give the appropriate directions regarding the 16 December 2020 Orders and to give the appropriate directions (if any)for Mylan to claim to recover its losses as a result of orders (that is, the 16 December 2020 Orders) that were, taking account subsequent events, wrongly made and causative of loss. </p>

The imminent appeal before the Technical Board of Appeal was known about at the hearing on 16 December 2020 and – to a certain extent – the variety of possible outcomes of the appeal factored in. Thus, in order to ensure that Mylan was not injuncted for no justification, the injunction was timed to start at 9:00pm on Friday 18 December 2020, by which time (it was anticipated) the outcome of the appeal would definitely be known. Had the appeal succeeded, and the decision of the Opposition Division to revoke been overturned, the injunction would have had effect from that time onwards. If – as proved to be the case – the appeal failed, then the “sunset” provisions would have been engaged, and the injunction would never have come into force at all. Up to 9:00pm on Friday, Neurim was afforded the rather more limited protection of the undertakings from Mylan that I have described.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="36">

	    <p style="margin-left:1.26in;margin-right:0.03in">It would be grossly unfair to Mylan for it to be unable to contend that – in light of the outcome of the appeal – the 16 December 2020 Orders should not be varied. The fact is that the hearing on 16 December 2020 only took place because – for good reason – it was very important to Neurim that the matter be heard in December 2020 rather than January or February 2021. The fact that the hearing took place before the appeal hearing in front of the Technical Board of Appeal was no more than an unfortunate consequence of the diaries of the persons most involved. It obviously would have been better to have the hearing <span style="text-decoration:underline">after</span> the outcome of the appeal was known. </p>

The reason I am disinclined to permit any revisiting of the costs order would be simply this: it is quite clear, I think, that if we had known that the EPO appeal would be determined at about the same time as these proceedings, Nugee J, as he then was, would not have ordered expedition. It would have been pointless. The thinking, as I see it, behind expedition was that there was an urgency, which I accept, which because the EPO grinds slow had to be met by this jurisdiction, which we did.  So it seems to me these proceedings were properly ordered and of course it is great that the EPO moved faster than everyone thought, but the consequence of that is that it may prove that these proceedings were entirely a waste of time and money. That is very unfortunate, but my present thinking is I am really not minded to blame either party for that. It is simply a fact of life that these proceedings and the EPO proceedings are coming to the boil at pretty much the same time. There we are.”  </span>

Indeed, it is very difficult to see how the outcome of the appeal before the Technical Board of Appeals could cause that view to change. The problem is that the Exclusive Licence Point <span style="text-decoration:underline">presumes</span> the existence of the Patent. By way of example, section 67(1) of the Patents Act 1977 refers to the “holder of an exclusive licence under a patent”. The Patent having been revoked <span style="font-style:italic">ab initio</span>, Flynn is the exclusive licensee of, quite literally, nothing. </p>

He said, at [36], that before an appeal could proceed in those circumstances, the court must be satisfied that it would be in the public interest for the projected appeal to proceed, but he added that it would be “a very rare event, especially where the rights and duties to be considered are private and not public”.

Whilst I agree that the definition of an exclusive licence in the Patents Act 1977 is by no means free from difficulty, at the end of the day this case turned on the wording of the licence actually granted by Neurim to Flynn. I have no evidence before me to justify finding that this wording is one that raises issues of general importance, and indeed Mr Vanhegan, QC made the point that there has been no particular reaction – one way of the other – in the intellectual property community to suggest that the point <span style="text-decoration:underline">is</span> one of general importance. The fact that Neurim and Flynn agreed a series of changes to the licence agreement between them over time also strongly suggests that the Exclusive Licence Point is actually a narrow one, and specific to this case. </p>

Of course, that may happen: the judgment may well be cited in support of a contention that, under this amended licence, Flynn is not an exclusive licensee.

I consider this point to be unarguable: I can see no risk of a contention of abuse of process where what is being litigated is the question of whether Flynn is an exclusive licensee of a patent other than the Patent.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="47">
		<p class="footnotedescription" style="text-align:justify;margin-right:0.04in"> This argument appears to be based on a suggestion I made that a summary judgment application by Flynn against Mylan, seeking judgment against Mylan in respect of Mylan’s infringement of the Patent, based upon a combination of (i) the findings in my Judgment and (ii) the amended licence agreement.

Mr Waugh, QC, for Neurim, contended that the adverse outcome (for Neurim) of the EPO Proceedings, and the fact that the Patent had – by reason only of the withdrawal of Neurim’s appeal before the Technical Board of Appeal, and not by reason of anything done in this jurisdiction, where Neurim had succeeded – been revoked <span style="font-style:italic">ab initio </span>could not and should not alter this conclusion as to who the winner was. The “UK proceedings are separate and distinct from those at the EPO”, according to Neurim. That, of course, is a contention previously made by Neurim as an argument for not revisiting the 16 December 2020 Orders <span style="text-decoration:underline">at all</span>. For the reasons I have given, I have rejected that contention and – as it seems to me – the contention is untenable in the context of costs. As I noted previously, of course, the UK Proceedings and the EPO Proceedings are separate and distinct, but that does not mean to say that they do not inter-relate and are not inter-connected. They obviously do and are.  </p>

This is very difficult in this case, because Neurim withdrew its appeal, and the Technical Board of Appeal never actually gave a formal decision, and will now never hand down any written reasons in the EPO Proceedings. But, even if the appeal had not been withdrawn, and full reasons had, in due course, been rendered in the EPO Proceedings by the Technical Board of Appeal, I consider that it would be invidious for me to seek to “second guess” the findings and reasoning of the Technical Board of Appeal.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.03in">I remind myself of Floyd LJ’s twelfth proposition or guidance in <span style="font-style:italic">IPCom</span>: in weighing the balance of staying or not staying English proceedings, it is material to take account of costs liable to be wasted. In this case, the picture changed dramatically between March 2020 (when expedition was ordered by Nugee J) and June 2020 (when, in my judgment, there was a material change, such that a party would have been justified in bringing the matter back before the court for re-consideration). As I see it, the following possibilities existed as at June/July 2020: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.03in">The third possibility is the one that occurred: no application to adjourn was made by either party. In June/July 2020, both Neurim and Mylan knew that there was a clear potential for the outcome of the UK Proceedings to be rendered pointless in light of the imminent hearing before the Technical Board of Appeal in the EPO Proceedings. The parties would have been well aware of potentiality. In my judgment, in not seeking to engage with the court on the question of adjournment, each of the parties assumed the risk of costs being wasted and of a costs order being made that followed the <span style="text-decoration:underline">outcome</span> of the interaction between the UK and the EPO Proceedings, as opposed to the reasoning (whatever it might be) of the UK Proceedings. I do not say that an outcome based order will always, or even generally, be the right one, although in this case I consider it to be the correct starting point when assessing the incidence of costs, for the reasons I have given. It seems to me that Neurim cannot now complain that it bears the entire costs of the trial simply because – although the Judgment favoured it – the outcome of the interaction between the EPO Proceedings and the UK Proceedings has resulted in Neurim being the losing party. The costs of the UK Proceedings were costs thrown away because the decision of the Technical Board of Appeal in the EPO Proceedings rendered the trial in the UK Proceedings unnecessary. That is something that Neurim could have avoided, and I consider there is no reason why I should alter the provisional view on costs that I have reached. Indeed, I consider the fact that it lay within Neurim’s power to bring this issue before the court to support and further justify the provisional view on costs that I have reached. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.03in">At paragraph 50(6) above, I raised, but did not answer, the difficult hypothetical question of what might have happened had the trial of the UK Proceedings gone ahead, with the outcome those proceedings had (as <span style="font-style:italic">per </span>the Judgment), but with the hearing before the Technical Board of Appeal not taking place until the first quarter of 2022. In those circumstances, the 16 December 2020 Orders would have been formalised and an injunction enjoining Mylan against infringement would have been operating against Mylan for around 14 months. For that period of time, Mylan would have been prevented (and, given the outcome of the EPO Proceedings I am hypothetising, which is the actual outcome only later, <span style="text-decoration:underline">wrongly</span> prevented) from bringing the Infringing Product (now clearly <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> an infringing product) to market in the UK. Furthermore, Mylan would, in accordance with those orders, have delivered up or destroyed Infringing Product; and Mylan would have paid substantially all of the costs of the UK Proceedings. </p>

However, I write these paragraphs to make clear that I did not hear full argument on this point (although the point was touched upon in the course of argument) and I am emphatically not deciding it. I have placed no weight on the fact that – if the law is as I have suggested it <span style="text-decoration:underline">might</span> be – it confirms the conclusion I have reached on costs. To the contrary, even if there were no restitutionary (or other) remedy enabling Mylan to recover benefits conferred in obedience to the 16 December 2020 Order, I consider the outcome that I have reached, both on the question of costs and the question of permission to appeal, to be the correct one. In short, I have reached my conclusions without this point being taken into account, either way. </p>
