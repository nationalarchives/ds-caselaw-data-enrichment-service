	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.32in;text-indent:0.5in">This is the latest battle in the sequence of disputes between the Claimant in this action (“Zipher”) on the one hand and companies in the Markem group, which includes both the Defendants (“Markem”), on the other.  Earlier proceedings concerned the parties’ entitlement to inventions disclosed in a number of patents and patent applications applied for by Zipher, including some which are now in issue in this action.  The earlier decisions are chronicled in the law reports.  Those of HHJ Fysh QC sitting as a deputy High Court Judge are  <span style="font-style:italic">Markem Corp v Zipher Ltd (No 1)</span> [2004] RPC 10, <span style="font-style:italic">Markem Corp v Zipher Ltd (No 2)</span> [2004] RPC 11 and <span style="font-style:italic">Markem Corp v Zipher Ltd (No 3)</span> [2005] RPC 3.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.32in;text-indent:0.5in">HHJ Fysh QC held that Markem Corporation and the Second Defendant were entitled to a number of the wider claims of those patents and applications, but that narrower claims belonged to Zipher. In the course of the proceedings at first instance, Zipher’s counsel offered an undertaking to the court as to what it would do with the wider claims if it was successful in establishing its claim to be entitled to them, which at first instance it was not.   The Court of Appeal allowed Zipher’s appeal: <span style="font-style:italic">Markem </span></p>

The Court of Appeal took the approach that in the absence of any allegation of breach by Zipher of a private law right, Markem’s claim to entitlement could not succeed. The order of the Court of Appeal recited a concession made by Zipher’s counsel that some of the wider claims as they stood then were invalid, or (in the case of one claim) invalid if construed in a particular way, but did not recite the undertaking offered to HHJ Fysh QC.  </p>

Markem contend that the court should not entertain the application to amend as it is not in conformity with the undertaking given to HHJ Fysh QC.  The amendments are opposed by Markem on statutory grounds and because they say the court should not exercise its discretion to allow the amendments even if they are otherwise allowable. This latter point raises the question of whether the court retains (following the entry into force of the Patents Act 2004 on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2007) any discretion to refuse to allow amendments which would not offend against the grounds of objection under the statute, and, if so, on what principles that discretion is to be exercised.     </p>

Although the claims are wider, the specific embodiments in the patents and the products which the parties make and sell are thermal transfer printers.  Thermal transfer printing uses a ribbon with solid thermoplastic ink covering one side.  The ink can be melted in specific regions if subjected from the other side to heat from the printing elements in a print head.  Once heated, the ink transfers from the tape to the substrate onto which it is desired to print.  A major application of this type of printing is in production lines, where it is necessary to add coded information onto a product, such as a “sell by” or “best before” date. For these reasons the machines are sometimes called “date coders” or just “coders”. </p>

For most of the last 30 years, he worked for Cambridge Consultants Limited. He is currently a freelance design engineer.

His own apprenticeship was 5 years with Cambridge Scientific Instruments Co. This included one day and one evening a week at the local technical college (which is now Anglia Ruskin University) learning the theoretical and mathematical side of the job.  At the end of his apprenticeship he became a skilled Scientific Instrument Maker. Mr Nelson started his involvement with thermal transfer printers in 1995 and continued until 1999.

In their simplest form, DC motors work by mounting a rotating armature on a rotating spindle.  The armature carries coils of wire which become electromagnets when an electric current is caused to flow in them.  Fixed magnets, called the stator, surround the rotating armature. The interaction between the stator and the field generated by the current in the windings of the armature causes the armature to experience a rotational force.  As the armature rotates, the current supplied to the windings is caused to reverse in polarity, so that the rotational force remains in the same direction. The reversal of current is called “commutation”. </p>

This stepping is achieved with the use of a stator consisting of multiple electromagnets (“teeth”) arranged around a central gear shaped rotor. When current flows in the windings, the teeth of the stator line up with the teeth of the gear shaped rotor.  Sequential energising of the teeth under the control of electrical circuitry enables the rotor to move stepwise into alignment with successive teeth of the stator.

By varying the periods of 6V and 0V supply, the device can be supplied with voltage which, in average terms, is equivalent to intermediate voltage supplies.

This is because the windings present a large impedance to high frequencies: and the switching of the voltage from zero to full-on is recognised as a high frequency, even if it only represents part of a cycle. To force more current into the windings against this impedance, one has to increase the voltage.  But this has the disadvantage that after a short period an excessively high current will start to flow.  It is therefore desirable to switch the high voltage off and on again.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.32in;text-indent:0.5in">Proportional-Integral-Derivative (“PID”) control is a specific form of closed loop control. The error function is subjected to a proportional function, an integral function and a derivative function.   Each of these has a parameter, called the gain, which alters the relative influence of that function.  The tuning of these parameters fundamentally defines both the steady state and dynamic performance of the closed loop control system. </p>

This can be done mechanically with a friction clutch or brake applied to the supply spool. An alternative method is electrical. A DC motor driving a spool may be used as an electrical brake for that spool by powering the motor connected to it to turn in the opposite direction to the turning of the spool. Another method of electrical braking is to use the DC motor so that a back emf will appear at its terminals. If a resistive load is applied to the motor it will exert a drag force on the tape. A controlled drag can be created by varying the resistance applied across the motor terminals. </p>

Thus the two motors operate in push-pull mode. This makes it possible to achieve very high rates of acceleration and deceleration. Tension in the tape being transported is determined by control of the drive motors and therefore is not dependent upon any components which have to contact the tape between the take-up and supply spools.  Thus a very simple overall mechanical assembly can be achieved. Given that both motors contribute to tape transport, relatively small and therefore inexpensive and compact motors can be used.” </p>

Although “push-pull” is a term which is apparently widely used in this context, it is perhaps not the most technically exact way of describing what is going on, as the supply spool does not push the tape in any meaningful sense.  What driving the supply spool achieves is to relieve the load on the take up spool, so that the system can accelerate more easily.

The conventional approach to achieving accurate control of tape acceleration, deceleration, speed and position has relied upon a capstan roller positioned between feed and supply spools, but the present invention relies upon a completely different approach, that is the accurate control of the drive applied to the stepper motors … which drive the ribbon spools. The stepper motors operate in push-pull bi-directional mode, that is if the tape is travelling in one direction between the spools both stepper motors are driven in that direction, and conversely when the ribbon is being driven in the opposition direction both stepper motors are driven in that opposite direction. Coordination of the drive to the two stepper motors requires knowledge of the diameters of the spools and this is achieved using the light emitting devices….” </p>

The take up motor is used to pull the tape from the supply spool with the supply spool de-energised. The system counts the number of steps taken by the take up spool.  The supply spool, being pulled along in this way, functions as a generator and produces a back-emf.  Because the motor is a stepper motor, this back-emf will be in the form of a series of pulses.  This enables the system to compare the number of steps taken by the take up motor with the number of pulses recorded from the supply motor, so as to arrive at a ratio of the two diameters.  This again is in the nature of a calibration process, as opposed to a process carried out during printing, as the supply spool is de-energised, which would not be practical during operation. </p>

If the derived value of t is too low (below a different predetermined limit), then a short section of ribbon can be removed from the length of ribbon between the spools. The control algorithms used to determine the correction amounts of ribbon added to or removed from the length of ribbon between the spools may be of conventional form, for example the algorithms known as proportional integral derivative control algorithms (PlD control). The algorithms make it possible to compare the measured tension t with predetermined upper and lower limits (the so-called deadband) and, if the measured tension is outside these limits, the difference between the measured tension t and a "nominal demand" tension which is set at a level between the upper and lower limits may be calculated, the result of that calculation being regarded as an error "signal". This error "signal" is then mathematically processed through the PID algorithms, which include a proportional gain constant, as well as integral and derivative factors. The mathematical processing results in a "correction" amount of ribbon that needs to be added to or removed from the ribbon path between the spools during the next ribbon feed. This addition or removal of ribbon maintains ribbon tension within acceptable limits.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.32in">At [0040], the specification explains that printheads used in thermal transfer printing must be accurately positioned relative to a platen (which supports a substrate to be printed) if good quality print is to be produced and that an angular displacement of only a few degrees can radically affect print quality. It goes on to say that the traditional approach to dealing with the problem is to position a printhead on an appropriate support assembly in a nominally corrected position, run a test-print to check the quality, and then mechanically adjust the position of the printhead so as to optimise print quality. It is explained that this requires the installer to make very small mechanical adjustments using, for example, spacers, in a time-consuming fashion  </p>

The printhead support is then displaced using the drive mechanism and a further print test is run. Adjustments in the position of the printhead are then made by the installer until the print quality is optimised. By using the drive mechanism to displace the printhead horizontally relative to the print roller, there is no need to make mechanical adjustments using, for example, spacers. </p>

Whilst the claim is not limited to monitoring absolute tension, it is I believe concerned with monitoring something which is indicative of tension.  It is not, in my judgment, wide enough to encompass keeping an eye on something which simply has some bearing on what might happen to tension in the future if nothing is done about it.   I agree with Mr Thorley QC when he says that however far the claim extends in terms of the relationship between the monitored value and the actual tension, it does not extend as far as monitoring something which is not tension at all. I think this is clear from the context of the words in claim 1, because claim 1 goes on to require that the <span style="font-style:italic">monitored tension</span> is maintained. This does not really work if the notion of tension monitoring is as loose a concept as that for which Markem contend. If what is monitored is not indicative of the tension in the tape, tension is not being monitored in the context of this specification.   In essence the claim is concerned with extracting a variable (it may be only a zero or a 1) which is in a known relationship to tension. </p>

Zipher also draw attention to claim 3 which requires the “tension in the tape being transported” to be “determined”.  Given that tension needs to be determined both when the tape is moving and when it is stationary, Zipher submit that the phrase “being transported” cannot connote only a tape which is in motion. </p>

This, in context, can only indicate a preference over detecting the current during periods of acceleration or deceleration (rather than a preference over not moving at all). As the embodiment under discussion will not function if the motors are not moving, it would not make sense to say that measurement whilst moving was merely “preferable”.  In the end, therefore, this passage does not help to resolve the issue of construction except to the extent that it emphasises the fact that in the specific embodiment the tape has to move. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.32in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment Markem’s approach to this term is too literal.  The invention is concerned with maintaining the tension in the tape generally, not just when it is in motion. So one would expect the same level of generality when it comes to monitoring the tape tension.  The skilled person would expect the phrase “being transported” to cover the case where the tape is moving, but not to be limited to it. It would be wrong to construe the phrase in a more limited and literal way just because the specific embodiment relies on the movement of the motors for monitoring tension.  The claim does not require the tape to be moving at the moment the tension in the tape is monitored. </p>

This, they submitted, meant that it was the motors (and nothing else) which determined the tension in the sense of both monitoring it and setting it.  Reading claim 1 purposively and in context, the monitoring and maintaining requirements of claim 1 were to be read in the same sense as claim 3, so that it is the use of the motors and the motors alone which monitors the tension and maintains it within the limits.  </p>

It is true, as Mr Arnold submits, that the striking feature of the specific embodiment is that, in addition to driving the motors to set the tension in push-pull mode, the current supplied to the motors is used to monitor the tension. Whilst both concepts are essential, their functions are explained separately in the specification.  In my judgment, the skilled reader would not understand the monitoring function to be encompassed by the phrase “tension … is determined by control of the stepper motors”.   I think the claim is entirely non-specific as to how (or indeed if) tension is monitored.  </p>

I do not think it is at all surprising that it was not.  The undertaking was only to bite if the court awarded claims 1-4 to Zipher, which it did not.  It would have made little sense to record the undertaking in an order which awarded claims 1-4 to Markem.  The way in which that was to be carried out was as I have described above.  The absence from the order is in my judgment no support for the idea that the undertaking was not given.  The place to look to see whether the undertaking was given is the transcript which records it being given, not the order which does not need to.  Even if the court had awarded claims 1-4 to Zipher, the enforceability of the undertaking would not have depended on whether the undertaking was recorded in the order.  </p>

Firstly, it would be preferable for the undertaking, now that it had bitten, to be recorded in an order of the court.  Secondly, the wording of the undertaking was slightly wider than that which had already been given to HHJ Fysh.

In case G1/93, <span style="font-style:italic">Advanced Semiconductor Products</span>, the Enlarged Board of Appeal of the EPO stated (at paragraph [9] of its reasons) that the idea underlying Art. 123(2) is that that an applicant should not be allowed to improve his position by adding subject matter not disclosed in the application as filed, which would give him an unwarranted advantage and could be damaging to the legal security of third parties relying on the content of the original application. At paragraph [16] it explained that whether an added feature which limits the scope of protection is contrary to Art 123(2) must be determined from all the circumstances. If it provides a technical contribution to the subject matter of the claimed invention then it would give an unwarranted advantage to the patentee. If, on the other hand, the feature merely excludes protection for part of the subject matter of the claimed invention as covered by the application as filed, the adding of such a feature cannot reasonably be considered to give any unwarranted advantage to the applicant. Nor does it adversely affect the interests of third parties.  </p>

First, the onus to establish that amendment should be allowed is upon the patentee and full disclosure must be made of all relevant matters. If there is a failure to disclose all the relevant matters, amendment will be refused. Secondly, amendment will be allowed provided the amendments are permitted under the Act and no circumstances arise which would lead the court to refuse the amendment. Thirdly, it is in the public interest that amendment is sought promptly. Thus, in cases where a patentee delays for an unreasonable period before seeking amendment, it will not be allowed unless the patentee shows reasonable grounds for his delay. Such includes cases where a patentee believed that amendment was not necessary and had reasonable grounds for that belief. Fourthly, a patentee who seeks to obtain an unfair advantage from a patent, which he knows or should have known should be amended, will not be allowed to amend. Such a case is where a patentee threatens an infringer with his unamended patent after he knows or should have known of the need to amend. Fifthly, the court is concerned with the conduct of the patentee and not with the merit of the invention.” </p>

These could turn into elaborate and expensive issues to litigate. Sometimes the discretion was all that stood between the patentee and success. </p>

First he draws attention to what the legislature has not done: change “may” to “shall” in the Patents Act 1977.  I do not think he can get anything from that, except to say that it would have been a much shorter route to the objective than that I have arrived at.  Secondly Mr Arnold asks, what if the application to amend was an abuse of right?  I think the answer is that the party whose right is abused will be able to restrain the abuse, not through an appeal to the court’s discretion, but by enforcing his right.  Equally, where the application to amend would be an abuse of the process of the court, the court will not allow it to be made at all.  That is not because the court is exercising a discretion to refuse amendments under the Act.  It is because the court will always ensure that its procedure is not abused.  In fact, that is what I have done here in relation to the undertaking to HHJ Fysh QC. </p>

What can be considered as part of the state of the art is laid down in Article 54(2) EPC as everything made available to the public by means of a written or oral description, by use or in any other way, before the date of filing of the European patent application. The case law (see Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office, 4th edition 2001 Section I.C.1.6.6) accepts that information is "available to the public" if only a single member of the public is in a position to gain access to it and understand it, and if there is no obligation to maintain secrecy. However in every such case (see also T 932/96 of 16 June 1998 points 2.4.4.4 and 2.4.4.5, or T 11/99 of 10 October 2000 points 1.2.1 and 1.2.2) the information was made available to one or more persons who <span style="font-weight:bold">at the time of the information being made available</span> could be described as a member or members of the public. </p>

Since both motors are stepper motors (see below), the only drive alteration that could be applied is a change in the number of steps that the motors move. This results in a length of tape being added to or subtracted from the tape extending between the spools. Since the drive alterations (number of steps) are dependent upon the position of the tension roller, the number of steps must be calculated from that position by the software (see below). In the absence of the position of the tension roller determining minor drive alterations to Motor B, then undoubtedly the tension roller would arrive at an end stop and therefore cease to function. Thus the motor drive alterations keep the tension within a desired range. Since the position of the tension roller indicates the tension in the ribbon, its position can be monitored both when the ribbon is moving as well as when it is stationary.” </p>

If we were to use gravity, that would keep the tension sensibly constant.  If we were to use zero rate spring, that is one whose force does not change with position, that would be very good at keeping a tension sensibly constant.  We could compromise and use a regular spring which would have a finite rate and under those conditions there could be some change in running tension as the arm moves.  The choice between those is really in the hands of the designer and what will be acceptable for the application. </p>

Although it might not be the optimum or most preferred way, the evidence shows that these are all obvious alternatives.

This drag motor generates an emf which is applied to a load resistance so as to produce a braking torque. In one such system so called “dynamic braking” is achieved by intermittently connecting a load across the motor windings. The load is varied by reference to “drag look-up tables”. </p>

As the drive spool pulls the tape from the supply spool, the supply spool motor generates a back emf pulse stream.  The frequency of these pulses is fed to a velocity sense circuit and checked against a look up table, and sets the take up motor drive to the appropriate level.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.32in">The dynamic braking of the drag motor works by means of a variable current sink which is able to draw different levels of current from the windings of the supply spool motor, and therefore apply different levels of braking. The circuit employs a full wave rectifier across the windings and combines the signal from the two windings in order to produce a smoother signal and prevent cogging.  The current level in the sink is set by the drag look up tables, using switching to bring into the drag circuit an appropriate resistance.  The correct entry in the look up table is that determined by the velocity sense circuit. The values are empirically derived and may take account of different ribbon materials. </p>

Although this description does not apply when in push-pull, the teaching would not readily bring to mind the use of a stepper motor. Moreover even if the skilled person did think of a stepper motor he would have to consider how he was going to use the current to monitor tension.  Mr Taylor’s evidence was that this was being done with the DC motor arrangement in Figure 9 of Shroff.  But his own evidence (directed to insufficiency) was that the skilled person would not readily see how this could be done using a stepper motor.  </p>

If the only things that you were trying to achieve were control and direction of speed, then that would be true, but I go back to my point again, that the key part of this is to sense the torque of the motors.  That is not, as we know, at all straightforward with a stepper motor.  The skilled person would not have been aware of the way of doing it with a stepper motor in 2000 and I think therefore would have shied away from it immediately because the DC motor is such an obvious choice for this application.  A stepper motor is not an obvious choice. </p>

The patentee had been first to devise a way of isolating the individual enantiomer and had disclosed and enabled a way of making it in the patent.  The trial judge had held that the claim was insufficient, in that, given that the enantiomer was known to exist (as part of a racemic mixture) and to be a desirable product to make, the patentee’s technical contribution was to be seen as consisting only in the way of making it.  The Court of Appeal held that approach to be wrong. The contribution to the art was the novel compound claimed: that was fully enabled because a way of making it had been taught.  The critical distinction between <span style="font-style:italic">Biogen</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Lundbeck</span> was that in <span style="font-style:italic">Biogen</span> the claim in the patent was to a class of products.  </p>

Forgive me if it appears to be folksy, but I would like to just give it anyway.  My son came to me and just said, "I have just changed the spark plug in the lawnmower."  The next time I go to try and start the lawnmower and it does not start, I would think that James has done something wrong and look at the spark plug and the connection to it.  If instead my son came to me and said, "Actually, dad, I have just taken the entire lawnmower to pieces because I was interested in it and I put it back together again" and I then start it and it does not start, I don't have a clue what he has done wrong, and that is with a machine that you actually knew worked yesterday. Research and development was my business.  That is what I did. You are presented with a machine that you actually don't know works because you have never built it before.  It is not like the lawnmower.  It just strikes me, and I am trying to be as fair and open as I can, that this patent is laying a minefield for the poor development engineer.  It has got nothing to do whether you are mechanical engineer, an electrical engineer or a chemist.  There are all these things that seem to be wrong and at each stage you would say, yes, you know that is wrong, and maybe you would if you could isolate that.  What worries me is that you have got a machine there that is unstable.  It is breaking or it is stalling.  You don't know what is wrong.  As I understood it, I am supposed to look at this as someone who is able to take this up and build it with minimal experimentation. </p>

A critical aspect of the patent’s teaching is therefore whether it is adequate to enable the skilled reader to obtain the relevant current.  If the idea of using current to the motors as a way of monitoring tension is to work, there must be a way of obtaining the so-called “work-related” current. Mr Taylor’s evidence in his report was that it would not be apparent to the skilled reader of 602 how to separate the work-related current from all the other factors affecting the current drawn by the stepper motors. Dr McMahon’s evidence was that the choice of appropriate sampling filtering and averaging techniques would be well within the capacity of the skilled team. </p>

Mr Taylor simply did not see how this could be done to obtain a DC component.  He accepted that what one was after was a tension component, and that Zipher had shown in their Zodiac program that interesting and special sampling techniques make it possible to extract it.

These are quite different in terms of the information content per sample.

This would not matter if the evidence supported a conclusion that the skilled team seeking to implement the teaching of the specification would discover the error.  The evidence does not support any such conclusion: in fact it supports the conclusion that the skilled team would not discover the error at all.  Mr Taylor did not spot the error for some time, and even when he did he was not certain that he was right, as he thought the angular velocity might somehow have been allowed for in the other terms. Dr McMahon seemed to accept in his report that a skilled team of average skill would not spot the error initially. When he was specifically asked to check the equation he sought to derive it from first principles.  He arrived at the corrected form and was satisfied he had thought it through adequately in a few hours.  He said that he thought it would take the skilled team a day of effort if they had problems with the equation to spot and fix the problem.   However, the skilled person would not have the benefit of someone asking him to check the equation – there is at least a hint there that something is wrong which the patent does not give.  In fact the patent clearly asserts that the equation is right. In my judgment a team of appropriate skill would proceed on the assumption that the tension equations were correct. I do not believe that the team would realise that there was an error in the equation until long after it had expended undue effort. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.32in;text-indent:0.5in">It will be recalled that the patent describes three methods of ascertaining the spool diameters.  The first two (optical and back-emf) are, on the evidence, only practical methods at the calibration stage, not in operational use. This is despite the express suggestion in the patent that the Figure 19 method is suitable “during ribbon usage”.   Mr Taylor’s evidence was that the third method (the constant area calculation) required knowledge of the up-to-date ratio of the spool radii, which the patentee does not describe how to determine.  His conclusion was that the patentee must be suggesting a form of dead reckoning, which he concluded would not be accurate enough for many purposes. Dead reckoning involves working from the knowledge of the distance the tape advances to calculate the increase and decrease in spool diameters, by adding or subtracting twice the thickness of the tape for each revolution.  </p>

I find it a little puzzling that in order to keep the tape tension under control, you have to get the payout of the tape balancing the take-up.  That in itself means that our stepping rates are correct.  What is actually happening is that we have a current view of the diameters.  If that is a bit out, i.e. we are, say, increasing the tension in the tape, we will add or subtract a little bit of tape.  The action of that will put a few more steps in.  We are told to split the number of steps between the motors, which will give us essentially an updated value of the real diameters.  I don't accept that it is circular. </p>

Well, step is an angular movement for this motor.  We know the amount of tape shifted because we have a value of it from the current value of radius.  We could use that to work out what is the correction. </p>

Well, I would suggest, and I am not sure this is explicitly taught, and I may be reading things across from what the actual printers do, with those caveats, we can work with the current value which we have which enable us to get tension. That current value will not be exactly right but it will be very nearly right.  That will enable us get a value of tension.  If that tension is off our nominal, then we will make a correction by adding some steps.  That will enable us to say, "Well, actually, we should say we made 100 steps, we really should have made 101, and that is telling us the radius is out by one part in 100.  We can use that corrected value for the next stage, run that, and then, if necessary, correct it again."  It is not a circular argument; it is a sequential correction, as the tape drive runs. </p>

What you say in your second report paragraph 3.8.1 -- I don't think you need look at it but if you want to I am happy – is that the bald statement in the patent that changes in spool diameters are monitored by reference to the stepper motors is not a reference to a feedback mechanism.  By implication therefore, all one is left with is some method of dead reckoning based on pulses sent to the stepper motors.  That is right, is it not? </p>

The stepper motors themselves are not able to distinguish between steps, what the source of the instruction for the steps are.  They just know  the number of steps.  If the tension control system adds some more steps, the motor just takes those as ordinary steps. </p>

The skilled reader would appreciate that he could get the current spool radius ratio from the stepping rates of the motors.  The formula assumes that the current ratio is known, and the skilled person would understand that the current stepping ratio would yield the ratio of the diameters. He would understand this would involve looking at an appropriate window and obtaining the ratio of steps taken, and applying this ratio to the formula.  This process would inevitably involve taking account of corrected steps – the motors cannot differentiate the source of steps as Dr McMahon said.   </p>

It is not as if the puzzles about what to measure and how to measure it were the only ones which the skilled person is facing in what is otherwise a perfectly described system.  The system is one which is and will remain a somewhat one-legged one because of the error in the tension formula.  Unless one is luckily operating within a generous tension range there will be failure on this ground alone, let alone with imperfect values of the tension related current. The system will have further errors introduced by temperature variations.  Further burdens are potentially imposed by the suggestion to use the current difference method.  Moreover there are other statements in the patent calculated to mislead rather than assist, such as the statement about motor sizing, which is liable to encourage the team to try motors which would introduce other errors.  There is also the encouragement to use a derivative term which I have held unhelpful as well.  </p>
