	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in;text-indent:0.5in">This is an action for infringement of two patents.  Although the claims are not so limited, both patents are really about cellular mobile telephones of the kind we carry in our pockets.  The first, European Patent (UK) No. 0,629,324 (“324” or “the 324 Patent”), relates to an apparatus for controlling the way in which the mobile telephone reduces power consumption by monitoring a channel for incoming messages intermittently. The second, European Patent (UK) No. 0,695,482 (“482” or “the 482 Patent”), relates to a method and device for the correction and limitation of the transmitted power of a mobile telephone. Both the patents are in the name of Qualcomm Incorporated, a US company and the claimant in the action.  Qualcomm promoted the introduction in some countries of a multiple access terrestrial telephone system known as “CDMA”, of which more later. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in;text-indent:0.5in">The defendant is Nokia Corporation, a Finnish company which is well known as a manufacturer of mobile telephone handsets.  It is accused of contributory infringement of 324, and infringement of 482, by selling those handsets. Nokia denies infringement of both patents, contends that they are both invalid and counterclaims to revoke them.  There are also issues about whether the patents are “essential” to the operation of the relevant standards. In relation to the 324 Patent, Qualcomm seeks a declaration that it is essential, and it is agreed by Nokia that if the patent is valid and infringed, then it is essential.  On the other hand, Nokia seeks a declaration that 482 is essential if it is infringed, whilst Qualcomm says that it is not essential. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">As is often the case, many of the issues which divide the parties to this action are issues of construction of the relevant patent claims.  The correct approach to the construction of a patent specification and its claims is now well settled. The task for the court is to determine what the person skilled in the art would have understood the patentee to have been using the language of the claim to mean: see <span style="font-style:italic">Kirin Amgen v TKT</span> [2005] RPC 9 [30]-[35].

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">One observation of Pumfrey J’s is important here.  The addressee of the specification is the person skilled in the art, equipped with the common general knowledge, no more and no less.  The addressee does not have access to documents which are not part of the common general knowledge.  This may seem trite, but there was a sustained attempt by Nokia in cross examination to make use of Qualcomm’s confidential internal documents (disclosed as relevant to other issues) on the issue of construction.  This is wrong, and counterproductive.  It is easy to explain why this is so.  It is wrong because, if the effect of such an internal document were to force an interpretation different from that which would be arrived at without it, the patent would mean different things to different people.  In particular, it would mean different things in the course of the grant procedure (where there is no disclosure) and in litigation (at least when there is chance disclosure on other issues).  It is wrong because the process of construction is designed to elicit objectively what the patentee’s intention is, not to inquire into his subjective intention.  It is counterproductive because (like file wrappers) it leads to lengthy and irrelevant satellite arguments as to the meaning and effect of other documents, which not everybody has access to or can be bothered to read.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">No doubt the purpose of deploying such documents is that it is thought that the court, once it has seen what the subjective intention of the patentee was, will be reluctant to hold that the skilled person would have understood that he meant something different.  For my part I can say that there is no such reluctance.   If anything, it alerts the tribunal to the fact that, without the document, there may be something to be said for the alternative construction. The same goes for file wrappers, which I noticed had been prepared into court bundles, but were not deployed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">It is often said that a patent specification should be construed without reference to the infringement.  Yet one cannot sensibly identify the point of construction without understanding what it is about the alleged infringement which is said to take it outside the claims.  Pumfrey LJ (sitting at first instance) identified the necessary process in <span style="font-style:italic">Nokia v Interdigital Technology </span></p>

It is important nevertheless that the opportunity thus presented to construe the document with one eye on the infringement must be rejected, as far as possible.  So when the claim calls for A, and the standard requires B, the right question is not whether A means B, or covers B, or might with hindsight be said to be another example of the genus of which B is also a member, but whether in the context of the specification the skilled man would appreciate that A in the claim encompassed B.” </p>

The expert is well able to assist the Court about the impact of different assumptions about the correct legal construction of the claim.  It may be that it is only on one construction of the claim that general technical statements made in the body of the patent about what the invention achieves will hold good.  It is perfectly legitimate for an expert to point that out, and to give a technical explanation of why, if the rival construction is adopted, the claim would extend to embodiments which would not achieve the patent’s technical objective. </p>

In order to conserve bandwidth, the traffic channels available for communication between a base station and mobile telephones within its area must be shared.  The small proportion of the mobile telephones within a base station’s cell at any one time which are actually engaged in calls are each assigned one of the available radio links only for the duration of the call.  When a call is terminated, the radio link previously employed for that call is freed for use by another mobile telephone.  The network must therefore provide mechanisms for assigning radio links to mobile telephones on a call-by-call basis. This is effected by control channels. </p>

In the case of a fixed land-line telephone network, the link from the local exchange to the subscriber’s telephone is a pair of wires and can carry voice signals in two directions.  A radio link can only carry information in one direction – from transmitter to receiver.  Each telephone call therefore requires two radio links – one from base station to mobile telephone (called the downlink<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>or forward link) and one from mobile telephone to base station (called the uplink<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>or reverse link). </p>

To take a simple example, the first time slot, S1, of a repeating frame of 8 time slots could be identified for carrying a particular type of information.  That time slot can be picked out, and considered as a stream of S1 time slots.  That stream is a logical channel.  Logical channels can be “mapped” onto physical channels in a variety of ways.  The concept of a “logical channel” is a very useful one for analysing time division multiplexed signal structures.  For many purposes, one can think of data being transmitted on a logical channel as if it is passing continuously through an entirely distinct “pipe” from the transmitter to the receiver.  In fact, that data is transmitted via the same physical communication channel – a modulated frequency channel – as all other data on other “logical channels”.  The data on a given logical channel is simply transmitted at different times in the time division multiplexed structure to the data in other logical channels.  The use of the “logical channel” concept simplifies design and analysis of a system because it hides the complexity of the underlying timing. </p>

The receiver has active states for receiving messages from the transmitter and inactive states during which it saves power, and during which the transmitter does not send any messages to it. The transmitter sends one or more messages to the receiver during each occurrence of the active state of the receiver. The channel is divided into “a continuous stream of slots”.  The receiver is said to have a slot cycle.  One slot of the slot cycle is the assigned slot of the receiver, during which it wakes up. It goes back to sleep for the rest of the cycle. Steps need to be taken to align the timing of the transmitter and receiver, so that the transmitter transmits during the assigned slot.  It is suggested that this synchronisation may be achieved using a separate pilot channel.   </p>

The processor in the mobile may select an SSI using an algorithm, or it may use a predetermined value (see [0021] at lines 57-58). The receivers in Figure 1 have chosen “1” for the slot cycle index from a range of indices from 1-7.  If the value “0” is chosen, the invention is said to be bypassed, because this will cause the receiver to monitor the channel continuously. The slot cycle is transmitted to the base station during registration of the mobile with the base station, so that the base station is able to access the mobile. </p>

When the mobile sends a message changing the slot cycle, the base station is required to acknowledge that message.  If no acknowledgment is received, then the mobile will default to an SSI of 1.  This means that whatever slot cycle the base station is on, the mobile will hear messages from the base station (because it will listen every 10 slots, and this will always coincide with the slot cycle being used by the base station, which can be every 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320 or 640 slots).

Perhaps more importantly in this particular case, it is important not to take the meaning of “suitable for” too far.  Mr Antony Watson QC, who argued the case on the 324 Patent for Qualcomm with Mr Thomas Hinchliffe, started from the premise that an apparatus did not cease to infringe merely because it was switched off.  So an apparatus for toasting bread infringes whether connected to the mains or not.  He says this is just one example, and there is a general principle that an apparatus is still suitable for performing a particular function if it can be readily modified so as to perform that function.   Mr Silverleaf accepts that a claim will be infringed if all that is required is to supply power.

If the apparatus has to undergo physical modification before it can be used, then <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> it is not suitable for use and does not infringe.  </p>

Thus the prior art referred to in [0002] is CDMA prior art, as the titles of the specifications recited show. The “pilot channel” mentioned as an example in [0012] is a channel characteristic of CDMA.

He was in my judgment right to accept this.  If, in such a system, message information for all mobiles is contained in a particular slot in a real-time frame, then it would be entirely possible to apply the invention as claimed to that system.  The real issue between the parties cannot be decided by asking “does the claim cover TDMA at all?”  The differences between the parties lie at a lower level of generality, namely whether the claims are apt to cover the particular implementation of TDMA which is the subject of the allegation of infringement.  In GSM/GPRS the assigned slots are not at regular intervals in real time.  They are to be found on a logical channel called PPCH, made up of time slots which are irregular (in real time), and do not even occur at regular intervals in the PPCH logical channel.  The first question which falls for decision is the type of periodicity in the assigned slots which the claim is calling for. </p>

I do not agree.  The skilled person would understand from his common general knowledge that complete control cannot be handed over to the mobile: so the claim must extend sufficiently far for the base station to be able to overrule an initial slot cycle selection by the mobile.  Once one approaches the claim with that understanding, there is nothing to indicate what particular additional rôle, if any, the base station plays: the only positive requirement is that the mobile must participate in the calculation of the slot cycle, by sending the index number. </p>

This is DRX on/off.  I cannot see any reason why the particular case where the index number may be 1 or zero would be taken to be excluded.

The document was supplied to the CTIA for a limited purpose, namely for it to evaluate CDMA technology. It was only in that limited context that it was free to make use of the document.  It is undoubtedly the case that the contemplated process of evaluation of the technology carried with it the risk that the information in the CTIA paper might have been further disclosed, so as to make it available to the public.

Most of the energy in a battery pack goes in powering the receiver as it listens for any packets addressed to the unit by the network. Because the mobile is alerted that there is a packet by a down setup message, which is transmitted in a specific slot in each frame, the mobile only has to power up to receive this slot and decode it, and can then switch of until the next frame. This feature on its own permits a significant power saving compared to a conventional portable which must remain switched on all the time to receive messages. </p>

A mobile may register telling the network it is in this mode and the network will inform the mobile of the current length of the a “multiframe”, which is simply a sequence of frames and in which frame of the multiframe the mobile should listen to receive down–setup messages.  The mobile then switches off except for one slot every multiframe, and therefore its power consumption can be decreased even further.  The trade-off made is that packets sent to the mobile will be delayed. </p>

As the length of the multiframe (i.e. how many frames) may not be fixed for all base stations for all time, when this occurs the base station tells the mobile the length of the multiframe.

Thus, on this channel, message information is not transmitted “only” during each assigned slot.  Once this is appreciated, one appreciates also that the mobile is listening “continuously” to DS, in the sense that it listens to every DS slot.  The logical channel formed by picking out all the DS slots is therefore the relevant channel to consider.  The only intermittent channel mode, and the only slot cycle, is therefore in VLDC. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">The first general point is relevant because the value of variable length slot cycles really only arises in the context of data: for voice calls it is not acceptable to build in longer periods of delay before the call is connected. In the case of data, a longer cycle is acceptable: users will not mind if a message takes much longer than a few seconds to get through.  Moreover systems such as GSM do not distinguish between voice and data when they wake the mobile up, so the shorter paging cycle demanded by the voice call is dominant.  Hence the motivation to apply different slot cycles could only arise in the context of data, and would be felt most clearly in the case of a data only device.   </p>

As I explained in my first report, I simply do not agree the position in early 1992 was as simple or straightforward as Prof Eizenhöfer suggests.  The concept of DRX as a battery saving tool was well known. However, the way it was implemented was with the base station dictating the slot cycle to the mobile stations.  The mindset for DRX was that the base station was in control.  </p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.53in;text-indent:0.00in">The reasons for this were as follows.  First, the mobile was technically inferior to the base station because the base station was not power limited.  It had a much more powerful signal processing capacity than the mobile and also knew what was going on in the network and therefore the radio resources it could bring to bear in any situation.  Second, the networks were owned by companies, like Vodafone, Cellnet, etc, who fundamentally wanted the network to have all the control, both technically over the mobiles and commercially over their customers.  So, mobiles could assist the base stations, but never control them.  Third, because of the previous two points, it would not have occurred to the skilled man to have the mobiles have the capability to decide what they wanted.  The base stations decided what was to be done, and the user was obliged to charge their batteries as frequently as required.  Of course the operators did not want the user to charge their batteries more frequently than was necessary, but they looked to the manufacturers of phones to increase the time between battery charges.  Accordingly, the manufacturers sought improvements in battery technology, chip design, and so on.  The operators, obtaining more users, had to decrease the size of their cells and that had a profound improvement on battery life because the mobiles were not having to transmit large distances to their base station.  Finally, the prevailing atmosphere in 1992 was that <span style="text-decoration:underline">all</span> decisions were made by the network in cellular systems. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">I have no doubt that considerations such as these were current in 1992, and that some of them are entitled to some weight in the appropriate context. For example, the first point might have weight depending on what additional processing capability the mobile was expected to undertake; the second might have weight if the only way in which a particular technical advance could be implemented was to incorporate it within an existing commercial network. However, I have to approach obviousness from the perspective of an overall network design. I therefore think that it would be wrong to do so on the basis of a pervasive mindset against allowing a mobile to make certain selections, provided always that this was technically obvious in the light of the prior art.   </p>

The document recognises that as between in-car mobile phones and hand held ones, the importance of battery power saving is different.  In the case of the former there is a substantial reservoir of power in the car battery, whilst in the case of the latter there is not.  Accordingly, the document suggests treating the two types differently as regards the extent to which they listen when idle.  The car phones are referred to as “ungrouped”; the hand held portables as “grouped”.  As can be seen most clearly in Figure 2, reproduced below, the incar mobile stations listen continuously, whilst the mobiles operate DRX and listen only in defined slots.  </p>

In order to obtain the intermittent reception mode, grouped mobiles identify themselves to the base station by sending a signal. Based on the receipt of that signal, the base station determines that the mobile is a grouped and not an ungrouped mobile, and allocates the longer paging cycle.  In my judgment that is adequate to anticipate claim 1 of the granted patent. </p>

I am not sure this really takes Nokia far enough, because it is still necessary to take the further step of allocating a different paging cycle to the formerly in-vehicle mobiles and the grouped ones. In any case it emerged in cross-examination that this thought was based on some very specific knowledge of GSM, which was not established to be common general knowledge. </p>

Implementing NEC, one would come to a conclusion as to the longest time one could expect a caller to wait and would set that as the waiting time.

It is said that the standard provides for a common control channel for packet data called PCCCH, which when implemented, would mean that there would be an infringing combination of phone and network.

The sub-section is concerned and concerned only with whether he knows sufficient facts about what is to be done with the means supplied.  If facts material to the allegation that the means are to be put to infringing use are hidden from him, then he will not infringe.  But if the facts are known or obvious to him in the circumstances, their complexity does not afford a defence. Otherwise, complicated inventions are less well protected than simple ones, which would not be a rational policy.  </p>

The blocks are allocated by the network for use by the Packet Broadcast Control Channel (PBCCH), the Packet Access Grant Channel (PAGCH), the Packet Notification Channel (PNCH) and the Packet Paging Channel (PPCH).  If a network operator decided that there would be one PBCCH block in a multiframe, it goes in block B0. A number of blocks are then allocated to functions other than paging, for example to Access Grant, Packet Notification or packet data transmission. Once this allocation has been made, the remaining blocks are available for paging. The blocks (after Block 0) must be allocated in the order: B6, B3, B9, B1, B7, B4, B10, B2, B8, B5, B11.   </p>

This depends also on how many paging blocks are available in the cell.  As explained above, the approximate number of paging blocks between one paging block and the next depends on SPLIT_PG_CYCLE and on M, which is determined by the base station and can vary from cell to cell and time to time.  Even though the value of SPLIT_PG_CYCLE for a Nokia phone is always 7, this will result in different numbers of paging blocks between paging blocks in the group depending on the parameters set by the base station. Then, the number of blocks or slots between paging blocks in the group will depend on the arrangement of paging blocks in the multiframe, explained above, which is again determined by the base station. </p>

The Gs interface is only the means by which signalling information is provided to the claimed apparatus: it is not part of the claimed apparatus itself.  It points out that the alleged infringing apparatus is the mobile, the Base Transceiver Stations (BTS) and the Base Station Controllers (BSC).  The Gs interface lies outside this. The feature relied on by Nokia is, says Qualcomm, just another functional feature which will be satisfied if connections are made to the claimed apparatus (mobile, BTS, BSC) to make it fulfil that function.  If PCCCH is enabled, the phones, the BTS and BSC will respond automatically and send the index number which is hard wired into their circuits, and thus set their slot cycle. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in;text-indent:0.5in">I have come to the conclusion that Qualcomm is right on this issue.  It is true that the existing system is not one which is in fact operating so that the slot cycle is determined based on an index number provided from a remote station, or implements slotted paging at all.  But the combination of mobile, BTS and BSC are set up to operate in that way.  As soon as the PCCCH channel, for which the standard makes provision, is enabled (by means external to that combination), the combination will function as required by the claim. The relevant apparatus (mobile, BTS and BSC) has not changed.  All that has changed is the manner in which the apparatus is being used.  That is not enough to avoid infringement.   </p>

If the transmit power from the base station was T<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">B </span>and the received power at the mobile was R<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">M</span>, then the attenuation loss is T<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">B</span>-R<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">M</span>.

In traditional analogue circuitry, calibration was usually performed by providing appropriate variable resistors or ‘trimmers’ which could be manually adjusted as part of the production process.  Circuits are often calibrated by measuring their response to a known signal and entering an appropriate adjustment factor (to bring the response into line with specification) into a look-up table stored in an associated memory.

To a mobile one power control signal is very much like another.

The circuit must be capable of responding to such commands, and must generate an internal signal (the closed loop power control signal) in response to them.   So I reject Qualcomm’s submission to the extent that it argues that “closed loop” in the claim has anything other than its usual meaning.  I also reject Nokia’s submission that the claim requires a dedicated circuit.  There is nothing in the claim to require a dedicated closed-loop power control circuit.  If the circuits in the phone will deal with, and process, closed-loop power commands, then this feature of the relevant circuit is present.  </p>

Moreover there is a contrast with claim 3, which requires a power detector for generating the transmit power value, clearly therefore requiring a measurement of transmitted power.

First of all, it is not really satisfactory to piece together a history of this sort from odd bits of evidence in this way.  If the inventor’s history is to be relied on as a secondary indication of non-obviousness, then it should be set out in a comprehensible way in the evidence, in a way that the opposing party knows what case it has to meet. Secondly, such history as has been put together strikes me as no more than routine development work.  The rivalry between CDMA and TDMA does not seem to me to matter: there was a clear and strong incentive to pursue CDMA once it is identified as part of a draft standard. As to what Nokia said about the standard, it cannot be said that this would be a disincentive to seeing how close to the accuracy requirement one would come, given the strong motivation to succeed that existed.  In fact the evidence showed that there was no real difficulty: the “lion in the path” would not deter, far less defeat, the average skilled team.   </p>

If that is not linear enough, you go and linearize it.  I think that is the simplest way.  I think if I spend one day, I could add another 10 permutations of things to that, but this does not take away the one which has finally been chosen.  It is the simplest and most straightforward one, based on the fact, and I think that seems to be the clue for all that, if you come to the decision that you do things digital as much as you can, and I think that is what figure 2 is about, it is really a straightforward approach. </p>

However, the claims in question here simply require that if the power to be transmitted exceeds some maximum, it is to be capped.  If not, the power which has been calculated as the correct power to send can be transmitted.  This seems to be merely to be stating the obvious.

Qualcomm argues that the passage on page 27, which is describing Figure 5, teaches that the <span style="text-decoration:underline">same</span> gain control signal should be used for amplifiers 94 and 102, and explains that this allows the transmitter power to “track” the received signal power.  The earlier passage on page 25, which teaches combining the control signals into a single variable gain amplifier would thus be thought to have no application to the Figure 5 embodiment.    </p>

For example contrasting granted claims 2 and 3, the requirement for a power detector in claim 3 and not in claim 2 suggests that “transmit power value” in claim 2 could be something other than measured power. </p>

The alleged invention, so far as claim 1 is concerned, is a particular method of controlling the power of a mobile transmitter in which a combination of open and closed loop power control is employed.  There is no entitlement to an apparatus claim to the phone alone, unless it can be properly limited to the alleged invention.  In this case, on Qualcomm’s contentions, it is not.  The method of power control used is not determined by the phone.  The claim, according to Qualcomm, covers phones which will never make any use of the alleged inventive method of power control.  It covers phones which will be used purely to implement a power control method which owes nothing to the alleged invention.  Claim 1 is not properly limited to the alleged invention and the specification is ‘Biogen’ insufficient.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">It seems to me that there are a number of  premises in this argument which are incorrect.  Firstly, the invention of claim 1 is not a method at all.  It is an apparatus with a particular capability.  It is inherent in claims of that kind that the apparatus will not always be performing the method of which it is capable.  Secondly, and in consequence, it cannot be right to say that in those circumstances there can be no entitlement on principle to a claim for apparatus.  Depending on the circumstances, it may be appropriate to have a monopoly to all apparatuses which have the capability.  Thirdly, the suggestion that the claim in this case is too broad because it covers phones which will never make use of closed loop power control ignores the fact that the phones are capable of making such use, and is in any case no more than an example of the inevitable consequence of having claims in this form.  Fourthly, there is far more to this claim than the combined used of open and closed loop power control.  It is further limited by features of internal circuitry, such as the requirement for linearisers, which are part of the inventive concept of the claim.  I cannot see why in those circumstances it is inappropriate to claim the circuitry even when not being used in a network which operates open and closed loop power control. </p>

Whilst the standard requires the phone to be capable of using both types of power control, it is silent on how to implement its requirements.  For example it does not specify calibration, far less how calibration is to be achieved.  The evidence also established (see for example document X21) that there were other ways of achieving this objective.  I was not satisfied that these were not technically possible.</p>
