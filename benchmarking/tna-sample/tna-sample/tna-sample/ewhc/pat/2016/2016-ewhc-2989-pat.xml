The allegation of infringement concerns Merck’s product raltegravir, which is marketed under the trade mark Isentress. Raltegravir is an anti-HIV therapy which has been on the market since 2007. Shionogi and GlaxoSmithKline developed an anti-HIV therapy called dolutegravir which has been marketed by Viiv Healthcare (a joint venture between Shionogi, GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer) under the trade mark Tivicay since 2013. It is common ground that dolutegravir does not fall within the claims of the Patent. Both drugs are integrase inhibitors. MSD denies infringement and claims that the Patent should be revoked on the grounds of lack of inventive step, insufficiency and added matter. </p>

Although the earliest claimed priority date is 10 August 2001, and no challenge to priority had been pleaded by MSD, counsel for Shionogi abandoned the claim to priority for the purposes of these proceedings in his opening submissions, thereby avoiding a dispute as to the relevant date(s) of assessment. </p>

The European Patent Office Opposition Division maintained it in amended form for the reasons given in a written decision dated 31 March 2015. That decision is under appeal, and therefore the amendment has been suspended. In the meantime, Shionogi has made an unconditional application to amend the Patent in accordance with the claims maintained by the Opposition Division. In addition, Shionogi has made two conditional applications to amend. </p>

His evidence concerned experimental work that Shionogi did on compounds falling within the claims of the Patent during that four year period, that being the period covered by the parties’ disclosure obligations with respect to validity.

Other molecules of the same oligonucleotides serve as integration targets. Therefore the products of the 3' processing reaction (if it occurs) are joined to the 5' end of a nick made on another oligonucleotide. As many different nucleotide positions can be used as target sites, the resulting strand transfer products are heterogeneous in length. The products of the 3' processing and strand transfer reactions are visualised by autoradiography after separation of the products in denaturing gel electrophoresis. This produces a ladder pattern of strand transfer products of varying lengths. As not all 3' processed substrates become joined to another oligonucleotide, typically a band two nucleotides shorter than the original substrate is also detected after electrophoresis.

In the absence of an effective inhibitor, HIV will kill the cells and the solution will remain yellow. However, if the cells do not die as a result of HIV infection (or cytotoxicity of the test compound), the solution will be blue/purple. The control wells (no HIV, no inhibitor added) should also be blue/purple. The effect of an inhibitor can be seen by the extent to which the HIV infected wells turn purple at different concentrations. MTT/MT4 dye assays can also be used to measure cytotoxicity. </p>

It describes an assay by which the ability of test compounds to inhibit integrase activity has been determined. Utilising the streptavidin-biotin binding system, which is commonly deployed in biochemical assays owing to the extremely high affinity of streptavidin for biotin, biotinylated substrate DNA is bound to a streptavidincoated plate. Into each well target DNA, labelled with digoxygenin, is added, together with integrase, buffer containing Mn<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2+</span> and a test compound. For positive and negative controls, no test compound and no integrase are added, respectively. In the absence of integrase inhibition, the plate-bound substrate DNA will be integrated into the digoxygenin-labelled target DNA by the action of the integrase enzyme, thereby attaching the digoxygenin-labelled target DNA via the plate-bound substrate DNA to the plate. Conversely, in the absence of integrase activity, integration will not occur and the target DNA will not be covalently attached to the substrate DNA. A colorimetric assay in which optical density (OD) is measured is then used to determine levels of immobilised digoxygenin and the resultant OD values converted into IC<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">50</span> values according to the formulae set out at [0440]-[0441].

MSD contends that only 10 of these compounds fall within the claims, whereas Shionogi contends that the 12 compounds highlighted above fall within the claims. Neither side suggests that it matters whether the correct figure is 10 or 12, however, and I will assume that Shionogi is right about this. In each case a single data point is reported. There is no statement as to whether this represents a single experiment or an average of a number of experiments. If it is a mean, no standard deviations are reported. No data from any cellular assay are reported. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">More generally, in my experience too much time is spent by cross-examiners in patent cases on <span style="font-style:italic">ad hominem</span> attacks that are unfair to the witness, unhelpful to the court and waste expensive time. It is, of course, both legitimate and helpful to explore such matters as the witness’ qualifications and experience, and hence the extent to which the witness has relevant expertise and/or is representative of the skilled person; the basis upon which the witness considers that information was or was not common general knowledge (which may include whether the witness has correctly understood the concept); the witness’ approach to issues such as obviousness (which may include whether the witness has fully appreciated the need to avoid hindsight and whether he or she has actually avoided hindsight); and so on. But cross-examiners must refrain from using the fact that the expert has not mentioned something in their report as a stick to beat the witness with unless the cross-examiner has real grounds for suggesting that this reflects on the witness’ impartiality, competence or approach to the issues rather than upon the instructions they have been given. (If the witness has been wrongly instructed, that is, of course, a highly relevant matter, but it is a point for submissions rather than criticism of the witness.) </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">A particular difficulty which often arises in multiple expert cases is the distribution of responsibilities between the experts. As noted above, the law recognises that some patents are addressed to skilled teams rather than skilled individuals. As the label implies, a skilled team is deemed to function as a team. In practice, however, it is extremely difficult for lawyers to instruct multiple experts as a team. The experts will often be busy people with limited availability, and whose schedules frequently do not coincide. Moreover, the steep learning curve for the lawyers in understanding the technical issues pushes them towards compartmentalisation. This means that, all too often, parties give insufficient attention to the interface between the different areas of expertise and between the different members of the expert team. </p>

What will rarely be legitimate or helpful is to criticise a witness for failing to deal with a point which he or she could have dealt with when it has been addressed by another expert, because this is unlikely to have been a decision made by the witnesses. Nor does it become any more legitimate or helpful if the cross-examiner either expressly asks the witness about the point or (more usually) asks the witness a question which leads the witness to bring it up. </p>

In the present case experts on both sides were subjected to cross-examinations parts of which were in my view unfair even disregarding the points I have made above. Counsel for MSD expressed incredulity when Prof Tsantrizos said that she could not remember when she was first instructed and tackled her at some length on a couple of paraphrases of sentences in other reports which, while not completely accurate, were not materially inaccurate. Counsel for Shionogi intervened in the cross-examination to object to this line of questioning. Although it was not necessary for me to rule upon the objection at the time, since counsel for MSD was willing to move on, having considered the matter, I consider that the objection was well founded. Rightly, counsel for MSD did not pursue these criticisms in closing submissions. Counsel for Shionogi asked Prof Debyser a number of questions in the form “Did you consider the toxicity data in Hazuda [2000]?”. I intervened to stop this form of questioning because, apart from the fact that counsel had not taken the witness to the paper when asking the question, the point being put was that there was no toxicity data in it when the question implied that there were. (In fact, as Prof Debyser explained in re-examination, Hazuda 2000 did contain toxicity information; but that is a separate point.) Again, no criticism was made in closing submissions based on these questions.                                      </p>

He graduated from Medical School at KU Leuven and Kulak in 1990. He obtained a PhD from KU Leuven on non-nucleoside inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase in 1994. From 1992 to 1993 he was a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School in Boston, USA. From 1994 to 1997 he undertook speciality training in Laboratory Medicine/Clinical Biology in KU Leuven and University Hospitals Leuven with a focus on Clinical Virology. From 1997 to 1998 he was a post-doctoral Fellow at the Rega Institute in Leuven studying HIV-1 integrase and integrase inhibitors. From 1998 to 2003 he was a post-doctoral fellow working on HIV-1 integrase as a target for antiviral therapy and as a tool for gene therapy with lentiviral vectors. From 2000 to 2006 he taught at Kulak, first as a special guest lecturer on gene transfer and gene therapy (2000-2003), and then as an Associate Professor in Biochemistry (2003-2006). From 2006 to 2011 he was Head of the Division of Molecular Medicine at KU Leuven. He has been a Full Professor at KU Leuven since 2009. Between 1995 and 2010 he mainly focussed on HIV integrase research. Since 2010 he has expanded his focus to include drug discovery and target validation in the fields of HIV, leukaemia and cystic fibrosis.

His discomfort with questions of pharmacokinetics in cross-examination was consistent with this. On the other hand, it is fair to say that the evidence he gave on this topic in crossexamination was somewhat more limited and nuanced than that in his report.        </p>

This criticism is unfair to the witness for three reasons.

Prof Debyser discussed the magnesium/manganese issue in some detail in his first report (at paragraphs 52-56 and 103).

Ther. Patents, </span>12(5), 709-724 (2002) (“Neamati 2002”). Counsel criticised Prof Neamati for failing to mention Neamati 2002 in his reports. This criticism is unfair for three reasons. First, Neamati 2002 was written in early 2002, and published in about May 2002, that is to say, well after the August 2001 date addressed in Prof Neamati’s first report. While the second report also considered the position as at August 2002, it was still mainly focused on August 2001.  </p>

Prior to 2000, no authentic antiviral integrase inhibitor (that is to say, one which achieves antiviral activity by virtue of inhibiting integrase) had been identified. In Debyser 2002, Prof Debyser and his co-authors noted that all of the HIV integrase research up to that date had led to only one series of compounds that selectively inhibit the integration step during HIV replication, namely the diketo acids. (These were the subject of Hazuda 2000, which is discussed below.) On page 7, Prof Debyser and his co-authors considered the question “Why is it so difficult to find selective integrase inhibitors?” They explained that the molecular biology and biochemistry of integration made it a difficult process to target effectively with drugs, and that existing biochemical assays made it difficult, if not impossible, to dissociate activity and toxicity of the compounds.   </p>

A compound which kills the virus, but is also toxic to the host cells, is not meaningfully an antiviral agent. Furthermore, an integrase inhibitor which is toxic is not suitable for use to prevent or treat viral disease. Some degree of toxicity may be acceptable, however, providing it arises at concentrations much greater than those needed for effective antiviral activity. Prof Götte agreed that toxicity testing is not just important, but is essential. Moreover, he agreed that the first indication of toxicity can come in the antiviral assay. As Dr Yoshinaga also confirmed, an EC<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">50</span> greater than the CC<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">50</span>, either measured both in HeLa cells or both in MTT/MT4 assays, indicates that the compound in question is more toxic than it is active. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">More specifically, Prof Debyser explained that assessing toxicity was particularly important when testing for antiviral activity arising from integrase inhibition because it was hypothesised that chelation of a divalent metal ion, probably magnesium, might play an important role in the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Several other physicallyimportant enzymes were known to use magnesium as a co-factor, however. Thus the less specific a candidate compound’s inhibitory activity was to integrase, the greater the risk that it would inhibit other cellular processes and hence give rise to problematic toxicity. </p>

He described three methods: quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) studies; time of addition studies; and resistance selection studies. Prof Götte accepted that validation work was necessary.  He explained that the need for validation work arises because, even if integrase inhibition by a particular compound is observed in an enzymatic assay, and antiviral activity is seen in an antiviral assay, the compound may not have targeted the integration step of HIV. Subject to a small qualification as to the relative usefulness of qPCR as against the other techniques he discussed, Prof Götte agreed with Prof Debyser’s account. </p>

However, there was no indication that the inhibitor co-ordinated with Mg<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2+</span>. Instead, the Mg<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2+</span> ion remained complexed to Asp-64 and Asp-116 and 5-CITEP appeared to be hydrogen-bonded to a number of residues near the active site which were known to be critical for binding to viral DNA (Lys-156, Lys-159 and Gln-148). This led the authors to suggest that the interaction between 5-CITEP and integrase might interfere with the normal binding between the enzyme and substrate DNA. As Prof Neamati, Prof Götte and Prof Tsantrizos agreed, however, Goldgur’s structure was obtained without any viral DNA being bound to the integrase (as it would be <span style="font-style:italic">in vivo</span>), and therefore the knowledge of this structure was known to be of limited use in any attempt to design a candidate drug structure.  </p>

This would be consistent with the medicinal chemist’s common general knowledge derived from Grobler and Pais. </p>

There was a rather odd dispute between Prof Neamati and Prof Tsantrizos in their reports as to the meaning of the term “pharmacophore” to a medicinal chemist. Prof Neamati defined a pharmacophore in his first report as “the three dimensional arrangement of a molecule necessary for its interaction with a biological target”. Prof Tsantrizos criticised this definition in her second report and preferred the following definition given by Patrick, <span style="font-style:italic">An Introduction to Medicinal Chemistry</span> (2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> ed, 2001) at 177-178:  </p>

MSD argues that “non-interfering” cannot simply mean the substituent does not interfere with the integrase inhibitory activity of the compound, both because that would render the word redundant and because the sentence from [0084] quoted in paragraph 61 above suggests that something else is meant. Accordingly, it must mean that the substituent does not reduce the activity of the compound with respect to a compound which lacks that substitution. But in that case, MSD argues, it is unclear what activity is meant not to be inferfered with, against what non-substituted standard the activity of the compound in question is to be compared and what degree of reduction of activity is permitted before a substituent ceases to be “non-interfering”. Furthermore, MSD argues, the non-substituted comparator cannot be the only obvious comparator, namely a compound with a hydrogen substituent because hydrogen is listed among the possible non-interfering substituents. </p>

I do not accept this. In <span style="font-style:italic">Idenix v Gilead</span>, the claims were on their face expressed to be pure compound claims, but it was common ground between the parties that they should be interpreted as claims to compounds with anti-<span style="font-style:italic">Flaviviridae </span>activity (see Kitchin LJ at [116]). I nevertheless concluded that the claims lacked an inventive step because it was not plausible that substantially all of the compounds covered by the claim had anti<span style="font-style:italic">Flaviviridae </span>activity, and that conclusion was upheld by the Court of Appeal. This is because the technical problem which was required plausibly to be solved if the claimed invention was to make a technical contribution to the art was the provision of compounds which had such activity. The identification of a very large class of compounds only some of which had such activity would not make a technical contribution to art, and it made no difference that the claim was limited to the compounds which did have activity.

The first is that MSD was content to argue its case by reference to the Patent, rather than to the Application. As I shall discuss when I come to consider MSD’s added matter objection, formula (I) was defined even more broadly in the Application than in the Patent. It was open to MSD to argue that, if the claimed inventions were only plausible in the light of the disclosure of the Patent and not in the light of the disclosure of the Application, then the Patent must be invalid for added matter. But given the breadth of formula (I) in the Patent, MSD evidently did not feel the need to advance its case in that way. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Secondly, it is Shionogi’s case that substantially all the compounds covered by the claims can be made by the skilled team and assessed for integrase inhibition (and antiviral activity, if necessary) without undue burden.

He accepted that it was open to Shionogi to rely upon this information in the context of insufficiency, however. Counsel for Shionogi did not take issue with the correctness of this analysis as a matter of law. While I am not entirely sure that it is correct, it is convenient to assume that counsel for MSD is right, because that will enable me to make findings upon both bases.       </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Counsel for Shionogi made a number of points about this figure. First, he submitted that it was not open to MSD to rely upon it because counsel for MSD had not put to Shionogi’s witnesses that the claimed inventions lacked plausibility because of the number of compounds falling within the scope of formula (I). This is not MSD’s case, however. Rather, MSD’s case is that the number of compounds failing within the scope of formula (I) provides the context in which the question of plausibility falls to be considered. Moreover, that context was not in dispute between the experts. Prof Neamati set out the estimate in his first report, and Prof Tsantrizos accepted it in paragraph 16 of her second report. Consistently with this, Prof Neamati’s estimate was not challenged in cross-examination. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Secondly, counsel for Shionogi pointed out that many patent claims cover large numbers of products.

This is correct, but for the reasons explained above it does not detract from the proposition that the question of plausibility must be assessed having regard to the number of compounds which fulfil the structural requirements.                   </p>

He submitted that this accorded with the function of the formula, which was to define the key features which were necessary for the compounds to have the desired activity while permitting variation elsewhere in the molecule. In principle, I accept that this is a relevant consideration. Thus MSD was right not to contend that the claims are invalid purely because of the number of compounds covered by the formula. But it remains necessary to consider the extent to which the claim does in fact define a pharmacophore and hence renders the claim plausible. </p>

In MSD’s evidence in chief, however, a number of limitations were identified by MSD’s witnesses, and in particular Prof Debyser. One of the matters to which Prof Debyser drew attention was the lack of any magnesium data (see paragraph 109 above). He also drew attention to the other defects which I shall consider below, such as the absence of statistical information. Shionogi raised no objection when it received MSD’s experts’ reports that they were raising unpleaded points, rather it sought to address the points on their merits. Counsel for Shionogi did not contend in his written closing submissions that it was not open to MSD to rely upon the other defects (although he did so in his oral closing submissions when I queried this). I cannot see any reason why the complaint about the absence of magnesium data should stand in a different position. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Furthermore, there can be no question of Shionogi having been taken by surprise on this question. Prof Götte replied to Prof Debyser’s comments about the absence of magnesium data in paragraph 2.13 of his second report. In paragraphs 132-135 of Shionogi’s opening skeleton argument, counsel for Shionogi noted that “Prof Debyser has a number of criticisms of the data in the Patent” and submitted that the criticisms were unfounded. While the criticisms which were specifically addressed did not include the magnesium point, it was one of Prof Debyser’s criticisms. The point about magnesium was expressly relied upon by MSD in paragraph 71 of MSD’s opening skeleton argument, but no protest was made about this by counsel for Shionogi in his oral opening submissions. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">I turn therefore to consider the various criticisms raised by MSD. The first is the limited number of compounds for which any data at all is reported. There is little dispute about this. I have reproduced Table 1 in paragraph 69 above.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Secondly, MSD points out that in each case a single data point is reported. There is no statement as to whether this represents a single experiment or an average of a number of experiments. If it is a mean, no standard deviations are reported. MSD relies on the evidence of Prof Debyser and Prof Neamati as to the desirability of this information being reported and on the acceptance by Prof Götte that it would have been better if this had been done. Shionogi’s answer to this point is four-fold. First, Shionogi contends that the skilled team would assume that the experiments were competently done and therefore had at least been carried out in duplicate. As Prof Götte accepted, however, the skilled team has no way of knowing whether this was so or not. Secondly, Shionogi says that the skilled team would not regard the absence of standard deviations as significant given that a standard deviation from a sample size of two would not be very meaningful. Thirdly, Shionogi points to certain papers in the field which also appear to report single experiments without statistical analysis. This is a fair point, although the tenor of Prof Debyser’s evidence was that standards had risen over the period leading to August 2002. Fourthly, Shionogi points out that it is clear from the evidence that such results are inherently rather imprecise. (Indeed, Dr Yoshinaga explained that the results could vary two or three-fold.) I accept that, at least for the second and fourth reasons, the skilled team would not be particularly concerned about the absence of information about the number of repetitions (if any) or statistics; but by the same token the skilled team would appreciate that the precise numbers given in Table 1 were not reliable. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Thirdly, MSD points out that, although the experiment included negative and positive controls, it did not include any reference compound. As stated in paragraph 6.11 of the technical primer agreed between the parties (reproduced in paragraph 57 above), albeit in relation to cellular assays, it was best practice to include such a reference compound. Prof Debyser explained that this was because of the problems that had been experienced in the field with false positives – compounds that gave positive results in biochemical assays that were not true integrase inhibitors. Shionogi’s answer to this is to rely on the fact that that there was no reference compound in Hazuda 2000. As Prof Debyser explained, however, the whole reason why Hazuda 2000 was so important was that it provided the first examples of validated authentic integrase inhibitors. Prior to Hazuda 2000, researchers just had to do the best they could. After the publication of those results, however, it was important to compare the activity of any new compound with one that had been established to be an authentic integrase inhibitor. Prof Götte accepted that it would have been better if this had been done, although he considered that it was not absolutely necessary. Strikingly, Dr Yoshinaga’s evidence was that, for the testing underlying the Table 1 data, Shionogi in fact used not one, but two, benchmark compounds (one of which was S-1360) to ensure the validity and accuracy of the assay; but this data is not included in the Patent.           </p>

It does not even state that the integrase was HIV-1 integrase. Prof Götte explained, and Prof Debyser accepted, that it would be possible to use the substrate DNA sequence on page 261 of the specification to work out that it was appropriate for HIV-1 (although Prof Debyser did not know whether the sequence was exclusive to HIV-1). More importantly, however, as Prof Debyser explained, the Patent does not identify the source, type or method of purification of the integrase. In particular, it does not specify whether the integrase was wild-type or a soluble mutant. This was significant because some compounds were active against soluble mutants, but inactive against wild-type integrase. </p>

MSD contends that the skilled team would want to see confirmation of the results using magnesium. A considerable amount of time was spent on this topic at trial, and counsel for Shionogi chose to make it his first point of attack on MSD’s case in his closing submissions.

Accordingly, some researchers would first assay with manganese, since the assay was easier to run. But the prudent approach was to repeat the assay using magnesium for those compounds which gave a positive result with manganese, since magnesium was believed to be the co-factor <span style="font-style:italic">in vivo</span>. Prof Debyser maintained this evidence in cross-examination. It was suggested to him that an experimental protocol using manganese described in Debyser <span style="font-style:italic">et al</span>, “Assays for the Evaluation of HIV-1 integrase inhibitors” in Schein (ed), <span style="font-style:italic">Methods in Molecular Biology, vol 160: Nuclease Methods and Protocols</span>, 139-155 (2001) was inconsistent with his evidence, but he did not accept that and nor do I. Prof Debyser was clear that it was perfectly acceptable to screen for activity using manganese, but that the risk of false positives meant that the results should be confirmed with magnesium. Equally, it was pointed out to Prof Debyser that some of the patent applications referred to in the Patent at [0004] report tests carried out using just manganese, but the answer is the same. Moreover, many of those applications were filed, and/or claimed priority from applications filed, several years before August 2002. As I have already noted, standards were rising in the field over that period.  </p>

He accepted that workers in the field might screen compounds for activity with manganese first, but he considered it essential to carry out a follow-up assay with magnesium on those compounds which were active with manganese because it was well known by August 2002 that results with manganese were unreliable. As noted above, counsel for Shionogi criticised Prof Neamati for raising this point during crossexamination when he had not mentioned it in his written evidence. I do not accept the criticism of the witness for the reasons I have already explained.

This contention was strongly supported by the evidence of Prof Debyser and Prof Neamati. Before expressing my conclusion on this point, however, I need to consider Shionogi’s response to it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The specification does not report any antiviral data, toxicity data or validation work for even a single compound. There is abundant evidence that a compound showing enzymatic activity in a biochemical assay may not show antiviral activity, that a compound which shows antiviral activity may not achieve that activity through integrase inhibition and that a compound which shows antiviral activity may be toxic. As discussed above, by August 2002, a considerable number of promising compounds and classes of compounds had failed for one or other of these reasons. Thus a positive result in a biochemical assay was not sufficient to make a reasonable prediction that that compound would have antiviral activity, still less that it would have antiviral activity due to integrase inhibition and not be toxic. An antiviral assay, toxicity testing and validation work would still be required. Toxicity in particular was difficult to predict. As discussed above, there was little between the virology experts on this. Prof Debyser’s evidence was clear and consistent, and Prof Götte substantially agreed with Prof Debyser’s account in cross-examination. Moreover, the evidence of the medicinal chemists was also consistent with this. </p>

On the contrary, Hazuda 2000 had shown that it was possible to demonstrate that compounds had integrase inhibitory activity and antiviral activity, that one was due to the other and that they did not appear to be unduly toxic (although further toxicity studies would be required). Moreover, Grobler had started the work on building up a structure-activity relationship that would enable predictions to be made about activity.   </p>

Nonetheless, variously formulated claims to pharmaceutical products have been granted under the EPC, all through the years. The patent system takes account of the intrinsic difficulties for a compound to be officially certified as a drug by not requiring an absolute proof that the compound is approved as a drug before it may be claimed as such. The boards of appeal have accepted that for a sufficient disclosure of a therapeutic application, it is not always necessary that results of applying the claimed composition in clinical trials, or at least to animals are reported. Yet, this does not mean that a simple verbal statement in a patent specification that compound X may be used to treat disease Y is enough to ensure sufficiency of disclosure in relation to a claim to a pharmaceutical. It is required that the patent provides some information in the form of, for example, experimental tests, to the avail that the claimed compound has a direct effect on a metabolic mechanism specifically involved in the disease, this mechanism being either known from the prior art or demonstrated in the patent per se. Showing a pharmaceutical effect in vitro may be sufficient if for the skilled person this observed effect directly and unambiguously reflects such a therapeutic application (T 241/95, OJ EPO 2001, 103, point 4.1.2 of the reasons, see also T 158/96 of 28 October 1998, point 3.5.2 of the reasons) or, as decision T 158/96 also put it, if there is a “clear and accepted established relationship” between the shown physiological activities and the disease (loc. cit.). Once this evidence is available from the patent application, then post-published (so-called) expert evidence (if any) may be taken into account, but only to back-up the findings in the patent application in relation to the use of the ingredient as a pharmaceutical, and not to establish sufficiency of disclosure on their own.’”  </p>

Counsel for Shionogi submitted that MSD’s plea of lack of plausibility, which I have set out in paragraph 195 above, was bad in law since the claim was limited to compounds which were suitable for preventing or treating viral disease. I do not accept this submission. As explained above, the mere fact that a claim contains a functional limitation to products which “work” does not avoid the issue. Moreover, the Patent promises at [0009]-[0010], [0232]-[0235] and [0461] that the compounds covered by formula (I) will be suitable for preventing or treating HIV. </p>

On the contrary, Prof Neamati included a very clear “health warning” to the reader at the outset. In his report, Prof Neamati was considering a different question, which was whether the patent applications referred to at [0004] added to the plausibility of the claimed inventions. His opinion was that they did not.

Dr Yoshinaga gave evidence that 11 compounds falling within the claims of the Patent, including a compound with the reference number 210-0249 (B-12-b in the Patent), had been tested in a mouse/MT4 HIV-1 model and gave positive results, but he did not suggest that any of these compounds were progressed further. He also gave evidence that a related compound which fell outside the claims, 210-0319, was progressed to <span style="font-style:italic">in vivo</span> testing in SIV-infected monkeys and gave positive results. It was put to Prof Debyser that certain Shionogi documents showed that 210-0249 had also been progressed into the monkey SIV study, but the context of this question was Prof Debyser’s evidence about impact of human serum albumin (as to which, see below) and the purpose of the test may have been to provide a comparator for 210-0139. This would explain why Dr Yoshinaga said that 201-0139 “advanced furthest in testing”. The compounds which Shionogi ultimately took forward into clinical trials are not within the claims. It progressed other leads in preference to these compounds, and ultimately abandoned the project altogether in favour of dolutegravir. </p>

This work (and similar studies by the same group and others) demonstrated that the halobenzyl group of integrase-inhibitors such as raltegravir and other related compounds fits within a tight pocket within the enzyme’s active site in complex with the viral DNA. As Prof Neamati explained, the halobenzyl group participates in π–π interactions with the penultimate deoxycytidine of the displaced viral DNA.

On the contrary, they represent sub-classes of compounds which Shionogi and Merck’s scientists thought were most likely to have suitable activity. Thus it is no surprise that much of MSD’s disclosure is centred around developing the SAR which ultimately led Merck to raltegravir. Moreover, it is clear from the structures of the tested compounds that they represent microscopic islands of closely-related compounds within the broad ocean of the claims.    </p>

(Three of the 30 that were said to fail on other grounds are also contended to fail for this reason, but it is unnecessary to consider these separately.) In these tests an antiviral cellular assay was repeated in the presence of HS or HSA rather than foetal bovine serum (FBS). As Prof Debyser explained, certain drugs bind to protein in the blood, and that fraction of the drug is therefore taken out of useful circulation. Normally, only the free drug will go to the appropriate active site and exert its pharmacological activity. The free drug concentration in the blood clearly depends upon how much of the drug is bound to protein. An HS/HSA assay measures the effect on a compound’s activity when HS/HSA is added. Where there is a high degree of protein binding, the amount of free, active drug is significantly reduced when the HS/HSA is introduced – and so the measured activity reduces (i.e. the EC<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">50</span> value goes up). </p>

But MSD points out that synthesising such compounds was a time-consuming activity. Prof Tsantrizos gave evidence about a highthroughput screening project at BI in 2004. By that time, she explained, it was possible for a small team of medicinal chemists and technicians to synthesise something like a hundred compounds a week, but only if a year’s tedious work had first been undertaken to establish a suitable modular synthesis. Thus even on this basis, it would take over a year to synthesise a hundred compounds which were structurally sufficiently closely related to be susceptible of modular synthesis. It is clear from the evidence that, in August 2002, it would have taken longer than that, and even longer to synthesise the same number of structurally diverse compounds. Prof Neamati’s estimate was that one medicinal chemist could synthesise about 50 compounds a year provided no difficulties were encountered. Thus a team of three could make 150 compounds in a year.      </p>

It is also more likely than not that some of the compounds that did exhibit integrase inhibitory activity would not exhibit antiviral activity.

It is also more likely than not that some of the compounds that exhibited activity in both assays and were not unduly toxic would fail in validation work.

The board stated that the present deletions did not result in singling out a particular combination of specific meanings, ie any hitherto nor specifically mentioned individual compound or group of compounds, but maintained the remaining subject-matter as a generic group of compounds differing from the original group only by its smaller size. Such a <span style="font-weight:bold">shrinking of the generic group</span> of chemical compounds was not objectionable under Art. 123(2) EPC 1973, since these deletions did not lead to a particular combination of specific meanings of the respective residues which was not disclosed originally or, in other words, did not generate another invention (see also <span style="font-weight:bold">T948/02</span>, which refers in detail to this case law and which did not allow the amendment of a generic chemical formula; see also <span style="font-weight:bold">T659/97, T894/05, T 888/08</span>). </p>

Second, the deletion does not lead to a particular combination of a specific meaning which was not disclosed originally, ie it does not generate another invention, or in other words it merely restricts the required protection but does not provide any technical contribution to the originally disclosed subject-matter.” </p>

Thus the skilled team is not taught anything different about the invention as a result of the limitations. </p>

Accordingly, MSD contends that the second conditional amendment would add matter because it would teach that combination for the first time. In support of this contention, counsel for MSD relied upon the decisions of the Technical Boards of Appeal in T 1374/07 <span style="font-style:italic">Puratos NV/Bread improver </span>(unreported, 13 January 2009) at [2.2] and T 1506/13 <span style="font-style:italic">The Brigham and Women’s Hospital Inc/Markers dermatomyositis polymyositis microarray </span>(unreported, 8 May 2015) at [4] that a selection of two components from one list is equivalent to a selection from two lists. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">I accept this argument. The second conditional amendment does not merely amount to a shrinkage of the coverage of the claim as with the points discussed above. It singles out a specific combination of restrictions on R<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">1</span> and Z<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">1</span>, Z<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span> and Z<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">3 </span>respectively which is not hinted at in the Application. It therefore does teach the skilled team something new about the invention. Moreover, as can be seen from the discussion in paragraph 256 above, this is not an accident: the purpose of the amendment is to exclude compounds which don’t “work”. Accordingly, the second conditional amendment is not permissible in any event.       </p>
