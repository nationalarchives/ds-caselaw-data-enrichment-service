References to the claims of the 417 Patent in this judgment are to the proposed amended form. The 417 Patent claims a dosage regimen for daptomycin of between 3-10 mg/kg administered once every 24 hours, for treating a bacterial infection. It has a first claimed priority date of 25 September 1998 and a second claimed priority date of 24 March 1999. The 417 Patent was filed on 24 September 1999. The 179 and 047 Patents concern purification processes for daptomycin (collectively “the Purity Patents”). They rely upon the same priority documents and their earliest claimed priority date is 20 January 2000.</p>

It would have been preferable to hear the trial of the 417 Patent first, followed shortly afterwards by the trial of the Purity Patents. Generally speaking, three patents with different subject matter are likely to prove too many for a single trial.</p>

US patents with common features to the Purity Patents (although not identical claims) were also held to be invalid over prior art relied on in these proceedings. Those decisions were affirmed on appeal. The Opposition Division of the EPO held that the 417 Patent was not entitled to its first priority date and was invalid for lack of inventive step. The decision of the Opposition Division is under appeal to the Technical Board of Appeal. However, I have heard different evidence and different arguments, and in respect of the US judgments, I am applying a different system of law. Other than passages to which I expressly refer, I have not relied on those decisions.</p>

I do not accept that this meant that Dr Ebert was unable to assist the court in respect of the subject matter of the 417 Patent. On the contrary, he had experience of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies in animal models, including with daptomycin. He had experience of advising clinicians on dosing regimens and at the Meriter Hospital his role as a pharmacist required him to approve or reject antibiotic prescriptions ordered by physicians. He had extensive experience of teaching in the areas of infectious diseases, pharmacotherapy, antibiotic pharmacology and clinical pharmacokinetics. In my judgment he was well qualified to give expert evidence in relation to the 417 Patent, and was measured and fair during his cross-examination.</p>

Cubist alleges that he ought to have referred to a number of papers published between 1992 and 1998 which made reference to abandonment of those trials. I do not accept this criticism of Dr Ebert. He explained at [4.54] and [8.5]-[8.6] of his first report the information that he considered the skilled person would have found out about Lilly's clinical trials at the priority date.

Cubist submits that this evidence was partial, in that it ignored evidence from the Bush and Hanberger papers (referred to below) that there were a range of possible values for the PAE of daptomycin, most of which were substantially below a value of six hours. I do not accept this criticism of Dr Ebert. He exhibited the Bush and Hanberger papers and set out the relevant data.

It is suggested that this was a matter of controversy at the priority date, and that Dr Ebert had unfairly presented only one side of the picture. I reject this criticism of his evidence. As explained in more detail below, I consider that once-daily dosing as an option for aminoglycosides was well established at the priority date and Dr Ebert was entitled to refer to this in support of his conclusions.</p>

Many witnesses can be accused of inconsistency after a sustained period of cross-examination.  Experts have to choose which sections to quote from texts, and it is often suggested that they have not included material passages. I do not consider that Dr Harding was trying to mislead the court in the passages from his evidence to which I have referred. The points made by Mr Meade, however, do have force in relation to the substantive issues to which the relevant evidence was directed, and I shall bear them in mind when considering those issues.</p>

Hospira makes no criticism of Dr Zeckel as a witness. However, it is alleged that, through no fault of his own, he was unable to give the full picture about what happened within Lilly in relation to the decision to cease development of daptomycin. In addition, Hospira alleges that Cubist applied, inadvertently, a wrong approach to its disclosure obligations concerning the Lilly history, on which it had chosen to rely, and that it did not disclose material documents adverse to its case.

Cubist’s answer to obviousness of the 417 Patent rests very heavily on knowledge at the priority date of what it characterised as Lilly’s failed development. Mr Waugh QC, who presented Cubist’s case on the 417 Patent, submitted that it was generally known at the priority date that daptomycin was a drug which had progressed through Phase I and some Phase II trials by the early 1990s, but that it had seen clinical failures at lower doses and toxicity at higher doses. A routine literature search on “daptomycin” would reveal further information about the reasons for Lilly’s failure. According to Cubist, this would put off the skilled team from trying to develop daptomycin further. By 1998 it would know that Lilly, who were world-leading experts in antibiotics, had failed to bring this drug to market some six years earlier. How, then, could it be obvious to the unimaginative skilled team to develop a successful dosage regimen for this same drug with a fair prospect of success?</p>

It was Lilly’s goal to develop daptomycin into a safe and effective drug for the treatment of a wide range of gram-positive cocci infections including skin infections, bacteraemia and endocarditis. However, Lilly had a more specific and narrow goal, namely to develop daptomycin as a treatment for endocarditis caused by <span style="font-style:italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span>, which would be superior in respect of efficacy and toxicity to the “gold standard” drug vancomycin, for the treatment of <span style="font-style:italic">S. aureus </span>endocarditis.

The results of this study showed a clinical cure or improvement in 96.8% of those with skin and soft tissue infections, which was higher than the reaction to the conventional therapy. Also, the dose of 2 mg/kg once every 24 hours had not demonstrated any appreciable side effects attributable to the drug. However, it did not show the efficacy that Lilly wanted to see in patients with bacteraemia and endocarditis.

In the third clinical trial, one volunteer’s CPK levels rose above 20,000 units after 11 days and another’s rose over 10,000 units after six days. According to Dr Zeckel, Lilly was concerned that continuing the trial would put healthy people at risk in that it was known that patients had developed kidney failure with CPK levels of less than 10,000. Moreover, he suggested that Lilly was concerned that any muscle injury caused by daptomycin administered at this dosage regimen would be more serious in vulnerable patients with potentially life-threatening infections.

Hospira was not satisfied with this approach but did not apply to the court to challenge it or to seek specific disclosure. It is true that relevant documents first appeared in the cross-examination bundles prepared by both Hospira and Cubist, and it would have been preferable if both parties had included those documents in their disclosure lists in advance of the trial. It is not appropriate to blame one party for the way in which those documents entered the case. Nor do I consider that either party was prejudiced by the late production of those documents.

They would not know or learn that doses of 2 mg/kg once a day had succeeded in certain infections, including skin and soft tissue; nor that 3 mg/kg twice a day (i.e. a total daily dose of 6 mg/kg) had succeeded in bacteraemia and endocarditis other than <span style="font-style:italic">S. aureus </span>endocarditis with only mild CPK elevations and no clinical symptoms. Dr Harding’s view was that the skilled team would be aware that the Lilly trial at 3 mg/kg per 12 hours had resulted in “therapy limiting toxicity” and more generally of “efficacy and toxicity issues” with daptomycin (Harding (1) [168] and [193]). Cubist’s case, as put to Dr Ebert, was that the skilled team would know or learn from the published literature that daptomycin had not been sufficiently efficacious at lower doses, and that higher doses had caused toxicity issues. I do not accept that this vague and inaccurate perception is a fair reflection of what the skilled team would have learnt from the published literature.

He pointed out that the primary goal with concentration-dependent killers was to achieve a high Cmax, which could be accomplished by administering a sufficiently high dose of the antibiotic. He explained that it does not follow that the high dose is automatically accompanied by an extension of the dosing interval. There are other considerations beyond Cmax, in particular the need to ensure that the drug is efficacious whilst avoiding administration at levels which might cause toxicity.</p>

In general, antibiotics exhibiting a prolonged PAE can be dosed less frequently whilst maintaining adequate bacterial inhibition. In vivo PAEs were not normally measured in humans, so it was necessary to extrapolate from in vitro tests and in vivo animal models to estimate the duration of the in vivo PAE in humans. It was well known that in vitro PAEs were shorter in duration than would actually be found in vivo, as Dr Ebert explained in cross-examination. I accept his evidence. It is supported by Craig, <span style="font-style:italic">Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Parameters: Rationale for Antibacterial Dosing of Mice and Men</span>: Clinical Infectious Diseases (1998) where the author states that “in most cases, in vivo PAEs are longer than in vitro PAEs.”</p>

The only dispute was in relation to the value for PAE.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:0.50in">“Without wishing to be bound by any theory, skeletal muscle effects appear to be related to the duration of time at low plasma concentrations of daptomycin available for repair of subclinical damage to the myofibers. Therefore, the data suggest that the dosing interval is the key determinant of muscle toxicity, rather than just the magnitude of the dose itself. Further, since Cmax and/or AUC were found to be the key pharmacokinetic parameters associated with eradication of infection [refs cited] the pharmacological activity of daptomycin is optimized by once-daily dosing. These results suggest that once-daily dosing can minimize daptomycin muscle toxicity, while potentially optimizing its antimicrobial efficacy (Figure 3).”</p>

Secondly, relying on [8.4] of G 2/98, Cubist submits that when a dosage range is disclosed, there is disclosure of a sub-range within that range.

Traditionally the scope of the right to claim priority from a previous first application had been regarded by the EPO as determined by, and limited to, the extent to which the subject-matter claimed in the later application had been at least implicitly disclosed in the first application. However, in decision T 73/88 <span style="font-style:italic">Snackfood/HOWARD</span> (OJ EPO 1992 557), which had been followed by certain other boards of appeal, priority for a claim had been recognised, even though it contained an additional technical feature which had not been disclosed in the priority application. This was because the board considered that the feature in question was not related to the functional effect, and hence to the character and nature of the invention. Thus, its absence from the disclosure of the priority document did not cause loss of priority, provided that the claim was otherwise in substance in respect of the same invention as that disclosed in the priority document. The Board of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Snackfood/HOWARD</span> held that a technical feature which was an essential feature for the purpose of determining the scope of protection was not necessarily an essential feature for the purpose of determining priority.</p>

Essentially a broad interpretation, which allowed the addition, modification or deletion of “inessential features”, would permit an applicant who had not disclosed an invention in a priority document to claim priority to the detriment of another applicant who had disclosed that same subject matter in a later priority document.

Otherwise, patent protection for selection inventions, in particular in the field of chemistry, could be seriously prejudiced if these criteria were not thoroughly complied with when assessing priority claims in respect of selection inventions.

Rather than being strictly related to the dose level (or the corresponding serum drug level), the degree of muscle damage appears to be related to the time between treatments. Muscle toxicity could be reduced by administering the drug in larger, less frequent doses, rather than small, frequent doses. It is possible that a certain interval between treatments is necessary for the repair of acute muscle damage. This is an unexpected conclusion that would not be anticipated on the basis of prior toxicology data.”</p>

In my judgment, the answer is no. The differences between the dosing ranges and intervals disclosed in the 417 Patent and the first priority document result in a substantively different invention. The first priority document discloses daptomycin at a dose of 2-10 mg/kg administered at intervals between 12 and 24 hours will be efficacious and result in reduced toxicity. The invention of the 417 Patent as proposed to be amended is that the dosing interval must be 24 hours, not 12 hours and the dose must be, at minimum 3 mg/kg, not 2 mg/kg. Differences in the dose used is important to efficacy and toxicity, and, based on the dog studies in the first priority document, differences in the dosing interval are significant to toxicity, as Dr Harding accepted at T7/919/2-921/23.</p>

Therefore, the data suggest that dosing interval had a greater influence on muscle toxicity than did dose itself. Further, studies in animal efficacy models have demonstrated that effectiveness of daptomycin is optimised by once-daily dosing because Cmax was found to be the key pharmacokinetic parameter associated with eradication of infection (J. Leggett et al., ICAAC abstract, 1987). These results suggest that once-daily dosing can minimise muscle toxicity, while optimizing its antimicrobial efficacy.”</p>

The second priority document clearly teaches that that once-daily dosing of daptomycin can minimise muscle toxicity while optimising its antimicrobial efficacy.

Since the Cubist Press Release discloses the claimed dosage regimen of the 417 Patent, and gives to the skilled team a fair expectation that this will be efficacious to treat the infections as the subject of the clinical trials, the suggestion that the skilled team would choose to save its money until it saw the results is irrelevant to technical obviousness. In any event, this argument failed on the facts. Dr Ebert explained that the skilled team would be interested in participating in what had been announced as a multi-centre trial; T8/1156/11-24.

Dr Ebert has shown in Annex 1 to his first report why applying the paediatric equation, which was common general knowledge, results in doses which span 8mg/kg and 10mg/kg, depending on the weight and age of the child. </p>

This was based on information that Dr Kelleher learnt at his time at Cubist and information from Lilly consultants to Cubist who were assisting in the technology transfer. In particular, he explained his understanding that Lilly had developed a method that supplied daptomycin for their investigational new drug (“IND”) application and early phase clinical research. However, he understood that Lilly was unable to develop a purification method that would provide daptomycin at a yield and purity that would be viable for manufacturing. The average reported yield from more than 50 pilots and toxicology/clinical lots was about 1.9%. This approach could be used in a research environment but would not, in Dr Kelleher’s view, result in a suitable manufacturing scale process with acceptable yields.</p>

His understanding was that this not only led to a low yield but only achieved purity of around 90 to 93%. The Lilly processes also resulted in an undesirable number of impurities and compositions that included endotoxins, which could cause fever in patients.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Dr Kelleher then set out initial work at Cubist to manufacture daptomycin for clinical trials by an ACN-based method similar, but not identical, to the methods used by Lilly. He recalled that there were various problems with daptomycin prepared by this method including low yields, high levels of endotoxins, too many impurities and low overall impurity. He discussed his work at Cubist from 1999 when he moved from his consultancy role to become an employee, with the goal of developing a viable manufacturing scale method. Cubist estimated that a viable manufacturing scale method would have to deliver yields of 25% or better with a purity that was greater than that reported by Lilly in their initial IND submissions to the FDA.</p>

Careful control of the decanoic acid feed at less than 50 ppm resulted in higher levels of daptomycin in the fermentation step.</p>

He referred at [45]-[46] to Lilly’s understanding, contained in an extract from a laboratory notebook that he exhibited, that these impurities were in equilibrium with daptomycin. He explained that Dr Baker, a retired Lilly scientist and expert in daptomycin purification, told him that this equilibrium meant that daptomycin was not capable of being purified beyond 93 to 96%. Dr Baker’s view was that the equilibrium caused the purity levels to return to below 93 to 96%, so further purification of daptomycin was not possible.

This view was supported by Dr Baker, who maintained that HIC should be used to purify daptomycin and that Cubist should focus its efforts on optimising the process on the HP-20SS resin. However, Bill Downey, a chromatography specialist who was contracted by Cubist to investigate the daptomycin purification process, disagreed with this approach, as did Dr Kelleher himself. They did not think that HIC alone could lead to the 25% yield that they required and believed that AEC experiments were necessary. </p>

Therefore, Dr Kelleher contacted a company known as Perseptive Biosystems to discuss the possibility of working with them to identify chromatography conditions which would improve the purity of daptomycin.

In summary, Paul Lynch had noted through pH mapping that daptomycin displayed anomalous binding behaviour with an AEC resin. Binding was greater at low pHs. Higher pHs resulted in low resolution, such that closely running impurities could not be separated from daptomycin. Mr Lynch could see that there were broad peaks on the chromatogram at D3/7 p.90. Such peaks showed that there was no clear separation between daptomycin and its similarly structured impurities. He found that at pH 6 and 7, 6M urea dramatically reduced, if not eliminated, this binding and separated daptomycin from its impurities. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Cubist’s more substantial objection goes to the weight that I can attach to the extract from Mr Lynch’s deposition. First, it is said that the extract which I have been shown has been edited by Hospira in that it was taken from a deposition of over 160 pages and is therefore inevitably selective. However, I was not shown any other passages from Mr Lynch’s deposition by Cubist and there was nothing to suggest that the passage which I have cited above was anything other than accurate. Secondly, it is submitted that as Mr Lynch is one of the inventors of the 417 Patent, his views as to whether process steps claimed in that document were standard are subjective and unreliable. Whilst this might be the case, I am unable to reach this conclusion, given that Mr Lynch was not called as a witness by Cubist. Thirdly, Cubist suggests that, had the extract from this deposition been the subject of a Civil Evidence Act Notice, then it would have considered whether to call Mr Lynch as a witness in these proceedings, in order to explain what he said in his deposition. I agree with Cubist that for this reason, the only evidential value of Mr Lynch’s deposition is in the answers that Dr Kelleher gave to the questions asked of him.</p>

In particular, he was asked whether Mr Lynch had told him, when he presented his results in May 1999 that he had done anything non-standard in identifying aggregation as a potential problem and urea as a potential solution. Dr Kelleher did not recall specifically what was discussed at that meeting and made clear that Cubist did not know what Mr Lynch considered standard. Dr Kelleher said at T3/271/14-20:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It was common ground that before embarking upon purification of a compound, it was important to establish from the literature what was known about the target and related compounds.  A literature search at the priority date would reveal a paper by Kirsch et al., 1989, which identified two degradation products of daptomycin as anhydro-daptomycin and a β-asp isomer of daptomycin. The Kirsch paper suggested at p.3 that daptomycin might go into equilibrium with the anhydro-daptomycin and the β isomer. Cubist submits that, having read the Kirsch paper, the skilled team would form the view that the existence of this equilibrium meant that it was not possible to separate daptomycin from anhydro-daptomycin and the β isomer and that this would limit the purity that it was possible to achieve with daptomycin.</p>

First, if the skilled team had formed this view, it would have been an incorrect technical prejudice, because it is common ground, and a fundamental premise of the 179 Patent, that it is possible to separate daptomycin from anhydro-daptomycin and the β isomer.  The existence of any equilibrium does not limit the purity that can be achieved with daptomycin. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Dr Baker explained that the possible existence of an equilibrium would not lead the skilled person to assume that anhydro-daptomycin and the β isomer could not be separated from daptomycin as, in common with Prof Myerson, he considered that whether an equilibrium would be reached would depend upon the conditions and timing of the purification process; T4/434/21-435/10. He also pointed out that if it were the case that as soon as the impurities were separated the equilibrium would start to reform then there would be “a very fundamental problem with daptomycin.” This is not a problem which the 179 Patent solves, as it only makes passing reference to Kirsch et al, and does not describe the equilibrium nor how the invention is said to avoid it; c.f.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, Prof Myerson’s evidence did not support the proposition that reforming of the equilibrium would be a real problem in practice. He explained that once the drug was lyophilised then the solution-based reactions moving towards the reinstatement of the impurities would all stop. He made clear that the drug would be administered in a relatively short time after being made up for intravenous administration to avoid side products from forming; T5/587/11-588/17.

I accept Dr Baker’s evidence that this does not indicate that AEC was entirely unsuitable for the purification of daptomycin, but merely that it did not remove the non-UV impurities. The disclosure of US 843 is that use of the reverse method has succeeded in removing the non-UV impurities. Therefore, the skilled person would understand that this enables other chromatographic steps to be carried out, given that the non-UV impurity problem has been solved.</p>

I consider that the difficulties encountered by Cubist were as a result of views expressed to it by Lilly, which would not have been shared by, or known to, the notional skilled team.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For these reasons, I find that claims 1 and 3 of the 179 Patent are obvious in the light of US 843. I consider that claim 4 is also obvious. Claim 4 includes a particular feed level condition which the skilled person would routinely reach by adjusting fermentation feed conditions to encourage production of daptomycin. This was explained by Dr Baker at T4/443/23-444/18, and I accept his evidence. Given that I have found that claims 1 and 3 lack inventive step, it is conceded by Cubist that claim 5 is invalid. This concession was rightly made, because Prof Myerson explained during his cross-examination that claim 5 added nothing inventive over claims 1 and 3.</p>

This is because the combination of features relied on is created with hindsight knowledge of the claims of the patent, and inventive combinations can often be made to appear obvious after the event.

Fourthly, allegations of obviousness in the light of common general knowledge alone need to be treated with a certain amount of care. They can be favoured by parties attacking the patent because the starting point is not obviously encumbered with inconvenient details of the kind found in documentary disclosures, such as misleading directions or distracting context. It is vitally important to make sure that the whole picture presented by the common general knowledge is considered, and not a partial one.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Giving due weight to this, and other warnings in the case law, I have nonetheless reached the conclusion that claim 1 of the 179 Patent is obvious over the common general knowledge alone. The scope of claim 1 includes the use of Tris (a standard buffer) and urea (a standard agent for use in an AEC column in order to avoid or remove aggregation) in an AEC process (a standard purification process). Since I have found that there is nothing about lipopeptides, or daptomycin, to deter the skilled person from using AEC to purify daptomycin, this is a case where this claim is obvious in the light of common general knowledge.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On the other hand, I do not consider that claim 3 is obvious over common general knowledge alone. My reasons are as follows. First, and in contrast to the case of obviousness over US 843, there is no starting point which would lead the skilled person to the combination of claim 3, by routine improvements. Secondly, I am not satisfied that, without US 843, the skilled team would be able to solve the problem of removal of non-UV impurities (which US 843 has dealt with) by the application of common general knowledge alone. Thirdly, a part of this attack was based on the proposition that claim 3 was a mere collocation of known purification steps. Insofar as this suggests that the order of steps in claim 3 does not matter, I disagree. The order does matter, and affects purification. Fourthly, Hospira’s attack based on common general knowledge relied upon the deposition of Mr Lynch’s evidence, as set out in his deposition. In the absence of a Civil Evidence Act Notice, I have held that the only evidential value of this deposition is the answers that were given by Dr Kelleher when he was cross-examined about it. </p>

I would not reach the same conclusion about the combination claimed in claim 3 based on common general knowledge alone. Since claims 4 and 5 are dependent on claim 3, in my judgment, they are not obvious based on common general knowledge alone.</p>

I agree that when you look at the actual arrangement of the amino acids, it is perhaps counterintuitive. However, we know that it is a biosurfactant.

[0092] gives a little more detail in respect of daptomycin. It discloses that at lower pH (pH 4.0) the CMC of daptomycin is lower than at pH 6 or 7.5. Thus, daptomycin can be encouraged to form micelles by lowering the pH. But again, daptomycin is not presented as a special case, with a particular problem to solve, in contrast to other lipopeptides.</p>

The daptomycin is first formed into micelles by lowering the pH. The solution is then passed through an ultrafiltration membrane. The daptomycin micelles are retained on the filter, but smaller impurities pass through. Then the daptomycin that was retained on the membrane has its pH adjusted upwards to pH 6.5, causing the daptomycin micelles to break apart. The solution is passed through another ultrafiltration step. This time, the daptomycin monomers are able to pass through the filter, but larger impurities are retained on the filter, thereby separating them from the daptomycin. </p>

There is nothing in the 047 Patent which requires micelle formation and disassociation to remove all impurities. On the contrary, example 15 at [0183] applies repeated chromatography steps, in addition to the method claimed in the 047 Patent, to purify daptomycin.

Prof Myerson explained that the first disadvantage of using methanol was that it is toxic so it would have to be removed to a very low level.

However, during cross-examination, Dr Kelleher explained that he had asked for daptomycin to be tested for micelle formation because “we knew it had a hydrophobic structure on it”; T3/279/22-280/2. This reflects the common general knowledge of cyclic lipopeptides as having a hydrophobic ring and hydrophilic tail, and therefore, likely to be biosurfactants. In any event, Dr Kelleher was unaware of Lin &amp; Jiang when he developed the process of the 047 Patent, and his evidence does not provide an answer to obviousness over that prior art.</p>

However, it was and is impossible to make something which fulfils these criteria, because the product of the fermentation process described in the Patents has been shown by Miao et al (2005) not to have the stereochemistry shown in Baltz. Miao shows that the compound produced by way of the fermentation process is a compound with a “D” (or left-handed) asparagine amino acid (“D-Asn”) in the fatty acid fail portion, instead of an L-Asn. It was common ground between the stereochemistry experts that Miao is right and Baltz is wrong.</p>

First, this raises an issue of construction as to what the skilled team would understand “daptomycin” to mean in the context of the Patents. In my judgment, the Patents are not using “daptomycin” to refer to an antibiotic with the exact stereochemical configuration shown in Fig. 1A of Baltz. Rather, they are using the word in a practical sense, simply to refer to the product obtained from the fermentation of Strepomyces roseosporus. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In particular, the Patents specifically state that daptomycin can be derived from the fermentation of Strepomyces roseosporus; e.g. at [0003]; [0046]-[0048]. Baltz also describes daptomycin as a fermentation product, and Baltz is referred to in the Patents as a means of general identification of daptomycin, rather than for its specific stereochemistry. The Patents are not concerned with the stereochemistry of daptomycin and none of them contain a stereochemical formula for daptomycin. This is confirmed by Figure 1 of the Patents, which shows the structure of daptomycin but not its stereochemistry.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, Prof Davies, the stereochemistry expert for Cubist, pointed out that the steps needed to elucidate the stereochemistry of daptomycin at the priority date would have been particularly complex and lengthy, owing to the large number of chiral centres and the total number of possible isomers. He considered that the accuracy to which this could be determined at the priority date would have been low. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In particular, the constitutional (“gross”) structure of daptomycin is shown in EP 179 and 047 and it would be apparent to the skilled reader that there were thirteen chiral centres which could potentially give rise to 213 individual stereoisomers.  An in vitro total synthesis of daptomycin would have been required to obtain any one of the possible stereoisomers, which would have presented a considerable task. It would have been pointless, as the skilled reader is told, and would know, that daptomycin can simply be obtained by fermentation. This indicates that the stereochemistry of daptomycin is a complexity which it is unnecessary for the skilled person to investigate and understand in order to put the teaching of the Patents into practice.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Fourthly, the evidence was that the skilled team would be able to manufacture, isolate and test daptomycin produced by fermentation of Strepomyces roseosporus, as real teams were able to do precisely that, in spite of the mistaken assignment in Fig 1A of Baltz, and before the correction was made by Miao in 2005. Dr Zeckel explained that Lilly had been working with daptomycin since 1985 and the mistaken assignment of the stereochemistry did not stop the work on daptomycin that was carried out post-Baltz and pre-Miao. Daptomycin made before 2005 by fermentation was no different to daptomycin made after 2005 by the same process. After 2005 the understanding of the stereochemistry of the 2Asn had changed, but that made no difference to the ability of skilled persons to produce and isolate daptomycin, and to administer it to patients.</p>

Had I otherwise considered that the Patents were insufficient, I would not have accepted this argument. It led to a dispute of spiralling complexity between the experts, the result of which is that I accept Prof Barrett’s evidence that Debono does not show, with any degree of clarity, that Baltz was wrong. </p>
