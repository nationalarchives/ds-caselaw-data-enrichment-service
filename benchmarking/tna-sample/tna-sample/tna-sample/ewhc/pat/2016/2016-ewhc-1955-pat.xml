	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">An important part of the context in this case relates to the famous drug VIAGRA.  By the relevant priority dates (1999/2000), Pfizer had launched the compound sildenafil citrate under the brand name VIAGRA as a treatment for erectile dysfunction.  It had attracted enormous public attention as well as attention in the pharmaceutical industry.  VIAGRA was first launched in the USA after approval by the FDA in March 1998 so that by the earliest of the various possible priority dates it had been on sale for about a year.  In fact at least in the industry it had attracted attention before launch.  Sildenafil is an inhibitor of an enzyme known as phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5).  That enzyme acts in the corpus cavernosum tissue in the human penis and plays a role in maintaining erections.  It is the inhibition of PDE5 which accounts for sildenafil’s mode of action.  Tadalafil is also an inhibitor of PDE5.  Many of the issues involve considering the thinking of a person skilled in the art aware of sildenafil and considering tadalafil as another possible inhibitor of PDE5.   </p>

Lilly does not agree.  It contends that a dose of tadalafil as low as 5mg and the advantages it provides in terms of efficacy and low side effects were not obvious.  Even if the skilled team embarked on a clinical research project into tadalafil starting from Daugan, they would have no reasonable prospect of success as to the outcome and no reasonable basis for thinking that a 5mg dose would be efficacious at all or would have the benefits it has.

Insofar as claim 19 is dependent on claims 16-18 then, by virtue of the dependencies of those claims, claim 19 will include the features in claims 8-9 (for which the issue is the inevitability of the pharmacokinetics).  That notional claim is not entitled to priority and it stands or falls with claims 8-9.  If one of the two notional claims encompassed by claim 19 is valid and the other invalid, an amendment to the claim dependencies will be needed under s63. </p>

Even if a micronized product was tested, the skilled person would not do so with a sufficient expectation that the test would work to reach the standard for obviousness. </p>

Lilly made the point that Dr Gibson had not set out to find any other examples of the usage of the particular part of the chemical nomenclature which was in issue.  He had never suggested that he had done such an exercise and explained orally that he had not done so because in his opinion the 006 document cross-referenced in the priority document supported the view he had reached.  There is nothing in this as a reason to discount Dr Gibson’s opinions.  His evidence on Chemdraw was said to be “one-sided”. That is not fair.  I will deal with the Chemdraw issue on its merits.

This is similar to the criticism Lilly made of Dr Gibson but more elegantly put.  I agree that Dr Brock appreciated the clinical issues in this case and he could be combative but I did not detect in his oral evidence anything to give me cause to discount his opinions as anything other than his sincerely held views.  The particular points the claimants make: about his views about what Glaxo did or didn’t do, about motivation over Daugan, and the concept of a minimal effective dose are matters I have had in mind at the relevant points in preparing this judgment.  The claimants also submitted that Dr Brock “needed to slip in” something about ranges of maximum doses in cross-examination about his Canadian evidence.

Erectile dysfunction is one form of sexual dysfunction, which can also include ejaculatory and desire issues. The cause may be physiological, psychological or both. Examples of factors that can lead to physiological erectile dysfunction include hypertension, smoking, diabetes, drugs (both prescription and recreational), hormonal disorders, neurological conditions, physical trauma (such as pelvic surgery), Peyronie's disease, dyslipidemia (abnormal lipid levels) and venous leakage. Psychological conditions such as depression, guilt, stress, anxiety and relational discord may also lead to erectile dysfunction.

Tumescence and de-tumescence are caused by changes in blood volume in the corpus cavernosa.  The flow of blood into the penis is controlled by smooth muscle found in the corpus cavernosa and in the arterial vessel walls.  Smooth muscle is also found in many parts of the body including the lungs, the vasculature, the gastrointestinal tract and the uterus.  Relaxation of smooth muscle in the penis allows blood to flow into the corpus cavernosa which swell.  That swelling causes compression of the vessels through which blood would flow out of the penis, causing the penis to be engorged with blood and rigid.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Smooth muscle relaxation leading to an erection results from a cascade or series of highly complex biochemical reactions within the body.  A "first messenger" such as the neurotransmitter nitric oxide (NO) or other hormones may initiate the cascade when released. The first messenger enters the smooth muscle cell or interacts with receptors on the cell surface, triggering an intracellular reaction. Molecules known as "second messengers" mediate the consequent intracellular reactions. In smooth muscle, these second messengers include the cyclic nucleotides, cyclic adenosine-3',5'- monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine-3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP). </p>

NO is ubiquitous in the body, and is responsible for initiating and mediating a large number of physiological reactions.  NO enters smooth muscle cells and binds to guanylate cyclase.  This enzyme catalyses the conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) into the second messenger cGMP. In turn, cGMP binds to and activates an enzyme in the smooth muscle called cGMP-specific protein kinase (PKG) that regulates the activity of other intracellular proteins. The result of such activation of PKG is the relaxation of the smooth muscle cell. </p>

These PDEs catabolise the second messengers by converting both cGMP and cAMP from their cyclic forms into their linear forms, GMP (guanosine-5'-monophosphate) and AMP (adenosine-5'-monophosphate).  GMP and AMP are not agonists of PKG and therefore the activity of the PDEs reduces the overall activation of PKG present in the smooth muscle cell.  Thus, increases in intracellular levels of cGMP (through NO production) promote smooth muscle relaxation, while decreases in intracellular cGMP levels (through hydrolysis by PDEs) result in the smooth muscle returning to its ordinary contracted state. </p>

A number of techniques were known to measure erectile function as at 30 April 1999.  One was the Rigiscan system which was employed in nocturnal penile tumescence testing as well as in the clinical setting to measure erectile response to visual stimuli.

Instead, it employs a self-assessment system whereby patients rate their erectile function over a course of sexual encounters which occur in more natural settings, principally their own homes.  This reduces the influence of other external factors and results in a more realistic situation in which to record erectile function.  The self-assessment is accomplished by the patient answering a questionnaire consisting of 15 questions about their sexual history over the past four weeks.  To each question the patients gives a score of 0 (a negative answer) to 5 (a positive answer).  The IIEF questions are also divided into five separate domains, with scores obtainable for each domain of sexual function.  One of the domains is erectile function (questions 1-5 and 15) with a possible maximum score of 30.  For the purpose of assessing erectile dysfunction, the erectile function domain is key and in particular the answers to questions 3 and 4.  Those questions and the possible answers are: </p>

Since the clinician is the only team member with experience of treating patients, they will have a particular importance when assessing the clinical significance of an effect – whether it is a desired effect or a side effect.  With an eye on questions which will arise in due course, I find that the clinical pharmacologist will take the lead in selecting doses to be tried in the dose ranging study or studies which would follow a successful Phase IIa study, albeit with input from the clinician.

The tests provide pharmacokinetic information and allow an assessment of bioavailability.  Assuming the decision after Phase I is positive the next step is Phase II.  These consist of studies in patients with the disease and consider efficacy as well as safety and tolerability.  The term tolerability has two slightly different meanings.  Used loosely the term just refers to the general severity of side effects.  The term can also refer more precisely to the balance between efficacy and side effects.  So even if a relatively high but safe dose is required for efficacy and that dose produces some side effects, if those side effects amount to an acceptable trade-off for the positive effect of the drug, the dose is tolerable.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Phase II studies generally consist of a Phase IIa “go no-go” study.  “Go no-go” refers to the decisive nature of the test.  Phase IIa studies can also be called Proof of Principle or Proof of Concept studies.  There may be a shade of difference in meaning between these two but it does not matter.  There was a modest dispute about what sort of dose or doses would be chosen for a Phase IIa study.  I find that a Phase IIa study will generally be done at one dose, selected to be high enough to give the drug the best chance of showing a positive effect on the disease albeit not too high to risk serious side effects.   </p>

The range to be tested is chosen to show an effect of dose.  In other words the idea is that the highest dose will show a larger clinical effect than the smallest dose.   Phase IIb studies are conducted in a larger number of patients than Phase IIa.  A small point on statistics came and went in the trial.  Although adding more dose arms to a study does have an effect on the ability of a given study to detect statistical significance of a given dose, that only matters if one is considering pairwise comparisons (placebo vs a single dose).  In dose ranging studies a known way of carrying them out is to test the statistical significance of the dose response itself against placebo.  Doing it that way does not create the same problem.  </p>

An effect may be clinically insignificant in the sense that the effect is too small to be of any real benefit to patients and yet it may be statistically significant in the sense that the statistics of the study allow one to conclude that the effect really is caused by the drug.   </p>

The primary task of the skilled team is to make safe, tolerable and effective medicines.

The contra-interaction with nitrates can be explained by reference to the nitric oxide pathway.  Nitroglycerin is a cardiac medicine which produces a rapid release of NO and causes vasodilation by increasing cGMP levels.

Essentially Lilly sought to emphasise higher doses while the claimants sought to emphasise lower does.  In my judgment the common general knowledge was as follows.  Sildenafil was known to be marketed at doses of 25mg, 50mg and 100mg and it was known that broadly efficacy increased with dose and so did side effects.  Those three doses are the doses a skilled team would focus on albeit, as the claimants established, it was also known that a 10mg dose of sildenafil had been investigated in trials and shown to be efficacious.  A landmark paper was Goldstein (1998) published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  Lilly, supported by Dr Brock, emphasised a particular aspect of Goldstein, in that in one dose escalation study patients could change to a higher or lower dose over time. At the end of the study only 2% were on the 25mg dose while 74% had selected the 100mg dose.  In argument counsel for Lilly placed undue emphasis on this result.  The skilled team would not think that it meant that a 25 mg dose of sildenafil was not effective or worthwhile either clinically or commercially.  The correct way of characterising the thinking of the skilled team is that they would not simply focus on a 25mg sildenafil dose.  They would have all three doses well in mind and would know that the most clinically effective and popular doses were the higher ones. </p>

Paragraph [0024] refers to a dosage form being packaged as an article of manufacture comprising a package insert, a container and a dosage form.  Normally this sort of description in a patent for a pharmaceutical product would not excite any interest but given one of the issues on infringement it is worth drawing attention to.  The package insert is a leaflet which is put inside the box (container) along with the pills (dosage forms).  Paragraph [0025] states that the package insert provides a description of how to administer a pharmaceutical product, along with safety and efficacy data required to allow the physician, pharmacist and patient to make an informed decision regarding the use of the product.  The paragraph also states that the package insert will provide instructions to administer one or more about 1 to 5mg unit dosage forms as needed, up to a maximum total dose of 5mg per day.  Paragraph [0027] refers to what the package insert says about side effects.  </p>

These side effects include facial flushing, vision abnormalities, and a significant decrease in blood pressure, when Compound (I) is administered alone or in combination with organic nitrates. </p>

Dr Brock drew a contrast between the level of side effects which are tolerable to patients concerned with erectile dysfunction as opposed to some other conditions, given that ED is a quality of life issue rather than, for instance, a life threatening disease.  His view was that side effects such as headache, backache, myalgia and flushing have a significant impact on patient tolerability in ED, and therefore the lower incidence of these effects at the claimed doses of 2mg and 5mg would be seen as a real advantage of the lower dose.  I accept that evidence.  </p>

The fact this is required by the regulators does not negate the teaching of the patent that the tendency of PDE associated side effects, including an interaction with nitrates but also facial flushing and vision abnormalities, are reduced with tadalafil.  I find that at the doses claimed tadalafil is not only an effective treatment for erectile dysfunction but does have a reduced tendency to side effects associated with its mode of action as a PDE inhibitor as compared to sildenafil. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Claim 1 claims a pharmaceutical dosage form composition with various characteristics.  It is therefore a claim to a product such as a tablet, liquid or capsule.  I will refer to it as a tablet without limitation.  The individual tablet must comprise 1 to 5 mg of tadalafil.  It must be suitable for oral administration up to a maximum total dose of 5 mg per day.  The requirement of suitability for oral administration causes no difficulty.  It is not clear what effect on the scope of the claim would be understood by the skilled reader to be intended by the inventor by the requirement to be “suitable for” administration up to a maximum daily dose.  “Suitable for” would be understood as conventional language almost always used in patents to refer to an objective characteristic (cf <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Virgin</span> paragraph 15).  The distinction is with something which is “intended for” a particular use.  Notable by its absence is any reference in claim 1 to the clinical indication.  That comes in claims 6 – 9 while claim 10 is a use claim written in the conventional Swiss form.  Given the later claims neither side really focussed on this point about the scope of claim 1.  In my judgment in claim 1 the words “up to a maximum total dose of 5 mg per day” have no effect on the scope of the claim.  The claim is simply to a tadalafil tablet (or other dosage form) suitable to be given orally containing 1 to 5 mg of the drug.  Such a tablet is inherently <span style="font-style:italic">suitable for</span> administration up to a maximum total dose of 5 mg per day.  Whether a doctor prescribes its use in that way is not relevant.  Such a tablet could be administered in that way.  The alternative would be to say that such a tablet can never be suitable for that sort of administration unless one knows how it has been prescribed.  But that is unreal and since the patent includes claims 7-9 and claim 10, the skilled reader would see no reason to interpret claim 1 that way. </p>

Lilly’s case was that if one looked at the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for a tadalafil 5 mg tablet, the fact that dosing of 5mg per day for chronic once daily dosing is approved (see the Actavis 5mg SmPC paragraph 4.2) means that the claim is infringed.  So far so good until one saw that the same paragraph in the SmPC also contemplates higher doses such as 10mg and 20 mg for on demand use, with a maximum dose frequency of once per day.  So the 5 mg tablets are approved for on demand prescription as long as the maximum dose is no more than 10 or 20 mg per day. </p>

The highest dose mentioned in these PILs is 5mg per day.  Consistent with this the leaflet seems to be focussed only on chronic daily dosing of tadalafil for which 5 mg per day is the maximum recommended in the SmPCs above.  I gave leave to allow Lilly to put them before the court even though they came after the evidence.  It did not prejudice the claimants since neither side called any witnesses to address these issues.  The court has been left to make what it can of the documents.  The claimants’ submission was they were the wrong sort of documents since they were aimed at the patient rather than the doctor.  To infringe a use claim or EPC 2000 claim the claimants submitted the focus had to be on what a doctor prescribes and the information provided to the doctor.   </p>

It is true that there are directions in the PIL but absent evidence I do not accept it is as simple as that.  The issue may depend on whether this is a prescription only medicine or whether this is also available from pharmacists over-the-counter (OTC).  No evidence was called about that.  For a prescription medicine the patient is directed by the doctor how to take the drug and so the PIL is not really what tells the patient what to do.  What information informs the doctor?  Absent evidence I would expect it to be more likely to be the SmPC rather than the PIL.

The claim should be given a purposive construction, understanding the inventor’s purpose by reading the patent as a whole.  The invention presented in the patent specification is the discovery that tadalafil can be administered at low doses in a manner which is still clinically effective but also has low adverse side effects.  This is said to be surprising in that the side effects were thought to be concomitant with efficacy of a PDE5 inhibitor.  Doses of 2.5 and 5 mg/day are said to exhibit this property and claim 1 sets the upper limit of the daily dose at 5mg.   </p>

A 10mg daily dose is also fully efficacious and has minimal side effects (paragraph [0074]).  The patent also teaches that doses of 25 mg and above are efficacious albeit that the adverse events must be considered (paragraph [0086]).  The table in paragraph [0085] shows the skilled reader that doses of 25 mg to 100 mg give higher IIEF scores than doses below 25 mg.  The table states these scores are statistically significant (presumably that is a pairwise comparison with placebo rather than a statement that the difference in score between drug treatment arms – see paragraph [0082]).   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I will approach the matter of construction focussing on claim 7 or 10 since they include the clinical indication.  For this purpose the focus is not on the part of the claim concerned with how much drug is in the tablet, it is on dosing.  Subject to the word “maximum”, a skilled reader would understand that what the inventor was using the words of those claims to mean is that the invention is concerned with treating sexual dysfunction by administering a dose of no more than 5mg tadalafil per day to a patient.  Doing this provides the efficacy with minimal side effects provided for in the patent.  Again subject to the word “maximum”, the skilled reader would not think the inventors intended to exclude the idea that higher doses of tadalafil could be administered to patients if the doctor (and clinical regulators) regarded the balance of efficacy and side effects to be acceptable.  Those higher doses would just not be taking advantage of the invention.  So marketing authorisation documents from the regulators which approved doses of 2.5 mg per day or 5mg per day as well as 10 mg per day would not mean that a use in accordance with the invention had not been approved by the regulator.  On the contrary.  It would have been.  Both a dose of 2.5 mg per day and a dose of 5 mg per day would take advantage of the discovery presented by the patent.  </p>

The phrase in both claims is “administration up to a maximum total dose of 5mg <span style="font-style:italic">[…]</span> per day”.  The language is being used to mean that the claim does not purport to cover administration of higher daily doses.  The maximum referred to is the total dose of 5 mg bearing in mind that a doctor may administer “up to” a total dose of 5mg.  So if the regulators only approved 20 mg daily tadalafil then (assuming there is no off-label use) the claim would never be infringed.  But if the regulator approved both 20 mg daily tadalafil and also 5 mg daily tadalafil then the latter use would infringe and the existence of the additional higher approved dose would make no difference.  The claim refers to a population in that sense.  </p>

Administration of tadalafil up to a maximum total dose of 5mg per day is one of the approved dosing regimes provided for by the regulators.  It is not the only one and dosing up to higher maximum total doses which are outside the claims are also approved.  However given the approval of 5mg daily dosing, I find that the use of tadalafil 2.5 mg and 5 mg tablets in accordance with the SmPC would infringe claims 7 and 10.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Turning to the disclosure of the priority document, the first point to note is that it is not focussed on a single compound.  The very first sentence refers to phosphodiesterase inhibitors (plural) and while that might usually be a minor matter, after a passage drawing attention to the significant commercial success of sildenafil but the existence of drawbacks in terms of side effects (the PDE6 point about colour vision, flushing, and the contraindications with organic nitrates), an important passage appears at page 3.  The key thing is to use a “selective PDE5 inhibitor”.  It is a defined term.  The priority document explains that a selective PDE5 inhibitor for oral human use has been obtained through clinical studies and the discovery that a selective PDE5 inhibitor meeting certain criteria allows for effective administration at a dose of 1-20 mg without contraindications, with a reduced tendency for flushing and with insignificant interaction with organic nitrates.  The definition on page 5 corresponds to the criteria on page 3.  A selective PDE5 inhibitor must have a 100 fold differential in the IC<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">50</span> for PDE5 v PDE6, at least 1000 fold differential in IC<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">50</span> for PDE5 v PDE1c and an IC<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">50</span> against PDE5 of less than 10 nM.  Moreover, as the claimants emphasise, the priority document states in terms that selective PDE5 inhibitors “vary significantly in chemical structure and their use in the present invention is not dependent on the chemical structure but rather on the critical parameters outlined herein.”  The critical parameters referred to are the three IC<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">50</span> criteria about potency against PDE5 and selectivity as between PDE5 and PDE6/PDE1c.  Consistent with this, claim 1 in the priority document claims a selective PDE5 inhibitor in a dosage form from 1-20 mg as a product and claim 9 claims the use of such a product to treat sexual dysfunction.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The second issue about the chemical name is a major dispute between the parties.  Lilly, supported by Prof Donohoe, contends the chemical compound named there is the compound now called tadalafil.  The claimants, supported by Dr Gibson, submit the name refers to a different compound which is not tadalafil.  The argument is about what “(6R-trans)” means in this context.  The two rival compounds are stereoisomers.  Only one is tadalafil.  The term “Named Compound” was used at trial to refer to whatever is named by that chemical name.  Putting the debate to one side at this stage, what the priority document has taught here is that the Named Compound has been tested and has an advantage over sildenafil relating to blood pressure and nitrates.  The Named Compound is also “one such inhibitor” which means it is a selective PDE5 inhibitor, i.e. it meets the three IC<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">50</span> criteria.  So the tests on the Named Compound support the hypothesis on which the general teaching of the priority document is based.  </p>

The other possible stereoisomer would have the orientation at 12a swapped over so that the hydrogen there is oriented downwards, in the same orientation as the benzodioxole group.  Drawn as above there would be dashes connecting the hydrogen to position 12a and a heavy wedge connecting 12a to the carbonyl carbon at position 1.  There are in fact two other stereoisomers which would be within the general structure, both of them having the benzodioxole group oriented upwards.  However they are excluded by the term “6R” which, by applying the chemical naming rules, unambiguously identifies the molecule as one with the benzodioxole group pointing downwards and the hydrogen upwards at position 6, as shown.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Dr Gibsons’ opinion was that the correct atom was the carbonyl carbon.  The key to his reasoning is that to work out which substituent at a chiral centre is the one referred to, one applies the Cahn Ingold rules of priority based on atomic number.  Carbon has a higher atomic number and therefore higher priority than hydrogen and so the carbon is the one.  It is the carbonyl carbon at position 1 because what the medicinal chemist would do is apply the cis and trans names as they are applied to monocycles as shown above.  The relevant ring is the pyrido ring which contains both chiral centres.  Applying the rules this way the medicinal chemist would identify the carbonyl carbon at 1 to be trans with respect to the benzodioxole group.  Dr Gibson supported this by reference to the preamble to IUPAC rule E3 which is as follows:  </p>

He was cross-examined on the basis that the examples of the adoption of local rules he relied on were clear whereas the 006 patent says nothing express about a local rule.  While that reduces the force of Prof Donohoe’s point, in my judgment it does not extinguish it.

Therefore that is the atom which must be trans with respect to the benzodioxole group at position 6.

In my judgment there was a minor inconsistency here but it does not significantly undermine the Professor’s evidence.  His point was not that the chemist would think or assume the ring actually was planar.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Some further support for Prof Donohoe’s approach comes from the behaviour of the Chemdraw software package.  In his first report Prof Donohoe explained he had entered the name into Chemdraw and the software had produced the compound which is tadalafil.  In reply Dr Gibson challenged the ability of the form of Chemdraw software available at the priority date to undertake this task. Following this no case was advanced by Lilly that the skilled team would use Chemdraw at the priority date.  However the fact remains that the Chemdraw software does produce the tadalafil structure when presented with the (6R-trans) name.  Lilly’s counsel put this to Dr Gibson in cross-examination on the basis that Chemdraw works by applying the chemical nomenclature rules and so this supported Lilly’s case.  Dr Gibson suggested that perhaps Chemdraw used a look-up table for pre-existing names. Since today the (6R-trans) name is associated with tadalafil, that could explain the behaviour of Chemdraw.  However I find that Chemdraw is not using a look up table but rather has derived the tadalafil structure by applying the chemical nomenclature rules.  That is for two reasons.  First it is consistent with the way Chemdraw is described in its own literature.  Second, as Prof Donohoe showed in his evidence, if the same name is used but with the designation (6R-cis) instead of (6R-trans) Chemdraw produces the (6R-12aS) stereoisomer.  The (6R-cis) name has not been used before and so that cannot be the result of a look up table in Chemdraw.  So Chemdraw’s application of the naming rules is consistent with Prof Donohoe’s opinion and inconsistent with Dr Gibson’s. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Although all five of Compounds 1 to 5 are within the class “selective PDE5 inhibitors” it is striking that Compound 5 is the only one for which actual experimentally derived data is given for all three criteria which the document explains are important.  Data for two criteria are reported in Table 1: the IC<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">50</span> for PDE5 and the ratio PED6/PDE5, but the third criterion is the ratio for PDE5 vs PDE1c.  It is common ground that based on Table 1, Compound 5 would be of particular interest.   Compound 5 is reported to have a ratio of 4000 in the text after Table 1 but no other statement is made for Compounds 1 to 4.  The reader would infer there must be at least a 1000 fold differential for each otherwise they would not be “selective PDE5 inhibitors” but that is all.  The fact that Compound 5 is tested in Example 5 also adds to the emphasis placed on it.   </p>

The sentence appears to refer to a single compound but the definition is actually a class.  In any event the only compound in the class as written which is in Table 1 is Compound 4.  That is due to the defined substituents R<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">1</span> and R<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">3</span>.  However, the data in that table do not indicate that Compound 4 is especially preferred.   On the contrary.  Compound 4 is one of the two least potent inhibitors of PDE5 in the table and one of the two least selective inhibitors for PDE6 with a PDE6/PDE5 ratio of 146.  So by the criteria which characterise a selective PDE5 inhibitor in Table 1, singling out Compound 4 is very odd.  In the abstract the idea that Compound 4 might be a compound which the inventors especially preferred for some other reason would not be odd at all.  What is peculiar is the statement that it is the data in Table 1 which indicate that such a compound is especially preferred.  So the skilled reader will see that there is something wrong somewhere.   </p>

Although other compounds and classes of compounds are discussed, emphasis seems to be placed on two particular compounds.  One is Compound 5.  This is the only one for which experimentally derived results for all three criteria are reported.  Compound 5 has been tested in patients (Example 5) and found to be fully efficacious with minimal side effects in doses from 5 to 20 mg.  But no stereochemistry is defined for Compound 5 even though the skilled reader would assume that a particular stereoisomer was being discussed.  Based on Table 1, Compound 5 has the highest PDE6/PDE5 selectivity ratio (Table 1) and high potency against PDE5 (2.5nM).  The other is the Named Compound/Compound 4.  This is a “selective PDE5 inhibitor” as defined.  It has a higher PDE6/PDE5 selectivity ratio than sildenafil (compare priority document p2 ln15).  It has been tested in Example 4 in healthy volunteers and found to have minimal effect on blood pressure in conjunction with nitrates.  Its stereochemistry is defined.  </p>

Swapping them back again allows the sentence after Table 2 to make sense because the compound in Table 2 which the sentence referred to would now be Compound 5 and the data in Table 1 does indeed indicate that Compound 5 is especially preferred.  As a consequence the compound called Compound 5 would also be the Named Compound (i.e. tadalafil).  And so Example 5 would also be a test of tadalafil as well as Example 4. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">A second aspect was his view about the relevance of the link between the 006 patent and the priority document to this aspect of the matter.  This has two elements.  The first element was the fact that a compound I will call “Compound 5 (R<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">3</span>=methyl)”, in other words the compound which Table 2 as drawn identifies as Compound 5, is not specifically identified in the 006 patent.  That is true but not very significant.  All the compounds 1 to 5 are within what is disclosed in the 006 patent.  The skilled reader reading the priority document would assume all five compounds had been made since IC<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">50</span> vales for each are reported.  If the Compound 5 (R<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">3</span>=methyl) compound really should be called Compound 4, which is Lilly’s case, it is still a compound within the 006 patent which the priority document teaches has been made and tested albeit the 006 patent does not specifically identify it.   The reference on p9 ln30 to compounds being “readily identified” from the 006 patent does not help nor does the fact that tadalafil is a specific compound described in the 006 patent and on which emphasis is placed there.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The second element in the argument about 006 is that Example 1 of the priority document states (p28 ln18-19) that “compound” (unnamed) was prepared as described in the 006 patent.  However the priority document is unspecific.  The 006 patent describes general synthetic approaches for the class of compounds described and sets out a specific synthetic scheme for the compound now known as tadalafil.  In my judgment this has no significant bearing on the question of whether a skilled reader who had realised there was something wrong somewhere in the priority document would decide that two rows on Table 2 had been swapped.   If the Named Compound (tadalafil) is Compound 4 so that the Compound 5(R<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">3</span>=methyl) compound is a different chemical entity then the 006 patent provides a worked example of how to make Compound 4 and a general teaching which includes Compound 5.  That is not inconsistent with what is stated in the priority document.  Dr Gibson did not think it was surprising that a compound which looked promising in the priority document was not specifically identified in the earlier 006 patent.  I accept Dr Gibson’s view on that.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">A third aspect of Prof Donohoe’s reasoning is that no stereochemistry is given for Compound 5(R<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">3</span>=methyl) even though it has been tested in Example 5.  I agree that the skilled reader would be conscious of this.  They would wish to have been told what it was.  But this cannot be taken too far.  It would not be the only way in which the priority document is unforthcoming in its disclosure.  The first three examples are entirely unspecific.

I do not agree.  One of the reasons the Professor gave for this in his report (paragraph 6.26) was that the priority document only gives PDE1c data for Compound 5.  But he accepted that all five compounds meet all three criteria including the PDE1c criterion.  The cross-examination sought to undermine the weight to be given to that reason and in my judgment Prof Donohoe’s answer accepted that it did.   </p>

A small but not trivial point is that in the clinical studies each example uses a different name for the drug being tested.  Example 4 tests “Study drug” while Example 5 tests “Compound 5”.  If they were the same drug, one might have expected them to be given the same name.  In the end the skilled reader would be left in real doubt as to what the correction was.  They are all realistic and the advantage of option (i) is not strong enough to rule out the others.  Accordingly, I find that the priority document does not disclose that Compound 5 is tadalafil.

Or arguing in a different way, the first sentence only referred to a total dose of 20 mg as a maximum across a population (returning to the issue of construction).  So if a doctor gave one patient (say) 3 mg per day, another 15 mg per day and a third 20 mg per day the doctor would still be working within the first sentence because the global maximum there was still 20 mg per day.  Whereas in the second sentence when it teaches “administer 5 to 15 mg/day”, that language excludes a total dose of 3 mg per day because it does not say “up to”.  It says the dose <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">is</span> 5 to 15 mg/day (my emphasis).   Thus a claim to “up to … 5 mg per day” is not supported.  </p>

In other words, the skilled person would understand the document to mean that the dosage forms could be administered up to a total dose of 20 mg per day or preferably that that total dose is 5 to 20 mg per day, or more preferably it is 5 to 15 mg per day.  The most preferable approach is to administer a total dose of 10 mg per day by using a 10 mg dosage form.  Thus a total daily dose of 5mg is disclosed and so is the idea of dosing up to a total of 20mg/day.  A skilled reader is not given new information when they are told (by claim 1 as granted) to use dosing up to a maximum total dose of 5mg per day.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Turning to the dose in a dosage form, the argument boils down to whether the claimed sub-range of 1-5mg dose in a dosage form is disclosed by the broad range of 1 - 20mg in the first sentence coupled with the other statements in the priority document.  In my judgment it is.  The skilled reader would see that the idea of a dosage form which contained any dose from 1 mg to 20 mg is expressly contemplated.  The document also contemplates administering one or more dosage forms up to a total dose of 20 mg per day in the first sentence of the quoted passage.  Therefore the idea that the total dose in a day may be given by delivering multiple tablets is expressed.  The document also contemplates administering less than 20 mg to a patient in a day, in the second sentence.  For any dose less than 20 mg per day, the dosage form necessarily will have to have less than 20 mg in it too.  The idea of administering a total dose of 5 mg per day is also expressly described as the bottom of two subranges in the second sentence.  Clearly to administer 5 mg per day would require one tablet with a 5 mg dose, or two tablets with 2.5 mg or even five 1 </p>

The answer to that is that the sentence bridging the pages refers to “one or more” dosage form being administered up to the total dose and so the idea of using one tablet to administer any total dose expressly identified is disclosed.  Claim 8 of the priority document also mentions a 5 mg dose per tablet.  </p>

Although there had been arguments about the scope of what was in issue in these proceedings, in my judgment given the complexity of the combinations of issues in this case, it needs to be addressed now that the issues have fallen in the way they have.  It is also the case that there was no evidence expressly directed to this point but the evidence from both sides did range over the issues necessary to educate the court in order to deal with it.  Lilly’s submission in closing (p1330-1331) was that there was no need for Example 5 to relate to tadalafil in order to support these claims.  The effects were plausible given what was said about selectivity in the priority document even if Example 5 is not tadalafil.

The priority document makes what is claimed plausible because the document provides data showing that tadalafil (Compound 4) is a PDE5 inhibitor and since, as the skilled reader would know but the document explains anyway, sildenafil works to treat this disease by being a PDE5 inhibitor, the basic effect is plausible.  The idea that tadalafil would produce efficacy at the doses claimed with minimal side effects is also plausible because the document expressly discloses the doses, sets out a rationale that this effect is due to being a “selective PDE5 inhibitor” based on the three criteria, and explains that tadalafil is a selective PDE5 inhibitor.  The claimants did not suggest that the rationale was not credible.  The rationale is also supported by Examples 4 and 5.  Although Example 5 is not clearly tadalafil, it nevertheless supports the teaching that a selective PDE5 inhibitor based on the three criteria would have the desired effect.  If one compound with the desired property does this then it is credible that another will, albeit no doubt tests will be needed.  Example 4 supports the general rationale albeit since it is for 10mg tadalafil rather than a 5 mg dose it cannot directly support the claims.  Overall in my judgment the use claims are supported by what is disclosed in the priority document and so all the claims (bar claims 2 and 12) maintain priority.  </p>

That is clearly and unambiguously disclosed.  The argument is about the references to dosage forms of 1-5 mg and administration up to a maximum total dose of 5mg per day.  The application contains more examples than the priority document, including examples of dosing up to 100 mg, but nevertheless on page 8 of the application the same text about dosing is present as appears in the priority document at pages 6-7.  Nothing in the extra material in the application undermines a conclusion that if, as I have held, the claims are supported by that passage in the priority document then they are also supported by the application.  Accordingly there is no added matter in the claims.  That includes claims 2 and 12 since, unlike the priority document, the application does expressly disclose a 2.5 mg tablet (e.g. claim 4). </p>

The argument in favour is that effectively implicitly new information is taught in the patent.

The relevant applications for s2(3)/Art 54(3) would be the designations for a European patent (UK) and a UK national patent.  Both are included in this PCT.  The applicants for those applications are Merck &amp; Co. Inc. and Ms Waldstreicher.  Since Ms Waldstreicher is named as one of the inventors, prima facie her claim to legal priority is strong.  Merck’s claim to legal priority is likely to be on the basis that they derive title from Ms Stoner.  When the applicant is a major international pharmaceutical company, the court is entitled to take notice of the fact that organisations of that kind have professional patent departments, part of whose function is to ensure that these sorts of formalities are complied with correctly.  The same would be true if the applicant was professionally represented.  The fact that Merck’s patent department (whose existence is mentioned on the cover sheet of the priority document) has gone to the trouble of carefully distinguishing between Ms Stoner and Ms Waldstriecher on the face of the PCT supports the inference that someone has taken care about the formalities. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I turn to the question whether Stoner deprives the claims of novelty.  Stoner is concerned with a combination therapy for treating erectile dysfunction.  The combination is of a cGMP PDE specific inhibitor such as a PDE5 inhibitor such as sildenafil or tadalafil (named IC-351 in Stoner) together with an alphaadrenergic receptor antagonist (such as melanotan-II).  The alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonists are centrally acting drugs which have been found to initiate erections in men with psychogenic erectile dysfunction.   A very wide range of unit dosage forms are disclosed, ranging from 0.01 to 500 mg of each active ingredient (p14 ln12-17) and a wide range of dosage levels are disclosed from between 0.001 to 50 mg/kg per day.  These wide ranges include the unit dosage forms and daily dosages claimed in the claims of 181.  Although clearly Stoner discloses a much wider range of drugs than tadalafil, and a much wider range of dosage forms and daily dosages than are claimed in 181, if Stoner was concerned only with monotherapy with a cGMP PDE specific inhibitor then I would find that the claims were anticipated.  That would include the use claims.  Although there is no data in Stoner to indicate efficacy, Stoner clearly asserts (i.e. discloses) that the inhibitors at those doses are effective.  The fact that Mr Muirhead accepted that to find out which doses would work would require a clinical trial is not the issue.  The disclosure will be enabling if the assertion is plausible.  It is also true that, as Lilly points out, there are no data in Stoner indicating efficacy.  Lilly then argues that accordingly the skilled clinician cannot learn anything about tadalafil’s efficacy for erectile dysfunction.  I do not accept that.  Stoner describes the clinical approval given to VIAGRA (sildenafil) and makes the point that tadalafil has the same mode of action.   Based on this information tadalafil’s efficacy is plausible.   It is also true that there is no data showing which particular doses would be effective as monotherapy.  However the claimed dosage forms and daily dosages are disclosed and there is no suggestion of a selection invention here.  So if Stoner was monotherapy (which it is not) then it would anticipate. </p>

Dr Brock’s evidence was that the combination with the centrally acting agents drug made a significant difference.  He thought the synergistic therapy discussed in Stoner was problematic and said in cross-examination that “all bets are off”.  Dr Brock also said that the skilled person reading Stoner would not believe that it disclosed increased efficacy from the combination, that the skilled person would understand that centrally acting agents have a very intolerable sideeffect profile and that the combination may actually negate any positive benefit of the peripherally acting PDE5.

In my judgment it does not because although it asserts that the various doses are efficacious, Dr Brock’s evidence shows that there is no basis for concluding that the particular combination of tadalafil at the relevant doses together with a centrally acting alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist will have efficacy.  There is nothing which makes it credible (plausible) that such a combination will work. </p>

Both of those are features of claim 7.  Nothing turns on the dose in the tablet.

That sort of programme would be very costly and time consuming but that does not make it anything other than routine.  No inventive effort would be required for the programme to succeed in establishing tadalafil as a safe, tolerable and effective treatment for male erectile dysfunction.  In the course of that programme a 5mg daily dose would be one of the doses used in patients.  The programme would reveal the invention.  It would reveal that a 5 mg daily dose is a safe, tolerable and effective treatment for male erectile dysfunction. So the claim lacks inventive step.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The application of patent law to pharmaceutical research seeks to strike a balance.  When a molecule is discovered and characterised a patent application like Daugan can be filed.  It discloses the molecule and discloses (i.e. asserts) that it will be useful to treat a disease.  The assertion is usually based on some rationale (PDE5 inhibition for erectile dysfunction) maybe with <span style="font-style:italic">in vitro</span> data.  At that stage the scientists do not know that the particular drug will be safe and effective but they have rational reasons for thinking/hoping that it will.  The compound is new and can be claimed as such but in a normal case that claim will only involve an inventive step based on its ability to treat the disease.  A new molecule with no function is not an invention. The patent may contain a Swiss style use claim to using the molecule to treat the disease.  For either claim the patent does not have to contain data proving it actually does work in patients as a safe and effective medicine.  The patent system in general is designed to reward and create incentives for inventions.  The patent system as it applies to medicines is calibrated to allow the inventors to file their application early so that they can invest in the costly and uncertain clinical research programmes of the kind counsel for Lilly is referring to.  A patent like Daugan (assuming it is granted) would give the inventors a 20 year monopoly which will cover the period during which that clinical research is done and regulatory data gathered, all at enormous cost, and still leave time at the end to sell the successful drug and earn enough money to create the necessary incentive.  The income has to pay for research not only into the successful drugs but also the unsuccessful drugs.  The system of Supplementary Protection Certificates allows for a term of such a patent to be extended if the drug did not get a marketing authorisation within a certain period in order to try and ensure that the incentive still exists.  There is an SPC for tadalafil.  Whether it is based on a patent derived from Daugan or another similar patent is not relevant.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The problem with Lilly’s logic is that taken at the level at which it is pitched it would make a claim to the use of tadalafil to treat erectile dysfunction using any daily dose non-obvious over Daugan, or at least any dose other than 50 mg.  That is because it is undeniable that to find out if Daugan’s assertions are true would require the very same costly uncertain research programme, a programme with numerous steps from pre-clinical to multi-phase clinical studies and beyond.  For all the skilled person knows reading Daugan, a 50mg tablet given as a daily single dose for erectile dysfunction actually might not work.  It may turn out not to be safe and effective for all kinds of reasons: dose, bioavailability, side effects etc.  Daugan asserts it will work but the skilled team would not take Daugan’s word for it.  There is no clinical data in Daugan, no doubt for the reasons I have already explained about how patent law is calibrated.  However the inventors of a drug cannot get an early patent on that drug based on its likely therapeutic properties but without clinical data in the patent because the law permits that in order to allow the clinical trials to be funded, and then get another later patent covering in effect the same subject matter simply based on the results of those very clinical trials predicted in the first patent.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Lilly contends that the claimants’ case is one of “obvious to try” and that this can only lead to invalidity if the skilled person has a fair prospect of success.  Lilly contends that all that can be said over Daugan is that one might embark on a clinical research programme hoping to succeed, but that is not enough.  It cannot be said (says Lilly) that considering a skilled team at the start of the project and given Daugan, that this team would think it was obvious to try 5mg/day of tadalafil with any prospect that it would work.  Even if the drug turns out to be safe and effective at a dose like 50 mg (and you never can say until you test it) Lilly argues you cannot say that a low dose like 5 mg would be likely to work.  Lilly developed this argument further near the end of the closing speeches and submitted that for the claim to be invalid, what would have to be obvious to a skilled team is not just that a 5mg/day dose would work in the sense of being safe and effective but that it would have the particular beneficial and surprising properties described in the patent of efficacy coupled with minimal PDE5 related side effects.   The point was illustrated by reference to the EPO’s problem/solution approach applied to the facts of this case.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This approach is nearer the mark but it is not quite right either.  In the end the test for obviousness is “a single and relatively simple question of fact” (<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">MedImmune</span> Paragraph 94) and “whether a route is obvious to try is only one of many considerations which it may be appropriate for the court to take into account” (<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">MedImmune</span> Paragraph 92).  This way of advancing Lilly’s case avoids facing up to a key part of the claimants argument which is relied on, leaving to one side the claimants’ case that 5mg is directly obvious anyway.  This is the Claimants submission that while you may not have had any particular reason <span style="font-style:italic">a priori</span> to think 5mg would or would not work, it was obvious that assuming the drug works at all, as Daugan teaches, there would be a dose level which is the lowest dose level at which it works, i.e. the minimum effective dose.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In my judgment the claimants are correct in two respects.  First, if it is obvious always to seek the lowest effective dose and if finding that that dose is 5mg/day or less does not involve an inventive step, then the fact that the skilled team could not have said at the start that 5mg/day would be effective does not turn 5mg/day into an invention.  Second, if the first point is true, then the fact that 5mg happens to have a surprising beneficial property (low PDE related side effects) which would not have been predicted, does not turn it into an invention either.  This first point shows one has to take care with a formulation of the legal question which just asks what the prospects of success of 5mg are over Daugan, and the second point shows that care is needed with a legal question which brings in the surprising beneficial properties of the 5mg dose described in the patent.  The properties may turn out to be a bonus.   </p>

Dr Brock’s evidence was that he did not believe Daugan alone would have given the skilled team sufficient impetus to develop tadalafil.  Mr Muirhead’s evidence was to the contrary.  He thought a skilled team would be interested in developing the compounds in Daugan for erectile dysfunction.  I find it would be entirely obvious for a skilled team given Daugan to set out taking tadalafil forward into a routine pre-clinical and clinical trial programme as an oral treatment for male erectile dysfunction at the priority date.  The statements in Daugan are quite sufficient to make it obvious to do this but the huge success of sildenafil, an oral PDE5 inhibitor, makes it very obvious.  Tadalafil would be an attractive potential second in class medicine to develop.  Daugan teaches that tadalafil has a promising IC<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">50</span> vs PDE5.  It is more potent than sildenafil (with an IC<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">50</span> of about 3 or 3.9 nM).  The skilled team would understand the limitation of <span style="font-style:italic">in vitro</span> IC<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">50</span> data and would know that there could be all sorts of factors such as bioavailabilty and tissue compartmentalisation which might limit its clinical utility but that would not deter the team from embarking on such a programme.  The fact that tadalafil is one of two compounds singled out in Daugan is not significant either.  Neither would the skilled team be deterred by the thought that the holders of Daugan, Glaxo, do not by 1999 appear to have taken tadalafil forward.  There could be any number of reasons why that might be so.   </p>

I find that the test at this stage would be on demand because sildenafil was approved for on demand use.  As for the dose I find that 50mg would be adopted.

The skilled clinician would not select a dose as low as 10 mg because as compared to the 10 mg doses the 50mg dose demonstrated significantly higher drug concentrations, making efficacy more likely.

Dr Saoud did not agree with this logic and gave his reasons in his second report.  The simple point was that the difference in potency of about 2 fold did not justify a 3-5 fold reduction in dose.  The skilled team’s view of the potency (IC<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">50</span>) for tadalafil against PDE5 could be 2 nM or 2.5 nM.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The logic of the three factors point works this way.  The ratio of molecular weights means that a 25mg mass of sildenafil has the same number of molecules as about a 20 mg mass of tadalafil, which is true.  Then assuming that tadalafil has roughly double the potency of sildenafil, you get the same inhibitory effect with half the number of molecules of tadalafil as sildenafil, so that takes you to 10mg tadalafil.  Then assuming chronic daily dosing, one can consider the accumulation ratio for tadalafil which for 10mg dose is 1.96 (i.e. about 2) and so on daily dosing you get to the conclusion that a 5mg daily dose of tadalafil is equivalent to a 25 mg dose of sildenafil.  Mr Muirhead did not advance this three factors theory in evidence so the only evidence for it is Dr Saoud answers in his oral evidence. The claimants’ closing submissions set out a passage of transcript at T5/637/6 – 640/3.  Dr Saoud’s broadly accepted the logic, using words like “rough and ready” and his answer at the end of this passage to the question about equivalence was “using this kind of exercise, yes”.  However stopping the quotation at p640/3 gives a wrong impression of Dr Saoud’s evidence.  In his very next answer and what followed, Dr Saoud explained that a skilled person would understand that the rough and ready effect of those three factors would indeed be as discussed but his firm view was that the skilled person would not take that approach.  Moreover when it was suggested that the skilled person only had those three factors to go on, Dr Saoud agreed that they were obvious factors but disagreed that they were the only ones.  He said there were many other factors, mentioning properties of sildenafil such as concentration, Cmax and bioavailability and the fact that bioavailabilty of tadalafil is unknown.  Of the three factors point overall he said: </p>

One of the vices of raising a point like this in crossexamination when it is not foreshadowed in the expert evidence is that it can become a test of how quickly people can think.  That is not helpful.  As I have been considering this issue it occurs to me that there may be an inconsistency built into it.  To deploy the third factor the skilled person needs to have found out the accumulation factor for tadalafil, i.e. to have acquired pharmacokinetic data.  But the questions sought to exclude knowledge of other bioavailability and pharmacokinetic data as unknown factors which could go either way.  </p>

He said therefore that it was thought that whilst lowering the dose would decrease the incidence of side effects, so would it reduce efficacy because they have the same root causes. </p>

So for example, for an orally administered drug like sildenafil, to function the drug has to reach a certain level in the systemic circulation and then diffuse into the penis tissue.  It is the level in the penis not the level in the blood stream which has the desired effect.  However, the facial flushing side effect may depend on the level of the drug in blood vessels in the face.  A different drug may have a different relative tendency to partition and diffuse into these two different tissues.  </p>

It was a daily dosing study testing four doses 10, 25, 50 and 100mg.  The results were that there was no difference in efficacy end point between all four doses demonstrating an apparent therapeutic plateau.  The most common side effects were headache, back pain and myalgia and these side effects did show a dose response.  10 mg and 25 mg tadalafil were well tolerated and all doses up to 100mg were “generally” well tolerated.

I have no proper evidence about Glaxo and I will not place weight on that.  I can place weight on the fact that the tadalafil project did involve tests in which doses were identified as a minimum effective dose purely for the fact (which I have found already) that the skilled team understood the concept.  However, as Lilly points out, different doses were identified as the minimum effective dose in different studies.  I do not have sufficient evidence about this to place any further weight on it either way.  I can note that the regulators did ask for the minimum effective dose to be investigated but since the regulators were presented with the data the developers of tadalafil actually produced, that act by the regulator is only really relevant to the questions I have to decide if that data presented to the regulator in real life was the same as the data which a skilled team would generate.  That is almost certainly not the case.  The evidence shows that the real development project for tadalafil involved quite an array of clinical trials of various kinds.

I am in no position to do that.

Mr Muirhead had worked on sildenafil at Pfizer.  He explained that what Pfizer defined as the minimum effective dose for sildenafil was between 5 and 25 mg.  This bears some explanation.  As was common general knowledge, in order to define a minimum effective dose a skilled person knows they need to define what a minimum clinically relevant effect is.  Lilly submitted that there was at the priority date no standard definition of what that would be for erectile dysfunction.

The IIEF questionnaire allows studies to be done of the patients’ views about sexual intercourse with their partners when they have taken the drug but again there was at that time no agreed upon basis on which to say that a particular IIEF score was the minimum clinically relevant score.

I agree.  Lilly submitted that Dr Brock’s evidence was that he would go forward with those doses and probably not go lower.  That is not exactly what Dr Brock said. His evidence in crossexamination was that he would not necessarily go lower.  Part of his thinking was influenced by the fact that at the relevant time in 1999 there was a highly competitive market place, which I do not doubt but cannot be taken too far.

Such an investigation would not be quite as routine for the skilled team as the work which has gone before but that cannot be taken too far.

It would be safe, tolerable and effective.  The skilled team will have defined a minimum clinically relevant effect for their own purposes.  I am not satisfied that the team would have any expectation that the minimum effective dose was substantially lower than 25 mg.  The team would clearly expect that somewhere below 25 mg there would be a dose of tadalafil which did not work, but that is really the limit of their expectations.  The skilled team would hope to see a dose response but even if they expected to see any statistically significant effect at 10 mg, they would have no reasonable expectation that 10 mg tadalafil would produce a clinically relevant effect as they had defined it.  In terms of expectations, an entirely feasible outcome would be that the minimum effective dose would to be found to be between 10 and 25mg.  Dr Brock’s evidence was that he could not predict whether 10 mg had efficacy in the light of Daugan.  Although that was expressed at an earlier stage in the exercise, it is germane. </p>

This half-life would emerge from the preclinical and Phase I studies.  So along with the on demand studies, testing of tadalafil would include chronic daily dosing.  This has a particular relevance because the accumulation factor of tadalafil at low doses suggests that a lower daily dose would be required for an equivalent effect seen with on demand dosing.  Lilly’s case on this focussed on the expectations of the skilled team and Dr Brock’s evidence that the expectation was that chronic dosing would exacerbate or prolong side effects.   </p>

It would naturally suggest consideration of chronic daily dosing of tadalafil.  However, the team would be well aware that sildenafil was an on demand medicine and was very successful.  The evidence was that the average frequency of sexual attempts for married and co-habiting couples was about 7 times per month.  Why take a pill every day when the therapeutic effect is only required on those occasions?  The skilled team would have a substantial concern about side effects.  The fact that sildenafil’s side effects such as facial flushing are tolerable by a patient who only takes the tablet on an occasional basis does not mean that such side effects, which were thought to be inherently linked to PDE5 inhibition, would be tolerable chronically.   </p>

It might or it might not.  This decision would be made after the Phase I studies.  It would lead to a Phase IIa Study with the same 50mg/day dose as I have discussed above.

It would not include a dose lower than 10mg/day.  The team would expect to see a dose response but would see the same plateau in efficacy down to 10 mg and dose response for side effects as discussed already.  All the reasoning I have considered above would be the same.  Assuming the team decided to conduct an investigation into lower doses in a second, daily dosed, dose ranging study including a 5mg/ day dose of tadalafil, they would not have a reasonable expectation that the drug at this dose would be a useful treatment for erectile dysfunction nor any expectation that the drug would produce a clinically relevant effect but with minimal side effects.

To take an extreme case, if a man began taking actual preparatory steps to commit some unlawful act seriously damaging to the claimant and in infringement of the claimant's rights and did so in full view of the claimant and well aware that the claimant could see them, he could hardly complain if the claimant started proceedings and the court decided to grant a final injunction to prevent it. A statement at trial that he had never intended to go through with it would get short shrift.  </p>

Actavis and Mylan have applied for and are obtaining marketing authorisations for their generic tadalafil products.  That is an expensive and time consuming process. Viewed objectively, it only makes sense if they are planning to sell tadalafil sometime.  The 181 patent (and, I will assume, 092) are potential obstacles.

Once in the stomach, a solid oral dosage form will begin to disintegrate into larger sub-sections (granules) or smaller sections (particles) within the gastric fluid. Soluble components of the tablet will start to dissolve (before, during and after disintegration, most rapidly after disintegration). Inter-individual variability exists in gastric emptying time.

This process determines a drug product's residence time in the different areas of the GI tract.  Food, especially fatty food, slows gastric emptying (and rate of drug absorption), explaining why taking some drugs on an empty stomach speeds absorption.  The small intestine has the largest surface area for drug absorption in the GI tract, and its membranes are more permeable than those in the stomach. For these reasons, most drugs are absorbed primarily in the small intestine. Intestinal transit time can influence drug absorption, particularly for drugs that are absorbed by active transport. </p>

The mixture is then stirred for a suitable time (for example for several hours) until equilibrium has been obtained (and a saturated solution achieved).  The undissolved API may then be removed from the saturated solution by filtration.  The quantity of API dissolved in the saturated solution can be determined by one of a number of analytical methods, such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). An API may exhibit different levels of solubility in different types of solvent.

Simply put, it may not matter if a drug has low aqueous solubility if the amount of drug actually required to be administered to the patient is itself low enough so that all the drug required dissolves.  There were examples in the literature comparing two drugs which both had low aqueous solubility, but in which one drug had a much higher dose number than the other.  The low dose number drug was easier to formulate than the high dose number drug.  The example high dose number drug was called griseofulvin. </p>

Prof Buckton gave convincing evidence that the skilled formulator would not determine the dose number at the outset.  Prof Frijlink’s evidence was effectively that it would be calculated.  I preferred Prof Buckton on this but it is quite a narrow issue.  I am sure the skilled formulator would have the general concept of the relationship between dose and drug’s solubility well in mind.  They would just not necessarily determine the dose number. </p>

Briefly, coprecipitates of a βcarboline with polymeric hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate, for example, were prepared, milled, mixed with excipients, and compressed into tablets for oral administration.  Studies revealed, however, that difficulties arose in generating precisely reproducible lots of coprecipitate product, which makes use of coprecipitates less than ideal in pharmaceutical formulations. </p>

In the treatment of sexual dysfunction, such as male erectile dysfunction or female sexual arousal disorder, however, a more rapid achievement of maximum blood concentration, along with a greater prospect for rapid onset of therapeutic effect, frequently is sought by individuals desiring more immediate and/or less prolonged effects. Accordingly, a need in the art continues to exist for orally administrable β-carboline compounds and β-carbolinecontaining pharmaceutical compositions having an ability to provide a therapeutic effect within a desirable, or at least acceptable, time frame.” </p>

The relevant particle size characteristics are where at least 90% of the particles have a particle size of less than about 40 microns. In paragraph [0008] tadalafil is drawn as “formula (I)” and is named as “compound (I)” in the later paragraphs.  The term “free drug” is defined later in the document (para [0024]) to refer to solid particles of tadalafil not intimately embedded in a polymeric coprecipitate. </p>

The claim then expressly requires the tadalafil to be solid particles not intimately embedded in a polymeric co-precipitate.

The logic here is the same.  In my judgment the passage in this priority document does disclose a daily dose of up to a maximum of 20 mg/day.  The fact the words “about” and “typically” appear in the priority document does not make this a different invention from what is claimed on the construction of the claim I have arrived at.

However, the priority document clearly identifies tadalafil as a member of the class (as “Compound A”).  The chemical name is given using the (6R-trans) terminology.  The four examples in the priority document all relate to tadalafil.  Tadalafil is clearly at the heart of the disclosure of the priority document.

Oren is concerned with tadalafil.  It discloses dosing of 1mg to 10mg/day (p13 ln11-14).  It has 13 examples of tadalafil formulations.  There is no dispute that although it is only expressed for Examples 1 and 2, all of these formulations in fact have particle size distribution of d90 of 4 microns.  Therefore these formulations would fall within claims 1 to 4 of the 092 patent but that does not matter because those claims are entitled to the 092 patent’s claimed priority date and so Oren is not prior art against them.  Oren is only prior art against any claim which is not entitled to priority.  On my findings that means it is relevant prior art against claims 8, 9, 16 to 18 and 19 insofar as 19 is dependent on 16 to 18.  Those claims are limited not by particle size but by pharmacokinetics.  There is a clear teaching in Oren to administer the formulation in order to treat sexual dysfunction but there are no pharmacokinetic data in Oren to show what would happen if you did.  </p>

The claimants do not agree it has not been proved.  One contention is that the patent shows that using a claimed particle size distribution gives the claimed pharmacokinetic parameters and that if that is not right, there must be insufficiency.  While I sympathise with the rhetoric I am not convinced the logic is sound.  The tests for inevitable result and sufficiency are not the same and the policy underlying them is not the same either.  If a claim covers something which is the truly inevitable result of carrying out a prior teaching then that claim is monopolising something which was available to the skilled person without any knowledge contributed by the inventors.  It makes sense that the public should not have to worry about such a patent.  It lacks novelty.  However when a skilled person is given the patent, they have a new teaching and a new goal in </p>

The standard of proof for the establishment of facts in patent cases is the balance of probabilities.  In the EPO sometimes a different standard is or may be applied (e.g. “to the hilt”) but to the extent that is what the EPO is doing, it is because the EPO is not the final word on validity and is not a national civil court.  There is no warrant for applying a higher standard of proof to any of the facts in issue in a patent case.  So one needs to be careful with what likelihood one is talking about.   In <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Inhale</span> the target was not precisely defined in the prior art and it was therefore not inevitable that a skilled person would arrive at the target in the claim (of which they were necessarily unaware).

Or am I concerned to establish what, on the balance of probabilities would in fact occur? In my judgment, it is the latter approach which is correct. The inevitable result test does not require proof of individual facts to a quasi-criminal standard. It may be impossible to establish the relevant technical facts to that standard.

I was not convinced this mattered either way.  It was common ground that aggregation was a possible problem with micronisation, particularly so with hydrophobic drugs like tadalafil.

So if the problem to be solved is to increase equilibrium solubility then micronisation cannot help.  However one needs not to lose sight of the fact that micronisation is a well-known technique for increasing dissolution rate and given the need for rapid onset, as good a dissolution rate as possible would be desirable.   </p>

The claimants’ case, supported by Prof Buckton, was that a formulation which included micronised tadalafil as well as a surfactant was obvious.  The surfactant took on extra significance as follows.  In crossexamination Prof Buckton accepted, based on a passage from a textbook called Gibaldi, that for a high dose number drug such as griseofulvin and therefore for tadalafil, micronisation alone without solubilisation is unlikely to work.  He accepted that, but maintained that that was why the skilled person would include a surfactant and that micronisation plus surfactant was obvious.  It was put to him that he had not mentioned this in his first report and that this represented a shift in the professor’s views.  It was said to be an indication of a hindsight driven attempt to justify a conclusion he had reached at the outset in the absence of information about tadalafil, which, once he saw that tadalafil had such a high dose number, indicated the flaws in his approach.  Sometimes this kind of point does indeed indicate that hindsight or <span style="font-style:italic">post hoc</span> justification has crept into an expert’s analysis.

Prof Buckton did mention absorption in the colon in crossexamination more than was necessary.  In that respect he was being argumentative but not in a manner which leads me to discount his evidence.

From this there may be very small drug particles available.  They can pass out of the stomach in the same way as dissolved drug.  They would then still need to dissolve in the small intestine.  Third there is a periodic housekeeper wave which empties the stomach contents into the small intestine.  The period between housekeeper waves can be up to 3 hours.

In the context of this case one can assume that if the drug is not absorbed in the small intestine in that period, it will not be absorbed at all.  The unabsorbed drug will be excreted.  So even once the drug has reached the small intestine, the absorption may not be fast enough to get it all absorbed in time.

Prof Frijlink’s view was that leakage of fluid and undissolved particles of drug through the pylorus (the sphincter between the stomach and the intestine) is relatively slow and that a larger proportion of the drug particles and liquid (containing dissolved drug) is likely to remain in the stomach until the next housekeeper wave.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Lilly submitted that this difference was not particularly important because it was common ground that, unless tadalafil’s solubility (or apparent solubility) can be increased, only a tiny fraction of a dose of tadalafil would dissolve in the stomach (about 1% of a 50mg dose in 250ml of medium).  Therefore the vast majority of it will, if it is to be absorbed at all, have to dissolve in the small intestine in any event.  Lilly argued that the issue of obviousness turns on whether the particles of tadalafil that arrive in the small intestine will be expected to dissolve rapidly enough and be absorbed rapidly enough to produce the required therapeutic effect to treat ED and achieve the required rapid onset of action. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I am not convinced that the issue is as unimportant as Lilly contends.  Prof Buckton’s view means that a significant amount of drug passes into the small intestine within 15 minutes.  Prof Frijlink’s approach is quite different, if in general only 30% has left the stomach after 90 minutes.  From the point of view of a skilled formulator thinking about how tadalafil will behave and bearing in mind the requirement for rapid onset within 2 hours, the difference between these two views is important.  Prof Buckton gave a convincing explanation for his opinion, in that there is a constant leakage of dissolved drug and small disintegrated particles below 2mm from the stomach and an exponential rate of emptying.  If the mean residence time for a drug is 1 ½ hrs, given the exponential rate the first 50% will be out in roughly 15 minutes because total expulsion takes about six half-lives.  By contrast while Prof Frijlink did maintain his opinion in cross-examination, he did not support it with reasons, or at least with any reasons which engaged with those given by Prof Buckton.  I prefer Prof Buckton’s evidence on this issue. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The significance of this is that 50% of the drug (dissolved and small particles) will have reached the small intestine within 15 minutes of taking the tablet.  Once in the small intestine the drug at least has a chance of being absorbed.  As dissolved drug is absorbed, more drug will in turn go into solution to replace it.  So increasing the rate of dissolution is important but nevertheless, as Lilly contends, with a low solubility drug the driving force behind absorption itself will still be low because the drug has low solubility and drug still has to diffuse in the intestine to the wall to be absorbed.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Another way of thinking about the problem is that unless solubility could be increased, which particle size reduction alone cannot do, the limited residence time in the gastrointestinal tract could place a limit on the amount of drug which could be absorbed regardless of the size of the dose in the tablet, preventing dose linearity.  Lilly relied on a paper by two authors at Pfizer in 1996 (Swindell and Pearson) to illustrate the concern and suggested that unless solubility of tadalafil was improved, the limit would be 9mg.  I accept the general concept rather than the number.  Swindell and Pearson itself was not common general knowledge.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the end however there is a danger of over-thinking all this.  The concept of a dose number is a way of making concrete the idea which a skilled formulator would understand anyway that trying to deliver a high dose of a low solubility drug is harder than trying to deliver a low dose of the same low solubility drug.   The reasons the expedients exist for trying to deal with low solubility drugs are because of all these considerations.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Another example of over-thinking was an argument that something significant depended on the skilled formulator thinking that a non-micronised formulation would achieve supersaturation.  I think this was tied up with what were said to be the reasons why the skilled person would assume micronisation of tadalafil had failed or been dismissed without testing and so, if the only formulations which were thought to work in the prior art were ones which achieved supersaturation, micronisation alone, which can’t, must not be viable.  The skilled formulator would not think like this. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Effectively Prof Frijlink’s core reason for not using micronisation is that it would be dismissed on theoretical grounds, based on considering the extremely high dose number and what might happen in the gastrointestinal tract, without testing.  Prof Buckton’s approach was different.  He did not agree that the skilled person would determine the dose number at initial stages because, as he put it “it is not going to change my view of life”.  His point was that the skilled person knows that the higher the dose and the lower the solubility, the harder it will be to achieve full bioavailability.  He explained that the higher the dose is, the formulator’s task gets harder for all the formulation strategies which have been suggested.  So his view was that it does not alter the way things go.  I preferred Prof Buckton’s evidence about how the skilled formulator would approach their task to that of Prof Frijlink.  I accept of course that formulation science has a firm theoretical basis in physics, chemistry and biology but I do not believe the skilled formulator would not test micronisation at all on theoretical grounds.  They would test it.  Accordingly Prof Frijlink’s reasons, if I place weight on them, would tend to negate any expectation of success even if they do not go far enough to stop the test.  </p>

Lilly pointed out that claim 8, from which all the relevant claims depend, refers to a free drug form of tadalafil.  By the definition given in the patent, the free drug form must be in the form of solid particles and excludes a solid dispersion.

In my judgment if that is the true construction of the claim then it would make <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Biogen</span> insufficient.  Stated at its broadest, the technical contribution of the patent is that tadalafil which has been processed, by micronisation, so as to produce the sorts of particle size distribution described and claimed in the patent and claimed, has pharmacokinetic properties which make it an effective treatment for sexual dysfunction. The technical contribution is not the pharmacokinetic properties divorced from the means by which they are achieved.  That is not how the skilled reader would understand the document and it is not consistent with the state of the art even assuming claim 1 involves an inventive step.  A rapid onset treatment for sexual dysfunction was obviously desirable to the skilled team by the priority date (see the obviousness section above).

They expressly contemplate, as an embodiment of the invention, a composition which is a mixture of the free drug form of tadalafil admixed with the coprecipitate form of tadalafil.  The composition could be a solid or a suspension.  Paragraph [0052] refers to bimodal delivery and is presumably contemplating the idea that the free drug form is micronised and therefore responsible for rapid onset whereas the coprecipitate gives the slower delivery.  Claiming that sort of thing would be commensurate with the technical contribution but the claim is not so limited.  Paragraph [0057] includes the idea that a mixed composition has the Cmax and AUC<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">(0-24)</span> values with the claimed range (there may be a transposition of digits – 3650/3560 but nothing turns on that) and there is no basis in the evidence to say this does not work (that would be part of the unpleaded insufficiency objection I have not allowed).

Once the API particles have been made, the tabletting process will make things stick together but it will not make the particles themselves any bigger.  If anything the bigger ones will break up into smaller particles.   The point is that the answer to the rival construction arguments is not to be found from the words of the claim in isolation.   </p>

If I have six cans of fizzy drink and one 2 litre bottle then, taking a can as 1/3 litre, I can describe what I have in terms of a size distribution in two ways.  Suppose I have lunch boxes which can only accommodate ½ litre sized container.  To consider a number distribution one counts the containers (or particles).  Expressed by number, 86% of the containers (6/7) have a size less than ½ litre.  On the other hand, to consider a volume distribution one counts or measures the total volume or mass of material contained in the containers (or particles).  Expressed by volume, half </p>

So in the volume distribution, the containers less than ½ litre in size represent 50% of the drink.   Thus depending on whether the distribution is to be expressed by number or by volume the same distribution could be expressed as 50% or 86%.  This is all common ground and explains why, if the claim is construed to cover both, it is truly ambiguous.  Lilly did not suggest that the fact that one could imagine cases in which both distributions put you on the same side of the line was enough to avoid the objection.  On the facts of this case I think that is right.  The fact that there could be some extreme distributions for which the problem does not arise cannot help.

They would know that the most popular way to measure particle size was by laser scattering and that these systems reported a volume distribution.  They would know that a laser scattering system could also be programmed to report a number distribution if that was required but would be well aware that they were normally set to report volume distribution.   They would also know that microscopy could be used and that these methods produce a number distribution.

The reason for this is not hard to fathom.  What matters in the pharmaceutical industry is the amount of drug not the number of particles.  If (as here) the small particles are the ones which will dissolve quickly enough to be useful, what one wants to know is how much of the drug is in that form.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">A standard way to report particle size distribution is by using d-values in which, for example: d10 means the diameter of particles below which 10% of the particles fall and d50 refers to 50%, etc.  This is based on an assumption that the particles are spheres.  In the real world they may not be spherical at all and that can complicate matters but the skilled formulator is aware of this.   The difference between volume and number distribution can also be understood when one considers collections of spherical particles.  As the radius of a spherical particle increases, its volume (and therefore the mass of drug it represents) rises with the cube of the radius.  So a single 10 micron diameter particle contains 1000 times more drug than a single 1 micron diameter particle.  Say one had one each of these particles.  By number 50% of the particles have a diameter less than 10 microns but by volume only 0.1% of the drug is in particles of less than 10 microns.  That is why it matters how to characterise the distribution.  The skilled formulator knows this.   </p>

The words “spherical volume diameter” appear here and elsewhere.  That has nothing to do with whether the size distribution is expressed by volume or by number.

Lilly contends that the key sentence is not particularly clear.  I disagree.  The words refer to plotting “cumulative frequency vs diameter, or in other methods weight vs diameter, usually adopting percentage undersize values for the cumulative frequency or weight”.  In my judgment this plainly describes plotting two different distributions by percentage undersize value.  One of them is cumulative frequency, i.e. number of particles, and the other is weight (which is equivalent to volume).  There is nothing odd about this since the skilled person knows that a laser scattering machine can be told to report either way.  </p>

The point is that one cannot sensibly do laser scattering because even after the dissolving step to remove some excipients, the sample will have other material present too.  The patent explains that the crystalline tadalafil can be visually differentiated from amorphous composition ingredients.  The particle size is determined by visual inspection and comparison with standardised particles of known size.  Lilly submitted this meant or included the possibility of using a standardised sample with a given size distribution and comparing that, as a distribution, to a test sample.  Prof Buckton did not agree and Prof Frijlink’s evidence to support this was particularly unconvincing.  I reject that construction.  Paragraphs [0045] and [0046] would be understood to describe a visual inspection technique using standardised particles of known size (not size distribution) so as to calibrate the technique.  Particles would be counted.  The result would be expressed by number.   </p>

The claimants contend that this means the claim is truly ambiguous and insufficient.  I do not agree.  The claimants’ submission overlooks the common general knowledge of the skilled formulator.  The skilled formulator prefers volume, knows that the two approaches are possible but also knows that they give radically different results.  So if the claim expressly called for a volume distribution the reader would not be surprised.  It is their preferred approach.  Equally a claim which expressly called for a number distribution would be readily understood.  However, the one thing the skilled reader would think would be decidedly odd would be the idea that the inventors intended that the boundary of the claim could be determined by either or both approaches.  That makes no sense.  It would be readily apparent to the skilled reader that such a construction made the claim hopelessly ambiguous.  They would think the inventors must have meant one or the other, no rational formulator would cover both.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The skilled reader would reject, at least provisionally, the idea that the claim covers both or either, and ask which of the two kinds of distribution is the one the inventors must have meant.  Only if they could not answer that question would the claim be ambiguous.  However, the conclusion is simple.  A volume distribution is the one preferred in the pharmaceutical industry and for good reason.  Given that ultimately what one wants to deliver to the patient is tadalafil molecules rather than particles as such, it makes sense to think of the distribution that way.  That is consistent with the use of laser scattering to produce a volume distribution for the API.  The skilled reader would see that the only reason a number distribution is determined at the end with microscopy is because there is no alternative.  It could always be converted albeit with errors.  Reading the document as a whole and in the light of the common general knowledge the skilled reader might well start with a doubt about it but they would arrive at one answer.
