	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.40in">This is an action for revocation and alleged infringement of UK Patent GB 364 420 (“the Patent”) concerning so-called “smart meters”.  It is, in substance, about whether British Gas (“BG”) should pay the claimants (“Meter-Tech”, in which term I include Vanclare SE LLC, “Vanclare”, the proprietor of the Patent) royalties in respect of BG’s past, current and proposed smart meter systems.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.40in">Meter-Tech is the exclusive licensee of the Patent, which is entitled “A prepayment utility metering system”, with a filing date of 22 May 2000. There is no claim to earlier priority.  The Patent was bought from the administrators of its former proprietor Secure Electrans Limited. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.40in">Meter-Tech contends that it has a valid patent which covers those BG systems and says that the claim for infringement is significant because it potentially affects, among other things, a £600 million contract for the installation of up to 16,000,000 smart meters throughout the United Kingdom. Meter-Tech values the claim at in excess of £10 million although it (or more strictly Vanclare) appears, from the correspondence, to have purchased the Patent as well as a number of other rights in 2014 for a much more modest sum (£160,000). There is material in the correspondence referring to it as a “£30 million infringement claim”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.40in">The case focusses commercially on BG’s current installed and proposed systems since the historic systems were not rolled out in significant quantities. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.40in">The Patent and the prior art is not complex. The central important issue may be (somewhat tendentiously but not unfairly) summarised as follows. Was it inventive, at the filing date of the Patent, to adopt and use a number which uniquely identifies a specific meter for directing a pre-payment to the right meter in a wireless system which requires the unique identification of that meter for that purpose? For reasons given in greater detail below, I consider that it was not inventive and have formed the view that the key claims of the Patent are invalid.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.40in">However, since its inception, the case has grown to encompass a large number of other points, some on infringement, relating to the various systems, including questions of experimental use. The dispute has generated multiple questions of construction and multiple sub-arguments on validity. As Meter-Tech says, there are now “very many” issues.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.40in">That may be partly because of the nature of the case it has advanced against BG. This is not a case in which there is a standards body to which patentees submit allegedly standards essential patents and give undertakings to grant licences to others on FRAND terms. As Birss J said in an earlier judgment concerning adjournment of the trial, it is not a conventional standards essential patents case. On Meter-Tech’s pleaded case, BG is facing a threat of disruption to an important national roll out and may have not felt justified in leaving any art uncited, or any argument unmade, in defence of its position.  Equally, Meter-Tech has sought to advance quite complex points on construction to try to limit the claims to avoid the prior art and common general knowledge.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.40in">The proceedings were originally commenced in IPEC as a claim for revocation of the Patent by British Gas Services Limited. Meter-Tech issued a claim for infringement in the High Couty against British Gas Trading Limited, together with an application to transfer the IPEC invalidity proceedings to the High Court. That case was transferred to the High Court by order of Mr Justice Arnold on 17 June 2015 (see [2015] EWHC 2087 (IPEC)) and the proceedings consolidated.  Upon that application, BG had contended that the issue of validity should be determined first and separately from the issue of infringement. Arnold J did not agree and ordered the case to proceed as an ordinary infringement action with both infringement and validity in issue. He gave directions to trial, including provision for amended statements of case from both sides. Those were to include a statement of case as to the essentiality of the Patent, setting out its alleged relevance to the UK Department of Energy’s Smart Metering Implementation Programme. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.40in">In his judgment on that occasion, Arnold J also said that the arguments on validity were not of particular complexity but that it would not be safe to conclude at that stage that BG had anything approaching an unanswerable case.   His view was that BG was realistic to recognise that the claims would require a trial for their proper resolution even though BG maintained that the claims were, in its words, “hopelessly invalid”.  </p>

These are useful but the lengthy expert evidence in the case has developed the points made in the statements of case considerably further.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.40in;text-indent:0.00in">was inconsistent with its case developed at trial that the meter serial number (MSN) or some other unique location identifier specific to the meter would have been obvious.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.40in">While I have considered these statements of case, including what they do not say, a case of this kind must be determined by reference to the evidence given at the trial.  Some forensic mileage can be made by pointing to the fact that a case advanced at trial was not put forward or not developed in a statement of case at an earlier stage of the proceedings but it would make little sense if, instead of such statements of case standing as documents to assist the parties in the preparation of their cases, they became instruments which preclude the court from deciding the case on the evidence actually given.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.40in">Specifically on the point about the MPxN, BG explained that the point made relating to that identifier in its statement of case on validity was because it was thought that MeterTech was contending that the identifier in question had to identify specifically the <span style="font-style:italic">geographical</span> location of the meter (which the MPxN could be said to do) rather than identify the meter itself.  Since it is now clear that this is not Meter-Tech’s case and the focus is much more on identification of the specific meter as opposed to the premises, other identifiers of the meter themselves are more naturally considered.  Thus the case developed by BG, which was not framed as limiting, has reasonably responded to the way in which Meter-Tech’s approach to the Patent has developed. </p>

Notwithstanding that provision, it has been the practice for allegations of obviousness to include a plea founded on nothing other than "common general knowledge". Sometimes, as here, these allegations reach trial without any further particularisation of the plea, except to the extent that the plea has been explained by the expert evidence adduced in support of it. I consider that the time has come when the matter which is said to be common general knowledge ought to receive some more formal exposition in advance of the expert evidence stage. Apart from anything else, the <span style="font-style:italic">Pozzoli</span> approach, which depends on identifying a difference between matter alleged to form part of the state of the art and the inventive concept, cannot begin to be applied without adequate particularisation of the starting point. </p>

The first is self-evident: it is that it is essential that the starting point for the plea is indeed established to be common general knowledge.

For example, in the present case it is admitted that "the existence of oxycodone" was common general knowledge. But the dispute here is not about whether a skilled person knew about oxycodone. The real dispute is about what oxycodone was used for. If the skilled person has not used oxycodone as an alternative to morphine for oral administration for moderate to severe pain, it becomes difficult to argue that it would occur to him to use oxycodone in the course of deciding on a controlled release formulation for use in such circumstances. </p>

If information is part of the common general knowledge then it forms part of the stock of knowledge which will inform and guide the skilled person's approach to the problem from the outset.

However the documents contain what might have been thought of as "inconvenient" details. Russo does not mention subcutaneous administration by name and is aimed at JCA rather than RA. Russo is also a small study and was published six years before the priority date. Jansen does mention subcutaneous and is for RA but it does not mention pain and contains the two statements referred to above which Medac relies on. That the "inconvenient" details in Russo have not led to a finding of non-obviousness is not the point. To invent as a starting point in the prior art an amalgam of the best bits of the two cited documents while leaving out the inconvenient aspects, which is in effect what the argument was, created a combination which did not hitherto exist.” </p>

If it is said that a claim to A+B is obvious because both A and B are part of the common general knowledge, the mere fact that they are proven to be common general knowledge at the priority date does not, of itself, render the combination A+B obvious.

That is not the defendants' fault because the parties agreed to treat Mr Townend's first report as a statement of the case. However the case then shifted very close to trial, which demonstrated why it should have been pleaded properly in the first place. Furthermore the argument presented a combination of common general knowledge features which had been created with hindsight knowledge of the patent. It was presented in a way which lacked inconvenient details which were found when the same ideas appeared in the committee documents and it presented points of common general knowledge at a level of generality which itself was crafted with hindsight.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.40in">That said, in my view, the court should be careful not to place undue forensic weight on the precise manner in which such a pleading is done.  Usually, such a case of obviousness over common general knowledge would be set out in a statement of case well before expert reports and the case may reasonably develop from them on the evidence.  Parties should not, in my view, think that simply because a case was put in a particular way at one point in a statement of case, that it will invariably be used against them at trial because it is said that the case ultimately developed was slightly different. Inconsistency during the course of a case of the argument as to why a patent is obvious over common general knowledge may, on occasion, shed some light on whether the argument is sound and whether it was really obvious but the mere fact that such an argument develops somewhat in the light of the way that points are put by the patentee carries limited weight.  I have therefore not given undue significance to the fact that BG’s pleaded case based on the prior art was put slightly differently at trial from the way in which it was put in the statements of case and points made were given somewhat different emphasis (see above and the discussion of the points below).  </p>

The reason put forward by Meter-Tech for adjourning the case in 2015 was that they had identified what Birss J described as a “very serious problem” in continuing the case relying on the evidence of its then expert, a Mr Orchard, who, it was said, had an apparent hostility to British Gas. Birss J rejected Meter-Tech’s application for a relisting in October 2016.

Similarly, the only way a supplier could enable energy supply to a premises was to send an engineer out to replace the main fuse.

Such meters have an additional “breaker” which may be built into the meter or placed between the meter and the distribution box.  The breaker can break the circuit (i.e. disconnect the power supply), and can be controlled by the meter automatically with no intervention necessary from a visiting engineer.  There is no automatic re-connection. A PAYG meter, unlike a credit meter, only delivers electricity into the premises if there is sufficient credit in the meter.  A credit meter is normally ‘on’, unless it has been disconnected by an engineer, in the sense that it always delivers electricity to the customer regardless of the customer’s account balance.  On the other hand, a PAYG Meter is normally 'off', and is only turned on if the customer manually reconnects the supply by crediting the meter with a recognised form of payment.  </p>

As Mr Pollock says, there was a feeling in society that it was disproportionately onerous to remove a person’s electricity supply altogether, and so the suppliers wanted to move to a new solution.  The difficulty of managing the problem of bad debt was also something that suppliers wanted to avoid. A PAYG Meter solved both these problems, as the consumer became responsible for managing his or her own debt, and it was up to the consumer to decide whether the meter was ‘on’ or ‘off’. As a result, PAYG systems became more prevalent in the 1990s and in my judgment by the priority date a skilled person would have been interested in developing PAYG systems. </p>

Ultimately, I consider that taking the evidence of the experts as a whole, both of whom referred to the position in South Africa and its importance as a PAYG territory albeit did not develop it in great detail, those skilled in the art in the UK would either have known that, in South Africa, prepayment customers did not have utility accounts or account numbers or it would have been natural for the skilled team to find this out when embarking on designing a PAYG meter system. Exactly how much would have been known by the skilled person of the identifiers used in South Africa, to make payment to the correct meter was not, in my view adequately established on the evidence.  For reasons which appear below, I do not however, consider that exactly what would have been known about the position in South Africa is of real relevance to the case.  Of somewhat greater importance was the more general fact that for millions of customers, in an important market, identification of the destination of payment did not take place by reference to an account number. </p>

If the key was not only able to carry payment information from the retail outlet to the meter, but was also able to carry metering data from the meter to the retail outlet, then the need for a meter-reader to visit the property would be substantially reduced from quarterly to every 15 – 18 months.  This bi-directional communications feature was first introduced in the early 1990s by Landis &amp; Gyr on behalf of BG.  The smart key (or actually a smart card in this case) technology looked very similar to the simple prepayment key from the user’s point of view, but the memory capacity was much greater (2k bytes), and the smart key had its own processor.

Furthermore, a set of additional status information (such as detected interference with the meter or meter malfunction) was recorded on the smart key. When the customer took the smart key to the retail outlet, the "status report" from the meter was transferred into the retailer's key reader while the credit transaction and other outbound data was transferred from the retailer's key reader to the customer's smart key. A telephone link from the retailer's keyreading device back to the utility company completed a full bi-directional communications path between the meter and the central billing system.  The process of reconciliation could therefore be conducted remotely from the meter, and a meter-reader or meter engineer needed only to visit the meter in the event that the regular status reports revealed the need to do so.  </p>

It is, in any event, in this case not important whether particular undertakings would or would not have been interested in adopting a particular system at the filing date.

If a customer wished to make a credit to his PAYG Meter, (or any other kind of payment regardless of meter type) it would be related to a specific account number, as it is this identifier that is commonly used within the supplier’s billing system. An account number is unique to a particular customer within a single supplier’s billing system, but at the filing date, as now, may well not be unique as between one supplier and another.   </p>

This is a reference that identifies electricity import and export points onto the distribution network. The gas equivalent is the Meter Point Reference Number (MPRN). Collectively they are referred to as MPxN. The intention of MPxN was to make identifying the electrical and gas supply points easier so that any utility could supply any supply point. The MPAN was useful to the distributor, as it represented the ‘end point’ of the distributor’s responsibility.  The obligation to assign MPANs lay with the distributor, because the distributor was responsible for supplying electricity to the metering point. </p>

However, I consider that on balance, it is likely that the skilled person would either have known about this or would have found out about it at the filing date. There is no doubt it was a well-known identifier.

A user is provided with a key or some other form of crediting means that can be taken to a crediting terminal at a shop, Post Office, store of the utility provider or other public place and charged or loaded with credit in response to payment by the user. The key is then taken to the prepayment utility meter and inserted in an interface provided to credit the prepayment utility meter with the credit loaded or charged on the key.

The utility meter can use its unique electronic identity and its "fixed place" location to log the activity of all related Piconet devices.” </span>

One of the benefits of the invention is said to be that, inter alia, government agencies can credit users’ pre-payment meters directly by using the unique identity number of the meter instead of providing customers with the cash equivalents which might be spent on other things and relying on them to use the cash to purchase such credit.  </p>

The distinction drawn in that part of the specification is between third parties paying the money to the meter or paying the money to the customer, not between different ways of paying money into the meter.   </p>

There is no need to repeat them here. It is however worth emphasising one point. A number of BT's arguments on this appeal involve reading limitations into the claim which are not there as a matter of language, on the grounds that to do so would follow more closely that which is disclosed by way of example in the body of the specification. It must be remembered, however, that the specification and claims of the patent serve different purposes. The specification describes and illustrates the invention, the claims set out the limits of the monopoly which the patentee claims. As with the interpretation of any document, it is conceivable that a certain, limited, meaning may be implicit in the language of a claim, if that is the meaning that it would convey to a skilled person, even if that meaning is not spelled out expressly in the language. However it is not appropriate to read limitations into the claim <span style="font-style:italic">solely</span> on the ground that examples in the body of the specification have this or that feature.

The first is a decision of this court in <span style="font-style:italic">Ocli Coating Laboratory v Pilkington</span> [1995] RPC 145. In that case the court concluded that a good reason for confining the meaning of the claims to what it described as a literal construction was that, if the wider construction was adopted, the patent would be rendered obvious in the light of the prior art. As the authors of Terrell point out, however, that cannot be a universal proposition. Where there is no reason to assume that the patentee was aware of a particular piece of prior art, his claim may well have been framed in ignorance of it. In such circumstances it would be wrong to impute to the patentee an intention to frame a claim so as to avoid attacks which could be based on it. It is also perhaps relevant to observe that that case was decided at a time when the courts decided construction by making a distinction between the strict, literal or acontextual meaning of the language and its purposive meaning, as opposed to adopting the unitary approach propounded in <span style="font-style:italic">Kirin Amgen</span>. One aspect of that approach invited speculation as to whether there was a possible reason why the patentee might have wanted to restrict himself to the strict, literal meaning. </p>

Moreover as soon as one departs from documents specifically acknowledged in the specification, the skilled reader has no basis for assuming that the patentee was aware of the document in question. Still further, where the objection is one of obviousness rather than lack of novelty, a value judgment is involved on which widely differing views are possible. It is true that if the document is said to form part of the common general knowledge, it might be said to be more likely that the patentee is aware of it. But a patentee may have been isolated from the common general knowledge, or may, despite the later finding of obviousness, have genuinely believed that he had made an invention over it. As will be seen below, the argument of invalidity over Kerpez involved, amongst other things, resolving a dispute between experts as to the feasibility of identifying noise sources. I am not persuaded therefore that it would be right to give weight to this factor in the present case.” </p>

However, it may seem rather artificial to treat a system of meters which, taken as a whole, employs mainly credit meters as a “pre-payment utility metering system”. It makes more sense to treat only that part of the system which employs such metering as such a system. On this approach, this integer would only be satisfied if the meters, even if capable of being operated as such, were actually activated.  On the other hand, a more realistic and technically justifiable approach would be to treat such a system as being a pre-payment utility metering system, albeit that it is also another kind of system.  That would be more consistent with the approach to interpretation of this integer insofar as it relates to the meters. </p>

As Meter-Tech recognised in its opening, there may be a separate argument to be had over the right remedy if there were infringement of the system and method claims only or largely as a result of the presence in such meters or systems of features which can be activated but which, for millions of customers (the vast majority), may never be activated at all. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.40in">A similar point applies to an allegation of infringement or threatened infringement by the supply (in shorthand) of “means essential”. In supplying a meter to a customer which was capable of being configured as a pre-payment meter but which was configured as a credit meter, BG may not infringe in virtue of the supply of means essential on the footing that BG may not, at that moment, intend that the meter should be reconfigured as a prepayment meter.  It would, however, be somewhat unreal to say that BG intended that to happen with respect to that meter if its primary and preferred approach would never to be to activate the pre-payment facility for the majority of its customers, because it was never necessary to do so.   </p>

The relationship is reinforced by the purpose of the unique identifier, namely to determine a transceiver number for communication with that specific meter. This point and Meter-Tech’s main skeleton argument highlight a difficulty in its argument on Claim 1. It says: “In the context of the prior art in this case, the following well defined question arises: is a customer account number such a location identifier, i.e.  unique to the location <span style="text-decoration:underline">and associated with the meter</span>?” That suggests that there may be a relevant difference between an identifier of the location and of the meter (the wording underlined is of course not used in this claim).

It is not directed to that issue and cannot be construed as though it had that purpose in mind.  It is, with respect to Meter-Tech, clearly wrong to say that “the Patent is intended to overcome such Supplier switches”.  Supplier switches may or may not be facilitated by the relevant regulators requiring that suppliers provide appropriate information for accessing customers or accounts.  The Patent is silent on this.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.40in">I agree with Meter-Tech that there is nothing to suggest that the remote communication unit cannot be comprised of multiple modules.  Nor does it matter where the modules actually are.  They may all be at a supplier and there is nothing in the Patent to suggest that the unit must be remote from the supplier in any respect.  Such a unit could be operated on a supplier’s servers (indeed, part of Meter-Tech’s case is that such a unit operated on BG’s own servers would infringe). “Remote” is therefore only from either the input of the credit at the supermarket or from the meter itself (or both).  I agree with Meter-Tech that the purpose of the Patent is satisfied if the remote communication unit is found in multiple discrete hardware units.  </p>

I do not accept that argument for reasons similar to those set out above.  As Meter-Tech says, there is no technical distinction between a direct mapping within the database from unique identifier to transceiver number, or a relationship established through a series of look up tables (e.g. unique identifier to attribute x (such as account number or MPxN); followed by attribute x (such as account number or MPxN) to transceiver number).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.40in">Second, as to “transceiver number”, the technical purpose of this integer as the specification explains is to enable the meter to be (in effect) phoned up to phone in a credit. The unique identifiers are cross-referenced with the “digital cellular network number for the transceiver”; that number is retrieved so that communication can be achieved with the particular meter connected to the transceiver. As Meter-Tech says, there is no basis in the Patent for excluding any such number that would be known to be suitable for arranging communication with a digital transceiver. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.40in">BG’s additional contentions are better addressed in the context of the specific arguments on infringement in which they arise since there is a further complication to this point namely how to deal with dynamically allocated transceiver “numbers” in an IP system which do not remain constant.

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.40in">The issue that arises on this integer is quite complex.  BG contends that the claim is limited to the situation where the payment itself is channelled to the remote communication unit and from there it is dealt with by the supplier’s accounting system, whereupon it becomes a credit, and not a payment.  Thus a distinction is sought to be made between a credit and a payment.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.40in">In principle, there is a distinction between a payment and a credit and the evidence to that effect is, to that extent, right. However, I do not accept that the Patent is seeking to make any real distinction between the two.  The language of the Patent is not particularly precise in any respect.  While in some documents written in particularly precise terms, it would be right to proceed on the basis that this distinction was material, I do not think it would be right to do so here. In simple terms, the Patent is simply saying that it is possible to make a payment remotely to the meter which ends up crediting the right meter as a result of the RCU finding the right telephone number to call up to access that meter. </p>

Where the term has no well-recognised meaning it should, if possible, be replaced by a more precise wording found elsewhere in the original disclosure. Where there is no basis in the disclosure for a clear definition and the term is not essential having regard to the invention, it should normally be retained in the claim, because to excise it would generally lead to an extension of the subjectmatter beyond the content of the application as filed - in contravention of Art. 123(2).

It is not a relative term as such, even though it may be possible to have degrees of “embeddedness”, and that the context in which it appears makes it sufficiently clear what is meant by it.  In particular Meter-Tech points to the purpose of embedding namely to provide an element of security in that it is an identifier which is difficult to change.  That is consistent with the use of the term in the “card not present” invention.  Having regard to those matters, the term “embedded” is, it is said, sufficiently clear.  Moreover, Meter-Tech contends that the EPO Guidelines do not preclude the use of relative terms but merely state a preference against them. </p>

MeterTech additionally contends that such an identifier need not be completely unchangeable. However, on that approach, an “embedded” identifier might be altered while remaining a property of the meter and not the customer. For example, one could envisage a controller of such a system changing all of the identifiers of the meters themselves from time to time to enhance the collective system security, in an electronic analogue to changing all the locks or combinations of a safe-storage system now and again.   </p>

The court is obliged to consider whether, regardless of what is or is not said about a term during the course of litigation, it is sufficiently clear in the context of the claims to satisfy s.14 of the Act.  The fact that there may be a debate as to what falls within the claim is not of itself sufficient to render it unclear in the context of this particular Patent.

However, the meters of the Phase 2B Dual Prepay System were capable of operation in both prepayment and credit modes.  BG therefore contends that a meter not in fact operating in prepayment mode is not a “prepayment utility meter” within integer B, and is not part of a “prepayment energy supply system” within the meaning of integer A.   I have addressed the issue in the construction section above. It is not a requirement of the claims that the meters in question operate solely as pre-payment meters or that the pre-payment functionality is activated provided that it is capable of being activated.  The following matters provide further support for the argument that such a meter/system should properly be regarded as a pre-payment meter/system. </p>

The primary objective, as recorded in a contemporary presentation was to develop a “robust and scaleable end to end solution for the deployment of smart meters.” In the context of BG’s customers, a relatively small number were ordered and even fewer (120) installed.

Meter-Tech contends that by complying with its legal and contractual obligations regarding SMIP, BG will infringe the Patent.  There is no dispute that BG intends to comply with those obligations.  The dispute is whether the future SMIP systems fall within the claims. Infringement is alleged both indirectly under s60 (2) and directly by common design.  Regarding indirect infringement, BG accepts that it will be liable under s60 (2) if the SMIP future system falls within the claims of the Patent.  </p>

Accordingly, the relevant number would (in the radio implementation) not identify a digital cellular transceiver.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.40in">This too is an issue which goes to the extent of infringement rather than whether there is infringement at all.  Claim 1 is a claim to a system and, if it includes a digital cellular transceiver as part of it, there would be infringement (subject to satisfying other integers) even if some of the users had communication hubs which did not operate on a digital cellular network.  However, again, if it came to the issue of payment in respect of the use of the invention, some account would need to be taken of the extent to which communication was effected in a manner which did not make use of the integers of the claim. By way of example, if one imagined a network in which 15 million of the meters operated by way of long range radio and 1 million by digital cellular, it may not, prima facie, be correct to provide compensation at the same level as one in which (say) almost all of the 16 million meters operated by way of a digital cellular network although precisely how account should be taken if it came to that of a system which used some infringing and some non-infringing means of communication may not be straightforward.   </p>

For the reasons given in the section on construction, I do not consider that the claim, interpreted in the light of the description, requires that this unit be a single entity. In my judgment it is right to consider the DCC, or more strictly, the equipment operated by the DCC, as a unit entity albeit with separate sub-units and that it can properly be regarded as the remote communication unit of this integer.  I do not think it makes sense to treat the individual sub-units as the remote communication unit.  Taken individually, they do not each contain all of the relevant databases.

A dynamically allocated IP address is, of course, not a fixed transceiver number as the Patent describes but the Patent does not attribute any particular significance to the transceiver number being fixed.  What matters for the purpose of the invention is that there is a determinable relationship between the transceiver number and the meter so that the system as a whole knows which number it should be “calling” to update that meter.  For that purpose, it does not matter whether the transceiver number is permanently fixed or whether, even, it changes during the course of a transaction, so long as the system as a whole keeps track of the relevant relationships.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.40in">Meter-Tech’s case is that by signing up to SMIP and agreeing to deliver a SMETS2compliant system compatible with the DCC, British Gas has engaged in a common design with the DCC.  British Gas accepts it is working with the DCC to implement the relevant systems but it denies that such acts amount to a common design as a matter of law.  The Defence admits the specific acts alleged in relation to the Future Systems (paragraph 5F1(ii)), but denies that those acts amount to joint tortfeasance by common design with the DCC. </p>

This idea does not, as it seems to me, call for any finding that the secondary party has explicitly mapped out a plan with the primary offender. Their tacit agreement will be sufficient.

In my judgment, on the basis of the facts as pleaded and admitted, BG would be acting pursuant to a common design with the DCC to implement a system and method falling within claims 1 and 11 of the Patent (as proposed to be amended).  This seems to be a paradigm case for such liability to arise, since the undertakings in question are proposing to engage in activities which are together required technically to implement the system.   This is a case in which BG and DCC would therefore have combined to secure the doing of acts which, were they to be done would be infringements.  </p>

Motivation can of course be important in evaluations of obviousness (see for example <span style="font-style:italic">Hoechst Celanese v.

However, again here, it is dangerous to make too much of it as an isolated factor, because a product can be obvious even if there was no reason actually to make it at the priority date and a skilled person would believe it to be unusable (a 100cm dinner plate, to adapt a familiar example).  It is also important to bear in mind that motivation can lie in the wish to make a different product which operates in a similar way, not necessarily a better one.  </p>

Just as in the old systems, where a customer fed his or her meter with coins, in systems of this kind in which crediting is done remotely and by telephone, the customer is notionally “feeding” a specific meter with electronic credit.  It is then the meter which determines whether the electricity is supplied to the premises or the supply broken where there has been insufficient pre-payment.  However, the key step in the process is working out which meter to feed and getting the notional coins (in modern systems credit) “into” that meter. One of the most natural things to do is therefore to use an identifier which specifically identifies the meter in question since that is the destination for the credit. </p>

It is common ground that he or she will have been able to cope with degree-level electrical engineering.

It is again wrong to say that a meter serial number cannot properly be called an identifier because suppliers may not have complete records of them. </p>

It is quite a different matter as to whether the supplier gives access to a third party to such numbers to enable them to access the meter as well.  Moreover, as was common ground, in the 1990s, there was a move towards deregulation and loosening of the grip of the suppliers over the meter.  So, far from being antithetical to prevailing commercial thinking, even if relevant, the approach taken by the Patent might be seen as in line with it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.40in">Sixth, it was at the filing date, common general knowledge that premises might have more than one meter (for example one for gas and one for electricity).  In order to implement a design of this kind in the context in which there was not a one to one relationship between the transceiver address and the meters, it would be necessary to use an identifier specific to the meter, rather than just specific to the transceiver address.  There was therefore an additional motivation for the skilled team to use the number of the meter and access that via a database correlating the transceiver address with the meter.  This is merely the electronic correlate of physically accessing a specific meter.  If a customer has two meters at a given premises, and only one of them needs to be accessed for any purpose, it would have been obvious to use the identifier of the meter itself and provide an appropriate correlation with the address at which it is to be found.  Thus, using an electronic identifier specific to the meter is merely the electronic analogue of what would be done in the physical world.  Since the purpose of such systems is to identify and credit the meters and the transceivers are merely the means by which this is done, it is if anything more natural to use for identifying the meters a number unique to them than to use just the transceiver address.    </p>

He agreed that it was but also said again that the meter serial number could be used as an alternative (see T4/465).  It was not in fact squarely put to him that the use of the MSN in that way would not have been an obvious alternative at the filing date in an O’Brien system and it is therefore not surprising that he did not directly engage with that question in cross examination.

First, the relevant claims of the Patent are not limited to a situation in which a third party is crediting a meter.  There was, as I have explained, a clear motivation to use an identifier which was unique to the meter in crediting the meter quite independently of by whom such credit was being done.  Second, it is not correct that Manson is “really” directed at one-to-many communications.  To the contrary, it specifically discloses a system which is intended to address single meters by giving them a unique identifier and using that to address messages to that meter alone.  As Mr Pollock says elsewhere in his first report: the combination of RIC + DIDC is a unique address disclosed by Manson. Third, if anything it points in the opposite direction in that it indicates that, like the Patent, addressing a meter uniquely involves the use of </p>

The basic idea is to provide a metering system in which some of the characteristics of a pre-payment meter are provided by a system which includes credit meters.  In essence, the metering system described measures the consumption from all of </p>

The description says that a pre-payment system can be implemented even if one or more of the meters does not incorporate a cut off facility provided that such a facility is provided by at least one of the meters in the system (p3).  Thus, the design provides what might be called a “composite” pre-payment meter system in which, taken together, the meters at a customer’s premises can be used to provide prepayment metering for all of the services. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.40in">In my judgment, the reasoning is the same with respect to Loe as with respect to the other art.  Loe does not say how the meters are to be identified.  Nor does it describe a local transceiver in any detail or a remote database. To that extent, it is less explicit than some of the other art considered above.  I am not persuaded that there is any teaching in Loe away from use of an identifier specific to the meter in a relevant way. </p>

In my judgment, for the same reasons as given above that is too narrow an approach and at least one obvious identifier at the filing date would have been a number such as the MSN which specifically identified the meter in question.  To that extent, I prefer the approach of Mr James for the same reasons.  There is no dispute that implementing a design of this kind using a digital cellular network would have been obvious at the filing date. </p>

He did not say that it was the only natural identifier to use and it was again not put to him that the MSN would not also be a natural identifier to use. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.40in">The underlying reason that the conclusion is the same on all these items of art is that they all disclose or render obvious a system of remote crediting using a telephone system of one kind or another of a pre-payment meter which inevitably relies on identifying the meter in various degrees of specificity.  The principal art (O’Brien, Manson and NETP) have that as the or a central focus of their disclosure and to that extent form a particularly clear basis. Once it is shown that the means of telephonic communication (digital cellular and RF in the home) would have been obvious, the only remaining question is whether (it being accepted that the use of the account number to identify the meter would have been obvious), the use of the MSN would also have been obvious.  None of the prior art citations contain material which specifically teaches away from the use of that approach, which was readily to hand at the filing date. </p>

In my view, in this case, that does not matter.  The evidence, taken as a whole is sufficient to clothe the court with the mantle of the skilled person and enable reliable conclusions as to validity to be drawn without it being necessary for each side to have put precisely their position to the other side’s expert.  Equally, as explained above I am not persuaded that the differences between the statements of case and the evidence were of significance in this case.   There was greater emphasis on the use of the MPxN in BG’s pleadings but not to the exclusion of other identifiers.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.40in">This is a rather unusual case in that the only matter said to differentiate the subject matter of claims 1 and 11 (even as proposed to be amended) from the state of the art is the use of an identifier unique to the meter instead of the account number.  For the reasons given above, I consider that this step would not have required invention in the context of a design with the other characteristics of the claims. Nonetheless, this was not the argument actually developed in the pleaded case of obviousness over common general knowledge alone.  In my judgment, because of the issues discussed above relating to the importance of pleading a case of common general knowledge, I do not think it would be appropriate to base a decision of obviousness on this additional ground in these circumstances.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.40in">I should say that I am not thereby holding that the key claims of the Patent were not obvious in the light of common general knowledge alone, merely that it would not be fair so to hold, given the manner in which the case was developed (and, in particular, not developed) in the pleadings. It might be thought that this approach should also apply to Loe, since no statement of case was served in respect of this and there would be something to be said for such an argument. However, in my judgment, different considerations apply where no statement of case on invalidity was ordered and the prior art in question is cited merely in the context of a response to the proposed amendment.   Loe is not, in any event, a particularly key citation. </p>

That was suggested by Meter-Tech to be the most obvious approach to take to implementing the prior art.  I am not however satisfied that the claims would lack novelty since none of the art cited clearly and unmistakably discloses all of the integers or makes it inevitable that they would be used even on the broader construction. </p>

That number would fall within the claims as proposed to be amended since (on any view of “embedded”) the MSN is permanently fixed and associated with the meter itself.  </p>

It is also not right to say that the claim discloses a method without those individual features any more than a general claim to a method of manufacture of a chemical description which omits specification of (say) the temperature at which the reaction is enabled thereby discloses that it can be performed at any temperature.  If there is an objection to a generalised claim of this kind, it lies in insufficiency, in that it may be impossible to perform the invention across the whole scope of the claim without invention, if the feature in question is not included.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.40in">The second objection advanced in this regard seems to me to be a reformulation of the first and I do not accept that either.  The claim is not teaching a different way of addressing communication.  It is claiming the same way but at a somewhat higher level of generality.  One may test an argument of this kind in the following way.  Suppose that the claim had simply said “”A system for effecting pre-payment of electricity”.  Such a claim would have faced multiple objections but added matter would not be one of them, if the specification remained the same, even though the claim disclosed none of the specific features which the description requires.  In both cases, the application and the specification of the patent, taken as a whole, would disclose such a system.  It is important in this context not to confuse teaching which says specifically that an invention can be performed without a particular feature with a claim which simply omits mention of that feature.  It does not follow that a patent with the latter sort of claim is in fact disclosing that it is possible to perform the invention without it.   </p>

I therefore do not accept the premise of BG’s argument.  In my judgment neither that passage nor the passage at p11, lines 20-21 have to do with bypassing the suppliers.  They are both concerned (at most) with the fact that, by the use of a number which identifies the right destination of the payment, anyone can provide credit for the meter using that number. As I have said above, the passages distinguish a situation from one in which the government or others pay the customer themselves in cash (or equivalent) rather than providing an energy credit for the meter.  It is in my judgment unjustifiable to suggest that these passages make a distinction between payments that are made directly to the meter and payments which are made to the utility company for crediting to the meter.   The passages do not say so and there is nothing in the specification that requires them to be interpreted in that way.   </p>

However, of all of the features in the numerous claims, this is a feature which (a) was not present in any of the claims of the application (b) was not present in any of the claims of the Patent (c) was not attempted to be amended into the Patent, even as a conditional amendment to any of the claims.  Yet it is now said to be central.  In my judgment, stepping back from the detail, what is really going on here, is that a specification which does not contain or disclose an allegedly critical feature at all and which is silent on an issue is now said at trial (by construing it in a given way many years after it was filed) to speak volumes on it.  Patentees in such a position may actually be reluctant to make such allegedly crucial matter explicit by making a specific claim to such a feature, because the absence of the feature in the application would thereby be highlighted by that contrast.  So, instead, a patentee attempts to say that, in the Patent, the concept is present, not by words, but by implication. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.40in">Finally, it is sometimes said, in the context of added matter objections, that a description should not be used as a reservoir of features from which to construct a new claim.  One might equally say that, where a description is silent on an issue, it is not to be treated as a <span style="font-style:italic">tabula</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">rasa</span> on which can be written, by implication, any concept that it may become convenient for the patentee to talk up as an aid to defending its validity or asserting its infringement many years later. That is unfair on third parties and can confer an unwarranted advantage on a patentee of the kind that the patent system is designed to avoid. That system is there to encourage the ingenuity of inventors in making and sufficiently describing real inventions and claiming them clearly. It is not there to encourage the exegetical enthusiasm of advocates in construing inventions out of their non-description, no matter how elegantly that is done.   </p>

In the context of the disclosure of the invention as a whole, I do not consider there to be a difference.  However, if BG is right on this, such would be a further basis upon which matter would have been added in that the alleged invention of paying a credit directly to a meter would not have been disclosed in the application while it was (as is alleged by Meter-Tech) central to the Patent.  I do not consider that this is a material difference. </p>
