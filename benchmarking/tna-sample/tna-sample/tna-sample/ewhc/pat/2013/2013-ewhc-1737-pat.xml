The Patent discloses and claims pharmaceutical compositions comprising an antibody to βamyloid peptide, also referred to as amyloid-β or Aβ. The Patent is one of four patents granted pursuant to divisional applications from a parent application which matured into EP 1 033 996. The Claimant (“Lilly”) seeks an order for revocation of the Patent and a declaration that dealings in pharmaceutical compositions comprising an antibody called solanezumab, which Lilly currently has in Phase 3 development for the treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease (“AD”), will not infringe the Patent. Lilly attacks the validity of the Patent on the grounds of added matter, lack of novelty, obviousness, and insufficiency. There is no challenge to the claimed priority date of 2 December 1997. JAI has applied to amend the Patent by deleting claims 13, 14 and 15 and by omitting two words from claim 11. That application is unopposed. </p>

Prof Wisniewski has been Professor of Neurology, Pathology and Psychiatry at New York University (“NYU”) School of Medicine since 2005. He obtained an MBBS from King’s College London (“KCL”) in 1983. He moved to New York in 1984 to pursue his interest in neurodegenerative research. Having completed residences in Anatomical Pathology, Neurology and Neuropathology at NYU Medical Center and Columbia University, in 1990 he took up an academic position as Clinical Instructor in Neurology at NYU. From 1990 to 1994 he worked with the immunologist Professor Blas Frangione. He became an Assistant Professor of Neurology and Pathology in 1992 and a tenured Assistant Professor of Neurology, Pathology and Psychiatry in 1999. He has been Director of the Conformational Disorders Laboratory at NYU since 1997 and Director of the Neuropathology Core of the NYU AD Center since 2002. He has held a number of other academic and hospital appointments. These positions allow him to divide his time equally between treating patients and research. His research focuses on neurodegenerative disorders, in particular the pathogenesis and treatment of AD and prion-related diseases. He has been on the editorial boards of several academic journals. He has published 217 full length peer-reviewed publications. He has won a number of awards. He is a named inventor on a number of patents. He was an investigator in the Phase 3 trials of both JAI’s product bapineuzumab and Lilly’s product solanezumab. </p>

Counsel for JAI rightly accepted that Prof Wisniewski was both highly expert and gave his evidence clearly and fairly, but submitted that on some points Prof Wisniewski had had difficulty in putting himself in the position of the addressee of the Patent rather than viewing matters from his own perspective. I think there is some force in this, and I have taken this into account when assessing his evidence.  </p>

He obtained a PhD in Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry from the State University of New York at Stony Brook in 1998. From October 1998 to June 1999 he held a post-doctoral position at Stony Brook. From June 1999 to 2002 he held a postdoctoral position in David Holtzman’s laboratory at Washington University School of Medicine. In September 1999 he received funding for a project to analyse physiologically relevant apolipoprotein/Aβ interactions in mouse models of AD. This work led first to the filing of US Patent Application 60/184601 in February 2000 (and later to further patent applications) and secondly to the publication of DeMattos <span style="font-style:italic">et al</span>, “Peripheral anti-Aβ antibody alters CNS and plasma Aβ clearance and decreases Aβ burden in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease”, <span style="font-style:italic">PNAS,</span> 98(19), 8850-885 (2001) (“DeMattos 2001”) on 17 July 2001. This was the starting point for the development of solanezumab. In late 2002 Dr DeMattos joined Lilly, where he is now a Research Fellow in Neuroscience Discovery Research. In his witness statements Dr DeMattos described aspects of the development of solanezumab.    </p>

From 1982 to 1990 he was a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow and from 1990 to 1995 an Honorary Lecturer at the Institute of Neurology, Queen Square. In 1995 he became Senior Lecturer in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospitals, which merged with KCL in 2000. He was appointed Reader in 2004 and Professor in 2008. In 2008 he also became Director of Brains for Dementia Research. He is the author of over 122 publications in refereed journals. His research includes work on the mechanisms of AD and other types of dementia, such as frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementias and vascular dementia. He has been involved in some clinical trials relating to AD, in particular a trial of memantine in people with Down’s syndrome. </p>

Thus he had limited experience in amyloid research prior to 1997 and no personal experience of working with Aβ. Nor did he have any clinical experience. Counsel for Lilly submitted that Prof Francis was adversarial in his evidence. I do not accept that. In my judgment he did his best to assist the court. I did think that Prof Francis exhibited some discomfort in some of his evidence, but I attribute that to his relative lack of expertise with regard to Aβ in 1997.      </p>

That being so, I consider that steps should have been taken to reduce the ambit of Dr Owen’s reports.

In my view a technical primer of the kind which was prepared by the parties in <span style="font-style:italic">MedImmune Ltd v Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd </span>[2011] EWHC 1669 (Ch) would have been of assistance.

The axon projects out from the soma to contact and communicate with other neurones, and in humans may be anything from less than a millimetre to over a metre in length. Axons often branch, as shown in the diagram above, enabling a neurone to communicate with multiple other cells. The point at which an axon from one neurone comes into contact with the neurites or soma of another neurone and passes on information is called a synapse. Information is relayed in the form of electrical impulses, which travel down the axon. When the electrical signal reaches the presynaptic terminal of the axon, at most synapses it triggers the release of a chemical signal, called a neurotransmitter, into the synapse. Examples of neurotransmitters are acetylcholine, glutamate and serotonin. These neurotransmitters diffuse across the synaptic cleft and are detected by post-synaptic receptors on dendrites<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>of other neurones. A synapse may be excitatory or inhibitory. An excitatory synapse<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>is one in which the neurotransmitter excites the post-synaptic membrane, making it more likely that the receptor neurone will propagate an electrical impulse. An inhibitory synapse is one in which the neurotransmitter decreases the excitation of the next neurone. </p>

APP is a transmembrane protein, the position of the membrane being indicated by the vertical dark green line. The Aβ region within APP is shown in red. APP is cleaved by three enzymes, known as α-, β- and γ-secretase. α-secretase cuts APP in the centre of the Aβ region, and so does not generate a fragment which contains the entire Aβ sequence. The ultimate product of α-secretase cleavage, after further cleavage by γsecretase, is a peptide called p3, which is non-toxic. β-secretase cleaves APP at a different point, to produce C-terminal fragments which contain the entire Aβ peptide sequence (the C-terminal is the end which contains a COOH or carboxylic acid group). The products of β-secretase cleavage are further cut by γ-secretase to yield Aβ. γ-secretase cuts at more than one amino acid position, so different lengths of Aβ can be produced. Thus Aβ is not a single species.</p>

Antibodies in the plasma are internalised into acidic compartments within cells which express FcRn. In the acidic environment, the antibody binds to FcRn, and the antibody/FcRn complex is recycled back to the cell surface. In the less acidic pH of the plasma, the antibody dissociates from the FcRn receptor and is released back into the plasma.

The resulting fused cell, known as a hybridoma, is immortalised and produces only one type of antibody (i.e. the antibody produced by the B cell that was fused with the myeloma cell). The hybridoma cells can be grown in large amounts, and from these a large quantity of a single antibody can be purified. The monoclonal antibodies produced by the hybridoma method are of the species which was immunised with antigen and from which the splenic B cells were harvested, usually mouse or rat. However, other techniques can be used to produce partly human or fully human monoclonal antibodies. </p>

Vaccination requires administration of a specific antigen of interest (which will be recognised by the adaptive immune system) usually accompanied by an adjuvant (which is a substance designed to stimulate the innate arm of the immune system to enhance antibody production). In experimental animals, a variety of adjuvants can be used, including Complete Freund’s Adjuvant or CFA. CFA, despite its name, contains an antigen, namely inactivated tuberculosis bacteria. CFA cannot be used in humans because it is toxic.

There are many vaccines for which boosting as infrequently as every ten years is sufficient (e.g. tetanus). This is important for patient compliance and cost. In contrast, the effects of passive immunisation typically only last for the length of time that the drug is maintained in the body. For antibodies of the human IgG1 isotype, the plasma half-life is about 21 days, although this can vary depending on antibody clearance mechanisms. Therefore it is likely that monthly, or even weekly, injections of antibodies would be required in a chronic disease. Antibodies are also very expensive compared with the materials used for active vaccinations.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">On the other hand, a potential advantage of passive immunisation over active immunisation is that, if toxicity issues in the patient are observed, the duration of toxicity is likely to be short since the antibody is cleared from the body relatively quickly.

Polyclonal antisera have been used successfully to treat infectious disease particularly where toxins or viruses are already circulating in the body, for example, in tetanus, diphtheria, rabies or hepatitis B. In this last example, serum is taken from patients who have had a hepatitis B infection and a fraction enriched for serum IgG (referred to as a gamma globulin fraction) is prepared. This fraction is then injected into humans who have not had a previous hepatitis B infection, but are travelling to countries where hepatitis B is endemic. This passive vaccination will be efficacious for about a month, during which time the injected antibody will be cleared from the system.  </p>

They were immunoreactive with antibodies recognising ligands expressed by activated monocytes and microglia (MHC class II and a protein called CD11b). Detailed examination of the AN1792treated brains revealed that the MHC II-positive cells were restricted to the vicinity of the limited amyloid remaining in these animals. The cells did not stain for markers of T cells (proteins known as CD3 and CD3e) or B cells (CD45RA and CD45RB), but did stain for a marker of monocytes (CD43). No such cells were found in the PBStreated mice ([0091]). MHC II-positive cells were also observed in the vicinity of extracellular amyloid in AN1792-treated animals ([0093]). Quantitative image analysis of MAC 1-labelled sections showed increased reactivity in the hippocampus of AN1792-treated mice ([0094]).

This example tests the ability of fragments of Aβ to produce similar effects to those shown for the full length aggregated Aβ42, which is used as a positive control ([0107]-[0128] and Figures 11-13). Prof Wisniewski exhibited to his first report a convenient tabular summary of the results which I reproduce below: </p>

Treatment with AN1528 had a significant impact on the level of cortical amyloid burden when measured by quantitative image analysis but not on the concentration of total Aβ in the same region when measured by ELISA. The difference between the two results is likely to be due to the specificities of the assays. Image analysis measures only insoluble Aβ aggregated into plaques. In contrast, the ELISA measured all forms of Aβ, both soluble and insoluble, monomeric and aggregated. Since the disease pathology is thought to be associated with the insoluble plaque-associated forms of Aβ, the image analysis technique may have more sensitivity to reveal treatment effects. However since the ELISA is a more rapid and easier assay, it is very useful for screening purposes. Moreover it may reveal that the treatmentassociated reduction of Aβ is greater for plaque-associated than total Aβ.        </p>

In addition, Dr Owen agreed with Prof Wisniewski that the clinician would be aware that the BBB was compromised in a number of conditions.  Dr Owen also accepted that the Patent appeared to presume at [0046] that its readers knew about the use of agents that could increase the passage of antibodies across the BBB. Accordingly, counsel for Lilly submitted that Prof Wisniewski’s evidence was to be preferred on this point. Counsel for JAI riposted that, even if the matter rested on Prof Wisniewski’s evidence, that did not establish that any of three methods was common general knowledge. </p>

Prof Wisniewski identified four strategies that were being pursued: (i) suppressing APP production, (ii) preventing the production of soluble Aβ, (iii) preventing or reversing Aβ aggregration and (iv) blocking neurotoxicity caused by aggregated Aβ. He agreed that three of these did not exclude targeting monomeric Aβ. Furthermore, a review published by Prof Wisniewski in 1997 contemplated monomeric Aβ as target. This is not surprising given that monomeric Aβ was known to be the precursor to amyloid deposits. Accordingly, the skilled team would not have discounted the possibility of targeting monomeric Aβ in order to prevent it aggregating into plaques. Nevertheless, it seems clear that the main focus of attention was on multimeric Aβ, and in particular aggregated Aβ in plaques.</p>

Monomeric Aβ is Aβ, it is one of the naturally occurring forms mentioned in [0033] and it is specifically referred to in [0027] and [0122]. The claim is not limited to aggregated Aβ. On the contrary, it is clear from [0008], [0036] and claims 5 and 6 that it embraces “dissociated” Aβ.

I accept that that is so, but nor would the skilled team exclude the possibility of targeting monomeric Aβ based on their common general knowledge. In any event, the Patent discloses and claims a new approach to the prevention and treatment of AD. In that context, the skilled team would appreciate that targeting the non-toxic monomer might prevent formation of the toxic multimers.  </p>

I accept that that is so, but there is nothing in the specification to suggest to the skilled team that the inventor intended to exclude other effects.

Although I acknowledge that the specification states in the summary of the invention at [0007] that the pharmaceutical composition is for use in methods which “entail inducing an immune response against a peptide component of an amyloid deposit in the patient by administration of an antibody” and at [0008] that “the immune response is induced by administering an antibody to Aβ” and states at [0030] that “Therapeutic agents for use in the present invention induce an immune response to Aβ peptide”, I do not consider that the skilled team would read those words into the claim. Indeed, counsel for Lilly did not argue that the claim was limited to antibodies which induced an immune response in accordance with the definition. On the contrary, he argued that it was not so limited (see the section on added matter below). Rather, his argument was the definition of “immune response” supported the restricted interpretation of “antibody to Aβ” for which Lilly contends.  </p>

Although I have not accepted that the definition is limited to Fc-mediated phagocytosis, I have accepted that it is limited to downstream effects such as phagocytosis, complement binding and ADCC. I also accept that the skilled team would not expect from their common general knowledge that antibodies to monomeric Aβ would induce phagocytosis, complement binding or ADCC. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the wording of the claim covers monomeric Aβ and it is not limited to a specific mechanism of action or to antibodies that induce an immune response as defined.   </p>

JAI contends that it is enough for the antibody to be shown to have the potential to treat the amyloidogenic component of the disease and that this can be done by demonstrating in animal models that the antibody has the capacity to reduce the amyloid burden. Lilly contends that the antibody must be shown to be efficacious in humans in clinical trials. It is common ground, however, that it is not necessary for the antibody to cure the disease.

They claim products. Since claim 1 (to a compound) has been upheld by the Supreme Court both on industrial applicability and sufficiency, and claim 13 (to an antibody) must also be upheld, it must follow that the patentee is entitled to claim a product (manufactured without undue effort and without invention) containing the compounds covered by claims 1 and 13. They, too, point to the decision of the TBA which held that claims 18 and 19 were sufficient. As long as the product is suitable for pharmaceutical or diagnostic use, in the sense that it can be put into a suitable carrier, the claim is sufficient. It does not matter that the claim does not specify a particular condition or disease that such a product could treat or diagnose. It is open to pharmaceutical companies downstream to find specific medical uses for such compositions (in which case a ‘Swiss-type’ patent for a second medical use could be granted); or to identify specific antibodies which have particular properties.” </p>

Counsel for Lilly submitted that, where available, Phase 3 trial results were the best guide to assessing whether the claimed effect was achieved, but also submitted that the claim did not require a Phase 3 trial to be carried out. It was unclear to me from his submissions what criterion should be applied in the absence of Phase 3 results.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">I do not entirely accept either party’s interpretation of this feature of the claim. In my judgment the primary criterion for efficacy indicated by the specification is success in a Phase 2 trial. My reasons are as follows. The specification asserts at [0006] that the invention “fulfils a longstanding need for therapeutic regimes for preventing or ameliorating the neuropathology of Alzheimer’s disease”. The detailed description of the invention includes discussions of “therapeutic agents”, “patients amenable to treatment” and “treatment regimes”. The second of these refers at [0041] to diagnosis by MMSE or ADRDA criteria. Thus the skilled team would understand that the object of the invention was to achieve preventative or therapeutic efficacy in patients. Although “patients” is defined in [0026] as “human and other mammalian subjects that receive either prophylactic or therapeutic treatment”, the skilled team would appreciate that the MMSE and ADRDA criteria are only applicable to humans beings. While it is true that the headings to Examples I and III refer to “prophylactic efficacy” and “therapeutic efficacy”, the skilled team would appreciate that those Examples do not include any cognitive tests even in mice. Thus the skilled team would take these Examples as being, at best, predictive of preventative or therapeutic efficacy, and would interpret the last sentences of [0076] and [0106] accordingly. The skilled team would not regard these Examples as establishing preventative or therapeutic efficacy even in mice. By contrast, the skilled team would note the statement in [0159] that “A phase II trial is performed to determine therapeutic efficacy” using ADRDA and MMSE criteria. To similar effect is the statement in [0161] that a Phase 2 trial is performed to determine preventative efficacy. Thus the skilled team would understand that this is the criterion by which efficacy is to be determined for the purposes of the invention. Tellingly, counsel for JAI accepted in his closing submissions that, if JAI’s construction was correct, the whole of Example XI was redundant. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Nevertheless, I agree with Lilly that, if they are available, the skilled team would regard Phase 3 trial results as the best guide to assessing whether the claimed effect is achieved. The skilled team, and in particular the clinical member, would be well aware that Phase 3 trials are the gold standard for determining efficacy and are required in order to obtain regulatory approval. The skilled team would also be aware that pharmaceutical compositions that have tested positively in Phase 2 trials frequently fail in Phase 3 trials.                     </p>

Lilly contends that the skilled team would understand “dissociated Aβ” to mean multimeric Aβ that is not aggregated into insoluble deposits. In my judgment JAI is again correct. While the skilled team would no doubt think it rather odd that the specification contains a definition of “disaggregated Aβ”, and not “dissociated Aβ”, I agree with JAI that they would conclude that the two terms were intended to be synonymous. I do not agree with Lilly that the skilled team would think that the definition of “disaggregated Aβ” was restricted to Aβ prepared by the method mentioned in the second sentence of [0027].      </p>

It goes on to state that it would be useful to have a monoclonal antibody specific for the Aβ1-42 peptide for diagnostic tests, therapeutics and for AD monitoring assays.

Lilly does not seriously contend, however, that Koing discloses that the antibody is efficacious in clinical trials of any kind, nor could it. It follows that this feature of the claim is not disclosed as I have construed it. Furthermore, Konig does not even contain data in a mouse model of the kind reported in Examples I, III and IV of the Patent.

One of the matters which it may be appropriate to take into account is whether it was obvious to try a particular route to an improved product or process. There may be no certainty of success but the skilled person might nevertheless assess the prospects of success as being sufficient to warrant a trial. In some circumstances this may be sufficient to render an invention obvious. On the other hand, there are areas of technology such as pharmaceuticals and biotechnology which are heavily dependent on research, and where workers are faced with many possible avenues to explore but have little idea if any one of them will prove fruitful. Nevertheless they do pursue them in the hope that they will find new and useful products.

JAI contends that the skilled team’s approach to this question would have been coloured by a mindset that (i) antibodies would not cross the BBB in sufficient quantities to have any useful therapeutic effect and (ii) any attempt to transport antibodies to Aβ across the BBB would be counterproductive since it would exacerbate the inflammation of the brain which was considered to be a cause of AD. Accordingly, JAI says that the skilled team would have discarded any proposal for immunotherapy as a treatment for AD. </p>

As discussed above, Prof Wisniewski accepted that the proposal for therapeutic application in Konig was speculative. Prof Francis said that it might be of interest to an academic lab not concerned with commercial development to investigate the antibodies of Konig in a mouse model, but that a pharmaceutical company would not be interested, as they would not conduct experiments that they did not think were going to lead to a drug. Dr Owen said in cross-examination that it was a reasonable strategy to investigate, but clarified in re-examination that he meant a strategy to determine whether there was any activity in mouse models and whether there was any evidence of any toxicity. Thus he was not suggesting that the skilled team would have expected success. The conclusion which I draw from this evidence is that Konig would not have given the skilled team any real expectation of success. </p>

These antibodies are described as the “active ingredient” in “pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration” (column 8 lines 49-52). As Prof Wisniewski accepted, however, Becker does not disclose any specific antibodies or any <span style="font-style:italic">in vivo </span>data at all.

Nonetheless, variously formulated claims to pharmaceutical products have been granted under the EPC, all through the years. The patent system takes account of the intrinsic difficulties for a compound to be officially certified as a drug by not requiring an absolute proof that the compound is approved as a drug before it may be claimed as such. The boards of appeal have accepted that for a sufficient disclosure of a therapeutic application, it is not always necessary that results of applying the claimed composition in clinical trials, or at least to animals are reported. Yet, this does not mean that a simple verbal statement in a patent specification that compound X may be used to treat disease Y is enough to ensure sufficiency of disclosure in relation to a claim to a pharmaceutical. It is required that the patent provides some information in the form of, for example, experimental tests, to the avail that the claimed compound has a direct effect on a metabolic mechanism specifically involved in the disease, this mechanism being either known from the prior art or demonstrated in the patent per se. Showing a pharmaceutical effect in vitro may be sufficient if for the skilled person this observed effect directly and unambiguously reflects such a therapeutic application (T 241/95, OJ EPO 2001, 103, point 4.1.2 of the reasons, see also T 158/96 of 28 October 1998, point 3.5.2 of the reasons) or, as decision T 158/96 also put it, if there is a “clear and accepted established relationship” between the shown physiological activities and the disease (loc. cit.). Once this evidence is available from the patent application, then post-published (so-called) expert evidence (if any) may be taken into account, but only to back-up the findings in the patent application in relation to the use of the ingredient as a pharmaceutical, and not to establish sufficiency of disclosure on their own.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.02in;margin-right:0.55in;text-indent:0.5in">Counsel for the Defendants took issue, however, with the second proposition. This raises an important point of principle. If a patent does disclose enough to make the invention plausible at the priority or filing date, can an opposing party came along 20 years later and say that, in the light of subsequently acquired knowledge, in fact the invention does not have the technical benefit that it appeared to have? As a matter of principle, it seems to me that the reasoning of the Board of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Johns Hopkins</span> and of the English judges quoted above applies with equal force: just as a patent which does not make the invention plausible cannot be supported by post-dated evidence, then a patent which does make the invention plausible cannot be shown to be obvious by post-dated evidence. Either way, the fundamental principle is that whether a claimed invention is obvious or not should be judged as at the priority or application date.  </p>

Post-dated evidence may not be relied upon either to establish a technical effect which is not made plausible by the specification in order to rebut an allegation of obviousness or to contradict a technical effect which is made plausible by the specification in order to found an allegation of obviousness. In my view it would be bizarre if, as counsel for Mylan submitted, a patent which at the time it was applied for disclosed what everyone thought was a good invention could be revoked 20 years later because subsequent advances in science had revealed that in fact the invention did not solve the technical problem. </p>

In this particular case, given that only humans infected with HIV develop AIDS, but chimpanzees infected with HIV do not develop AIDS, the Board considers that the results of the AIDSVAX vaccine trial are much more relevant evidence, than the results in chimpanzees so heavily relied on by the appellant I before the opposition division as evidence of the effectiveness of what is claimed. </p>

The patent in suit contains no suggestion that the intended vaccine might succeed only for selected human groups, and certainly no identification of such groups. If what is claimed works only for some groups, this suggests that some other (unknown) factors are in play, and raises questions whether for these groups there is any significance in the difference between ‘unclipped’ as claimed and the (partly) clipped env form present in the prior art suggestions.  </p>

Prof Wisniewski expressed the view in his reports that a monoclonal antibody was unlikely to reproduce the effect of the active polyclonal response. In cross-examination, it became apparent that what he meant was that the active data was no guarantee of success with passive administration.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Against this, Lilly relies on three matters as casting doubt on the plausibility of the claim. The first is that all the Examples used CFA. As discussed above, CFA is not a mere adjuvant, but includes an antigen. Accordingly, it strongly stimulates the innate immune system. Dr Owen accepted that, as a result, there would be higher levels of activated macrophages in the periphery at the site of the injection, but he did not know what would happen in the CNS. He also accepted that the stimulation of the innate immune system could not be replicated by passive immunisation alone. Whether this matters, however, depends on what happens in the CNS, and specifically in the context of the experiments reported in the Patent. So far as that is concerned, Dr Owen’s evidence was that, if CFA stimulated the macrophages of the innate immune system to phagocytose Aβ plaques, one would expect this effect to be observed in the controls which used CFA/PBS alone. Given that significant reductions of amyloid burden were only observed in the groups treated with Aβ, however, this suggests that the clearance of Aβ reported in Example IV was antigen-specific and not due to the activity of macrophages which were non-specifically activated by CFA. Prof Wisniewski agreed with this. </p>

Counsel for Lilly nevertheless submitted that the skilled reader would appreciate that the active immunisation approach used in the Examples of the Patent might depend upon some impairment of the BBB which might not be replicated by passive immunisation.

Lilly contends that the skilled team would conclude from the data in Example IV summarised in paragraph 137 above that this was not the case, and that on the contrary antibodies to the mid-region and C-terminal end of Aβ would be unlikely to work. Thus whereas the Aβ1-5 fragment both reduced total cortical Aβ and reduced the burden of plaque Aβ in the brain, the Aβ1-12 and Aβ13-28 fragments had neither effect while the Aβ32-42 fragment had no effect on total cortical Aβ and was not tested on plaque Aβ. This data relates to active administration, but the thesis upon which the Patent is based is that such data provide a plausible basis for predicting what will happen with passive administration. Thus all the experts agreed that the teaching of the Patent suggests selecting an antibody to an epitope at the N-terminal end of Aβ.</p>

The first is how burdensome it would be to produce an appropriate antibody to Aβ. Lilly contends that this would be a lengthy and complex task. JAI contends that, while it would take some time, effort and expense, it would be routine work for the skilled immunologist. The second aspect is whether the antibody would be efficacious applying the criterion I have discussed above (see paragraphs 203-204). Lilly relies upon evidence as to JAI’s own attempts to perform the invention as showing very clearly that achieving success would be very difficult and uncertain. JAI’s main answers to this contention are (i) its argument as to the construction of the words “for preventing or treating a disease characterised by amyloid deposit” and (ii) its argument that post-dated evidence cannot be relied on, both of which I have already rejected. Nevertheless, I must consider the evidence and make the appropriate findings in case I am wrong on construction. </p>

Even though the Patent only claims passive immunisation, the skilled team would first want to verify that active immunisation worked, to get a better idea of what the mechanism was and to ensure that there was no toxicity because of the uncertainty associated with moving from active to passive given the absence of data in the Patent. Dr Owen disagreed with this. In my judgment, however, Prof Francis’ evidence (see in particular the passage quoted in paragraph 267 above) confirms that the skilled team would want to see some cognitive data in mice from active immunisation, in order to satisfy themselves that there was a sufficient likelihood of therapeutic benefit before embarking on the effort and cost of developing and testing monoclonal antibodies.

As reported in this paper, Dr Schenk and his colleagues first tested two mouse monoclonals against Aβ, 10D5 and 21F12, in PDAPP mice. The mice received weekly injections for six months, after which quantitative image analysis was used to determine amyloid burden and ELISA to determine Aβ1-42 levels in the cortex. 10D5 reduced plaque burden and cortical Aβ1-42, whereas 21F12 had less effect on plaque burden and none on cortical Aβ1-42. In a second study the Elan team repeated the 10D5 treatment and also tested two additional antibodies referred to as 3D6 and 16C11. Both 10D5 and 3D6 were effective in reducing plaque burden, whereas 16C11 was not.

While 3D6 and 10D5 gave positive results in both tests, 22D12, 266, 16C11 and 21F12 gave negative results in both tests (see Table 1). The authors also tested a number of fragments of Aβ. In this regard, the authors commented that “The internal peptide Aβ15-24 encompasses the epitope of antibody 266, which exhibits high affinity for soluble Aβ …, but as shown above it does not recognize plaques in sections of unfixed AD or PDAPP tissue” (page 2024 right-hand column). In addition, the authors did some work on different antibody isotypes. Their conclusion was that their results “indicate that antibody Fcmediated plaque clearance is a highly efficient and effective process for protection against neuropathology in an animal model of Alzheimer’s disease” (abstract on page 2023).    </p>

Leaving aside the fact that Prof Wisniewski thought that Dr Owen’s timescales were on the optimistic side, as I understand it, the main reason for the discrepancy between this estimate and Dr Owen’s estimate of 15 months to reach this stage is that Prof Wisniewski took into account the need for the skilled team to do experiments of the kind performed by the Elan team to identify the best candidate antibody to progress.

As Prof Francis explained, even deciding what mouse to use for this purpose would not have been simple. In principle either the PDAPP or the Tg2576 mouse could be used, but he did not know whether there was a cognitive deficit in PDAPP mice the amelioration of which could be tested. He also said that there were significant limitations with the mouse models being used in 1997, which only became clear subsequently.  Thus the mouse models failed to pick up both inflammation and a failure to improve cognition, and these problems only became apparent in the clinical trials in humans. </p>

This shows the results of cognitive tests that had been carried out to evaluate the efficacy of a number of antibodies targeting N-terminal, central Aβ and C-terminal epitopes. Of the N-terminal antibodies, 3D6 and 10D5 were found to be the most efficacious, 12A11 was found to be somewhat effective and 2H3 and two others were found not to be efficacious. Of the central region antibodies, an antibody called 15C11 was found to be most efficacious, 266 was found to be somewhat effective, two antibodies were found to be partially effective, one was found not to effective and results were apparently awaited for four.

These included that the facts that both PDAPP mice and Tg2576 mice lacked two of the four main lesions of AD and hence were more resistant to amyloid-related pathology, that transgenic mice were less likely to have auto-immune complications and low levels of toxicity were more easily missed in mice. Thus there would be a great deal of work involved in order to verify that the chosen product could be put into humans.   </p>

Dr Sperling also reported the results on safety including vasogenic edema (ARIA-E) and micro-hemorraghes (ARIA-H). In the apoE4 carriers, who only received a low dose of bapineuzumab (0.5 mg/kg), the vasogenic edema rate (ARIA-E) was 15.3% (compared to 1% for controls).

In terms of biomarkers, there was a statistically significant reduction in amyloid burden, but the effect was very small (in the order of  0.05 to 0.1%) and not likely to be physiologically significant.

Both 3D6 and 10D5 reduced amyloidosis as assessed by ELISA values of total cortical Aβ substantially in PDAPP mice. 12A11 reduced total cortical Aβ, but the reduction was not statistically significant. Treatment with 266 resulted in a slight increase in total cortical Aβ. All three N-terminal antibodies significantly decreased the amyloid burden as assessed by immunohistochemical analysis, whereas 266 did not. A similar result was obtained for neuritic burden.

Ponezumab was progressed to two Phase 2 trials which were carried out between 2008 and 2011. In November 2011, Pfizer announced that it had abandoned development of ponezumab. As counsel for JAI pointed out, ponezumab was an antibody of IgG2 isotype, and for that reason did not fall within claim 1 of the Patent. As counsel for Lilly pointed out, if the only problem with ponezumab was that it was not IgG1, it would have been a relatively straightforward matter to re-engineer it to change it from IgG2 to IgG1.    </p>

On the contrary, at least some mid-region and C-terminal antibodies are ineffective at least in PDAPP mice. While there is some evidence to show that mid-region and C-terminal antibodies have an effect on Aβ plaques in PSAPP mice, which are not used in the examples in the Patent, that would simply present the skilled team with the conundrum of which tests to rely on. Still less do all antibodies to Aβ produce cognitive benefits even in mice. Still less are all antibodies to Aβ effective to prevent or treat AD (or any other disease characterised by amyloid deposit). </p>

By then, however, Elan had already done a considerable, and burdensome, amount of work.

JAI contends that the Patent discloses a principle of general application, namely the passive administration of antibodies to Aβ “for use in preventing or treating a disease characterised by amyloid deposit”. Accordingly, JAI contends that it is immaterial that the claims cover antibodies that function by different mechanisms to that proposed by the Patent. If the specification enabled the skilled team to produce antibodies to Aβ that were effective without undue burden, I would agree with this. As discussed above, claim 1 is not limited to antibodies that function by any specific mechanism. Rather, it is limited to antibodies that are efficacious. If the specification enabled the skilled person to make efficacious antibodies without undue burden, it would be immaterial that some of those antibodies functioned by a different mechanism to that postulated in the Patent.            </p>

Lu showed that, in the presence of soluble monomeric Aβ solution, the ratio of solanezumab to soluble monomeric Aβ is 1:1.9, which corresponds to two monomeric Aβ peptides binding to a single antibody. Further, even when solanezumab is incubated with aggregated Aβ, it binds only to monomeric Aβ with a ratio of 1:1.7.

Secondly, the principal point made by Dr Owen in his evidence which counsel for JAI relied on his closing submissions was that Dr Owen had pointed out in paragraph 272 of his first report that Lu did not state whether monomeric Aβ was isolated from a size exclusion column for the purpose of the experiments and therefore it was possible that Lu’s “soluble monomeric Aβ” had contained multimeric Aβ. Prof Wisniewski explained in paragraph 213 of his second report why he disagreed with this. Dr Owen did not respond to this in his third report and Prof Wisniewski’s explanation was not challenged in cross-examination.

This study used the same method as a paper which was published subsequently, Zago <span style="font-style:italic">et al</span>, “Neutralization of Soluble, Synaptoxic Amyloid β Species is Epitope Specific”, <span style="font-style:italic">J.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">It is common ground that Nishioka shows that 266 blocks the binding of soluble oligomeric Aβ to rat hippocampal neurons. The question is whether it shows that 266 binds to oligomeric Aβ.  It is known that soluble oligomeric Aβ binds to neurons. The experiment proceeds on the theory that, if the binding of soluble Aβ oligomers to neurons decreases on addition of 266, that must be due to 266 blocking the binding of the oligomers.  As is common ground, however, the experiment is an indirect one. It was also common ground between Prof Wisniewski and Prof Francis that, due to the method of preparation, there would be monomer present in the oligomer mixture.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Prof Wisniewski’s evidence was that Nishioka does not indicate that there is any direct interaction between 266 and oligomers because 266 could equally be binding to monomers and shifting the equilibrium so as to reduce the presence of oligomers. Prof Francis accepted that the results could be explained by a shift in equilibrium if the kinetics of the dissociation were such that oligomers could dissociate in the time available, and admitted that he did not know whether that was so or not. Again, I prefer Prof Wisniewski’s evidence on this point.     </p>

Counsel for Lilly submitted that the CUPA was effectively </span>an unwitnessed experiment, and accordingly it should be given no weight. I do not accept this submission. There is no reason to doubt that the CUPA is what it appears to be, namely, a patent application filed by JAI in the ordinary course of its business as a result of research carried out by JAI’s scientists. It follows that the experiments it records are not subject to constraints imposed on experiments conducted for the purposes of litigation.  Counsel for Lilly also submitted that the weight to be attached to the experiments was affected by the fact that, unlike in the case of Lu and Nishioka, JAI had not disclosed the relevant laboratory notebooks. This submission has particular relevance for reasons that will appear, and I accept it. It is immaterial that Lilly did not specifically request such disclosure.</p>

If JAI had further images which demonstrated that Prof Wisniewski’s criticisms were unfounded, it would have been a simple matter for JAI to produce them. It did not. I can only conclude that either it did not have the images or they did not assist its case. Counsel for JAI submitted that Prof Wisniewski had applied an inconsistent approach to Racke, but Racke did include some sequential sections and negative controls. Furthermore, Racke was a peerreviewed paper and it is likely that the reviewers would have been given access to more images than were included in the paper.</p>

Prof Francis said that he would like more information to be confident of the interpretation placed on the data by the authors and agreed it would be required for publication in a high-impact journal. Accordingly, I consider that less weight should be given to the CUPA than the earlier work, and in particular Elan’s own peerreviewed publications.</p>

Dr Owen accepted that, if solanezumab is specific for monomeric Aβ, then monomers of solanezumab would have no effector function, and in particular would be very unlikely to activate Fc receptor- or complement-mediated phagocytosis. He nevertheless suggested that aggregated solanezumab could be present in small quantities which would have such functions. He accepted, however, that he had no evidence that aggregated solanezumab was present (let alone that it crossed the BBB). Although information about this would be contained in the chemistry manufacturing control package for solanezumab, he had not asked to see that package. Furthermore, he accepted that he had no idea whether aggregated solanezumab would have any therapeutic effect. Accordingly, I conclude that solanezumab which crosses the BBB does not induce any downstream effects.</p>

In order to test the peripheral sink hypothesis, the authors studied the clearance of radiolabelled Aβ1-40 microinjected into mouse brains after intraperitoneal administration of 266. Radio-labelled Aβ1-40 was rapidly eliminated from brains with a half-life of about 30 minutes in control mice, whereas 266 significantly retarded the elimination of radio-labelled Aβ1-40. The authors also found evidence that 266 entered the brain and bound radio-labelled Aβ.</p>

Prof Francis relied on Kakee <span style="font-style:italic">et al</span>, “Brain Efflux Index as a Novel Method of Analyzing Efflux Transport at the Blood-Brain Barrier”, <span style="font-style:italic">J. P. E. T.</span>, 277(3), 1550-1559 (1996) (“Kakee”) as suggesting that microinjection would not have this effect. Prof Wisniewski said that it was not clear whether Yamada had faithfully followed the technique of Kakee, but accepted that if it had this was less of an issue. On the other hand, he said that there was evidence of excessive breakdown of the BBB in Yamada. Prof Francis agreed that the extent of breach of the BBB caused by the microinjection technique used in Yamada depends on the precision with which it is carried out, and will vary from injection to injection, investigator to investigator, and with the speed and volume of injection and size of animal. Accordingly, he agreed that it was possible that the results in the paper were an artefact of the experimental technique.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Even if the results in Yamada are reliable, there was a dispute as to whether the amount of solanezumab which crosses the BBB would be sufficient to have a significant effect on monomeric Aβ in the brain. Prof Francis calculated that the amount of Aβ monomer bound to 266 as about 35% of Aβ1-40 monomer in the brain or about 70% of total monomeric Aβ1-42. By contrast, Prof Wisniewski calculated that about 6.4% of total Aβ1-40 in the brain and about 20% of total Aβ1-42 was bound. Prof Wisniewski said that the fraction of the total pool was the most physiologically relevant figure because it was the total pool that was potentially available for binding even though 266 only bound monomers. Prof Francis disagreed with this. Although at first blush Prof Francis’s calculation appears more logical, I find Prof Wisniewski’s reasoning more persuasive, because the question is not whether solanezumab can bind to monomeric Aβ. The question is whether it can thereby affect the equilibrium between monomeric and multimeric Aβ, and thereby Aβ plaques. For that purpose, it seems to me that the proportion calculated by Prof Wisniewski is more relevant.      </p>
