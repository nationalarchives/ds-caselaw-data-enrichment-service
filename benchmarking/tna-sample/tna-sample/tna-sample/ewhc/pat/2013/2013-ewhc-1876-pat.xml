The patents belong to Gemalto (in fact the 865 patent belongs to Gemalto S.A. and the 9062 patent belongs to Gemalto N.V. but nothing turns on the distinction.)  The proceedings began as actions for revocation of both patents by HTC. By counterclaim, Gemalto contends that the patents are infringed by certain HTC smart phones. The cases concerning the two patents are distinct but it was convenient to hear them together because they both involve the same general area of technology. The technology relates to what are sometimes called smart cards or chip cards. </p>

All these claims save for claim 9 are alleged to be infringed by HTC’s sales of the devices in issue. Part of the issue of infringement involves s60(2) of the 1977 Act.  All the claims include the term “microcontroller” and a key argument is whether the HTC devices have microcontrollers at all.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In relation to validity, HTC contends that claims 1, 3, 8, 9, 15 and 18 are not entitled to the claimed priority date (October 1996) but only to the filing date (October 1997).  Any claim which is only entitled to the filing date is alleged to be obvious over an intervening publication called Cyberflex.  Any claim which is entitled to the priority date is said to lack novelty over two items of prior art, a paper by Caron and a paper by Pasman. Moreover any claim entitled to the priority date is said to be obvious.  Four starting points for obviousness are relied on: common general knowledge alone, Caron, Pasman and a patent application called ‘171. HTC also contends that all claims are unpatentable subject matter contrary to s1 (2) of the 1977 Act (Art 52 EPC) since they are to computer programs as such. HTC had an insufficiency plea but it was not pursued. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This action is concerned with programming computers. Computers have a number of elements: the central processing unit (CPU) which performs the computations, the memory and the input/output hardware to communicate with the outside world.  Modern computers are implemented on silicon chips.  A microprocessor chip is the chip which carries the CPU. In some systems the microprocessor chip may be connected by a system bus to other components such as memory chips and input/output devices to make a working computer. Other chips may have some memory and I/O devices on the same piece of silicon as the CPU.  Inevitably, since space is limited, the amount of memory which can be fitted on the same chip as the CPU is limited.  As technology has advanced, it has been possible to cram more and more circuitry onto a single piece of silicon.  Thus the CPUs have become much more powerful over time and the amount of memory which can be made available has increased.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There are various different kinds of computer memory. Random Access Memory or RAM is a memory used by a computer to store intermediate results which can be accessed relatively quickly. The memory is volatile in that the contents are lost when power is removed.  Read Only Memory or ROM is a type of memory which generally cannot be modified and is used to store programs or data what are not intended to change after manufacture. ROM is non-volatile, i.e. it retains data even when the power is off. Variants on ROM are PROM, EPROM and EEPROM. PROM is Programmable ROM, a form of non-volatile memory in which the contents are set by a user but once set cannot be changed.  EPROM is Erasable Programmable ROM, one example of which was a form of PROM in which the data could all be erased in one go using ultraviolet light. EEPROM is Electrically Erasable PROM, a non-volatile memory which can be erased and reprogrammed repeatedly, albeit much more slowly than RAM. Although the letters in the term ROM originally meant “read only”, the term ROM as it is used in EEPROM is really referring to the non-volatile nature of the memory.  FLASH memory is a kind of EEPROM.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Another kind of memory arising in this case is cache memory. Cache is used in computer architecture to reduce the access time for reading and/or writing data.  The principle works by placing into the cache memory a temporary copy of some of the data from the system’s main memory, that is the data which is currently being processed.  The data can be the instructions to be performed or data to be manipulated.  The data in cache is never unique because it is only ever a copy of data already in other memory in the system.  Cache memories are faster and generally more costly than other kinds.  They are located physically close to the CPU to speed up access times. </p>

Both contain computer chips.  Often in an embedded system there will be a single silicon chip which carries the CPU and all the memory and other functional elements necessary. By contrast a desktop or laptop computer will usually have a processor chip and separate memory chips and other things.   </p>

Each computer has an instruction set, a predefined set of instructions which the processor understands and can execute.  Once given a program containing such instructions, the computer can perform the instructions sequentially.  Typically the instructions are of one of three types.  An instruction can be to perform an operation on a value, to access memory to store or retrieve information or instructions, or to jump to another location in the program if required to do so.  The values the instruction is to operate upon are called operands.  In the instruction “add A to B”, A and B are the operands.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The instruction set of any processor is defined in binary code, and programs expressed in this form are known as machine code (or native code). Instructions in machine code are represented by numbers or opcodes, with each instruction having a unique opcode.  In order to make machine code more intelligible, one can replace opcodes with short mnemonic labels to stand in place of numbers, e.g. “ADD” instead of the numerical opcode for addition. These labels are also known as strings, since they are just strings of characters.  Strings may also be used to stand for operands or other constant values that appear repeatedly in the program. The resulting mode of expression is called assembly code or assembly language.  Assembly code is much easier to write and to understand than machine code.  By its nature, any assembly language is specific to the particular processor on whose instruction set it is based. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In order to execute a program written in assembly code, the program must first be transformed into machine code. This is done by a tool called an assembler, which translates the mnemonic labels into binary instructions ready for execution by the processor. The operation of an assembler may include steps designed to optimise the output binary file, which includes eliminating unnecessary code and making what remains more concise and more efficient to execute. Such optimisation typically involves multiple passes over the program, since each pass may create fresh opportunities for optimisation. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Assembly language is an example of a “low-level” programming language. “Lowlevel” means that the language is close to the basic instruction set understood by the processor, and thus requires relatively little translation in order to be executable by the processor. As such, low-level programming languages force the human programmer to do the work of translating the conceptual functions the program is intended to perform into terms which the processor will be able to handle. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">“High-level” programming languages are ones which are further from the processor’s basic instruction set, but which allow the programmer to employ more abstract concepts and express instructions more naturally (compared to low-level languages). The result is a language which lets the programmer write in terms of the problem to be solved, rather than having to think about how the program will run on the hardware. High-level languages thus move away from specific machine-focused instructions towards more powerful abstract concepts and commands, and so lend themselves to more fluent and more sophisticated programming. As a rule of thumb, the more high-level the programming language, the closer its instructions and syntax will be to plain English and the further they will be from the limited set of opcodes understood by the processor. High level languages include BASIC, FORTRAN, C, PASCAL and JAVA (or Java). </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In order for a program written in a high level language to work on a computer, that program has to be translated into machine code. There are two different approaches to this, using a compiler or using an interpreter. A compiler is a program which takes a program written in the high level language (the source code) and creates an entire program written in another language (the object code). The object code can be machine code.  In many cases a number of source files will cross refer to each other and also to other files containing libraries of code for standard functions.  In order to create a single executable program, a tool called a linker or link editor is used to consolidate all of the files into a single file and resolve all the cross-references. </p>

An interpreter interprets the high level language at run time, effectively line by line.  The software of the interpreter takes the original program as its input and works out what the result of executing that program should be and outputs the result. Generally using an interpreter is a less efficient way of executing a program than using a compiler but interpreters have other advantages which will emerge below. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A virtual machine is a kind of interpreter program which operates as if it were a computer processor for the input program. In other words it is a virtualised implementation of a hardware architecture with its own virtual instruction set and opcodes and so on.  The virtual machine may be designed to mimic a real computer or it may be a hypothetical machine.  From the point of view of the input program a virtual machine behaves exactly like a real hardware processor, executing instructions and so on.  Underpinning the performance of the virtual machine is a real machine on which the virtual machine is running. The virtual machine can only run its own instruction set by implementing each instruction in the instruction set of the underlying real machine. The correspondence between its instructions and those of the underlying hardware is often known as a dispatch table.  Although running a program on a virtual machine is bound to be slower than running the same program in machine code on the actual underlying processor, there are advantages to using virtual machines. Also, since modern computers run so fast, a virtual machine may still run application programs at an acceptable speed.  This allows the original executable code for arcade games to be run unchanged so that the original games can be played on  modern computers. An advantage of virtual machines is that because they take charge of executing the program, they can be designed to enforce security checks on any application being executed.  This may include verifying the trustworthiness of an application, and ring-fencing access to data held by the computer. </p>

The virtual machine may be a “stack machine” in which the (virtual) processor, rather than storing values in registers, stores them in stacks.  When a value is stored in a stack it is placed notionally on the top of the stack, above the previous entry.  The previous entry still exists, now one place further down the stack.  When data is retrieved from the stack, it is the value at the top of the stack which is read.

HTC submitted this could not simply be explained by the fact he was giving evidence in a second language and was indicative of a lack of credibility.  I do not agree.  On a number of occasions (although not all) the questions being asked were lengthy and would require careful thought by a native English speaker. The Professor also often used the laptop computer in court to read a live transcript of the questions, clearly as an aid to interpretation.  This also took up time.

A smart card usually comprises a single chip which has a CPU, RAM, ROM and other non-volatile memory, usually EEPROM or FLASH. It is generally supplemented by security sensors.  The card has a contact plate; the contacts put the card into contact with the outside environment.  The ROM contains the card’s program. The programs are stored during the manufacturing process. The EEPROM is used to store data.  Security is provided in various ways.  There may be sensors to detect attempts at reverse engineering.  The fact that that elements of the card are on a single silicon substrate prevents an attacker from probing the card and reading the data stored in it.  The card may execute cryptographic functions using keys present in the memory of the card which only the card and the transmitter know.

Many instruction sets will include an instruction such as “ADD X,Y”.  This means add X to Y or, to be more precise, it could mean take X, add Y to it, and make the new value of X the result of the sum.  The same instruction set may also contain another instruction “INC X” which means “increment X”, in other words add 1 to X, in other words make the new value of X the result of the sum of X plus 1.  Comparing ADD X,Y and INC X, it can be seen that ADD X,Y can be regarded as a generic instruction since any value Y can be added to X whereas INC X is a specific instruction since only the number 1 can be added to X. A human programmer or a compiler program has a choice. The single line of code “INC X” is identical to these two lines of code “MAKE Y = 1, ADD X,Y”.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in">One common general knowledge technique was “subsetting”.  If one is thinking about an approach which involves an interpreter for the code, it may be that the task in hand does not need to use all the features in the instruction set. For example some instruction sets include instructions for carrying out floating point arithmetic. These sorts of instructions may be useful for some applications but irrelevant for others.  So the team could decide to subset the language. A subset of the instruction set is defined which the interpreter will be able to interpret (say every instruction except those dealing with floating point numbers).  The interpreter is created on that basis. It is therefore a simpler interpreter to write since it does not have to handle floating point operations.  All programs have to be written using the instructions in the subset. A program may be used to verify that the code does not contain instructions outside the subset since they will not be understood. Dr Greaves explained and I accept that subsetting was a technique in common use by programmers working on embedded systems. Even if the skilled team was not focussed on programming an embedded system, the existence of the technique and its utility in that context was part of the common general knowledge. </p>

Dr Greaves described this as the compiler “tool chain”. There are only two important elements to which I need to draw attention. As I have mentioned already when a compiler works on source code to create an executable program it often seeks to optimise the code in order to make it smaller and more efficient to execute.  There are numerous kinds of optimisation technique.  One kind of optimisation which is relevant to this case is the replacement of generic instructions with specific ones since the specific instruction takes up fewer bytes than the generic one.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Another critical element in the compilation tool chain is linking. Programs often consist of a number of independent files of source code.  Some standard code used in many applications may be in a code library. A linker is used to link together the compiled versions of all these source code files into a single executable file. Linking also provides another opportunity for code optimisation.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There was no dispute that although Java was new at the relevant time, its existence was part of the common general knowledge.  The Java package as a whole or Java “platform” consisted of a number of components.  Java was a high level programming language.  Once code had been written in Java, it was compiled by the Java compiler to produce an intermediate form of code called byte code.  Once compiled to byte code, the computer files making up the program were called Class files. Byte code formed the code for a virtual machine called the Java Virtual Machine or JVM.  The JVM interpreted the byte code.  Thus the Java compiler was not machine specific, since it produced a program made up of byte code in the Class file format.  On the other hand the JVM would be machine specific. The result was that as long as a computer had a JVM installed on it, that computer could run programs which had been written in Java because the programs were presented as Class files.  This was very useful in the context of the internet.  It meant that software in the form of Class files could be made available from a website. As long as the user’s computer had a JVM, it did not matter what sort of computer it was. The users could all obtain the same Class files from a website and run the same program.  Java also had a number of security features.  Some of them arose from the fact that the byte code was going to run on a virtual machine, which had security built in. All of this was part of the common general knowledge of the skilled addressee. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The JVM had a number of functional components.  As well as an interpreter or “execution engine” which interpreted the byte code, the JVM also carried out linking, optimisation of the code and verification.  The view of Prof. Paradinas was that the skilled team would regard the JVM as a single entity for running Class files and would have no particular reason to divide it up internally.  Gemalto pointed out that Dr Greaves accepted that some people would just be users and would not care how the JVM works internally.  Nevertheless I find that the idea that the JVM had consisted of components with different functions would be common general knowledge.  The skilled team would know it was comparatively large and would know, without having to be told or reminded, that the JVM was not merely an execution engine for byte code but carried out other functions such as linking and security/verification tasks.  However I think Prof. Paradinas’ evidence which I have referred to reflects something important about the skilled team in that, without any prompt to think more carefully about the JVM, the skilled team would not have more than a superficial interest in the contents of the JVM.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Another issue about Java and the common general knowledge was whether the skilled team regarded the Java Class file as “sacrosanct” (a word used by Prof. Paradinas).  The advantage of portability between different computers was a key aspect of Java’s importance and a key reason it had become common general knowledge so quickly after it had been launched. That portability comes from the portability of Class files but I reject the argument that this had a relevant impact on the mindset of the skilled team in the sense that it might discourage them or act as a disincentive to alter Class files in some way. This portability was an important commercial matter but it was not a technical reason why one would not modify Class files. The skilled team would know very well that modifying the Class files would sacrifice portability but would also understand that this was a trade off. Whether it was worthwhile in a given situation would be a matter to take into account in deciding what to do.   </p>

The main preferred embodiment is a way of running Java programs on a smart card or integrated circuit card.   The way this works is that the program is written in the Java high level language as normal and compiled to the normal Class file format using the normal Java compiler.  Normally this produces multiple Class files.  Next a converter is used to consolidate and compress the files to produce a single “card class file” and the card class file is then loaded onto the smart card using a conventional card loader [paragraph 0075].  The smart card contains a card Java virtual machine (Card JVM) which is used to interpret applications which are contained on the card [paragraph 0073].  In practice the Card JVM is a sort of cut down version of the normal JVM, having regard to the fact that the memory available on smart cards is much less than is usually available to computers which run a JVM.  This way the problem posed in paragraph [0006] is solved.  Programs written in a high level language (Java) can be run on a smart card.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:0.14in;text-indent:0.50in">I would stress only two points from this summary, given the importance of the issue of construction in this case. The first is that the exercise is one of construing the language of the claims in the context of the specification. The meaning of that language is informed by the technical understanding gained from reading the specification. Thus the specification has an important role in understanding the meaning of the language used. It is not, however, a proper approach to construction to start with the specification and ask what a patentee who has made that disclosure might be intending to claim, and then to shoe-horn the meaning of the language of the claim to fit with that understanding, whatever language he has actually used. To do so would be to afford supremacy to the description over the claims, contrary to the guidance given by Article 69 EPC and its protocol.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:0.14in;text-indent:0.50in">The second point is this. The patentee may have described a number of embodiments or examples of increasing sophistication in the body of the specification. Having done so, the patentee has the freedom to set the generality of his claim at the level of his choosing. There is no presumption that he will have decided to pitch his claim at the level of the most sophisticated embodiment. It is the claims which will tell the skilled reader at what level the patentee has decided to stake his monopoly claim. The skilled reader would not be justified in assuming that the patentee has elected to claim the features of the most sophisticated embodiment, so as to compel the conclusion that those features are read into the claims. Equally, as sub-paragraph (v) in the above summary indicates, the skilled reader does not assume that the patentee is aiming at the widest possible construction consistent with his purpose.”  </p>

The word is not an expression used in ordinary English outside this technical field.  It is a term of art and evidence is admissible to discern its meaning.  This is in effect an exercise in considering the common general knowledge of a skilled addressee.  Next I will consider how the skilled addressee would understand the patent.

The small special-purpose computers are or were sometimes called “single-board computers” although Axelson explains that term can be misleading since the computer does not need to have a single circuit board and (by then) many other types of computers like laptops were now being manufactured on a single board as well. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Single chip computers were useful for embedded systems and no doubt that is why the term became associated with them.  At some stage the expression “single chip microcontroller” was used.  Plainly the point of the expression is to emphasise that this sort of microcontroller is one of the single chip kind, with the CPU, memory and other things on a single chip.  Necessarily using the term “single chip” to qualify microcontroller shows that, at least at one stage, not all microcontrollers were single chips.  Dr Greaves was asked about the phrase “single chip microcontroller” (Day 4/p458ln25 – p459 ln24).  He said:  </p>

An example of a ROMless microcontroller which Dr Greaves was aware of from the relevant time was a chip called the 8031 which was in the 8051 family but had no ROM on board.  Part of the argument advanced by Gemalto was that the existence of the term ROMless microcontroller showed that a microcontroller did not as a matter of necessity have to have on-chip ROM. The argument may be flawless as a matter of logic but I do not accept it follows that just because a skilled person would understand what a ROMless microcontroller was, this displaces the point that what a skilled person would take as the typical meaning of the term microcontroller was a single chip with the CPU, memory (and the I/O interfaces) on that one chip.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Other examples put to Dr Greaves showed that manufacturers were selling chips called microcontrollers which accessed off-chip memory. One example was an SGS Thomson ST10R165.  This chip could access 16Mbytes of external RAM or ROM.   Another example put to Dr Greaves was the Zilog Z86C93. This was a ROMless microcontroller which could access 64 Kbytes of external memory. Dr Greaves’ position on the Z86C93 was the same as for all the examples put to him. Chips are made in families, in this case Z8 family of microcontrollers well known in the early 1990s.  It is a ROMless version of a microcontroller and is part of the family. Other members of the family will have things on-chip. Dr Greaves was asked a number of times if it was a misuse of the term microcontroller to use it in the context of a ROMless device or a device which accessed external memory.  In summary his view was that these were variants on the norm.  </p>

It is no fault of Dr Greaves but it is not the question I have to decide.  When experts assist the court in understanding what technical terms meant to a person skilled in the art, if a term has a loose meaning or is capable of multiple meanings, then so be it.

I think Mr Tappin is right.  Mr Mellor did rely in argument on an example of a microcontroller in which the RAM and ROM were off-chip, which he had put to Dr Greaves in cross-examination.  It was a page from a magazine called Analog Dialogue from 1994 and described a chip set to implement the baseband portion of a GSM mobile phone handset.  One of the chips in the set was an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) which includes an embedded H8 16-bit microcontroller which the system diagram showed accessed offchip RAM and ROM. Dr Greaves accepted this was like the other ROMless microcontrollers which had been put to him.  For what it is worth it is not clear to me that the microcontroller itself had no on-chip memory.  </p>

I agree in that the evidence is clear that there is no universal definition.   The term is used in different senses in different contexts.  Mr Mellor also submitted that the conclusion to be drawn from the evidence is that “microcontroller” did not have the precise definition put forward by Dr Greaves.  It is quite clear the term was not one with a single well defined meaning, but that does not mean the expression was devoid of meaning nor does it mean that Gemalto’s submission is right, that by 1996 a microcontroller was simply a controller which contains a microprocessor.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in">I find that the skilled addressee would be familiar with the word in 1996.  It was used in a variety of senses. There are certain chips which in 1996 were called microcontrollers.  That is one sense in which the word was used.  If you told a skilled person that a chip was a microcontroller and told them nothing more about it, they would think they knew what you meant and would expect it to contain, on a single silicon substrate, a CPU, memory (RAM and ROM) and I/O interface devices.  Thus manufacturers could sell chips called microcontrollers irrespective of the use to which they were going to be put.  No doubt in general they were best suited to be used in embedded systems and were in fact used for that application but whatever the chip was to be used for, the chip itself was a microcontroller. This meaning of the term was the normal usage by those skilled in the art in 1996.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in">An extended version of the normal usage covered variants on microcontroller chips, such as ROMless microcontrollers. These shared many of the characteristics of typical microcontrollers but in such a case the word was being used in an extended sense.  Another extension of the normal usage related to microcontroller chips which could access off-chip memory. These clearly existed. However one thing about all microcontroller chips was that on a single silicon chip there was more than just a CPU.  Normally the chip also had I/O interface devices and memory.  I am not satisfied I was shown any example of a microcontroller chip with no on-chip memory (ignoring registers) and I reject the idea that a skilled person using the language in its normal or extended sense would be comfortable calling a chip with no on-chip memory a microcontroller.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in">A different sense in which the term was used was to refer to the computer in an embedded or dedicated system.  Now if one pointed a skilled person to a washing machine and asked them what was inside controlling the machine, they might say a microcontroller. That would be true irrespective of the chip actually being used.  It might be a standard 8051 microcontroller but there is no reason in principle why the microcontroller inside a washing machine might not be a board with an 8080 microprocessor on it as well as associated external RAM and ROM and I/O interfaces.  That usage of the term microcontroller was not referring to a chip as such at all.  This is the sense in which Gemalto contends the word should be interpreted, as a controller which contains a microprocessor.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in">A point arose about whether a microcontroller could have cache.  By 1996 the skilled person would know that some microprocessors had on-chip cache.  Dr Greaves said that the skilled person would never describe something with only a CPU and cache on-chip as a microcontroller. Prof. Paradinas said that cache was more part of the microprocessor than the microcontroller, by which I understood him to mean that cache, like registers, are part of the architecture of the processor itself.  A chip with a CPU which has only cache and no other on-chip memory (ignoring registers) is not within either the normal usage of the term microcontroller I have identified nor is it within the extended version. It is not a microcontroller chip.  On the other hand the presence of cache on the chip has nothing to do with the wider definition of microcontroller which relates to a computer in an embedded system. If a computer exercising control in an embedded system had cache, that does not stop it being within the wider definition of microcontroller.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in">What about the patentee’s purpose? HTC submitted that this assisted their construction because the problem being described in the patent is that to run a Java application needs a JVM but the JVM, which is large, will not fit into the highly constrained memory on a microcontroller chip.  Gemalto submitted that it was not correct to take the specific problem addressed in a patent specification and use that as a justification for reading limitations into a claim which are simply absent.   I think there some force in Gemalto’s point.  Inventions often arise from a particular problem faced by an inventor which is described in detail in the specification.  Once the solution has been found it is often possible to generalise and so to write a claim which is more broadly based that the particular problem addressed.  In this case the fact that claim 1 is not limited to Java is an example. However HTC retorts that the reference to the problem as they describe it is in the background section of the patent, where one is entitled to expect more general ideas.  Nevertheless, looking at the patent as a whole, I do not accept that discerning the inventor’s purpose helps to resolve this dispute.  The problem addressed is concerned with implementing high level languages when resources are limited.  Microcontrollers can have limited resources whether one is using the term in HTC’s sense or in Gemalto’s sense. In this case purpose is neutral.  </p>

Mr Mellor submitted to the contrary; he said that “microprocessor” here is shorthand for “microprocessor based computer” mentioned in the previous paragraph. That is wrong. For example the paragraph states “<span style="font-style:italic">a microprocessor typically has a central processing unit that requires certain external components (e.g., memory, input controls and output controls) to function properly</span>”.  The term microprocessor here is being used to refer to a chip not a whole computer system.  The contrast being drawn in paragraph [0007] is between the amount of memory which the chip can access.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Paragraph [0021] received a lot of attention.  It includes the sentence “<span style="font-style:italic">at least a portion of the memory may be located in the processor</span>”.  Gemalto submitted this meant that the specification was acknowledging the possibility that the memory may not be located in the processor, i.e. may not be on the same chip as the processor.  Thus Gemalto submitted this favoured their construction. I do not agree. It is preceded by the sentence, “<span style="font-style:italic">The processor may be a microcontroller</span>.”  Like much of this section of the patent, this sentence appears to be based on the footing that the invention need not be a microcontroller.  However the claimed invention is to a microcontroller and one is left with the impression that this paragraph is not well drafted. The skilled addressee would be wary of drawing conclusions and that is enough to undermine Gemalto’s reliance on it. Moreover, if I was required to give a meaning to the relevant sentence, my view is the following.  As I read these two sentences, they are in fact talking about a single case.  The processor may be a microcontroller and if it is then that will have the consequence that at least a portion of the memory will be located in the processor, i.e. on the same chip. I do not accept this paragraph assists Gemalto.  At best this is an indication that the patentee has contemplated what I have called the extended version of the normal usage of the word, referring to a microcontroller chip with on-chip memory albeit that it can access some off-chip memory too.  </p>

HTC contended that these phrases mean storing the code in the non-volatile on-chip memory of a microcontroller.

Gemalto did not agree.  It submitted there was no reason to read this limitation into the word “loaded” and the term “loaded in memory” was apt to cover a case in which code was put into some cache memory when the program was being run.

That is to a method of programming and is a generalisation of the process described in the patent where an application written in Java (a first programming language) is compiled to byte code (a first intermediate code) which is interpretable by a first intermediate code virtual machine (the JVM) and then the byte code is converted to a second intermediate code (the Card JVM byte code) which is interpretable by a second intermediate code virtual machine (the Card JVM).  In the patent it is clear that the steps so far do not take place on the microcontroller.  Nevertheless claim 15 is to a method of programming a microcontroller and the last step of the claim is “<span style="font-style:italic">loading the second intermediate code into the memory of the microcontroller</span>”.  In its context in claim 15 this is talking about storing the code in the memory of the microcontroller, it is not talking about the point at which the code is executed.  After all the claim is to a method of programming, not to a method of running a program.  I am sure that in claim 15 the term “loading … into the memory of the microcontroller” is referring to putting the code in a place where it can be kept in the memory of the microcontroller so that it can be run when needed.   </p>

(I suppose if the microcontroller in question was one of the kinds which could also access off-chip memory as well then there is no reason why that should be excluded.) Accordingly “loaded in memory” means put into the memory of the microcontroller.  That could be ROM or FLASH but it could also be RAM (as long as the power was kept on).  It is not talking about the mechanics of the execution process and has nothing to do with the process of using cache memory which some processors employ. The act of copying some data from the system’s main memory into cache memory is not what the skilled team would understand the inventor to be using this language to mean. </p>

Carrying out this conversion means that the jump destinations as they were before conversion would probably be wrong.  Once the conversion process is finished, step (e) is needed.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in">The reason for replacing specific instructions with generic ones is as follows.  The task of an interpreter program is to read the source code, identify the instructions contained in it and translate them appropriately.  In effect the interpreter has to look up each instruction in a dictionary.  The larger the instruction set the interpreter has to be able to read, the larger the dictionary.  An interpreter which only has to deal with a smaller instruction set will have a smaller dictionary.  It is likely therefore to be smaller and to run faster than an interpreter dealing with a larger instruction set.  Thus as long as the instruction set includes a suitable generic instruction, further specific instructions could be replaced by the generic one, reducing the size of the dictionary and so reducing the size of the interpreter program and speeding it up.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Step (c) relates to a process of modifying byte code operands from references using strings to references using unique identifiers.  In the byte code the operands may be identified by strings.  So an instruction to add a value representing the Value Added Tax onto a value representing the price of an item can be written in a way which is understandable: “ADD VAT to PRICE” instead of writing it using incomprehensible references to the relevant memory locations for the operands.  However strings like VAT and PRICE take up space, generally one byte per character.  Step (c) replaces the strings with “unique identifiers”. Although the claim is not limited to this, the unique identifiers can be simple numbers to identify the value concerned.  In the example, if the unique identifiers can be numbers in a single byte, the eight bytes needed for VAT and PRICE are reduced to two bytes. </p>

In fact in the Java class file the identifying strings are not stored with the byte code, they form a separate list called the constant pool and the operands actually stored with the byte codes are integers which refer to the entries in the constant pool.  Nevertheless the space saving is real enough because the class files contain all the strings.  If the strings are replaced by smaller “unique identifiers” then space is saved. </p>

One reason why renumbering of byte codes might be worthwhile is that it can allow the interpreter program to be more efficient by grouping instructions with similar operands together.  The grouping means that fewer lines of code in the interpreter program are needed to process the instructions.  This is described in the patent at paragraph [0087].   </p>

In holding that the priority claim was a good one, the Board (two of whose members were Peter Ford, later H.H. Judge Ford, and Gerald Paterson, later the author of The European Patent System) accepted an opinion from English counsel (Nicholas Pumfrey, later Pumfrey J.) stating that (i) the assignment of the invention (which post-dated the making of the invention) was effective in law even though the assignment of the patent application was not, and (ii) although the assignment was ineffective in law B had acquired an equitable interest in the patent application which was a proprietorial interest. Although it could well be argued that point (i) was enough, the Board seems to have regarded point (ii) as significant as well. </p>

One area into which it diversified was smart cards.  In the early 1990s the Schlumberger group had two divisions: “Oilfield Services” and “Measurement and Systems”.  A sub-division called Electronic Transactions covered smart cards.  It was a sub-division of Measurement and Systems.  A business plan for the project which led to the invention (called project OSMAN) was dated 7 July 1995.  The document is in the name of “Schlumberger ET/Cards division”.  It was decided to undertake the project in the USA.  The group company which operated Schlumberger’s smart card business in the USA was STI.  However STI lacked the infrastructure required for the project. The decision was made to use a facility in Austin, Texas.  This was a facility owned by Schlumberger’s Oilfield Services division which operated through Schlumberger Technology Corporation (STC).  The key work which led to the invention took place between spring and autumn 1996.  Shortly after filing the US priority document Schlumberger announced its new smart card, Cyberflex.  </p>

M. Piou explains why this is so in detail.  I should note that in making this point M. Piou is equating Schlumberger’s Electronic ET/ Cards division with STI as far as the USA is concerned.  It is not necessary to set out all the points M. Piou relies on since his evidence was not challenged.  An example is that when Schlumberger needed a licence from Sun Microsystems, the originators of Java, to use the Java trade mark, the agreement was between Sun and STI.  Finally M. Piou states that no additional payment was made to Mr Guthery or Mr Wilkinson for the November 1997 assignment. </p>

HTC argued that although in English law section 39 of the 1977 Act provides that an invention made by an employee in this way would belong to his employer (save for certain exceptions which do not, or to be more exact do not appear to, apply), that section did not apply because, by s43(2) of the 1977 Act, sections 39 to 42 do not apply unless, at the time the invention was made, certain criteria are satisfied, both of which require a connection to the UK (employee or employer) and neither of which is satisfied.  So, Mr Tappin argued, as a matter of English law s 7 of the 1977 Act applies but s39 does not.  Thus the right to be granted a patent belongs primarily to the inventor (s7(2)(a)).

They pointed out that neither side had led any evidence of US law and that the court should and can only proceed on the assumption that the applicable law is the same as English law.  Section 43(2) contains limitations on the application of s39 to non-UK employees but that is on the obvious basis that foreign law, if proved, would apply instead.  Absent any evidence that a different provision applies, the presumption means that a provision equivalent to s39 should be assumed.   </p>

In order to decide the relative rights to an invention as between the inventor and his employer when the person was working in Texas and was employed by an American company, I must apply US/Texan law.  Gemalto’s counsel are right that the reason s43(2) of the 1977 Act disapplies s39 cannot be to create a different English law of the ownership of foreign inventions, the section is disapplied because as a matter of English law, the correct law to apply to that question is the local foreign law.  Since I have no evidence of the applicable US/Texan law the only basis on which I can decide this issue is to assume US/Texan law is the same as what English law would be applied to events which took place in England.  On that basis section 39 would have the effect that the invention belonged to STC.  In taking this approach, as Gemalto’s counsel submitted, I am not applying s39 to an employee in the USA, I am presuming that the corresponding law is the same and applying that.  </p>

As Floyd J said in the next paragraph of his judgment in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Samsung</span>, the test for claiming priority in respect of the same invention has more substance, and is less formal, than that.  It is certainly not an obviousness test (para 228 of <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Abbott</span> above).  One respect in which it is clear that the test for priority is not or at least not only an added matter test is in relation to enablement.  Enablement is certainly one of the requirements for a successful claim to priority and this applies both in the sense that what is specifically disclosed must actually be enabled (<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Asahi</span> [1991] RPC 485) and also in the sense described by Lord Hoffmann in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Biogen</span> [1997] RPC 1 when he held that the claim in question lost priority because it covered other ways of achieving the goal which owed nothing to the principle disclosed.

Likewise there is nothing in Art.87 which compels or suggests this conclusion. And Art.4H of the Paris Convention is positively against it.

Inventors and their advisors would have to start worrying not only about the technical information disclosed in the document but how it was to be claimed: have I drafted my main claim or consistory clause broadly enough? That is not the purpose of the system: the purpose at this point is to get the information justifying the later claim into a patent office of a Union country. If you do that, you can have your priority, whether you express that in a proposed claim, consistory clause, statement of invention, other text or drawing or in any combination of these. Time is of the essence because the world-wide system (except for the Americans) works on the first to file basis. The detailed framing of a claim based on that information may then be done within the Convention year.” </p>

They also show in my judgment that entitlement to priority is a different question from the other familiar elements of patent validity: sufficiency of disclosure, novelty, inventive step and added matter.  It is its own test which arises in its own context and with its own policy considerations.  It contains aspects which are common to other areas. The test for enablement must be the same as in other contexts and the test for disclosure (clearly and unambiguously derivable, explicitly or implicitly) must be the same whether one is looking at a priority document for priority or an application for added matter.  However I agree with Mr Tappin’s submission that as between priority and added matter, one is looking at the disclosure for a different purpose. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This has a bearing on another aspect of HTC’s case.  Part of HTC’s case on priority included a submission that because a dependent claim (in fact claim 7) was not entitled to priority, but is encompassed within claim 1, it follows that claim 1 cannot be entitled to priority either.  Gemalto submitted this was wrong in law because otherwise an opponent, by citing some inventive improvement not disclosed in the priority document but merely covered by a granted claim, would automatically knock out the priority of the claim, a proposition Gemalto argued only had to be stated to be rejected.  I agree with Gemalto up to a point but care is needed not to state things too broadly.  If a specific feature is not disclosed in the priority document then a claim that expressly refers to that feature must lose priority.  However the fact that a broad claim will cover something (among other things) is irrelevant to priority as long as the priority document supports the broad claim at its level of generality.  That conclusion is at the heart of the reason of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Biogen</span>.  If the broad claim covers things which owe nothing to the disclosure of the priority document then the priority document will not support the broad claim and priority will be lost, as happened in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Biogen</span> on its facts, but that is a different matter.  I do not believe Kitchin J was seeking to say anything different.  All the passage in paragraph 122 means is that if the claim is one for which partial or multiple priorities are to be ascribed, the use of generic wording does not prevent that from happening.  </p>

It explains that due to the severe resource constraints of “today’s smart card single-chip computers” it is impossible to fit the current smallest Java environment on a smart card and describes “a yet-smaller version of the Java virtual machine and runtime environment which is specifically tailored for use on smart cards”. In some places in the document this is called a JavaCard virtual machine. The extent to which the priority document discloses a converter is controversial and I will deal with it below.   </p>

For example when section 3 is read in the context of the priority document as a whole, it would be clear to the skilled reader that it is supposed to lead to compacting the application program specifically (see p5 line 15 of the priority document).  That is important.  Also Dr Greaves’ approach did not take full account of the words “all” and “unique” in the paragraph.  As Prof Paradinas explained, if <span style="font-style:italic">all</span> text strings are translated then this must include the text strings in the constant pool of the class file.  Replacing these will undoubtedly reduce the space needed on the card for the secondary form of the program.

In other words something (call it a converter) has converted the compiled form of a Java application into a secondary form and made the form which goes onto the card smaller.

This skilled person is very familiar, as a matter of common general knowledge, with the idea that there are ways of processing the code to change the size of a program.  This aspect of the skilled reader’s common general knowledge means that when they read the priority document, in my judgment they would understand the idea of the namespace map as a way of compacting the code but they would know there were other ways of doing it.  The priority document does not simply teach that the namespace map could be used, it expressly draws attention to the fact that this is part of a general idea of achieving time and space efficiency.  The teaching is explaining that space efficiency can be achieved by post processing the application program to allow the interpreter program to be smaller (section 2) and by post processing the application program to make that program smaller as well (section 3).  A skilled team given the priority document who decided to reduce the size of the application for time and space efficiency using other techniques apart from the namespace map would not think they were doing anything different from the principles of general application the inventors of the priority document have taught.  In my judgment the converter referred to in claim 1 is entitled to the priority of the priority document.

One point was that the processing referred to in section 3 may only relate to the constant pool in a Java class file and not directly to the byte code operands but I do not accept that this is a relevant distinction.  In the context of a Java class file, a reference to byte code operands as “references using identifying strings” would be understood by a person skilled in the art as taking into account the fact that inside a class file the strings themselves are actually in the constant pool, separate from but cross-referenced to the byte code.   </p>

The premise is correct (renumbering does not change the size of the application) but the conclusion that priority is lost does not follow. Claim 8 is dependent on claim 1. All this combined claim requires is that the converter has to reduce the size of the application (claim 1) and also has to renumber the bytecodes (claim 8(d)). There is no requirement in the combined claim that renumbering has to cause a size reduction. Thus I find that elements 8(d) would be entitled to priority. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Next I need to consider the impact on the priority of claim 8 of the claims from which it depends.  In the section on construction above I have identified that claim 8 can be notionally regarded as two claims: claim 8 plus 4 plus 1 and claim 8 plus 7 plus 1.  The parties’ arguments did not chase every possible permutation of the arguments but at this point I need to decide if either of these notional claims is entitled to priority.  Claim 4 is related to the same namespace map disclosure which supports 8(c) and so that claim has priority. However although sub-setting of the Java byte code is disclosed in the priority document (page 29) I do not believe the idea that the converter will verify the sub-setting is disclosed and so claim 7 is not entitled to priority.  Thus claim 8 plus 7 plus 1 is only entitled to the filing date irrespective of elements 8(c) or (d).  That leaves claim 8 plus 4 plus 1.  Strictly I should also include claim 3 because unless the claim is limited to Java, it loses priority. </p>

As I addressed in the section on construction, the claim expressly relates to a process including all five steps (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) and then requires the converter to perform at least one of those steps.  In my judgment this claim is not entitled to multiple priorities because at its heart is a process consisting of all five steps.  They are not alternatives.  I can see that claim 18 with the same five sub-paragraphs is drafted in a different way, without reference to a process including all five steps, and that might raise different issues.  However it cannot make any difference that claim 8 might have been drafted differently.  I find that claim 8 is not entitled to multiple priorities.  </p>

The material discloses that Cyberflex is a smart card that runs programs written in Java. There is a CD-ROM with software called MakeSolo.  Once the programmer has written a Java application, MakeSolo prepares the Java class file for loading onto the card. The MakeSolo software processes the Java byte code (from a standard Java compiler) and checks code for compliance with the Java Card API Specification.  Certain Java byte codes are not supported: for example Cyberflex does not support floating point, exceptions and threads.  The card contains an operating system and a virtual machine called Solo. The Solo Virtual Machine (SVM) is an interpreter which translates the byte code into instructions which the microprocessor on the card can understand.  The virtual machine on the smart card takes up only 4KB of memory.  In comparison the normal full JVM needs 150KB.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is no dispute that the Cyberflex materials disclose all the features of claim 1 save for those in sub-paragraph (b). The only difference between the claim and Cyberflex arises from whatever it is that the MakeSolo program does.  It is clear that MakeSolo is a post processor of code.  The code it starts with is a compiled form of a program written in a high level language. MakeSolo processes that code into a form suitable for interpretation by the interpreter. To that extent it is a converter as I have construed the claim.  However, as Dr Greaves said in his first report, it is not absolutely clear that MakeSolo will reduce the size of the compiled code. I agree. The difference which exists between Cyberflex and claim 1 is whether MakeSolo reduces the size of the code. That is the only difference.   </p>

Many people reading Cyberflex would do so with a view merely to consider whether to buy and use it.  Nevertheless the materials comprise a technical teaching which describes something.  Although no doubt it would involve a lot of work, in my judgment no inventive step is required for anyone skilled in the art (regardless of the precise definition or composition of that team) to embark on developing their own product based on the ideas described in these materials.  In other words the skilled team would not simply be buying the Cyberflex system as a user and speculating about how it might operate, the team is considering what is taught with a view to producing their own system. </p>

Gemalto submitted this was an exercise in hindsight.  I do not agree.  The Cyberflex materials explain that the virtual machine on the card is 4KB in size as compared to the 150KB size of the normal Java Virtual Machine.  It is obvious that steps which are carried out by the JVM normally, such as linking, optimisation and verification, are being carried out off-card in the Cyberflex system.  No hindsight is involved.  I also do not accept the argument that the skilled person in this context does not know the details of what is contained inside a JVM.  Since the Solo Virtual Machine is clearly a cut down version of the JVM, in order for the team to even begin to contemplate creating their own version of the Solo Virtual Machine, the team has to have an understanding of the functions carried out inside a JVM.  This team will not treat the JVM as a monolithic block.   </p>

In closing Gemalto took a general point about Dr Greaves’ approach which would apply to all claims.  Gemalto submitted that in cross-examination Dr Greaves accepted that his approach to obviousness over Cyberflex utilised a number of building blocks and pieces of deduction that he had used in the section of his report on obviousness over common general knowledge alone at the priority date.  This came down to two criticisms.  The first was that there was no basis for the idea of using an interpreter on a smart card to run applications originally written in Java - but Cyberflex puts this very idea before the skilled team.  The second was about whether all the details of the functions of the JVM were part of the common general knowledge.  However starting from Cyberflex the team would find this out if they did not already have that information.  Without these points the criticism has little force and I reject Gemalto’s submission about Dr Greaves’ approach in relation to Cyberflex.   </p>

Prof. Paradinas accepted that the skilled person would know this.  Cyberflex expressly teaches that certain Java bytecodes are not supported, i.e. that there has been subsetting.

The intermediate code in the Caron article corresponds to the first intermediate code in claim 15. As a matter of construction, all claim 15 requires is that the first intermediate code be interpretable by a virtual machine. It cannot matter in principle whether a virtual machine for the code is actually described along with the code itself. The disclosure in Caron is that the code is code with the capacity to be interpreted by a virtual machine. That is all the claim requires.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in">The process disclosed in Caron includes the idea that the source code written in C is compiled into an intermediate language and then translated into another code.  Prof. Paradinas calls the translated code “assembled machine code”. Whether or not that is a fair description does not matter as long as it is remembered that in Caron’s Virtual Code approach that “assembled machine code” is code for a virtual machine on the card. In claim 1, as a matter of construction, the word “converter” simply means the thing which post processes the compiled form into a minimized form suitable for interpretation by the interpreter.  As I understand Prof. Paradinas’ evidence here, it is based on a narrower construction of the term “converter”. Prof. Paradinas construction of “converter” covers a post processor which takes compiled code and ends up with “compiled code” but not a post processor which starts with compiled code and ends up with “assembled machine code”. I reject that distinction. There is no basis for it in the specification. All the claim requires for a post processor to be a converter is that the code produced by the converter satisfies the requirements in the claim (suitable for interpretation by the interpreter and in a minimized form).  Prof. Paradinas accepted that the process of translation would involve optimisation which would reduce the size of the code. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Pasman was published in 1979. It relates to the use of a high-level language (Pascal) on what is now regarded as an early 8 bit microprocessor called the 8080.  Also used in Pasman is a minicomputer called the DEC 10. At the time the term “minicomputer” was used to refer to larger, more powerful computers than microprocessor based microcomputers. The idea is to use a high level language to reduce the programming effort in writing applications for the microcomputer.  The problem is that the resulting programs are too large for a microcomputer so Pasman wants an implementation which gives efficient memory usage.  Pasman refers to a portable compiler for Pascal called the P-compiler which produces a code called P-symbolic code.  This consists of assembler statements for a “hypothetical computer”. In other words, P-symbolic code is intermediate code which could be interpreted by an interpreter.  Pasman also refers to an assembler (the P-assembler) which translates the P-symbolic code into Pmachine code.  A DEC 10 minicomputer was used to perform all compilation and assembly of the Pascal and P-symbolic code, prior to loading onto the 8080.  The 8080 had limited amount of memory available. It could access 64Kbytes (all offchip).  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Pasman describes three possible approaches to generating code to run on the 8080.  The first two involve creating machine code for the 8080 itself.  The third is the idea of generating code for a “P-processor” and interpreting it on the 8080.  Pasman notes that the first two approaches would produce two or three times as much code as the third, and proposes to write an interpreter for P-machine code.   Optimisation of the code is described as part of the process of creating P-machine code from P-symbolic code.  One such optimisation involves replacing generic opcodes with specific ones in order to save space. These optimisations are performed by the P-assembler.  In other words, on the DEC 10 the compiled intermediate code produced by the P-compiler is being post processed by the P-assembler to produce optimised code suitable for interpretation by the interpreter on the 8080.  </p>

In his first report Prof. Paradinas gave three distinctions between Pasman and claim 1.  One was that Pascal was not the right kind of high level language but, as with Caron, that point was abandoned by Gemalto.  Another was a similar argument to the one I have rejected over Caron that the assembler in Pasman is part of the compilation stage and that the intermediate P symbolic code has no practical use.  Both points are irrelevant or are based on a construction of claim 1 I do not accept.  Finally Prof. Paradinas said the 8080 was not a microcontroller because all its memory was offchip.  While that accords with the construction I have arrived at, it is not the construction of microcontroller advanced by Gemalto in closing. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Prof. Paradinas said that the idea of using high level languages to develop microcontroller applications was not really accepted.  He said it was not really done save for the CQL card with which he had been involved.  In his oral evidence Prof. Paradinas said that the culture in the smart card industry was an “electronics” culture rather than a “computer science” culture, a point which was seeking to emphasise that the focus was on assembly language programming and hardware.  Prof. Paradinas said the “first language” of such individuals was assembly language.  This supports Gemalto’s view of the skilled person. </p>

The point of these references was to support Dr Greaves’ view that those skilled in art were aware of the desirability of programming microcontrollers in high level languages.  The references showed microcontroller manufacturers producing microcontroller chips designed to run applications programmed in high level languages.  The Atmel document stated that high level languages, with C being the most widely used, are rapidly becoming the standard programming methodology for embedded microcontrollers.  In his answers Prof. Paradinas said that there was in fact some demand for programming smart cards in high level languages and said that high level languages were used for programming some microcontrollers but not all microcontrollers.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in">The conclusions I draw from the evidence on this issue are as follows.  First I believe the evidence was clear that those working in smart cards at all material times were well aware that programming applications in high level languages was a desirable thing to do in some circumstances.  Two examples will suffice.  The Caron Thesis, which reflects work done up to 1994, refers to the C_Card project begun in 1990 using a high level language to meet the need to program more complex applications.  Slides from a CardTech /SecurTech ’96 conference in May 1996 refer to a “Smart card management and application generator” which allows applications to be written in a high level language.  Those working in this field knew it was desirable and knew that the major problem was that the size constraints made the process of programming in a high level language difficult.   </p>

A number of the documents relied on by HTC dated from after 1993.  I find that whatever the position was in 1993, by the priority date in October 1996, the idea of programming a smart card in a high level language was a very familiar idea to those working in that field.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Third, I believe care needs to be taken in necessarily equating the smart card industry with microcontrollers in general.  Although microcontroller chips were used in smart cards, the use of microcontrollers was not limited to smart cards.  Prof. Paradinas’ experience was very much focussed on smart cards.  I have no reason to doubt his characterisation of the people in the smart card industry in 1993 as people with an “electronics” culture focussed on programming in assembly language.  However the patent claims are not limited to smart cards or to microcontrollers in smart cards.  Even in 1993 there was a wider microcontroller industry, not focussed specifically on smart cards. </p>

There are twelve entries prior to 1996 and a number of high level languages are mentioned (C, Pascal, Java and Basic).

He explained in his first expert’s report that before reading the 865 patent he was asked to consider the disciplines which would have been included in a team tasked with developing a microcontroller (such as a smart card) which could be programmed in a high level language.  In cross-examination he explained that he approached this as if he had been asked to consider how to solve a problem.  Gemalto submitted that teams actually tasked with this problem did not exist in fact and submitted that this meant Dr Greaves’ instructions necessarily entailed pointers to the idea and objective of using high level languages on microcontrollers.  His second report indicated that these early discussions included compilers and interpreters.  Gemalto submitted this also indicated that impermissible hindsight was involved.  Another submission of Gemalto’s was that a reference to memory constraints before Dr Greaves had read the patent meant he had approached the patent with a mindset exclusively about microcontrollers with memory constraints.  Finally, arising from a muddle which Dr Greaves got into in cross-examination, Gemalto submitted that it was not clear whether the section of Dr Greaves’ report which related to obviousness over common general knowledge alone had been prepared, as Gemalto contended it should have been, “free from the influence of the 865 patent”.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Since I have found that the common general knowledge did include the idea of programming a microcontroller in a high level language, one of Gemalto’s main points about this part of Dr Greaves’ evidence falls away. It was not hindsight to pose the question in that way. Also given the way in which I have identified the skilled team, the submission about compilers falls away as well. As for the point about how Dr Greaves read the patent. It does not arise in this part of the case but it is convenient to address it here. I reject it. I do not think Dr Greaves gave undue weight to memory constraints in reading the patent. I also note the argument is in danger of getting circular. Dr Greaves is being criticised both for considering common general knowledge before reading the patent and at the same time for not preparing his views on common general knowledge before seeing the patent.  </p>

It would be manifest to that team that in order for this to work, they would need to create their own JVM to run on the microcontroller.  The critical point is that at the priority date microcontrollers had very limited memory capacity.  This limitation was one of the defining characteristics of microcontrollers. The team would think (rightly) that a normal JVM would just not fit in the memory of a microcontroller.  The problem is not a minor one. The JVM is far too big.  The team would know that the JVM is made up of components but to move forward the team has to decide how it will deal with them.  Can functions be performed off-card?  What effect does that have?  What functions can/should be performed off-card and what functions might be dispensed with altogether?  What functions must be kept on the card?  Why not dispense with a virtual machine altogether and just compile to the machine code of the microcontroller?  </p>

This takes for granted that the skilled team has decided it can jettison all other elements of the JVM but does not grapple with the question of whether the skilled team would accept that was worthwhile.

HTC submitted that Prof. Paradinas’s personal experience was a hindrance rather than a help in addressing this issue - I do not agree.  In my judgment the skilled team would think in the way Prof. Paradinas described. His concern applies not just in the smart card sector of the microcontroller field but applies to all microcontrollers at that time. The team would think the memory available on a microcontroller was so limited that it was unlikely to be realistic to run Java applications on a microcontroller. I find that claim 3 was not obvious at the priority date because of the severe memory constraints on microcontrollers.    </p>

The team would see that the idea involves compiling the application code into an intermediate code (QUAD) which is code for a virtual machine and then describes options for how to generate code which will actually be loaded onto the smart card.  These are the Direct Code and Virtual Code options.  The Virtual Code option is to translate the QUAD code to code for a virtual machine and store in the ROM memory of the chip both the interpreter and the translated code.  The relative advantages and disadvantages of the two options are explained. </p>

It was put to him that all he was doing was using Caron as a “jumping off point” for the common general knowledge argument and the manner in which the point was put in cross-examination seemed to Dr Greaves as if he had approached his evidence in an inappropriate or wrong way. I reject that.  Dr Greaves’ report recognised that the various obviousness arguments being advanced had common elements.  There is nothing wrong with that.  Dr Greaves was not ignoring the prior art.  Moreover, as Mr Tappin submitted, when one is dealing with obviousness there is nothing inappropriate in principle in a skilled person adding to or departing from the teaching of the prior art based on their common general knowledge. Whether such a step was or was not obvious still has to be determined.   </p>

I understood an answer given by Prof. Paradinas in cross-examination (p313 line 15) to accept that the teaching of Caron was applicable to a language like Java with Class files.  I think it would be obvious to the skilled team how Caron’s teaching might be applied in the case of Java, in that Caron’s intermediate QUAD code produced by compilation equates by analogy to the Class files with bytecode producing by the Java compiler.  The skilled team would also understand that to apply Caron’s Virtual Code approach in the context of Java would involve creating an interpreter to be loaded onto the smart card.  Caron shows that skilled team that something along these lines can be done and provides a framework to the skilled team which can be applied to Java.  This is why the case over Caron is stronger than the argument over common general knowledge alone.  It involves much less hindsight. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However I still think it suffers from the same key problem.  Caron teaches that it is feasible to use the interpreter approach within the memory constraint of a microcontroller.  The size of the interpreter mentioned in Caron is 1.5 Kbytes.  It would be obvious to the skilled team that the JVM was much larger than that.  The existing JVM simply would not fit.  So again the skilled team is faced with a dilemma about what to do about all the other functions of the JVM.  They cannot all be retained because they will not fit in the memory but these functions are some of the important features which makes Java a desirable language to use in the first place.  I do not think it was an obvious thing to do given the severe memory constraints on microcontrollers.  </p>

This runs the very basic core services of the computer system, managing the resources and running device drivers.  In order to run applications the Android system has a virtual machine called the Dalvik Virtual Machine or DVM.  The applications which are run on a DVM include but are not limited to downloadable programs referred to today as “apps”.  For every application which is run, a separate instance of the DVM is created and run.

The process of creating the application code to run on a DVM, starting from a developer writing in Java, is as follows.

To run the app on an Android system requires a further conversion process.  This is carried out using a development environment called the Android SDK (software development kit).  This creates .dex files from .class files by means of a tool called dx.  After the .dex files have been produced, the .dex file and any resources the application needs are packaged together into an .apk file by a component called ApkBuilder.  Android .apk files must be “signed” in order to be installed on an Android device.  This refers to a cryptographic signature which identifies the author who created the application package.  The .dex is optimised into an optimised dex format (.odex).  Amongst other things this process verifies that the byte code does not perform illegal operations.  When the application is run, the byte code used is that in the .odex file. </p>

There is clearly an interpreter in the HTC device (the Dalvik Virtual Machine).  There are clearly applications with source code in a high level language (Java) which is compiled into a compiled form (Java byte code). There might have been a point about whether the Android SDK is a converter if I had accepted Prof. Paradinas’ view about the meaning of converter (addressed in relation to the Caron paper).  However I rejected that narrow interpretation.  I find that the Android SDK is or includes a converter for post processing the Java bytecode into a minimized form suitable for interpretation by the DVM.

Gemalto’s argument focussed on the cache.  It said that the relevant element of claim 1 was satisfied when the phone was turned on and the application code, along with the code for the DVM, was loaded into cache.  This led to a lengthy argument about how cache works in the HTC devices, some of which was confidential.  I will deal with that argument in case this action goes further but I will say at the start that on my construction of “loaded in memory”, the operation Gemalto relies on whereby blocks of code are put into cache for execution does not satisfy this part of the claim.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The following is not confidential.  In order to run an application, blocks of data are copied from RAM into cache.  This data will be the executable code to run the DVM and the executable code for the application itself.  In this context the phrase “executable code” includes both instructions and information to be acted upon.  HTC emphasised that these blocks are smaller than normal size of the application or the DVM.  So at any one time, the cache will only contain part of the program(s) to be run.  When the processor wishes to access an item of data in RAM, the memory controller first looks for it in the cache.  If it is in the cache, the data is passed to the processor.  Because there is a good chance the next piece of data a processor will want to access will be located close to the previous data, by putting data into cache in blocks, there is a good chance that the processor will run for quite a few instruction cycles just accessing the cache.  Since cache can be accessed very quickly, the processor runs fast.  When the data required is not in cache this state is called a “cache miss”.  The data needs to be retrieved from the RAM.  The confidential element of the argument was about whether it was possible for an item of data to get to the processor from the RAM directly in any circumstances or whether it had to go through the cache.  In every case the data has to pass through what I will call the cache system.  In fact the relevant processors have two caches, L1 and L2 but that extra layer of complexity seems to me to be irrelevant.   </p>

Gemalto submitted this still satisfied the claim but I am not so sure since claim 1 required “the interpreter” to be loaded in memory.

In other words the DVM is promoted as a tool to be used when resources are limited.  Gemalto also pointed out that the Android SDK converts the apps into a form in which they are smaller than they would otherwise be and results in a very significant saving of resources.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">To decide whether claim 8 would be infringed depends on the details of the conversion process carried out by the Android SDK.  It is not disputed that the Android SDK comprises means for translating from byte codes in the compiled form (Java byte codes) to byte codes in a format suitable for interpretation by the interpreter (the DVM). There is no dispute that elements 8(a), (c) and (e) are satisfied.  The dx tool in the Android SDK deals with the jumps as required by elements 8(a) and (e) and deals with byte code operands in a manner within element 8(c).

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The main point is about the word “equivalent” in elements 8(b) and 8(d).  HTC submits this means “semantically equivalent” that is to say that the instructions do the same thing.  So far so superficially attractive.  Then HTC argues that the Java byte codes are not semantically equivalent to the DVM byte codes because the Java virtual machine is a stack machine while the Dalvik virtual machine is a register machine.  HTC argues that the semantics are close but they are different because of the different architecture of the virtual machines.  HTC points out that in cross-examination Prof. Paradinas accepted that as a result of the difference in machine architecture the byte codes for the DVM are not semantically equivalent to byte codes for the DVM.  In essence the point is that an instruction “take the first number off the stack and the second number off the stack, add them together and store the answer on the stack” has a different meaning from an instruction “add the contents of register 1 to the contents of register 2 and store the result in register 1”.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I reject HTC’s argument on this because it has lost sight of the patent specification.  In a sense of course “equivalent” means semantically equivalent since the point of this process is to end up with a program which does the same thing as it did before, albeit using different byte codes.  However as Gemalto pointed out the patent expressly states in paragraph [0088]:  </p>

It would be clear to the skilled reader that the patent recognised that the conversion process may involve replacing byte codes for one kind of machine architecture with byte codes for another. Plainly these would still have to be semantically equivalent so that the overall program did the same thing.  In the example I set out above about adding to numbers, both instructions have the same essential meaning, they are just implemented in different ways to reflect the different machine architecture.   </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Moreover the fact that it is possible to find some individual byte codes in one instruction set which have no meaning in the other instruction set because of the difference in architecture does not advance this argument either.  Dr Greaves pointed out that Java includes a byte code instruction “<span style="font-style:italic">iload_0</span>”.  It means “push” (i.e. put) a value in local variable “0” onto the stack.  He said the DVM cannot perform that operation (because it does not have a stack).  That is true but as Dr Greaves pointed out the DVM would perform a different operation, moving a value between a pair of specific registers.  In my judgment this goes to show that although at a certain level of detail the instructions will differ because the machine architecture differs, in fact at a higher level byte codes can be regarded as equivalent when viewed in the context of the program  as a whole.  I reject HTC’s meaning of “equivalent”.  It is too narrow. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally in relation to element 8(b) HTC argued that an example given by Prof. Paradinas of the conversion by the Android SDK of specific Java byte codes into generic DVM byte codes was not within the claim.  Prof. Paradinas referred to some specific byte codes (such as <span style="font-style:italic">iconst_m1</span>,<span style="font-style:italic"> iconst_0</span> and<span style="font-style:italic"> iconst_1</span>).  These all perform the same operation but using a different number (-1, 0 or 1 respectively (m1 referring to 1)) which is built into the opcode itself.  He said they were converted by the dx tool into a DVM operation “<span style="font-style:italic">const/4 vA #+B</span>” or “<span style="font-style:italic">const/16 vAA, #+BBBB</span>”.  Leaving aside the detailed meanings of the codes, there is no doubt this operation performs the same thing as Java “<span style="font-style:italic">iconst</span>” opcodes but now the operand B must be supplied.  In the conversion process B would be set at -1, 0 or 1 as appropriate.  Dr Greaves did not accept this was an example of the conversion required by claim 8(b) because “const/4” was not <span style="text-decoration:underline">the</span> generic byte code.  That is because there is a form of the operation which is more general again.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">All this demonstrates is that there are levels of generality from very specific to very general.  I reject the argument implicit in this approach that the skilled reader would interpret claim 8(b) are being limited to a case in which a specific byte code was converted to the most generic possible equivalent byte code.  I find that the Android SDK does perform operations which satisfy claim 8(b) and the example referred to above which was given by Prof. Paradinas is an example of that. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The argument on element 8(d) also involved a point of construction.  Prof. Paradinas gave examples in which equivalent opcodes (for “goto” instructions) were renumbered during the conversion process.  HTC argued that one cannot sensibly speak of “renumbering” byte codes when moving from Java byte codes to byte codes for the DVM.  The byte codes may have different numbers but that is because they are byte codes for different machines with different instruction sets.  What claim 8(d) is talking about (in the context of Java) is giving a Java byte code a different number.  Essentially HTC’s argument is that this element is only applicable in the case of a conversion which is less drastic than a conversion to an instruction set for a machine with a different architecture.  Although I agree that HTCs’ argument correctly characterises the renumbering described in the specification at paragraph [0087], I agree with Gemalto that the argument is really seeking to read words into the language of the claim which are not present.  There is no reason to read limitations into the feature which are absent.  On that basis the conversion carried out by the Android SDK falls within claim 8(d).   </p>

Gemalto’s infringement case is that a product within those claims does not exist when the power is switched off because the cache is empty.  The relevant product is created when a HTC device is switched on and an application is run on a DVM.  At that point a product within the claim is created because the relevant code is “loaded in memory” by being placed into cache.   I have rejected this argument (above) but if I accepted it (and the rest of Gemalto’s case on infringement of claim 1) then in my judgment an HTC device, switched off, as supplied by HTC to a customer in the UK is a means relating to an essential element of the invention for putting the invention into effect in the UK.  It comprises a microcontroller and a memory (on Gemalto’s case) as well as an interpreter ready in the FLASH to be used when required.  The device is set up to allow users to download apps for themselves.  Once a user has downloaded an app, the code stored in the FLASH is code in a minimized form which has been prepared in the manner required by claim 1.  HTC also knows this and intends that their customers should download these apps in the UK and use them in the UK.  That use is what puts the invention into effect in the UK.  </p>

Since these things do not matter, HTC’s state of knowledge about where those things might have happened does not matter either.  Thus if, which I reject, Gemalto’s infringement case on claim 1 was sound, HTC would infringe under s60(2). The same goes for claim 8. </p>

Gemalto contends that the HTC device as sold is a means relating to an essential element of the invention for putting the invention into effect in the UK because it will permit users to take that last step of the method in the UK.  All the other steps will have been performed by someone else, such as the developer of the app.  The best way of putting Gemalto’s case here is to consider an app developer in the UK, performing all the steps of compilation and conversion in the UK.  The HTC device allows the user to complete the claimed process and as a result the whole process will now be or have been performed in the UK.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Gemalto contends that the following HTC mobile communication devices infringe the patent: the HTC Sensation, the HTC Sensation XL with Beats Audio, the HTC Sensation XE with Beats Audio, the HTC Explorer, the HTC Rhyme, the HTC EVO 3D, the HTC Cha Cha, the HTC Salsa, the HTC Incredible S, the HTC Desire S, the HTC Desire Z, the HTC Desire HD, the HTC Wildfire S and the HTC Gratia.  This list of devices is not the same as the list in relation to the 865 patent.  Collectively these have been referred to as “the HTC Smartphones”.  Nothing turns on any differences between these devices.  It is common ground that these devices are capable of operating in accordance with a standard issued by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) number TS 102 223. This standard is known as the 233 standard.  The issue of infringement is to some extent a squeeze argument in that HTC says that if operating in accordance with the 223 standard infringes then the patent must lack novelty over GSM 11.PQ because they are the same in all material respects.  Gemalto does not accept that GSM 11.PQ is the same as the 233 standard.   No point on s60(2) arises on the 9062 case. The issue is whether one of the HTC smartphones, with its SIM card installed, falls within the 9062 patent.  </p>

At that time the GSM mobile telephone system was beginning to become successful and popular.  The SIM card used in a GSM mobile phone is a smart card.  A smart card always needs to have a reader.  In banking the reader could be the ATM machine which would dispense cash when a bank card was inserted and the PIN transaction completed.  In a mobile phone the reader is the phone itself.   </p>

This then led to trouble in cross-examination because a part of his report which he had said reflected his views expressed without seeing the patent included a claim chart. Self evidently the text must have been written after he saw the patent and Dr Woodsend was clearly puzzled about how he could have appeared to have made a mistake like this when it was put to him in cross-examination.  In my judgment there was no mistake at all.  I am sure Dr Woodsend did indeed formulate the basis for his views before seeing the patent and, when the text was prepared, felt that the text expressed views he had already formulated.  The text put them into a proper context to show how they related to the patent.  Dr Woodsend was clearly concerned he had done something wrong.  </p>

The approach of withholding the patent from an expert might be thought to imply that an item of prior art which is only identified after the expert has already seen the patent could not be successfully deployed in an obviousness attack.  But that is incorrect.  A related problem was present in this case.  Dr Woodsend was the author of GSM 11.PQ and worked closely on it.  To isolate Mr Woodsend from the ideas found in the patent when he was first considering Diehl was an impossible task.  At least one of the key ideas absent from Diehl but present in the patent (implementing a proactive SIM arrangement using the T=0 protocol) is present in GSM 11.PQ.  The witness has to rely on the legal team to tell him or her what is important and what is not in the context of the preparation of their reports.  He or she can properly be questioned about it in the witness box.  This may be entirely legitimate but if the problem has arisen as a result of the way the legal team has instructed the expert it can be unfair on the witness.  That is what happened in this case.  </p>

After giving evidence on 865, the Professor was released from his oath.  He returned to the witness box a few days later to give evidence about 9062.  On this second occasion he was a different person.  I regret to say that I did not find the Professor’s evidence on 9062 to be helpful.  The views expressed by Prof. Paradinas in the course of cross-examination appeared to be ideas which were simply occurring to him as he sat in the witness box and were not the product of careful thought about the issues in the case.  He appeared to have no memory of or even, I regret to say, understanding of the evidence in his reports.  He raised new ideas which were not foreshadowed before. I suspect that there is some force in Mr Burkill’s submission that Prof. Paradinas was very tired after dealing with the 865 case both as a witness and sitting in court to assist in the cross-examination of Dr Greaves. That may be but I do not believe it is a complete explanation.  Moreover even if it is an explanation, it does not allow me to place any real weight on the Professor’s evidence. During his evidence I thought Prof. Paradinas might find it easier if he allowed the interpreter to interpret the questions into his mother tongue and answered in the same language but he did not take up my suggestion.  I suspect, although Prof Paradinas did not say this himself, that the nature of his expertise meant </p>

It also defined certain functions which cards had to support. These including functions like READ RECORD and UPDATE RECORD which allowed the card to be used as a form of data store.  One command which was mandatory was GET RESPONSE.  In fact the GET RESPONSE command was part of a draft standard called 7816-4 but whether 7816-4 was or was not common general knowledge is in dispute and I will address it below.  What is not in dispute is that GSM 11.11 was common general knowledge and it defines GET RESPONSE.  The GET RESPONSE command is used when it is needed to transfer data to the card and also get data from the card. The need arises because in the T=0 protocol it is not possible to do that in one command-response pair.  The diagram below is based on one in GSM 11.11. The commands from the reader are on the left and the responses from the card are on the right.  Commands are always initiated by the reader. They tell the cardwhat to do in a five byte header consisting of CLA (class byte), INS (instruction byte) and P1, P2 and P3.  P3 defines the length of the data field.  The response always contains two status words (SW1 and SW2) which encode the response to the command (e.g. 90 00 means successful execution).  The way in which GET RESPONSE works is depicted below:  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">HTC contended that the draft standard 7816-4 was common general knowledge by the priority date. The point of the argument about 7816-4 is that it defines a way for formatting the data field in an APDU using an approach called TLV for tag, length, value.  TLV comes up later in relation to the obviousness attack based on Diehl. At this stage the issue is whether 7816-4 was common general knowledge.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">7816-4 had been going through the ISO standardisation process for some years.  In 1993 a vote was taken to elevate it to a “Draft International Standard” (DIS) but the DIS status was rejected because of inconsistencies in the document at that time.  By the priority date (30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 1995) it had achieved DIS status but it only became a full standard in September 1995, after the priority date.  HTC pointed to some pre-priority date literature including Smart Card News in which a number of manufacturers refer to 7816-4 in the context of new products they are introducing.   </p>

The reference to “good basis for further action” is a reference to the well known formulation of what represents common general knowledge in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">General Tire v</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Firestone</span> [1972] RPC 457 in the passage starting at p482.  Gemalto argued that because the standard was still a draft and given its history, the skilled person could not know whether it would ultimately be adopted unchanged from the DIS form. Dr Woodsend said that everyone in the industry would know by May 1995 that the vote to accept 7816-4 had been passed. Prof Paradinas said that all the skilled persons knew there was a battle around the standard and knew that if they decided to implement it they were taking some risk.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Since smart card manufacturers were producing cards which were 7816-4 compliant, they clearly regarded it as a good enough basis on which to take further action.  Whatever risk that might have involved was not high enough to deter those skilled in this art from acting.  I find that 7816-4 was part of the common general knowledge.  In any event even if (which I do not accept) 7816-4 as a whole was not common general knowledge, I find that the aspect relating to the TLV data field was sufficiently crystallised to be part of the common general knowledge.  </p>

It notes that they often use the communication protocol defined in ISO 7816-3.  It goes on to say that there are drawbacks to the intelligence lying in the reader and that while it has been suggested to transfer intelligence (i.e. transaction management) to the card, that raises the issue of compatibility of such modified cards with existing readers. </p>

The issue is whether the claim covers a reader which is capable of generating the sequence referred to in the claim in some circumstances but is also capable of generating other sequences outside the claim in other (entirely deterministic) circumstances.   </p>

HTC said that properly understood this paragraph supported its position on construction because it would involve the handset stacking or queuing commands from other “passive” smart cards while it handled the instructions from the “active” smart card.  That would not be possible on Gemalto’s construction.  Gemalto contended that the translation of this paragraph was wrong and asked the interpreter assisting Prof Paradinas to provide an alternative. I am not convinced the distinction between the two rival interpretations actually assisted Gemalto’s argument but it is not necessary to resolve this dispute since even if Gemalto are right about the last paragraph it would not advance their interpretation, it would simply neutralise the point being put by HTC.  Moreover I am not convinced HTC’s interpretation of this paragraph helps anyway because in order for it to have a bearing on construction one needs to construct an elaborate analysis of how what is described in a rather delphic single sentence must work and then draw inferences from that about what the claim must mean.  This approach may not be impermissible meticulous <span style="font-style:italic">verbal</span> analysis but it seems to me it is a similar impermissible kind of analysis.

A skilled person who got as far as HTC in the analysis of the last paragraph had no way of knowing if the inventor had thought it through to the same extent and could simply conclude that the inventor had not.   </p>

At that time an organisation called CEPT (the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunication Organisations) set up a group to define a standard for digital mobile telephones.  The group was called Groupe Spécial Mobile or GSM.  In the late 1980s (1988 or 1989) GSM became an ETSI technical committee (although the precise relationship between the GSM and ETSI is in issue – see below).  By the early 1990s the GSM mobile phone network was up and running.  The term “GSM” now means <span style="text-decoration:underline">G</span>lobal <span style="text-decoration:underline">S</span>ystem for <span style="text-decoration:underline">M</span>obile Communications).  The technical committee was renamed SMG (Special Mobile Groups) at some point.  SMG had a number of sub-technical committees, SMG 1, SMG 2 etc.  These had the task of developing technical recommendations about various aspects of mobile telephone technology such as radio and network aspects (SMG 2 and SMG 3), data services (SMG4) and so on.  One of the SMG sub-technical committees was SMG9.  SMG9 was concerned with integrated circuit cards (i.e. SIM cards).  The SMGs were responsible for drafting and developing standards.   </p>

Although it operated under some ETSI rules, it did not operate under all of them.  He drew a distinction between ETSI standards and SMG standards.  For standards which started in SMG, the subgroups and working groups would do their work and the standard would be approved at SMG (the Technical Committee) and then implemented.  After that the standard would go to ETSI and ETSI “did what they did”.  The point was that once a standard was approved by SMG, it was put into practice by the industry.   </p>

Whether or not that limited circulation might have a bearing on the issues does not matter because Mr Clayton explained that in SMG he would circulate SMG documents very widely and not just to members but to non-members as well.  Mr Burkill pointed out that this evidence was general and not specific to the GSM 11.PQ document. That is true but Mr Clayton was making the point to emphasise his position about SMG’s independence from ETSI.  It supports HTC’s case that the participants in SMG meetings were not obliged to keep such documents confidential.  </p>

The document defines mandatory ME procedures for the “SIM Application Toolkit”.  This is a set of commands and procedures for use during the network operation phase of GSM.  One of the elements of the SIM Application Toolkit is a mechanism called Proactive SIM.  Proactive SIM provides a mechanism whereby the SIM can initiate actions to be taken by the ME.  The mechanism stays within the T=0 protocol.  The mechanism involves the SIM using the status words 91 XX to indicate that it has a message to send to the ME; the ME then uses GET RESPONSE to obtain that message.  The ME then deals with the message from the SIM and reports back using the COMMAND RESULT procedure.  This procedure involves using a T=0 protocol command called ENVELOPE to send a message to the card described as ENVELOPE (COMMAND RESULT).  It is then up to the SIM to decide what to do next, including issuing another command using the same mechanism. </p>

The SIM responds in the normal way as in the T-=-0 protocol but uses the status words to signal to the ME that the SIM has something it wishes to say to the ME.  In the example this is signalled by the number 91 in the first status word (see above).  The ME then sends the GET RESPONSE message to the SIM and the SIM responds with a message which contains the command the SIM wishes to give to the ME.  The command is called the Proactive SIM command. In GSM 11.PQ the possible commands are specified.  They include commands like PLAY TONE which asks the ME to play a tone in its earpiece; SET UP CALL which asks the ME to set up a phone call; and GET INPUT which asks the ME to display a message on the screen and request a response, allowing a dialogue between the SIM and the user.   </p>

The ME therefore sends a COMMAND RESULT message to the SIM which indicates that a temporary problem has occurred.  The SIM responds (as it always will in the T=0 protocol) but the response status word contains the signal (91) which indicates that the SIM has something to say to the ME.  Thus in effect the cycle is repeated. The ME knows to send a GET RESPONSE message to the SIM and does so.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is much more in GSM 11.PQ that the example in case 4 of Proactive SIM. The document proposes that an option would be to allow commands to be stacked in the ME and queued in the SIM.  In order to facilitate stacking and to allow the system to keep track of commands, each Proactive SIM command must be given a number.  One of the specified commands which the SIM can give to the ME is called ASK RESULT. This requests the result of a previous proactive command. GSM 11.PQ also specifies the kinds of result which the ME can pass back to the SIM. There are four: OK, result pending, temporary problem and permanent problem. The distinction between temporary problem and permanent problem is that if the problem is temporary, as illustrated in Case 4, the SIM understands that it might be worth trying again. The result “result pending” tells the SIM that the proactive command has not yet been completed.   </p>

The reader can receive and process instructions and data received from the SIM and the SIM manages a transaction at its, i.e. the SIM’s initiative.  The reader has means for developing and transmitting report messages to the SIM on execution of its instructions by the reader.  The reader can generate requests for instructions and reports, as called for by claim 1 and there is no dispute that, for example in Case 4, a sequence of requests and reports which is alternate and repetitive as required by the claim is disclosed.  </p>

Thus on Gemalto’s construction of claim 1, GSM 11.PQ did not anticipate.  However I have rejected Gemalto’s construction of the claim.  In my judgment claim 1 covers what is disclosed in GSM 11.PQ.

The point of this argument is that if stacking is maintained then on Gemalto’s construction the result is still one which is outside claim 1.  Dr Woodsend did not agree with the proposition put to him.  He accepted that stacking/queuing would lead to problems but his view was that the skilled person would appreciate that and would implement the system without queuing / stacking.  He pointed out that GSM 11.PQ itself states that stacking is optional.  The thrust of his evidence can be seen from the following answer (at day 8 p969-970):  </p>

Mr Burkill submitted that GSM 11.PQ was an over engineered proposal which stipulated mandatory features which were useless and were inconsistent with the simple alternation of requests and reports.   It missed what he called the simplicity of the invention in 9062.  That is a fair point and I will take this submission into account.  </p>

After the priority date he was rapporteur to SMG9.  The work led to the GSM standard which was the forerunner of the 223 standard in place today.  Stacking is not permitted, ASK RESULT has gone and there is no result pending message.  The steps which are said to be obvious have been taken.  They were taken inside SMG9 with Dr Woodsend’s full involvement.  I will bear this in mind as well. </p>

However even to articulate the argument is to exaggerate its significance. The list of commands under “Preferred embodiments” is the same list of commands under “Invention” with two extras: CLEAR SCREEN and END OF SESSION.  In fact CLEAR SCREEN is referred to in the Invention section but not given a place in the list. A skilled person would not be put off by this and would not think anything less of the disclosure.

The first one requires the terminal to display a message and waits for the next action performed by the smart card. The second one is identical to DISPLAY MESSAGE but the user will initiate message clearing.  Dr Woodsend’s protocol uses DISPLAY ERASABLE MESSAGE.  Prof Paradinas pointed out that a command sequence using the other command, DISPLAY MESSAGE could not be implemented using the T=0 protocol because the screen would freeze. Dr Woodsend did not disagree but said in cross-examination that the answer was to use DISPLAY ERASABLE MESSAGE as he had done or include an extra message so that DISPLAY MESSAGE resembled all the other commands.  Dr Woodsend thought that he would fix DISPLAY MESSAGE so that it looked like all the others; he said it was easier to do that than to invent a whole new protocol.  However it seems to me that it is wrong to ignore the fact that, as disclosed in Diehl, the DISPLAY MESSAGE command indicates that it is the card which will take the initiative so far as both the next exchange of information and the next command are concerned.

Although I recognise that it was not intended to be by either HTC or Dr Woodsend, I think the argument put forward over Diehl is based on looking back from claim 1 of 9062 and seeing how to arrive at the invention.  At various stages in the reasoning a choice is made: adopting T=0, using TLV, and not using DISPLAY MESSAGE or altering it.  At each point I am not convinced there is a reason to take the step in the manner which leads to the claim other than impermissible knowledge of the invention.
