At trial both WarnerLambert and Actavis instructed separate teams of counsel and called different witnesses for the infringement case to those instructed and called for the validity cases. As well as defending the infringement claim, Actavis counterclaim in respect of threats allegedly made by Pfizer. Two issues have been reserved for consideration later if necessary: a defence to the infringement claim raised by Actavis that the grant of any relief would be contrary to competition law, and a defence to the threats claim raised by Pfizer under section 70(2A)(b) of the Patents Act 1977. </p>

He obtained a BSc in Biochemistry from Leeds in 1971, an MSc in Molecular Enzymology from Warwick University in 1972 and a PhD in Virology from Warwick in 1976. After post-doctoral studies at the Institut du Radium and the Institut Pasteur, in 1979 he took up a research post in the Immunology Department at St George’s Hospital London. From 1981 to 1984 he was a Senior Scientist in the field of Neuroimmunology employed by Wellcome Foundation Research Laboratories. From 1984 to 1994 he was Head of Neuroimmunology at the Sandoz Institute for Medical Research. Whilst at Sandoz, he was primarily involved in identifying new molecules with analgesic properties. As part of this drug development work, candidate molecules were regularly tested in animal models of pain. In 1994 he joined the Department of Biology at UCL as a Senior Lecturer, becoming Professor in 1998. In 2001 he co-founded a start-up company to develop analgesic drugs directed at novel molecular targets. In 2009 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences. He is the author of three books and over 150 scientific publications. He also has a number of patents to his name. His current role is primarily as a pain geneticist, but his work has covered a range of disciplines within the field of pain research. </p>

It was also put to him, and he appeared to accept, that he was an expert in ion channels, but it was not put to him that he had specialised in ion channels. Counsel accepted that Prof Wood had tried to assist the court, but nevertheless criticised certain aspects of his evidence. Counsel’s main point, which related to Prof Wood’s reliance in oral evidence upon papers as evidence of common general knowledge which he had not mentioned in his reports, applies equally to Prof Woolf, however.

He obtained a BSc in Physiology from the University of the Witwatersrand in 1972, an MB, BCh from the same university in 1977 and a PhD in Physiology from the same university in 1979. From 1979 to 1981 he was a Lecturer in the Department of Physiology at Middlesex Hospital Medical School. Between 1981 and 1997 he was successively Lecturer, Senior Lecturer, Reader and Professor of Neurobiology at UCL. During this period, he discovered the phenomenon of the central sensitisation of neurons in the dorsal horn to peripheral painful stimuli, which was published in a much-cited paper (C.J. Woolf, “Evidence for a central component of post-injury pain hypersensitivity”, <span style="font-style:italic">Nature</span>, 306, 686-688 (1983)), and much of his subsequent research has been in this area. In the 1980s he attended a weekly pain clinic at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital. In 1995 he was appointed as an Honorary Consultant at University College Hospital where in 1996 he served on a committee that reviewed the needs and treatment options for pain patients, including opportunities for new therapies. In 1997 he was appointed as Director of the Neural Plasticity Research Group at Massachusetts General Hospital and Professor of Anaesthesiology Research at Harvard Medical School. He took up his present position at Children's Hospital Boston in 2010. He has acted as a consultant to many pharmaceutical and biotech companies. He has received a number of awards. He has published over 350 scientific papers in the field of pain research. He is also a named inventor on 16 patents. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">Counsel for Mylan and Actavis made three criticisms of Prof Woolf’s evidence. First, he submitted that, as the originator and principal proponent of the central sensitisation theory, it was difficult for Prof Woolf to put himself into the position of the ordinary skilled neuroscientist at the priority date. This is not, of course, a criticism of Prof Woolf himself. When this point was put to Prof Woolf, he disputed it on the basis that he had had extensive discussions about the theory with others in the field between 1983 and 1996 (and subsequently). I accept that evidence, and I also accept that Prof Woolf did his best to put himself into the position of the ordinary skilled neuroscientist. Nevertheless, it was clear from his evidence that, particularly during the period up to the priority date, he had a strong focus on central sensitisation which would not necessarily have been shared by the ordinary skilled neuroscientist. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, counsel submitted that Prof Woolf’s views were significantly influenced by post-priority information or materials that were not part of the common general knowledge at the priority date. Counsel gave a number of examples of this. It is, of course, always very difficult for expert witnesses in patent cases entirely to avoid hindsight. I am sure that Prof Woolf did his best to do so, but nevertheless I consider that there is some force in this submission. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, counsel submitted that Prof Woolf had tended to argue Warner-Lambert’s case rather than provide impartial evidence. Again, counsel gave a number of examples of this. This is a more serious criticism than either of the previous two, and I have considered it with care. I am sure that Prof Woolf was trying to be independent and impartial, and I have no doubt that much of the time he succeeded in this. Nevertheless, I have to say that his evidence did give me the strong impression that some of the time, and no doubt unconsciously, he was supporting Warner-Lambert’s case. I suspect that this may be explained by his prior participation in the US proceedings. </p>

He obtained a BSc in Anatomy from UCL in 1969 and an MB BS from UCL in 1972. He trained in general medicine and then in neurology at University College Hospital, the Royal Free Hospital and the National Hospital for Nervous Diseases (as it was then called). During this period he undertook research into peripheral nerve injury in mice which led to a clinical trial of propanolol for post-traumatic neuralgia, for which he was awarded an MD. He was appointed as Consultant Neurologist at the National Hospital and Whittington Hospital in 1982. From 1982 to 2008 he was Honorary Senior Lecturer at the Institute of Neurology. He has also held various clinical consultant/adviser positions to St Luke’s Hospital for the Clergy (1983 to 2002), the Ministry of Defence (1983 to present), King Edward VII Hospital for Officers (1993 to 1995), the Royal Navy (1983 to 2003), the Royal Society of Musicians (1996 to 2006) and the Royal Air Force (1997 to present). He was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1988. In 1994 he was a member of the International Association for the Study of Pain’s (“IASP’s”) Task Force on Taxonomy (as to which, see below). He has published 115 scientific papers.

I regret to say that Ms Tully was an unimpressive witness. She appeared more concerned to articulate Pfizer’s corporate position than to answer the questions put to her. Furthermore, she had not taken adequate care over the preparation of her evidence. In particular, the crossexamination on the section of her second witness statement on the purchasing practices of Pfizer’s pharmacy customers showed that it made no sense and Ms Tully was unable to explain it. It was evident that she had just adopted material prepared by others without understanding it. I was left wondering how much of the rest of her evidence was also prepared by others. </p>

As Medical Director, he is responsible for the medical aspects of all of Pfizer’s products in the UK, including both clinical and regulatory issues. Using his clinical knowledge, Dr Philips reinterpreted the IMS data relating to sales of pregabalin as discussed below. Dr Phillips was placed in a difficult position for two reasons. The first is that he was a senior employee of Pfizer who had originally prepared the evidence contained in his second witness statement on the basis that it was all factual evidence. After I had ruled that some of it was expert evidence, but given Warner-Lambert and Pfizer permission to adduce that expert evidence, Dr Phillips made a third witness statement in which he confirmed that, subject to certain minor clarifications, the views he had expressed were consistent with the duties of an expert. Secondly, it became clear in cross-examination that the exercise reported by Dr Phillips had been mainly carried out by others, although he had gone through it and satisfied himself as to its correctness. Furthermore, the two individuals who had done most of the work had doctorates in unspecified scientific disciplines, and were not medically qualified. I have no doubt that Dr Phillips did his best to discharge his duties as an expert, but for these reasons I consider that his evidence must be approached with a degree of caution.     </p>

Unlike nociceptive/inflammatory pain, there is frequently a delay in the onset of neuropathic pain after the initiating injury (although this is not always the case). Furthermore, whereas nociceptive/inflammatory pain subsides either when the noxious stimulus is removed or when the originating injury heals, neuropathic pain often persists for many years and sometimes for life.

Hyperalgesia may be experienced in relation to thermal or mechanical stimuli, and hence referred to as thermal hyperalgesia or mechanical hyperalgesia. The term “allodynia” is used to describe pain that is experienced in response to stimuli that would not normally be expected to cause pain (e.g. light touch). Again, one can distinguish between thermal and mechanical allodynia.

It is important to appreciate that, at the priority date, the term “central sensitisation” might be used by a neuroscientist or clinician in one of two ways. (The term was not defined in the IASP <span style="font-style:italic">Classification of Chronic Pain</span> in 1994.) The first (and probably more common) way was to use it narrowly and specifically to denote the theory devised by Prof Woolf (referred to for convenience in much of the evidence as <span style="font-style:italic">central sensitisation</span> or “central sensitisation in the italicised sense”). The second way was to use it more broadly and loosely to denote not only central sensitisation in the narrow sense, but also other central amplification and augmentation mechanisms. In this judgment I shall endeavour to confine use of the term “central sensitisation” to the first sense. The following account of central sensitisation in that sense is taken almost verbatim from paragraphs 58-61 of Prof Woolf’s first report. </p>

This form of central sensitisation is now known as “activity-dependent central sensitisation” and can be induced by producing trains of action potentials in nociceptors by diverse means; for example, repeated noxious heat stimuli, tissue injury, tissue inflammation, injury to a nerve or ectopic activity in an injured nerve, chemical irritants that activate nociceptors, and electrical stimulation of nociceptors. This activity in nociceptor sensory fibers triggers an increase in synaptic strength in neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord; changes called “synaptic potentiation”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">A critical component of activity-dependent synaptic potentiation is mediated by Nmethyl-D-aspartate (“NMDA”) receptors. The NMDA receptor is a glutamate receptor and is an ion channel protein expressed by neurons. The pore of the NMDA ion channel receptor is normally blocked by a magnesium ion in a voltage-dependent way. When the membrane potential of a neuron is reduced (becomes more depolarised), the magnesium block of the NMDA receptor is relieved and the ion channel receptor now responds to synaptic release of glutamate, and this augments, facilitates, amplifies or sensitises the response of the neuron. In addition, the NMDA receptor allows calcium to enter the neuron, which then acts as a second messenger producing further changes in the neuron and its excitability that persist after the initiating barrage of activity. NMDA receptor antagonists are often used to validate preclinical models of central sensitisation due to the crucial role of NMDA receptors. </p>

This phenomenon has been described or characterised as an increase in “gain” in the dorsal horn, where pharmacological treatment to reduce the “gain” may treat the underlying pain symptoms. Such treatment typically does not reduce or block nociceptive pain, but normalises pain hypersensitivity.</p>

This is mediated by the strong synaptic inputs between the particular sensory inputs and pathways and inhibitory neurons that focus activity to these dedicated circuits.</p>

As I shall explain in more detail later, the diagnoses are recorded by the GPs using prescription software and by means of Read codes.

They provide a standard vocabulary by which clinicians can record findings in patients’ records. Each Read code is a unique alpha-numeric code that identifies a clinical term that can be used to described, for example, a patient’s symptoms or the details of a blood test. Read codes are organised in a number of chapters. Chapters 1-9 are used most frequently by GPs and cover history, examination, procedures and administration. GPs can allocate the reason for a medication to any of these categories. As there is often more than one way of describing the same clinical concept, a number of synonymous terms are available. This is managed by having a Preferred Term that clinicians should use and Synonyms; but as the system has developed it is not always the case that Synonyms are actually precisely synonymous with the Preferred Term. Although Read codes are a very useful way of recording clinical information, seeing a Read code in isolation gives no great insight into what was in the mind of a clinician when they prescribe a particular medication, not least because of the time pressure and heavy workload that GPs are under. </p>

For this reason, mapping Read codes accurately to ICD 10 classifications is a difficult exercise. Furthermore, ICD 10 is not well suited to analysing conditions based on symptoms with few objective criteria. Thus the mapping problem is compounded when dealing with pain. </p>

Existing medicines have the advantage that they are known compounds which have been shown to have acceptable safety profiles, and therefore need much less testing from that perspective. Experience shows that a compound which has therapeutic benefit in one application not infrequently turns out to have therapeutic benefit in another application (sometimes more than one other application) which may be quite different to the first application. Thus there is significant potential and value in finding such second (and third, etc.) medical uses. Discovering such second medical uses requires difficult and expensive research, however. How is such research to be funded? The answer which has been provided by the European patent system is to grant patents for second (and subsequent) medical uses of known compounds. The monopoly thus conferred on the inventor who finds the second medical use provides the return on the investment required to fund the research. </p>

The European patent system has attempted to overcome these obstacles in two ways.  </p>

This is consistent with what appears from the documentary evidence, and it makes sense. Prof Wood and Dr Scadding did not differentiate between the two contexts, however, nor was it put to either of them that the position would differ. It is true that, as counsel for Warner-Lambert submitted, there is a difference in that, for the purposes of considering obviousness, the skilled team has not read the Patent, whereas for the purpose of considering sufficiency, the skilled team has read the Patent (see <span style="font-style:italic">Schlumberger Holdings Ltd v Electromagnetic Geoservices AS</span> [2010] EWCA Civ 819, [2010] RPC 33 at [31]-[32] and [64] (Jacob LJ)).

The fields may be different aspects of the same art or, in an extreme case, different arts altogether. In such circumstances it is legitimate to consider the question of obviousness from the perspective of each addressee, and hence in the light of that addressee’s common general knowledge, although this does not mean that there cannot be invention in marrying two different arts: see <span style="font-style:italic">Inhale Therapeutic Systems Inc v Quadrant Healthcare plc</span> [2002] RPC 21 at [35]-[42] (Laddie J). Counsel for Mylan and Actavis  accepted that, at least on the facts of the present case, the same approach should be applied to sufficiency i.e. it is enough if the invention can be performed by one of the addressees using that addressee’s common general knowledge.     </p>

Counsel for Warner-Lambert submitted that matter relied on as being common general knowledge must be shown to be common general knowledge in the UK, but counsel for Mylan and Actavis disputed that this was necessary. Although I only received limited argument on the point, it seems to me that, at minimum, it must be shown that the matter in question was common general knowledge in the UK. The reason for this is that, whether one is concerned with the validity of a European Patent (UK), or a UK patent, one is concerned with a right in respect of the UK. It is true that the prior art may have been published anywhere in the world, but I do not think that alters the need for the skilled team to consider that art as if they were located in the UK. I do not think it matters that a fact was common general knowledge in (say) China, if it was not common general knowledge here. The position may be different if all the persons skilled in a particular art in the UK are acquainted with the position in China, but no point of that kind arises here. I do not consider that this approach is contrary to Article 27(1) of TRIPS, which provides that “patents shall be available and patent rights enjoyable with discrimination as to the place of invention”, as counsel for Mylan and Actavis submitted. </p>

Thus a scientific theory does not have to have been generally accepted as correct if it is regarded as a reasonable working hypothesis by the bulk of those skilled in art.

In my view some caution has to be exercised in these circumstances in determining what matters formed part of the common general knowledge of the neuroscientist and/or clinician. By way of example, both Prof Wood and Prof Woolf referred in their oral evidence to papers as being part of the common general knowledge which they had not referred to in their reports (in the case of Prof Woolf, he prepared three reports).

The first concerns the use of gabapentin for the treatment of pain. Mylan and Actavis contend that it was part of the common general knowledge that gabapentin was (i) being used off-label by clinicians for the treatment of pain and (ii) regarded as having therapeutic promise for that indication, although no controlled trials had been carried out. Warner-Lambert disputes both propositions, and in particular proposition (ii).</p>

He attended a meeting on 28 September 1995 to discuss gabapentin’s use for the treatment of chronic pain conditions, which was attended by a number of pain clinicians. It was reported to the meeting that about 25% of prescriptions of gabapentin were off-label use, including chronic pain conditions. Several of the clinicians present acknowledged that they were using gabapentin in their own patients.    </p>

Counsel for Mylan and Actavis submitted that it was more likely that Prof Woolf would have heard about the campaign before the priority date. I do not accept this. In July 1996 Prof Woolf was based in the UK, and there is no evidence that Parke-Davis undertook a similar campaign in the UK. Although Prof Woolf travelled occasionally to the USA for conferences, there is nothing to suggest that he would have learnt about the campaign on those occasions.  </p>

Secondly, such anaesthetists and neurologists would have been aware that there was only anecdotal evidence that gabapentin <span style="font-style:italic">appeared</span> to be effective for the treatment of neuropathic pain, and therefore was worth trying, particularly in patients for whom other treatments had been ineffective. It was not known that gabapentin was effective for the treatment of neuropathic pain, nor was there any proper scientific evidence for such a hypothesis (so far as the common general knowledge was concerned, although there was evidence in the Radulovic prior art discussed below).             </p>

Dr Scadding’s evidence was that he had prescribed gabapentin off-label for the treatment of neuropathic pain well before the priority date. He had become aware of gabapentin no later than January 1994 when it was profiled in an article in <span style="font-style:italic">The Lancet</span>. His belief was that he had prescribed gabapentin for neuropathic pain before reading the Galer and Rawbotham articles. His opinion was that the use of gabapentin for treating pain was common general knowledge.  In support of this, he said that his approach was the same as other clinicians that he knew and that he recalled discussing the use of gabapentin for pain with other people at the time, although he could not pinpoint this knowledge to before July 1996. Dr Scadding accepted, however, that if a drug was being used off-label generally, one would expect to see that represented in case reports from the UK; but there were no case reports from the UK concerning the use of gabapentin to treat pain before the priority date. He also accepted that it takes a considerable time from the very first prescription of a drug for a new condition for that use to become common general knowledge. In addition, he accepted that there was no basis to suggest that it was common general knowledge that gabapentin was effective to treat pain in 1996. Although there had been some enthusiastic case reports, one could have no expectation that it would work, not least because the mechanism of action was unknown. Furthermore, he himself had not achieved the degree of success that some had reported.      </p>

The three most frequent Read codes are ones clearly associated with epilepsy. There is only one prescription (and that only in the fourth quarter of 1996) that appears to relate to a condition marked by neuropathic pain. On the other hand, the fourth and fifth most common Read codes are “unknown” and “unspecified”, which together amount to 18.6% of the prescriptions. Thus this evidence is rather inconclusive.  </p>

It is also common ground that the mere fact that a new drug was an anticonvulsant would not give the skilled team an expectation that the drug would be useful for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Mylan and Actavis contend, however, that the skilled team’s perception was that there was sufficient commonality between epilepsy and neuropathic pain, in that both could be characterised by neuronal hyperexcitability, that there was a reasonable basis for thinking that such a drug might be effective in treating neuropathic pain.

A low-intensity stimulus in this mode can, acting via lowthreshold afferents, generate pain, the phenomenon of allodynia (Fig 5.5). This needs to be differentiated from the situation which operates when the transduction properties of highthreshold afferents are changed so that their threshold falls (peripheral sensitization) (Fig. 5.6 and see Ch. 1). The sensitization of the dorsal horn can occur following peripheral tissue injury, peripheral inflammation and damage to the peripheral and central nervous systems. In addition to the reduction in the threshold of stimuli required to elicit pain in Mode 3, the response to suprathreshold high-intensity stimuli is exaggerated (Fig. 5.7).

Acute tissue damage and inflammatory states will directly and indirectly lead to the activation of nociceptors which will induce central sensitization. On recovery from the damage or inflammation, the source of the input during the central changes is removed and the hyperalgesia and allodynia commonly disappear within several hours or days. Neuropathic pain, in contrast, is typically persistent and intractable (Ch.10). One explanation may be that a constant drive of input from axotomized nociceptors is present (Devor 1991), which maintains the central sensitization. Another is that associated with peripheral nerve damage is the decrease in segmental inhibitory mechanisms (Wall &amp; Devor 1981; Woolf &amp; Wall 1982) which exaggerates the synaptic response to afferent input.” </p>

However once hyperalgesia is established, it does not need to be maintained by inputs from the peripheral tissue.” Under the heading “Central sensitisation” the article states that “recent experimental studies suggest that sensitisation within the CNS also contributes significantly to this phenomenon [hyperalgesia]” (page 261).

This may be the consequence of three different kinds of pathological change produced by nerve lesions. First, a maintained state of central sensitization in response to ongoing ectopic C-fibre input either from the site of injury or the DRG (the generator model). Second, decreased inhibition due to impaired inhibitory transmission, as a result of either a decrease in GABA levels or an excitotoxic loss of inhibitory neurones (the disinhibition model). We have recently shown that disinhibition results in a central hypersensitivity phenomenon. Finally, A-mediated pain might be the consequence of a reorganization of synaptic connections in the spinal cord (the structural model).” Prof Woolf goes on: </p>

Counsel for Mylan and Actavis suggested that Prof Woolf had been influenced by the knowledge that, as he explained, the theory advanced in his own paper had been shown after the priority date to be incorrect. This suggestion does not address the points that that there were just two papers (or three, if one includes the one referred to in the next paragraph) and that they had been very little cited, however.   </p>

As the title suggests, the authors examined 208 patients with PHN. Those examinations were carried out at the start of a prospective, longitudinal study that was designed, amongst other things, to examine long-term responses to pain treatment. The results were recorded in two tables. Table IV indicates that in a sample of 158 patients with PHN, hyperesthesia (a term used to cover both hyperalgesia and allodynia) was confirmed in 65% and absent in 28%. Table V reports on a more detailed examination of 50 patients, and indicates that 58% had allodynia and only 14% had hyperalgesia. Thus about 30% of the patients did not have either hyperalgesia or allodynia. But about 70% did. </p>

In fact, if you look at the class of drugs that were most commonly used to treat those conditions, whether it be neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, any of the conditions that were characterised by the non-italicised version, central augmentation, amplification, the most commonly used class of drugs for all of those conditions were tricyclic drugs that were  originally developed as anti-depressants. Amitriptyline is the one we have heard a lot about. That drug, although it binds very weakly to NMDA receptors, at the time and subsequent to the priority date, was really thought to be working more so by working on the inhibitory pathways. We have heard about disinhibition, those pathways that go from the brain areas, the peri-aqueductal grey – the Yunus chapter. We are just talking about those. So, compounds, which were the drugs most broadly used in clinical conditions, characterised by hyperalgesia, were probably not working on the italicised version of central sensitisation. They were working on the broader concept of central sensitisation. So that, clinically, in 1996, and even at present, the non-italicised version of central sensitisation is what we identify with hyperalgesia and allodynia and the classes of drugs that work in those conditions. Some may be working on the italicised version, but many are not working on the italicised version. They are treating hyperalgesia and allodynia via different mechanisms.” </p>

Although Prof Woolf accepted that the second phase was a model of inflammatory pain, he did not accept that it was a model of inflammation. He was adamant that it was important to recognise that the immune system drove inflammation and that the immune response took place over several hours (i.e. after the period covered by the second phase). Prof Woolf accepted, however, that neurogenic inflammation started very soon after tissue damage occurred in the first phase, with the release of neuropeptides from the peripheral terminals of nociceptors which caused swelling. He also accepted that tissue damage released inflammatory mediators, such as bradykinin, histamine, serotonin and prostaglandins, which were present and active during the second phase. He emphasised, however, that central sensitisation greatly amplified this low-level input. </p>

Models such as the formalin test in the rat have been shown to be associated with a two-phased response, with the magnitude of the secondphase behaviour being in excess of that anticipated on the basis of the afferent activity measured in the peripheral afferent at the corresponding time points (Heapy et al 1987; Wheeler Aceto et al 1990). Similarly, other models of hyperalgesia involving chronic inflammatory states may well be involved in such states of facilitated processing (though if the increased pain behaviour reflects upon a greater sensitivity of the peripheral nerve to the stimulus, then this hyperalgesia might reflect a model mediated by a peripheral mechanism). The spinal delivery of certain afferent transmitters, such as sP or NMDA will evoke a prominent decrease in the thermal nociceptive threshold of the unanaesthetized rat, corresponding to the presumed mechanisms set into play by repetitive afferent input. In man, the focal activation of cutaneous C-fibres by the subcutaneous injection of capsaicin results in a prominent acute pain behaviour followed by a profound hyperalgesia over an area of skin that greatly exceeds the focal site of the original stimulus. Importantly, this secondary hyperalgesia appears centrally mediated, for (as with the formalin test) if the acute afferent barrage is blocked by local anaesthetic, the secondary phase does not occur (Torebjörk et al 1992).” </p>

Only at double that dose, 20 mg/kg, had a very small, albeit significant, effect been observed in the second phase. By way of comparison, the usual dose of amitriptyline used to treat neuropathic pain in humans was about 1 mg/kg. So the rats needed 20 times the normal human dose before even a minimal effect was observed.

Fluoxetine did not work in any of the models. Mexiletine reduced hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia in both models. Desipramine reduced hyperalgesia in both models, but not tactile allodynia. The authors therefore concluded that “the neuronal mechanisms underlying the two manifestations of neuropathic pain [i.e. hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia] are different” (summary at 161). It can therefore be seen that the paper provides little support for the proposition that the second phase of the formalin test was regarded as predictive of efficacy for neuropathic pain.</p>

Futhermore, when it was put to him that “some people thought that the formalin test modelled neuropathic pain”, Prof Wood disagreed, saying that “some people hoped that it might be”, that the hope was not fulfilled and that it was not common general knowledge. Remarkably, counsel for Warner-Lambert submitted in his closing submissions that in this cross-examination counsel “was not attempting to establish that the theory was generally accepted, but that it would be recognised”.  </p>

Singh, “Role of excitatory amino acid receptors in the mediation of the nociceptive response to formalin in the rate”, <span style="font-style:italic">Neuroscience Letters</span>, 174, 217-221 (1994). It is correct that in this paper the authors (who included the inventor of the Patent) use the second phase of the formalin test to test certain agents for their effect on central sensitisation. As they explain, however, “since the tonic phase of the formalin response is accompanied by a prolonged inflammatory response, potential anti-inflammatory properties of these compounds were also investigated against carrageenin-induced inflammation in the rat”. Thus they recognise that the second phase of the formalin test comprises both central sensitisation and inflammatory components. To try to ascertain which component the agents are acting on, they also test them in the carrageenin model. As the agents do not act in the carrageenin model, they are able to conclude that the agents attenuate central sensitisation. </p>

Nor was it put to Prof Wood that the paper was common general knowledge. He said that he read the journal in which it is appeared, but only to scan it rather than as core reading.

The basis for this is that, as Prof Woolf and Prof Wood agreed, it was known that NSAIDs were efficacious in the second phase, but not the first phase, of the formalin test. As I have already noted, the experts were agreed that NSAIDs were not effective for neuropathic pain. At least in relation to peripheral neurpathic pain, however, this is not quite as strong a point as it may appear, because Prof Woolf’s evidence when it was put to him was that NSAIDs were effective in the Bennett model, albeit only when administered intrathecally at high doses, of the order of 100 to 1000 times higher than a patient could tolerate. </p>

Surprisingly, this is not something that was stated by Prof Wood in his reports, and therefore I have approached this proposition with scepticism.

Thus Prof Woolf drew a distinction between dynamic allodynia and static allodynia. This is consistent with Bennett (cited above) which draws the same distinction (at pages 212-213). It is clear from the literature that, as one would expect, if the experimenter is interested in dynamic allodynia as opposed to static allodynia, then different stimuli are required (for example, a light brush).

It is convenient to defer consideration of this question to the context of infringement, to which it is primarily relevant. Neither side suggested that the precise nature of the mental element was significant to the issues on obviousness (let alone insufficiency). </p>

The abstract says that 3-isobutyl GABA is “structurally related to the novel anticonvulsant gabapentin”. The structures of GABA, gabapentin and (S)-3-isobutyl GABA (pregabalin) are shown in Figure 1. The introduction says that “there are only a small number of molecular targets that are generally accepted to be relevant for clinical therapy of epilepsies”, that “gabapentin has been proven to be an effective treatment for prevention of partial seizures in patients refractory to available drugs” and that “the molecular site of action of gabapentin is not well understood” (page 11). It then says that a “novel binding site labeled by tritiated gabapentin has been described in membrane fractions from rat brain tissue” (page 12, left-hand column). It goes on to say that this binding site “has been used to evaluate a number of derivatives of gabapentin and structurally related compounds”. Pregabalin is then identified as being “one of a series of GABA derivatives substituted at the 3-position and of these derivatives is the most potent anticonvulsant in vivo” (page 12, left-hand column). </p>

The R enantiomer was inactive, however. Taylor I also reports binding studies using radiolabelled gabapentin and partially purified synaptic plasma membranes from rat cortexes. The results in Figure 3 show that pregabalin binds to the same binding site as gabapentin, but more potently.

Together these findings strongly suggest that the gabapentin-binding site is novel in comparison to commonly studied neurotransmitter and drug receptor sites of brain.

There may be no certainty of success but the skilled person might nevertheless assess the prospects of success as being sufficient to warrant a trial. In some circumstances this may be sufficient to render an invention obvious. On the other hand, there are areas of technology such as pharmaceuticals and biotechnology which are heavily dependent on research, and where workers are faced with many possible avenues to explore but have little idea if any one of them will prove fruitful. Nevertheless they do pursue them in the hope that they will find new and useful products.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">Mylan and Actavis’ obviousness case is focussed on the use of pregabalin for the treatment of neuropathic pain, i.e. claim 3 and subsidiary claims falling within the ambit of claim 3. It suffers from the basic difficulty that none of the prior art relied on discloses both pregabalin and use for the treatment of neuropathic pain (or any kind of pain). Mylan and Actavis advance a series of different arguments, which divide into two main groups. The first group starts from the proposition that the potential utility of gabapentin for treating neuropathic pain was common general knowledge. On this basis, Mylan and Actavis rely upon Taylor II alternatively Gee alternatively Radulovic (read with Taylor I or Gee) as starting points. If this was not common general knowledge, as I have concluded, Mylan and Actavis rely upon Mellick (read with Taylor II or Gee) alternatively Radulovic (read with Taylor I or Gee) as starting points. It can thus be seen that Mylan and Actavis’ case depends on the skilled team reading (at least) two items of prior art together. It is well established that, in principle, this is a perfectly permissible line of argument; but it is more difficult to make good than a case based solely upon the disclosure of a single item of prior art (read with the common general knowledge).  </p>

Although Prof Wood gave evidence in his first report that the neuroscientist would carry out a literature search “to identify other scientific papers relating to gabapentin”, and that he believed that the neuroscientist would find Gee as a result, he was not specific as to what search would be done or how. In cross-examination he accepted that he could not be sure what papers would be found. Nor was any case put to Prof Woolf in cross-examination as to the nature of the search that would be carried out. Still less was it put that the skilled team would inevitably find Gee. Accordingly, I am not persuaded that it has been established that the skilled team would find Gee as a result of reading Mellick.                   </p>

I am unimpressed with this point for two reasons. First, no basis was put to Prof Wood for thinking either that the skilled team would read this paper or that it accurately represented the reaction of the skilled team to Taylor II. Secondly and more importantly, Taylor II does present evidence of correlation, and as noted above, the contrary was not put to Prof Wood.

Prof Wood agreed that this was an interesting observation, but he thought that it could be explained by the conditions under which the binding assay was carried out and the requirement for transport of the compounds into the cells. Accordingly, he would not be concerned by the discrepancy. </p>

Pregabalin is mentioned, and some data relating to it is presented, but there is no emphasis on pregabalin in Taylor II. Once the skilled team moved beyond testing gabapentin, moreover, there are various other possibilities that they could explore. Thus Prof Wood accepted that he would be interested in testing the amino acids mentioned in the note added to Suman-Chauhan in proof, and that they would possibly be higher on his list than pregabalin. I accept that the skilled team would be motivated and that the tests would not be difficult or expensive to carry out, but nevertheless anything more than a test of gabapentin would still be a research project, as Prof Wood accepted. As Prof Woolf emphasised (albeit in the context of Radulovic), there are ethical issues with animal tests and they do take time and resources, and thus the skilled team would prioritise testing for compounds for which there was a clear rationale in the form of data.   </p>

This abstract (which was for a poster presentation by Prof Bennett at the 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Annual Meeting for the Society of Neuroscience in San Diego in November 1995) states that gabapentin is a “novel antiepileptic with an unique binding pattern in brain, and an unknown mechanism of action.”  It then states that Mellick and Mellick “suggests that it may have efficacy in the treatment of neuropathic pain”.  The abstract describes studies of gabapentin’s effect on “heathyperalgesia” and “mechano-hyperalgesia (pin prick test) and mechano-allodynia (v. Frey hair test)”. It reports that heat hyperalgesia and mechano-allodynia, but not mechano-hyperalgesia, were “significantly reduced in a dose-related manner”. It concludes by saying “Our results suggest that [gabapentin] may be useful in the clinic and that its effects may be mediated by a spinal site of action”. </p>

It is fair to say that Taylor I is more focussed than Taylor II. Nevertheless the skilled team starting from Radulovic is only reading Taylor I in order to follow up the references given by Radulovic. Thus the context is the skilled team’s interest in what Radulovic has taught them about gabapentin. It is true that Taylor I teaches them that pregabalin is structurally related to gabapentin, binds more potently and is a more potent anticonvulsant, but it does not say anything about pregabalin’s effect on neuropathic pain. For the reasons I have given when discussing Taylor II, I do not consider that it would be obvious to test pregabalin as well gabapentin. Indeed, as counsel for Warner-Lambert pointed out, Radulovic emphasises how much work has been done on gabapentin, and yet how little was known about its mechanism of action. As the skilled team would appreciate, much less work had been done on pregabalin. Furthermore, like Suman-Chauhan, which it cites, Radulovic draws attention to the neutral L-amino acids as another possibility to investigate.         </p>

The first is that, even on Warner-Lambert’s construction, claim 1 is extremely broad. Prof Woolf accepted that the idea that a compound would be useful for all the conditions listed in [0003] was really quite extraordinary. The second is that the specification expressly states that the data presented show that pregabalin is effective in the treatment of inflammatory pain, a statement which it is common ground that the skilled team would regard as entirely plausible. By contrast, the specification does not claim that the data presented show that pregabalin is effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain, let alone conditions such as idiopathic pain. Thirdly, the specification expressly mentions two recognised models of neuropathic pain, but presents no data from such models. Fourthly, as already noted, there is no mention in the specification of the unifying principle relied upon by Warner-Lambert, namely central sensitisation. Indeed, there is no suggestion in the specification that there is any unifying characteristic or principle which enables a prediction to be made in respect of conditions other than inflammatory pain. Fifthly, the skilled team would note that the specification does not refer to either hyperalgesia or allodynia when discussing the formalin test. Sixthly, the skilled team would appreciate that the data presented in the Patent do not discriminate between primary and secondary hyperalgesia, but it is only the latter that indicates the presence of central sensitisation. Furthermore, the skilled team would appreciate that it would have been quite easy to design the experiments in way that did measure secondary hyperalgesia. Seventhly, as counsel for Mylan and Actavis pointed out, it is telling that counsel for Warner-Lambert suggested to Dr Scadding and Prof Wood in crossexamination that there was sufficient data in the Patent to make obvious to try pregabalin for neuropathic pain. That is not enough for sufficiency.  </p>

It follows that Warner-Lambert cannot rely upon central sensitisation as a unifying characteristic or principle which embraces central neuropathic pain. Even if the skilled team reading the Patent with their common general knowledge as to central sensitisation regarded it as plausible that pregabalin would be effective for peripheral neuropathic pain, they would not consider that that rationale extended to central neuropathic pain. Thus Prof Woolf accepted that, based on the data in the Patent, it would be impossible for the skilled team to make any reasonable prediction that pregabalin would be effective for treating central neuropathic pain, whereas he maintained that it could be predicted that it would be effective for peripheral neuropathic pain. It is for this reason that counsel for WarnerLambert argued that claim 3 should be construed as limited to peripheral neuropathic pain.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">In the alternative, counsel for Warner-Lambert argued that a unifying characteristic or principle which embraced central neuropathic pain was the presence of hyperalgesia and/or allodynia. I do not consider that this argument is open to Warner-Lambert, since it was not pleaded, advanced in Warner-Lambert’s evidence or opening skeleton argument, was not put to Dr Scadding or Prof Wood, was not supported by Prof Woolf and was first suggested by Prof Clauw (who gave evidence last) in crossexamination. In any event, I do not accept that, considered as a whole, the evidence supports it. As I have said, the only expert who espoused it was Prof Clauw and then only very late in the day. Furthermore, as counsel for Mylan and Actavis pointed out, this argument is difficult to reconcile with the fact that NSAIDs were known to be effective for the treatment of inflammatory pain, but not neuropathic pain, a problem that becomes particularly acute when one is dealing with central neuropathic pain. (While this is also an obstacle to Warner-Lambert’s case with respect to peripheral neuropathic pain, it is less of an issue for the reason explained in paragraph 234 above.)     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">Turning to peripheral neuropathic pain, I consider that the evidence is finely balanced. In addition to the general points made above, Warner-Lambert’s case suffers from the problem that it has not been established that it was common general knowledge that the rat paw formalin test was predictive of efficacy for neuropathic pain. Moreover, as discussed above, Prof Woolf accepted that the carrageenin and post-operative pain models did not assist in this regard. Nevertheless, I have concluded on balance that, given that plausibility is a relatively low threshold, the data contained in the specification, when read with the common general knowledge, just make it plausible that pregabalin would be effective to treat peripheral neuropathic pain. This is because the common general knowledge as to (i) the involvement of central sensitisation (at least as an amplifying mechanism) in both inflammatory pain and peripheral neuropathic pain and (ii) the role played by central sensitisation in the rat paw formalin test would have suggested to the skilled team that it was possible that a drug which was effective for inflammatory pain, in particular as modelled by the second phase of the formalin test, would also be effective in peripheral neuropathic pain, although this would not necessarily be the case. This conclusion is supported by the evidence not only of Prof Woolf, but also of Dr Scadding and Prof Wood in crossexamination. Dr Scadding said that, when he read the Patent, he thought that it “could be the case” that pregabalin would be effective for (peripheral) neuropathic pain, although a demonstration of that was missing. Prof Wood more or less accepted that it was a credible suggestion, although he made it clear that he would want to test it experimentally. </p>

The guidance notes that pregabalin appears to be more sought after for misuse than gabapentin, that there is a growing illegal market, that the drugs are also being bought from online pharmacies and that prescribing per capita in secure settings is double that in the community.

As Ms Howe explained, the starting point of any consideration of prescribing practice is the fundamental principle of the prescriber’s clinical freedom. Nevertheless, generic prescribing is encouraged at all levels of the healthcare system, including by the Department of Health, NHS England, CCGs and Health Boards and by the professions. This is for both clinical and financial reasons. The clinical reasons are that prescribing generically helps remind clinicians of the therapeutic action of the drug, enables greater certainty amongst healthcare professionals when treating a patient (e.g. when the patient moves between care providers) and promotes dispensing flexibility (and hence speed).        </p>

At the hearing in January 2015, Actavis adduced evidence from a pharmacist who examined his pharmacy’s prescription records for December 2014. During that month they received 55 prescriptions for Lyrica. Of those, only 17 were filed by the patient in person, while the remaining 38 were filed either by patients’ representatives or were sent to the pharmacy as a part of its delivery service. This is clearly a small sample, but it is the only evidence on this point before the court. (In saying this, I should make it clear that Actavis did not tender this witness at trial; but no party adduced any other evidence on this point.) What this indicates is that, in a very substantial proportion of cases, a pharmacist who receives a prescription for pregabalin cannot ask the patient what indication the drug has been prescribed for. </p>

It may therefore be questioned to what extent such patients will be able accurately to answer a question as to the indication for which they have been prescribed pregabalin.

Part VIII contains a range of commonly used drugs, of which pregabalin is one. Part VIII is divided into five categories: Category A (readily available drugs, where the reimbursement price is calculated from a weighted average of the list price for four suppliers, provided that the drug is available from both of two of the suppliers or from one of those two and the other two), B (where usage has declined over time), C (price based on a particular brand or supplier), E (extemporaneously prepared) and M (the most widely available drugs, where the reimbursement price is calculated by the Department of Health in accordance with an agreement negotiated between the Department and the British Generic Manufacturers Association under section 261 of the National Health Service Act 2006).

This suggested quite a high level of off-label prescribing, and moreover off-label prescribing for conditions which extended beyond pain and psychiatric conditions. </p>

The second is that in January to September 2014 there appears to have been a sharp drop in percentage of pregabalin prescribed for pain (from 63% to 54%) and a sharp increase in “other diseases” (from 24% to 32%) compared to 2013.  </p>

The GPs record their diagnoses using Read codes. IMS maps the Read codes to ICD 10 codes using a proprietary correlation. Towards the end of 2011, Pfizer and IMS agreed a set of allocations of ICD 10 codes that would allow prescriptions to be divided between different disease and indication categories in the field of pain, psychiatry and epilepsy. This exercise was undertaken by Pfizer’s then European Medical Lead for Pain/CNS in conjunction with its European Business Analytics and Insight team. As Dr Phillips confirmed, thereafter Pfizer used these allocations on a daily basis in its business to allow Pfizer to ascertain the relative proportions of prescriptions written for each drug for each indication in any given period. The allocations were not specific to pregabalin. Importantly, it was these allocations that underpinned the 54% figure quoted above. </p>

In the first stage, Pfizer sought to align the figure attributable to pain with the figure on which Pfizer was basing its Brand Equalisation deals (as to which, see below), namely 59% for pain. In the first stage of the exercise, Pfizer decided to reallocate seven ICD 10 codes from “other diseases” to pain.  </p>

As noted in paragraph 33 above, this work was initially done by two scientists who were not medically qualified.  </p>

It should be noted, however, that these figures do not present the raw percentages from the reallocated IMS medical audit data. Rather, these percentages are the result of combining the medical audit data with “moving annual total” sales figures for pregabalin from IMS. The medical audit data is published quarterly and averages four quarters, with the result that the moving annual total analysis reflected seven quarters of medical audit data. Thus these figures essentially reflect an average of seven quarters of medical audit data. For example, the 59% figure for pain originally proposed by Pfizer in its Brand Equalisation deals (as to which, see paragraph 506 below) was based on an analysis of the June 2014 moving annual total of sales proportioned in accordance with the medical audit data, whereas the 54% figure in evidence at the January hearing was based on the September 2014 moving annual total. Dr Phillips was unable to explain why the medical audit data had been combined with the sales data in this way. Nevertheless, this does not appear to matter greatly for present purposes. </p>

This produced the following figures: pain 78.6%, psychiatry 15.3%, epilepsy 2.1% and other diseases 4.0%. Applying the same approach to the data for the quarter to December 2014 produced the following figures: pain 78.1%, psychiatry 16.1%, epilepsy 2.2% and other diseases 3.6%.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">Of the ICD 10 codes which were reallocated by Pfizer, by far the most frequently occurring was “R693”, corresponding to “Diagnosis Not Stated”. As noted above, the IMS data appears to show an increase in the “other diseases” category from 24% in 2013 to 32% in September 2014. It appears that this was due to the GPs on the IMS panel changing from iSoft to EMIS in September/October 2013. Unlike iSoft, EMIS does not routinely prompt users to link prescriptions to a diagnosis. This resulted in a significant increase in use of the code R693. (It also resulted in a temporary dip in the number of GPs on the IMS panel for the fourth quarter of 2013, to just under 300.) The percentage of prescriptions attributed to R693 increased still further in the first quarter of 2015. </p>

First, Dr Phillips accepted that the exercise included allocating conditions to the pain category which were very unlikely to have been treated with pregabalin, such as cystitis, and thus were more likely to reflect a coding error. Secondly, Dr Phillips accepted that for some conditions pregabalin could just as easily be treating anxiety as it could pain. Thirdly, in several instances Dr Jones considered the diagnoses to be poorly defined, which Dr Phillips accepted was a reasonable view. Fourthly, and perhaps most importantly, Dr Jones’ evidence was that the pro-rating of unspecified diagnoses was inappropriate. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">Dr Jones gave a number of reasons for this. First, it assumed that there was no offlabel use (or least no off-label use outside the categories of pain and psychiatry), whereas the evidence suggested that there was wider off-label use. Secondly, it assumed that the failure to link the prescription to a diagnosis was equally likely for all three categories, whereas Dr Jones’ view was that the link between pregabalin and epilepsy was firm, the link between pregabalin and pain less so and the link between pregabalin and anxiety disorders considerably less so. Moreover, Dr Jones considered it likely that a considerable proportion of the unspecified prescriptions related to the use of pregabalin to deal with anxiety states that were associated with addiction (which might initially be addiction to another substance, although it could become pregabalin). Thirdly, it assumed that pregabalin was only ever prescribed for one condition, whereas it may in fact be prescribed for both pain and anxiety.  </p>

The most recent such data are those from 2013 (although this includes the quarter in which the switchover occurred, the full effect of the switchover was not felt until 2014).

In particular, he agreed that the reallocations of 20 of the 50 codes reallocated to pain were fair. Thus he accepted that the figure for pain in January to September 2014 should be increased to 58.7%. Furthermore, in cross-examination, he accepted that in some additional instances it was more likely than not either that the code reflected a diagnosis for pain or that the prescriptions could be apportioned between pain and anxiety. </p>

Even though Actavis had placed the steps taken and not taken by Pfizer in this regard squarely in issue, Pfizer did not adduce evidence from any member of the relevant team. Ms Tully knew little about this topic. Dr Phillips was able to supplement her evidence in one respect, but again he was not the right person to give evidence about it.

The preferred option was a full label, but Actavis knew that, from a regulatory perspective, it would be possible to restrict their application for a marketing authorisation to a skinny label later on if appropriate.  </p>

Mr Wilson explained that Actavis frequently used the X% figure when planning product launches, because experience had shown that it was a figure that allowed for considerable flexibility: if Actavis planned for X%, then they could quite easily cope with selling either more or less than that figure in the initial period after the launch.

For this purpose, data was obtained from IMS in August 2014. Actavis carried out a rather crude analysis of the IMS data which suggested that about 71% of the market was for pain and about 29% for non-patented uses. This was done by Stephen Harrison, a business information manager who was not medically qualified. Mr Wilson’s evidence was that it was regarded as no more than an approximate estimate. Subsequently Actavis re-analysed the figures in October 2014. This produced a figure of 74% for pain, as result of re-distributing 5% of other uses between pain, seizure and anxiety. The figure which was most consistently used by Actavis in its forecasts and plans was 70%, however. This is the 71% figure rounded down. </p>

Given that Actavis were hoping to obtain a marketing authorisation quickly, Actavis were hopeful that they would face no or limited generic competition for the non-patented indications when they launched, and therefore would achieve a better than X% share. In addition, Actavis knew that they could, if necessary, sell the product over a longer period of time given that it has a shelf life of two years. In any event, the initial quantity of product had already been ordered by that point in time. Accordingly, Actavis did not revise their sales forecasts for pregabalin to reflect the fact that they would only be targeting an estimated 30% of the pregabalin market.  </p>

Pfizer contends, however, that this shows that Actavis foresaw that Lecaent would be dispensed for neuropathic pain. I do not accept this.

While receipt by a patient of a generic drug dispensed for an indication which remains covered by a second medical use patent, and which has therefore been carved out of the skinny label, is one possible circumstance where such reassurance would be useful, it is not the only one. This point is highlighted by the wording which is used by Actavis. Counsel for Pfizer implied during her cross-examination of Mr Wilson that the change in wording was somehow improper or suspicious. It has the advantage, however, that it covers the situation where the doctor has prescribed pregabalin off-label.

This is a common step taken by originators when a generic version of a drug is about to be launched. Brand Equalisation deals involve the originator discounting the price of the branded product offered to specific customers so as to compete with the price of the generic product. Pfizer has entered into Brand Equalisation deals in respect of Lyrica with a number of its largest pharmacy customers. These include three of the four largest chains, namely Boots, Lloyds and The Well Group. Ms Tully’s evidence was that the customers with whom Brand Equalisation deals had been agreed had a combined share of the UK market for prescription medicines of about 42%. Pfizer’s original proposals for these Brand Equalisation deals were based on the percentage of pregabalin being prescribed for pain being 59%, but this was subsequently changed to 78%.   </p>

These complaints give rise to one of a number of side issues as to regulatory law which have arisen in these proceedings, namely whether Actavis was able to send such letters prior to receiving its marketing authorisation. I shall consider that below (see paragraphs 576-584). </p>

The first is that Actavis deal almost entirely with wholesalers. Thus Actavis would have to require its wholesalers to impose contractual terms on pharmacies. In order to make such terms enforceable by Actavis, provision would have to be made in accordance with the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999. While in theory this is possible, the practical reality is that enforcing contractual terms at one remove is never as easy as enforcing them between contracting parties. Secondly, it puts the dispensing pharmacist in a difficult position: how does he or she know what would amount to “reasonable enquiries” and “reasonable checks”? Thirdly, for this reason, it would be likely to discourage wholesalers and pharmacists from selling Lecaent. </p>

Actavis contend that they could not do this for regulatory reasons. I will consider that issue below (see paragraphs 585-589). Even if it was permissible, I remain of the view that there are two problems with this demand. The first is that it would be unlikely to be very effective in the absence of knowledge as to the indication for which pregabalin had been prescribed. The second is that it would deter pharmacists from stocking Lecaent, both because of the (small amount of) extra work required to remove the wrapper and because of a concern that they would be unable to comply with the notice. </p>

Counsel for Pfizer suggested to Mr Wilson that the scheme could be modified to allow pharmacists to stock the product. Mr Wilson said that this would be cumbersome. As counsel for Actavis pointed out, it would require GPs to prescribe by brand for the non-patented indications (rather than generically). The scheme would have to apply to all generic entrants into the market, each of whom would have to adopt their own brand name. Thus it would also require the GPs to memorise the new brand names for each and every generic entrant and to choose arbitrarily between them when writing the prescription (which would also require the clinical software to be modified). It would also require pharmacists to stock all of the branded generic products. In short, it would be unworkable. In addition, Ms Howe said that the Department of Health would regard prescribing by brand in this way as unsatisfactory from a pharmacy policy perspective, because it ran counter to the advantages of generic prescribing. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">Ms Howe explained that NHS GP contracts take one of three forms: General Medical Services (“GMS”) contracts, for which there are mandatory terms in the National Health Service (General Medical Services) Regulations 2004; Personal Medical Services (“PMS”) contracts, for which there are mandatory terms in the National Health Service (Personal Medical Services) Regulations 2004; and Alternative Provider Medical Services (“APMS”) contracts, for which there are mandatory terms in the Alternative Provider Medical Services Directions 2013. Most GP services are provided under GMS or PMS contracts. Both the GMS and the PMS Regulations require such contracts to include a term requiring contractors to have regard to all relevant guidance issued by NHS England. There is no equivalent provision in the APMS Directions. The upshot is that most GPs are required to have regard to guidance issued by NHS England, but are not bound to follow it.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">It is clear from the evidence that the main reason why it has taken time for the guidance issued by NHS England and others to translate into a higher level of branded prescribing is that many patients who take pregabalin for pain have chronic conditions which require long-term treatment and thus they have repeat prescriptions. Practice with regard to repeat prescriptions varies from surgery to surgery, but typically a patient will be able to obtain repeat prescriptions for 6 or 12 months without seeing a doctor. In the ordinary course, it will only be at the point that the patient sees the doctor that the opportunity will arise to switch that patient’s prescription from generic pregabalin to Lyrica. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">It is possible, however, for a GP practice to arrange for all prescriptions for pregabalin to be reviewed and to switch any prescriptions for generic pregabalin for pain to Lyrica. It would not be necessary for this work all to be done by a GP: the review could be done by an administrator, although a GP would then need to issue the new prescriptions. This would require the expenditure of time and money, however. It is clear from the evidence that, even though the expenditure of time and money is not large, there has been an understandable degree of reluctance on the part of GP practices to expend their own resources on the task. As a result, some practices have requested Pfizer to fund the exercise. Pfizer did not agree to this until counsel for Actavis asked Ms Tully on cross-examination why not. Towards the end of the trial, on 16 July 2015, Pfizer did offer to fund such work, but on the basis that it could recover the costs from the generic companies. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">It was suggested by counsel for Pfizer in her opening submissions, on the basis of some reports in the medical press, that, in addition to the cost issue, some GPs might refuse to follow the guidance issued by NHS on the ground that they regarded it as an interference with their clinical freedom. She did not pursue this suggestion in her closing submissions, and there is no firm evidence to support it. As noted above, there are other circumstances in which prescribing by brand name is established practice, and it does not affect the doctor’s freedom to prescribe whatever drug they consider clinically most appropriate. It seems to me that the negative reactions suggested by the press reports are more likely to be attributable to GPs’ concerns about the spectre of patent infringement (see further below for discussion of the position of doctors in this regard).  </p>

Ms Dagg’s evidence includes examples of this (see paragraph 562 below). In my judgment it is unlikely that many pharmacists will be unaware of it. Of course, this still leaves the situation where the pharmacist is presented with a prescription for generic pregabalin, does not know what indication it has been prescribed for and cannot readily find out (e.g. because the prescription has been presented by someone other than the patient). The more that prescribers prescribe Lyrica for pain, however, the more pharmacists will be justified in assuming that prescriptions written generically are for the non-patented indications.    </p>

It is common ground, however, that this scenario would not apply to Pfizer since it is the owner of the Patent. </p>

Instead, the problem of lack of novelty is addressed by making the claims purpose-limited. As noted above, this is achieved by interpreting the word “for” as importing a mental element, rather than merely as meaning “suitable for”, which is an objective criterion. Because the process of manufacturing the products is being carried out with a new mental element, it is novel. If “for” meant “suitable for”, this would not be the case: pregabalin made before the priority date of the Patent was just as suitable for treating pain as pregabalin made afterwards. What has changed (assuming that the Patent is valid) is that it is now known that pregabalin is effective for the treatment of (neuropathic) pain (or least, has plausibly been predicted to be effective).   </p>

The principle was ineffective there because the old use itself was ‘uninformative’.

The present case is another situation in which one cannot rely on the principle, because the subject matter of the invention is concerned with the purpose of acts which are in themselves no different from those which were done before.

The inclusion of a manufacturing step ensures that it is not. Jacob LJ was not addressing the nature of the mental element in the claim.

Actavis’ test would provide a defence in those circumstances, because the defendant could credibly say that he did not target those sales which he was striving manfully to prevent. The hard case arises because of the peculiarities of the UK's market place for drugs.

Counsel argued that this clearly directs attention to the manufacturer’s purpose, i.e. intention, rather than mere foreseeability as to the prescriber’s intention. As counsel for Actavis put it, on Floyd LJ’s construction, there is no technical nexus between the manufacturer’s acts and the intention to achieve the new therapeutic effect which gives the claim novelty. Without such a nexus, the manufacturer may infringe as a result of the actions of third parties outside the manufacturer’s control. </p>

It is at least arguable that that interpretation does not infringe the policy underlying Article 53(c) or the interpretation of that provision adopted in <span style="font-style:italic">G2/08</span> because the claimed process is complete when the pharmaceutical composition has been prepared. Thus the claim does not interfere with the prescriber’s freedom, any more than a claim for infringement of a conventional product claim pursuant to section 60(2) would do in circumstances where the claimed product came into existence as a result of the prescriber’s actions: compare <span style="font-style:italic">Actavis UK Ltd v Eli Lilly &amp; Co</span> [2015] EWCA Civ 555 at [81]-[92] (Floyd LJ). Furthermore, as discussed below, it is not necessarily the case that it is the prescriber’s intention which is decisive. Turning to the novelty-conferring effect of the manufacturer’s mental state, this is addressed by Floyd LJ at [124]. As for the fact that the manufacturer may infringe as a consequence of the acts of third parties outside his control, Floyd LJ acknowledged this point at [132], but nevertheless was not persuaded by it.  </p>

As they pointed out, Floyd LJ expressly accepted at [118] that “[m]aking pregablin for patients to whom it is to be administered for the non-patented indications is not within the technical subject matter of the claim”. Accordingly, this cannot be an infringing act. Counsel submitted that Floyd LJ’s construction apparently had the consequence that, if it was foreseeable to an unlicensed manufacturer of pregabalin that “<span style="font-style:italic">some</span> of his drug” (as Floyd LJ put it at [127], emphasis added) would be intentionally administered for the treatment of </p>

(In fact, in this case, manufacture of Lecaent could not have infringed the Patent because it was carried out in Bulgaria; but this does not affect the principle involved, nor does it prevent the sale of Lecaent in the UK from being an infringement.) Furthermore, this would be so even if it was foreseeable that the majority (possibly even the vast majority, depending on what was meant by “some”) of the pregabalin made by that manufacturer would be administered for the treatment of the non-patented indications and even if the majority (possibly the vast majority) was in fact administered for the treatment of those indications. Still further, all of the pregabalin would be infringing product, and thus anyone who subsequently dealt in it would also infringe on a strict liability basis. Counsel for Actavis submitted that this outcome would be worse for the manufacturer than the “extreme view” which Floyd LJ rejected at [122], because at least the “extreme view” meant that only the proportion of pregabalin which was in fact administered for the treatment of pain would be infringing. </p>

The only indication I can see as to how he thought it was to be avoided, however, comes when he discusses the question of remedies. As noted above, he suggested that any “potential unfairness” of his interpretation in the first of the two “hard cases” he considered could be mitigated by restricting the scope of the injunction so that it did not prevent the sale of the product. This suggests that he considered that the injunction might somehow be tailored so as only to prohibit manufacture of pregabalin which it was foreseeable would be intentionally administered to treat pain, and not pregabalin which it was foreseeable would be administered for non-patented indications, although his statement that it might be unjust to grant an injunction at all indicates that he appreciated that this could be very difficult. Similarly, it appears that he envisaged that the financial remedy would only apply to pregabalin which it was foreseeable would be intentionally administered to treat pain, presumably on a statistical basis. </p>

(Indeed, as discussed below, it is not merely the manufacturer who cannot foresee this.) Suppose that a manufacturer could foresee that 20% of the pregabalin it manufactured would be intentionally administered to treat pain, and 80% would be administered to treat non-patented indications. The normal rule in patent cases is that each act of manufacture is a fresh potential act of infringement. In the case of any one pack of pregabalin, the statistical chance of it being intentionally administered for treatment of pain would be 20%. Why then should the manufacture of that pack amount to an infringement (particularly bearing in mind that, if one tested the matter on the balance of probabilities, this would fall well short)? And why should all of that manufacturer’s pregabalin be treated as infringing product so that any dealer in any of it infringes? The only way to avoid these difficulties would be to apply a statistical approach, i.e. treating 20% of the manufacturer’s production as being infringing product, but that approach runs into the difficulty that one cannot divide the packs of pregabalin emanating from that manufacturer into packs which are infringing and packs which are not infringing.

Counsel for Actavis submitted, however, that this was incorrect. As counsel pointed out, under section 60(2), it is only the act of supplying (or offering to supply) the “means, relating to an essential element of an invention, for putting the invention into effect” that is an infringement, not the act of manufacturing the means. Furthermore, the “means” do not become infringing articles any dealing in which will be a strict liability infringement. In those circumstances it is relatively straightforward to confine the effects of a finding of infringement to the proportion of the “means essential” which is foreseeably intended to put the invention into effect. The position here is different, because foreseeability on the part of the manufacturer does not provide a sufficient basis to distinguish between infringing and noninfringing acts of manufacture, particularly when it comes to parties downstream from the manufacturer.  </p>

As he made clear at [126], Floyd LJ’s interpretation was inspired by section 60(2), and therefore guidance from that field is equally relevant here. The second is that in the present case the manufacturer is lawfully entitled to manufacture pregabalin for the non-patented indications. As discussed in more detail below, the manufacturer is under a duty to respect Pfizer’s rights (assuming that the Patent is valid); but it may be thought that this duty is appropriately secured and limited by a requirement of intention on the part of the manufacturer.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">There are two main aspects of the dispute. First, counsel for Pfizer submitted that there was no real difference between Floyd LJ’s interpretation of the word “for” and a pure test of foreseeability on the part of the manufacturer that its pregabalin would in fact be used for the treatment of pain. I do not accept this submission. Floyd LJ made it clear at [121] that intentional administration was at the heart of the invention, at [122] that the word “for” provided the link between the manufacture of pregabalin and the intentional use of the drug, at [127] that the word “for” required knowledge or foresight of the ultimate intentional use, at [128] that there were two mental states involved and at [129] that a manufacturer infringes when he knows or foresees that users will intentionally administer pregabalin for the treatment of pain. Thus the requirement of intention is central to his interpretation. It is plainly not a pure test of foreseeability. Furthermore, I agree with counsel for Actavis that a pure test of foreseeability would not be enough to confer novelty on the claim. It is the element of intention which ensures novelty. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, if intention is required, counsel for Pfizer advanced three alternative cases as to how that requirement could be fulfilled. The first alternative is predicated on the assumption that the relevant intention is that of the prescribing doctor. On that basis, counsel for Pfizer submitted that it was sufficient if the doctor intends pregabalin from any source to be administered to the patient for the treatment of pain. The second alternative is predicated on the assumption that the relevant intention is that of the dispensing pharmacist, if necessary in combination with the doctor. On that assumption, counsel for Pfizer submitted it was sufficient that the pharmacist knows that the doctor has prescribed pregabalin for pain and dispenses the generic manufacturer’s product. The third alternative is predicated on the assumption that the relevant intention was that of the patient, if necessary in combination with the doctor and pharmacist. On that assumption, counsel for Pfizer submitted it was sufficient that the patient knows that the doctor has prescribed pregabalin for pain and that the pharmacist has dispensed the generic manufacturer’s product. </p>

I agree that the intention of the doctor is highly relevant, if not exclusively so. Floyd LJ expressly referred to “the doctor” at [119], and at [121] he made the point that the novelty of the claim derives from “the intention of producing the new therapeutic effect”. It is the prescribing doctor who intends to produce the new therapeutic effect (here treating pain) because it is the doctor who has the requisite medical knowledge (derived from the SmPC for Lyrica, and hence from the clinical trials carried out by Pfizer to substantiate the claim made in the Patent of efficacy for neuropathic pain, or from the doctor’s appreciation that pregabalin may also be effective for treating other kinds of pain if prescribed off-label, as is also claimed in the Patent).  </p>

I agree with this. Floyd LJ expressly referred at [127] to the manufacturer foreseeing that “some of <span style="font-style:italic">his</span> drug will intentionally be used for pain [emphasis added]”. Furthermore, it would make no sense for it to be sufficient that the doctor intended pregabalin from any source to be administered for pain. Infringement must </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">What about the pharmacist? Floyd LJ does not expressly refer to the pharmacist in his analysis, but as counsel for Pfizer pointed out, his language in [122]-[129] is quite general, referring, for example, to “intentional use for pain”. After considerable hesitation, I have concluded that, on Floyd LJ’s reasoning, the intention of the pharmacist is also relevant. In general, of course, the pharmacist will simply intend to dispense the drug which the doctor has prescribed for the purpose of treating whatever indication the doctor has prescribed that drug for. Moreover, in general, the pharmacist will not know what that indication is. In those circumstances the pharmacist’s intention adds nothing to that of the doctor. Even if the doctor prescribes generic pregabalin for treating pain and the pharmacist dispenses the generic manufacturer’s product, neither the doctor nor the pharmacist nor the two in combination will have <span style="font-style:italic">intended</span> that <span style="font-style:italic">that</span> product be administered for the treatment of pain. But what if the pharmacist knows that the doctor has prescribed generic pregabalin for treating pain and the pharmacist dispenses the generic manufacturer’s product? In those circumstances it seems to me that it can be said that the result is intentional administration of the generic manufacturer’s product to treat pain.   </p>

The patient is the one who is being treated. In general the patient intends to take whatever drug the doctor has prescribed for whatever condition the doctor has prescribed it for. Usually the patient will not have any medical knowledge about the efficacy of that drug for that condition. Moreover, the patient will rely on the pharmacist to dispense the correct drug, and in general the patient will not have any choice as to the source of that drug. Indeed, many patients will be oblivious to the source of the drug.    </p>

In the course of her oral opening submissions, counsel for Pfizer conceded that pharmacists who dispensed Lecaent knowing or believing that the patient was being treated for a non-patented indication did not infringe the Patent. In her closing submissions, however, counsel for Pfizer withdrew this concession. The reason for this <span style="font-style:italic">volte-face</span> is not hard to understand. As I have pointed out above, infringement under section 60(1)(c) is a tort of strict liability. It follows that, if the manufacturer had the relevant state of mind at the time of manufacture of some pregabalin, then anyone who deals in any of that manufacturer’s pregabalin - including pharmacists - will infringe regardless of their state of mind (and regardless of what use is actually made of the pregabalin). This is what Pfizer and its solicitors meant when they referred in many of their communications with stakeholders to pharmacists infringing the Patent “unwittingly”. Counsel for Pfizer initially conceded that pharmacists did not infringe if they dispensed Lecaent for non-patented indications because she appreciated how unattractive this consequence of Pfizer’s case appeared.

To my surprise, not only was this question not addressed by counsel for Pfizer in her skeleton argument, but also she did not have a ready answer to the question when I raised it during her opening submissions. Indeed, it was not until her closing oral submissions that she was able fully to articulate Pfizer’s case.

The first is that, because Swiss form claims are process claims directed at the manufacturer of the medicament or pharmaceutical composition, the mental element must be satisfied as at the date of manufacture: see Floyd LJ at [129]. As noted above, each act of manufacture is a fresh potential act of infringement. Thus acts of manufacture on different dates may differ with respect to the question of infringement if the manufacturer’s mental state differs. The second is that the date on which the cause of action for infringement under section 60(1)(c) accrues is the date of sale or other dealing. In principle, each act of dealing is a fresh potential act of infringement committed on that date. Nevertheless, the infringement analysis will not differ depending on the date of sale if all of the product was made on the same date or on dates as at which the manufacturer’s mental state was the same. </p>

Taking the example postulated in paragraph 629 above, one might say that dealers in the generic manufacturer’s product should only pay damages or account for profits in respect of 20% of the quantities dealt in. That would be a proportionate result, but it would not be a principled one.

In this regard, he went so far as to submit that, even if the court concluded that Actavis had infringed the Patent, no relief should be granted to Pfizer. I do not accept this submission.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">As for the position of NHS England, counsel for Pfizer maintained that NHS England had come under a duty to issue guidance with regard to the prescribing of pregabalin for the reasons set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Warner-Lambert IV</span>. Counsel for Actavis supported this proposition. Counsel for the Secretary of State took issue with it, but did not advance any arguments to the contrary. NHS England was, of course, unrepresented. That being so, and given that the question was not fully argued and that it is not of decisive relevance to Actavis’ liability, I shall not consider this question further. I would nevertheless comment that, if it is correct that NHS England came under such a duty, but NHS England failed to discharge that duty, then that might be something that parties in the position of Actavis could rely upon. As it is, however, in the present case NHS England did issue guidance almost contemporaneously with generic entry into market, albeit as a result of Pfizer’s application. </p>

At the beginning of this period, Actavis had not decided whether to market Lecaent under a full label conditional upon successful revocation of the Patent (or at least claims 1 and 3) or under a skinny label prior to determination of any claim for revocation. By the end of this period, Actavis had decided to market pregabalin under a skinny label. In assessing what was foreseeable to Actavis, it seems to me that I have to consider the position on the basis of what was foreseeable if Actavis elected, as it did, to market pregabalin under a skinny label. </p>

Thus the question to be resolved is whether it was foreseeable to Actavis that, in the 5% of cases where the prescription indicated that pregabalin had been prescribed for pain, the pharmacist would dispense Lecaent despite the fact that it was not licensed for pain? </p>

I consider it probable that, if Actavis had elected to launch Lecaent with a skinny label earlier, they would have made this decision earlier as well. I do not consider that it matters that the intended notification related to neuropathic pain and not all pain: Lyrica is not licensed for pain other than neuropathic pain, and Actavis had no reason to think that pharmacists who refrained from dispensing Lecaent to fulfil prescriptions known to be neuropathic pain would nevertheless dispense it to fulfil prescriptions known to be for other kinds of pain. </p>

Given the way in which that came about, I do not accept this. On the other hand, one thing which Actavis did know, because it is common practice amongst originator companies faced with LOE, is that Pfizer would enter into Brand Equalisation deals with its larger pharmacy customers. Indeed, as noted in paragraph 436 above, in December 2014 Actavis learnt that Pfizer was offering Brand Equalisation deals based on pain being 59% of the pregabalin market. Furthermore, Actavis knew that such deals would be likely to preserve a substantial market share for Lyrica. </p>

The relevance of this is that such launches were likely to depress the generic price for pregabalin, and hence the incentive for pharmacists to dispense generic pregabalin rather than Lyrica where possible. On the other hand, to the extent that Actavis’ competitors took sales away from Actavis, this would make it less likely that Lecaent would be dispensed. Moreover, the full effect of generic competition on price would only be felt if and when pregabalin was moved from Category C to Category A or M of the Drug Tariff. </p>

The first, at [136], was that the courts of two EPC member states considering this question, namely the Court of Appeal of The Hague in <span style="font-style:italic">Novartis v Sun </span>and the Landgericht Hamburg in <span style="font-style:italic">Warner-Lambert v Aliud</span>, have held that indirect infringement can arise in these circumstances. I am puzzled by his reference to the EPC since, as discussed above, the law with regard to indirect infringement derives from the CPC, not the EPC. Leaving that aside, as discussed in <span style="font-style:italic">Warner-Lambert II</span> at [44]-[57] and <span style="font-style:italic">Warner-Lambert III </span>at [4], the reasoning of the Court of Appeal of The Hague in <span style="font-style:italic">Sun v Novartis</span> simply does not address the difficulties with Pfizer’s case on indirect infringement. Much the same is true of the reasoning of the Landgericht Hamburg in <span style="font-style:italic">Warner-Lambert v Aliud </span>considered by Floyd LJ at [82]-[92]. Indeed, as Floyd LJ noted at [89], the Landgericht appears to have treated the Swiss form claims as being the same as EPC 2000 claims i.e. as product rather than process claims. But he himself followed the consistent jurisprudence of the courts of this country and of the EPO Boards of Appeal that they are process claims. </p>

It seems to assume that the invention is the method of treatment. But section 125 of the 1977 Act provides that the invention is that specified in the claim unless the context otherwise requires. Furthermore, as counsel for Actavis pointed out, the Court of Appeal has previously held that, for the purposes of section 60(2), the invention is indeed what it is claimed: see <span style="font-style:italic">Menashe Business Mercantile Ltd v William Hill Organisation Ltd</span> [2002] EWCA Civ 1702, [2003] 1 WLR 1462 at [24] (Aldous LJ). Thus the invention is the process of manufacture claimed in claims 1 and 3 of the Patent, not the method of treatment. Yet further, for the reasons discussed above, the method of treatment is not a patentable invention anyway, which is precisely why the claims are in the form they are. Finally, this approach is inconsistent with Floyd LJ’s interpretation of the mental element in the claims, which requires a mental element on the part of manufacturer, as it must do in order to confer novelty on the claims.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">The fundamental difficulty with Pfizer’s claim under section 60(2) remains, as it has always done, that claims 1 and 3 of the Patent are claims to processes of manufacture, but there is no act of manufacture by any party downstream from Actavis, nor even the prospect of such an act. This is so even if manufacturing (or “preparation”, to use the word in the claims) for this purpose includes packaging with appropriate instructions. In particular, there is no act of manufacture by pharmacists, nor any prospect of such an act. It follows that, although there is no difficulty in concluding that Lecaent’s active ingredient is “means, relating to an essential element of the invention, for putting the invention into effect”, Lecaent is not suitable for putting, or intended to put, the invention into effect: either the invention has already been put into effect by the time that Lecaent leaves Actavis’ hands or it is not put into effect at all. Accordingly, I conclude that Actavis have not infringed claims 1 and 3 of the Patent pursuant to section 60(2).  </p>

More significantly, Actavis also seek a declaration that none of the following parties have infringed the Patent: (i) doctors who prescribe generic pregabalin for the treatment of pain, (ii) pharmacists who dispense Lecaent and (iii) patients who take Lecaent. I consider that, due to the extensive publicity this litigation has attracted, it would serve a useful purpose for this Court to clarify the position of each of these groups by means of a formal declaration. Given that I have concluded that Actavis have not infringed the Patent, it follows that none of these groups have either. It is nevertheless worth commenting briefly on the position of doctors, pharmacists and patients.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.31in;text-indent:0.00in">The reality is that the majority of pregabalin supplied in the UK is used for the treatment of pain. In relation to the issue of patent infringement by pharmacists, as we explained at our meeting, Pfizer takes its position on this with some reluctance.  However, we also explained, the infringement postion arises from the acts of patent infringement that are set out in section 60 of the Patents Act 1977. In this case, we believe infringing acts would include: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.31in;text-indent:0.00in">It is clear that, in the absence of any specific guidance, prescribers will generally continue to prescribe pregabalin by references to its INN (i.e ‘pregabalin’), regardless of indication. Further prescriptions will generally not include details of the indication being treated. Unfortunately, therefore, if pharmacists dispense generic pregabalin without the necessary precautions being put in place, it is clear that, they will be doing so for the treatment of pain. We believe this would amount to infringement by, amongst other things, keeping and disposing of generic pregabalin for the treatment of pain. </p>

Again, it is only because of the regulatory/ prescribing framework which you have explained that you are unwilling to change or clarify, that Pfizer must take a position in relation to pharmacists.” </p>

But in my view the email dated 13 November 2013 would have been understood as a threat of proceedings against pharmacists dispensing generic pregabalin. The email does not simply provide factual information about the Patent.  It directly alleges that pharmacists would infringe the Patent in certain circumstances. Moreover, it expressly notes that patentees have occasionally asserted patent infringement against pharmacists. The statement that Pfizer would not lightly make allegations of infringement against pharmacists does not neutralise the threat, but accentuates it. It is immaterial that the threat was made against a potentially large class of persons. The threat plainly related to Actavis’ product since the letter dated 5 November 2014 had referred to the prospect of Actavis marketing pregabalin under a skinny label. </p>

The background to the email was Actavis’ impending launch of a generic pregabalin product. It is immaterial that Actavis was not yet on the market with that product. The email was calculated to have a chilling effect on the willingness of pharmacists to stock and dispense generic pregabalin, and in particular Actavis’ product when it was launched. This was harmful to Actavis’ commercial interests in a real manner. This is so irrespective of the validity of claims 1 and 3 of the Patent. </p>

Pfizer accepts that this letter was a threat, but disputes that Actavis are aggrieved by it. In my judgment Actavis are aggrieved by it. The letter was designed to try and minimise the prescribing and dispensing of generic pregabalin for pain. The simplest way for doctors and pharmacists to avoid the threat would be to prescribe and dispense Lyrica in all cases. Thus the letter was calculated to have a chilling effect on the sales of Lecaent. Furthermore, if one takes my conclusions as to the validity of claims 1 and 3 into account, it is clear that the effect of the threat was to tend to exclude Lecaent from a part of the market in which it transpires it was lawful for Lecaent to be sold. Again, Pfizer cannot justify the threat.    </p>

On balance I consider that this letter would have been understood by the ordinary reader in her position as a threat to sue pharmacists. It is very clear and explicit in stating Pfizer’s position that pharmacists are infringing the patent. Moreover, it refers to the “potential liability” of pharmacists, which can only mean their liability to Pfizer for patent infringement. Still further, despite noting pharmacists’ concern over this possible liability, it states that “Pfizer must take a position in relation to pharmacists”. The letter expressly refers to Actavis’ product and Pfizer’s claim for infringement in respect of it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">I am not persuaded, however, that Actavis are aggrieved by this threat. Pfizer did not make the threat with a view to it being disseminated to pharmacists. The purpose of the threat, as with the remainder of the letter, was to try to put pressure on the Department of Health to issue guidance with respect to prescribing Lyrica by brand name for pain. In that respect, Pfizer was aiming at the wrong target, the right target being NHS England. Thus I do not consider that the letter was capable of inflicting any real harm on Actavis’ commercial interests.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">Letter to Murrays Healthcare Ltd 8 February 2015.</span> Pfizer accepts that this letter was a threat, but disputes that Actavis are aggrieved by it. In my judgment Actavis are aggrieved by this letter irrespective of my conclusion with respect to the validity of claims 1 and 3 of the Patent. The object of the letter was to try to persuade Murrays only to dispense Lyrica for pain. Indirectly, it was calculated to discourage Murrays from stocking Lecaent, particularly given that it expressly referred to Actavis. Pfizer suggest that, in fact, Murrays were not deterred from doing so. Even if that is correct, I do not regard this as an answer. It should not be forgotten that the requirement to be a person aggrieved is a requirement as to standing. Whether a potentially damaging communication to a customer of the claimant has in fact caused a loss of sales is a matter which goes to remedy. Moreover, given my conclusion as to the validity of the Patent, Actavis are even more clearly aggrieved by the letter. Again, Pfizer cannot justify this threat.  </p>

There is no evidence from the recipient of this letter, Mr Ward. In my judgment this letter would be understood as a threat to bring proceedings against doctors, pharmacists and possibly even the BMA itself. Not only does the letter set out Pfizer’s assertions about infringement, but in addition it emphasises that “this is a legal matter”.  The letter expressly refers to Actavis’ product and Pfizer’s claim for infringement in respect of it. In my judgment Actavis are again aggrieved by this letter for similar reasons to those given above. Again, Pfizer cannot justify the threat.    </p>

Ms Wright was one of the recipients of this letter. She explained that the letter was sent by recorded delivery. She gave clear and convincing evidence that she interpreted it as a threat. Furthermore, I consider that the ordinary reasonable reader of the letter in her position would have done the same. Again, the letter emphasises that “this is a legal matter”. The Annex makes it plain that Pfizer contends that pharmacists who do not take the steps requested by Pfizer will infringe the Patent. The letter expressly refers to Actavis. I do not accept Pfizer’s argument that the letter went no further than the guidance issued to pharmacists by bodies such as the PSNC, particularly since some of this guidance was disseminating other threats made by Pfizer. In my judgment Actavis are again aggrieved by this letter for similar reasons to those given above. Indeed, Ms Wright gave evidence that seven of the ten pharmacies within the John Preddy chain decided not to stock (or if they had stocked it, not to dispense) generic pregabalin as a result of the letter. Again, Pfizer cannot justify the threat.    <span style="text-decoration:underline">Afterword: the need for a system</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">I have now lived with this case for nine months. During that time, I have heard and determined the applications which led to the <span style="font-style:italic">Warner-Lambert I, II, III and IV</span> judgments, I have heard and determined a number of other case management applications, I have heard the trial and I have written this judgment. During that time, I have reflected repeatedly and at length on the issues raised by this litigation. At the end of that period of reflection, I remain more convinced than ever that the best solution to the problem of protecting the monopoly conferred by a second medical use patent while allowing lawful generic competition for non-patented indications of the substance in question is to separate the patented market for the substance from the non-patented market by ensuring that prescribers write prescriptions for the patented indication by reference to the patentee’s brand name and write prescriptions for nonpatented indications by reference to the generic name of the substance (the INN). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">Prescribers cannot be expected to know when this is required, nor should they be required to take steps to find out. What is needed is for centralised and authoritative guidance to be given to prescribers as to when this practice should be adopted. Such guidance also needs to be conveyed to other relevant stakeholders, and in particular to the software providers. The question is who is to issue such centralised and authoritative guidance. This is a particular challenge for the decentralised (some might say fragmented) English healthcare system since the 2012 Act. As I understand it, the Secretary of State considers that he lacks the power to issue such guidance (see <span style="font-style:italic">Warner-Lambert I </span>at [75]). That being so, the only body in England which appears to have the necessary power and authority is NHS England. In Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the devolved governments appear to have the necessary power and authority. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">In the present case, NHS England issued guidance as a result of an order made by this Court on an application by Pfizer. Regardless of the legal soundness of that procedure, it had two practical advantages. The first was that it provided a convenient forum to enable the interested parties to negotiate what was to be done, when and by whom. In the end, this was all agreed. The second was that the procedure included the protection for the NHS and for the generic companies of a cross-undertaking in damages. This is particularly important because of the risk that the second medical use patent may prove to be invalid if challenged, as has transpired in the case of claims 1 and 3 of the Patent if I am right. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.31in;text-indent:0.5in">Looking to the future, however, it does not seem to me to be in anyone’s interests for these problems to be dealt with in the ad hoc manner in which they were addressed in this case. It is not as if the situation which arose in this case could not have been predicted. On the contrary, as soon as it was known that the SPC had lapsed, the resulting scenario was entirely predictable. (And if I am right that Pfizer planned to allow the SPC to lapse, for whatever reason, then Pfizer was in a position to predict it even before then.) In general, information as to patent expiry dates and loss of data exclusivity dates is in the public domain and can be ascertained in advance. I nevertheless recognise that it is probably too much to expect NHS England to keep track of such dates and to plan for the resulting situations. I consider that it behoves patentees who want their second medical use patents enforced to provide NHS England with all the information and assistance it requires to enable it to issue appropriate guidance as and when required. I also consider that it behoves generic companies who want their interests in obtaining untroubled access to lawful markets protected to cooperate with NHS England as well. I recognise that generic companies are always understandably reluctant to disclose their future commercial plans to anyone, but the potential interest of generic companies in a skinny label launch (whether or not pending a challenge to the validity of the patent) to avoid a second medical use patent will usually be obvious. In short, what is needed is a system for dealing with these situations. </p>

Moreover, Ms Howe’s evidence and the closing submissions made by counsel for the Secretary of State make it clear that the Secretary of State accepts the desirability of the solution I have proposed. I therefore trust that the Secretary of State will take steps to ensure that a suitable system is put in place in England. I also trust that he will liaise with his counterparts in the Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish administrations to try to ensure that the system operates across the whole of the UK.                       </p>
