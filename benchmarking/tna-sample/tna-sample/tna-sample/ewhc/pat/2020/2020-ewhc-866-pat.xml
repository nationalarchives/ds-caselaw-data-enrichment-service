The Defendants also dispute that they threaten to infringe any of the Patents. Furthermore, FibroGen has applied to amend the Patents both unconditionally and conditionally. Most of the amendment applications are unopposed save on the ground that they do not cure the alleged invalidity of the Patents, but one is. The result is a case of considerable complexity, as indicated by the fact that the parties’ written closing submissions run to 434 paragraphs (Claimants) and 537 paragraphs (Defendants), and cross-refer to further material in their respective opening skeleton arguments.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.00in">The Defendants also called a second medicinal chemist, Prof Fishwick. Originally, Prof Fishwick’s evidence was directed solely to the number of compounds covered by Formula (I) in what was then claim 19 of EP 823 as proposed to be amended (now claim 19A). It was justifiable for the Defendants to wish to call a second expert for that discrete and limited purpose, particularly given that claim 19 of EP 823 was asserted by the Claimants against the Defendants, but not against GSK. As part of that exercise, however, Prof Fishwick interpreted Formula (I). The Defendants’ main medicinal chemist, Prof Ward also interpreted Formula (I), and at that stage appeared to reach the same conclusion. No objection to this was raised by the Claimants prior to the trial, even though the Claimants did (successfully) raise an objection to a different instance of duplication of expert evidence by the Defendants (and GSK) at the pre-trial review. Shortly before the trial, both Prof Ward and Prof Fishwick served supplementary reports acknowledging errors in documents prepared by the Defendants’ solicitors which they had exhibited illustrating their interpretation; but at that stage it became clear that they were interpreting Formula (I) differently. Although the Claimants did object to this after the trial had commenced, given that no objection had been raised previously, I permitted the Defendants to call Prof Fishwick not merely to give evidence as to his calculations, but also as to the interpretation of the claim. (The admissibility of the latter evidence is a separate point, to which I will return below.) Sensibly, counsel kept their cross-examination of all three medicinal chemistry experts on this issue brief.  </p>

I will refer to these witnesses as “the clinical practice experts”. Again, it was justifiable for the parties to call additional experts to address these questions, because (for differing reasons) their principal nephrology experts were unable to do so. Without objection from the Defendants, counsel for the Claimants also cross-examined the Defendants’ clinical practice expert on some questions of common general knowledge at the Priority Dates. </p>

The Patents Court depends on the assistance it receives from expert witnesses, many of whom are scientists of considerable distinction in their own fields. Particularly in complex cases such as this, preparing expert reports and giving oral evidence can be an arduous task in terms of the time, effort and concentration involved. It is vital that the task of the experts is not made more difficult by the lawyers than it needs to be. </p>

As I shall explain, both Prof Winearls and Prof Haase were let down by those instructing them with respect to the preparation of their expert reports, and Prof Haase was in one respect cross-examined unfairly. It should not be necessary for me to say that this is unacceptable. These are matters of professional responsibility. If practitioners continue not to observe the standards required of them, the Patents Court will have to take steps to enforce those standards.        </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.00in">Prof Winearls. The Claimants’ expert was Professor Christopher Winearls. On 31 August 2019 he retired from practice as an NHS consultant nephrologist in the Oxford Kidney Unit at the Churchill Hospital, part of the Oxford University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. Prof Winearls obtained an MBChB from the University of Cape Town in 1973 and was awarded a DPhil in transplant immunology by the University of Oxford in 1979. He undertook his training in nephrology in Oxford and then at Hammersmith Hospital. He was appointed a consultant nephrologist at the Churchill Hospital in 1988 and remained in full-time practice until 2016, after which he was parttime. He was the Clinical Director of the Oxford Kidney Unit from 1995 to 2009. He was a Lecturer, and then Senior Lecturer, at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School between 1985 and 1988, after which he became an Associate Professor of Medicine at the University of Oxford. He was an editor of Erythropoietin – Molecular, Cellular and Clinical Biology (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1991) and of the Oxford Textbook of Clinical Nephrology (now in its 4th edition), and an author of a considerable number of published papers. In addition to other professional memberships, he was formerly Secretary and later Clinical Vice President of the Renal Association (of the United Kingdom). He was on the Editorial Board of the American Journal of Kidney Diseases until 2016, and he contributed to the Standards Document produced by the Royal College of Physicians and the Renal Association and the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (“KDIGO”) Guidance on Chronic Kidney Disease (2012). He described his role in 2001 as having been “a clinician, a clinical researcher and an educator and trainer of students and doctors”. His research interests included renal anaemia. He was the nephrologist on the team which first investigated the effect of recombinant human erythropoietin in uraemic man (P.M. Cotes et al, “Characterization of the anaemia of chronic renal failure and the mode of its correction by a preparation of human erythropoietin (r-HuEpo): an investigation of the pharmacokinetics of intravenous erythropoietin and its effects on erythrokinetics”, Q J Med, 70(262), 11337 (1989)) and he was a Principal Investigator on the PIVOTAL trial describing the effects of two dose regimens of intravenous iron in haemodialysis patients also receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) (I.C. Macdougall et al, “Intravenous iron in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis”, N Engl J Med, 380(5), 447-458 (2019)). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.00in">As Prof Winearls explained in his first report, he was instructed to read EP 823 as exemplifying the Family A Patents. Despite that, he was asked to consider the obviousness of the claims of EP 531. In paragraph 134 of his first report he identified the inventive concept of the claims of EP 531 as being “the use of HIF-PHIs to increase endogenous Epo production in prevention, pre-treatment or treatment of anaemia associated with kidney disease, CRF or CKD”. As Prof Winearls naturally accepted in cross-examination, that statement of the inventive concept is applicable to EP 823, but not to EP 531. Counsel for the Defendants rightly did not suggest that this was the fault of the witness: it is evident that, at some point in the drafting of the report, a section dealing with the obviousness of EP 823 was re-drafted to address EP 531 without all the necessary changes being made. An expert in Prof Winearls’ position cannot possibly be expected to spot points like this, and must rely on those instructing them. Fortunately, this error did not matter. </p>

I will consider the substance of this issue later. At this stage it suffices to say that I make no criticism of Prof Winearls. It became clear from his oral evidence that, as a careful reading of his reports had suggested might well be the case, he had some difficulty in distinguishing between what would have been known by an ordinary clinical nephrologist and what would have been known by a nephrologist with a research interest in renal anaemia. (The significance of this distinction will become apparent later.)  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.00in">This would be understandable in any event, but there is a specific reason why Prof Winearls is entirely to be forgiven for this. As he explained, he was a colleague for more than 30 years of Professor Sir Peter Ratcliffe, who features in the case as an author of some of the key papers and who (together with Professor Gregg Semenza and Professor William Kaelin) won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2019 for their work on oxygen sensing, and whose work on the control of erythropoietin (Epo) Prof Winearls had followed with great interest. As Prof Winearls vividly put in his oral evidence, he was “next door to it”. Prof Winearls made it clear that he had (rightly) attempted to put that special knowledge out of his mind. But I think that made it particularly difficult for him to identify the common general knowledge of a nephrologist with a research interest in renal anaemia who did not have that special knowledge, and it is not surprising that he over-compensated. </p>

First, in paragraph 81 Prof Winearls said that “[i]t is now known that HIF … is responsible for promoting Epo production [emphasis added]”. As he accepted, in fact this was known in 2001 (and indeed, had been known for some time before that). I regard this mis-statement as regrettable, but it appears to me that it flowed from the difficulty discussed above.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.00in">The second instance actually concerns a different topic to HIF. In paragraph 83 of his first report Prof Winearls referred to “the damaged kidney” being “incapable of producing Epo in renal anaemia patients [emphasis added]”. Prof Winearls accepted that that sentence was over-stated. As counsel for the Claimants pointed out, however, elsewhere in his first report, Prof Winearls stated the position in a more nuanced manner. Thus in paragraph 136 he said that in patients with kidney disease “the ability of the kidneys to produce Epo was thought to be reduced because of damage to or phenotypic change in the interstitial fibroblasts [emphasis added]”, and he used very similar language at paragraph 48. It is clear that the latter statement represents the opinion that Prof Winearls was attempting to convey. Accordingly, I do not regard the poor drafting of the former statement as significant. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.00in">Prof Haase. The Defendants’ expert was Professor Volker Haase. He obtained an MD degree from the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University School of Medicine in 1987 and a higher research doctorate in 1990 for work on tumour immunology. His career since then has been primarily in the United States, where he held a variety of research and clinical positions in the 1990s. From 1990 to 1993 he undertook a research fellowship at the Massachusetts General Hospital and the MGH Cancer Center. From 1993 to 1996 he was an Intern and then a Resident in Internal Medicine at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. From 1996 to 1999 he was a Clinical and Research Fellow in the Renal Division at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, and he obtained board certification in nephrology in 1999. From 1997 to 2001 he was a Research Fellow at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. From 1999 to 2001 he was an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and from 2001 to 2008 was Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. From 2008 he held various Assistant and Associate Professor roles, and in 2015 he was appointed as full Professor of Medicine, full Professor of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics and full member of the programme in Cancer Biology at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee. Since 1997 his research activities have focused on the regulation of the HIF and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) pathways and their involvement in renal and other diseases, and he started his own laboratory group in 2001 to undertake research focused on the role of HIF signalling. He is the author of over 95 scientific publications, and he is on the editorial boards of a number of journals. Alongside his research activities, he has practised as a clinical nephrologist for over 20 years. He was an Attending Physician at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School from 1999 to 2001, and at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania from 2001 to 2008. Since 2010 he has served as an Attending Physician at the VA Medical Center in Nashville, and since 2011 he has served in the same capacity at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. </p>

Counsel for the Claimants submitted that this meant that more weight should be given to Prof Winearls’ views. I do not accept this. Prof Haase had sufficient clinical experience to give the evidence that he did, and the parts of the case his evidence addressed do not turn on questions of clinical practice. What is more important in my judgment is that Prof Haase was working on HIF in December 2001, and therefore it is possible that he had more knowledge about HIF than the skilled nephrologist discussed below.  </p>

The significance of this is that this was – apart from the Family B Patents – the first report of a link between HIF and hepcidin (as to which, see below). Prof Haase explained in his fourth report, served in reply to Prof Winearls’ third report, which drew attention to Peyssonnaux, that there had subsequently been conflicting reports in the literature on this point. I consider that Prof Haase should have been instructed to address this in his first report, but I do not see any reason for thinking that Prof Haase is to be blamed for this failure as counsel for the Claimants submitted. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, Prof Haase was asked to consider and comment in his fourth report on a number of papers concerning HIF-PHIs which Prof Winearls had discussed in his second report. What Prof Haase did not mention in his report was that he and a coauthor had recently published a review (N.S. Sanghani and V.H. Haase, “HypoxiaInducible Factor Activators in Renal Anemia: Current Clinical Experience”, Adv Chronic Kidney Dis, 26(4), 253-266 (2019), “Sanghani”) in which they had discussed the same papers. It was put to Prof Haase that the conclusions he drew from some of the papers in his fourth report were inconsistent with those drawn in Sanghani. Before turning to the substance of the criticism, I again consider that Prof Haase should have been instructed to reference Sanghani in his report and, if and to the extent that he was now drawing different conclusions, to explain why. Turning to the substance of the criticism, in the case of the principal alleged inconsistency, the real point is, as explained below, not that Prof Haase was inconsistent; but that, for a reason he missed both times, one of the papers could be said to support a different conclusion. In any event, as counsel for the Defendants pointed out, Prof Haase’s task in writing his report was different to his task in writing Sanghani because he had been instructed specifically to consider the papers in question and to see what conclusions could be drawn from them that were relevant to the issues in this case. </p>

For the most part, this was exemplary: it was well-constructed, appropriately thorough and courteously conducted. It was marred, however, by one passage which should not have taken place. In paragraph 43 of his first report Prof Haase expressed the opinion that cobalt salts were well known (i) to have been used to treat anaemia from the 1930s to the 1970s, (ii) to stimulate the expression of Epo by inducing HIF-α and (iii) to mimic hypoxia by stabilising HIF and inducing Epo. In support of his opinion on the first point, Prof Haase cited H.H. Corner, “Cobalt and nutritional anaemia”, Br Med J, 2, 169-170 (1939), L. Berk et al, “Erythropoietic effect of cobalt in patients with or without anemia”, N Engl J Med, 240, 754-61 (1949) and J.P. Kriss et al, “Hypothyroidism and thyroid hyperplasia in patients treated with cobalt”, J Am Med Assoc, 157, 117-21 (1955) (“Corner”, “Berk” and “Kriss”). In paragraphs 37-40 of his fourth report Prof Haase returned to this topic, explaining that he was not suggesting that Corner, Berk and Kriss were themselves common general knowledge and citing an additional publication. </p>

Prof Haase’s answer was that he had cited papers on cobalt in previous review articles he had written, for example one he and a co-author had published in 2015 (M.J. Koury and V.H. Haase, “Anaemia in kidney disease: harnessing hypoxia responses for therapy”, Nat Rev Nephrol, 11, 394-410, “Koury”), and therefore he had been aware of the papers prior to his involvement in this case. He added that he had been aware of cobalt in 2001, having published an article referring to it (which he was able specifically to identify) in that year, but he was not sure that he knew about Corner, Berk or Kriss at that time.  </p>

I still do not know whether any of the articles cited in Koury cite Corner, Berk or Kriss. What I do know is that counsel made no attempt to demonstrate that none of them did. From memory, Prof Haase thought that Ebert did, although he was not 100% sure. Counsel for the Claimants asserted in a footnote in their written closing submissions that Ebert did not cite Corner or Berk. I will assume that that is correct; but that implies that Ebert did cite Kriss, and Kriss cites Berk (but not Corner). Even if none of the articles had cited Corner, Berk or Kriss, that would still not have disproved the witness’ evidence, because it would remain possible that he had read the papers for the purposes of writing Koury, but had decided not to cite them, or had read them for a previous review. Moreover, that would still leave his previous awareness of cobalt. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.00in">In addition to his failure to mention the two papers discussed above, counsel for the Claimants advanced a number of other criticisms of Prof Haase. First, counsel pointed out that Prof Haase strayed into giving long and discursive answers on occasion. That is undoubtedly correct, and it unnecessarily prolonged the cross-examination, but I do not consider that it detracts from the cogency of his opinions. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, counsel for the Claimants submitted that at times it appeared that Prof Haase had spent too long with the lawyers in this case, which had perhaps unwittingly led him to act as an advocate for the Defendants. In addition to the alleged discrepancies between what he had said in his reports and what he had said in the Peyssonnaux and Sanghani articles, which I have already dealt with, counsel submitted that this was demonstrated by Prof Haase’s evidence that it had been proposed that hepcidin might be regulated by Epo, when the Claimants contend that this is not supported by the contemporaneous literature. I do not accept this demonstrates partiality on the part of Prof Haase. On the contrary, it appeared to me that it represented Prof Haase’s genuine opinion. Again, whether that opinion accurately reflected the common general knowledge at the Family B Priority Date is a different question which I will consider below.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.00in">Counsel also suggested that this tendency may have been “exacerbated” by Prof Haase’s relationship with Akebia: he has served on its Scientific Advisory Board since 2009 and was involved in the Phase I and II trials for vadadustat. Prof Haase was open about his relationship with Akebia in his first report, however. He was also open about his relationship with FibroGen: he has attended several conferences and sponsored meetings organised by FibroGen and its licensee for the USA and China, AstraZeneca, to discuss their HIF-PHI pipeline and he recently served as an advisor to FibroGen and AstraZeneca with regard to their Phase III programme for roxadustat. I do not accept this begins to demonstrate partiality towards Akebia on the part of Prof Haase. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.00in">Thirdly, counsel for the Claimants submitted that Prof Haase had been wrongly instructed as to, or had misunderstood, the concept of common general knowledge. I see no evidence that he was wrongly instructed. He may not have fully understood the concept, but this is a common problem for expert witnesses in patent cases. As noted above, Prof Winearls also had some difficulty with the concept. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.00in">Finally, counsel for the Claimants pointed out that Prof Haase had explained that the first document he was shown in the case was WO 997 (which discloses HIF biology), and he was asked, based on this, what he thought the skilled team would look like. Counsel submitted that, as a result, his entire analysis was tainted by the knowledge that the invention was HIF-related, when that would not have been apparent at the Family A Priority Date. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.00in">This submission illustrates why it can be advantageous to try to instruct expert witnesses in sequence, first asking them about the common general knowledge, then showing them the prior art and asking them questions such as what steps would be obvious in the light of it and only then showing them the patent in suit. This is a procedure known as “sequential unmasking” in the psychological literature (see generally on this subject C.T. Robertson and A.S. Kesselheim (eds), Blinding as a Solution to Bias, Academic Press, 2016). The point of it is to try to avoid, or at least reduce, hindsight. In my opinion, it is desirable to try to minimise hindsight on the part of expert witnesses where possible. There is no rule or principle that experts must be instructed sequentially, however. Moreover, there are often real practical problems in doing so. To take just one obvious example, any discussion about the common general knowledge must start by identifying the skilled person or team. How is this to be done if the expert cannot be shown the patent? One way is to ask the expert to make an assumption, which they can check later when they see the patent; but that is not necessarily a perfect solution. Other problems can be caused by the pre-existing knowledge of the expert and by amendments to the parties’ cases (such as the introduction of new prior art after the expert has read the patent). Still further, instructing experts in this way can make their task even more burdensome, particularly when it comes to cross-examination, because they may find it difficult to recall what they knew when unless it is clearly documented. (It should be borne in mind, however, that some cross-examination as to the way in which the expert has been instructed is often justified in any event.) </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.00in">In the present case, Prof Haase explained in his first report that he had discussed the common general knowledge with those instructing him before he had seen the Patents, so to that extent he was instructed sequentially. Nevertheless, it appears that Prof Haase was asked to read WO 997 before commenting on Epstein because at that time the Defendants were not advancing a case of obviousness of the Family A Patents, but were relying upon WO 997 as prior art against the Family B Patents. In any event, given Prof Haase’s prior knowledge of HIF-PHIs, which he acknowledged in his first report, it would not have been possible to instruct him in a manner which was free from hindsight. Accordingly, I do not criticise the manner in which he was instructed. In evaluating his evidence, however, I accept that it is necessary to take into account that he read WO 997 before forming his opinion concerning obviousness over Epstein.       </p>

First, Dr Devonald was strangely unwilling to accept that his first report was based on Prof Winearls’ evaluation of the literature, despite the fact that Dr Devonald had expressly stated in his report that he was asked to assume that Prof Winearls’ evaluation was reasonable. Dr Devonald attempted to suggest that he had undertaken his own analysis based on a review by E.K. Batchelor et al, “Iron Deficiency in Chronic Kidney Disease: Updates in Pathophysiology, Diagnosis and Treatment”, J Am Soc Nephrol, 10 February 2020 (e-publication), but he had not seen that review at the date of his first report. Secondly, Dr Devonald was reluctant directly to answer a question he was asked as to whether a change in clinical practice was likely with HIF-PHIs. (Counsel for the Defendants submitted that Dr Devonald twice failed to answer the question, whereas counsel for the Claimants submitted that he had answered it the third time it was asked.

I was told that, at the time of the case management conference, the parties were disagreed as to the need for a primer, and the judge decided not to order one. With the benefit of hindsight, it is clear to me that that was a mistake. This case involves two moderately complex areas of science, and the preparation of a primer at an early stage would have saved considerable time and effort at later stages. This is particularly so because, as is often the case, there was no dispute as to much of the technical background. In future, the preparation of a technical primer should be regarded as mandatory in Category 4 and 5 cases unless there are good reasons to the contrary.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.26in">Strategies may be deployed in an effort to enhance the pharmacokinetic profile of a compound. For example, a drug may be manufactured as a pro-drug. Pro-drugs are compounds that are themselves inactive, but are converted into the active drug inside the body. For example, a carboxylic acid functional group is ionised inside the body. It may have a role to play in the binding of a drug via ionic or hydrogen bonding, but the fact that it is ionised is likely to restrict it from crossing a lipid cell membrane. Commonly, the carboxylic acid is protected as an ester. The less polar ester is able to cross cell membranes into the blood stream where it is hydrolysed to the ionised carboxylic acid by esterases in the blood. </p>

They speed up, or catalyse, biological reactions without themselves being consumed. Substrates bind to and react at a specific part of the enzyme called the active site (also referred to as the binding site or binding pocket). The active site usually consists of an indentation on the surface of the enzyme that has a unique three-dimensional structure and functional group distribution. Only molecules with the right shape and functional group distribution can bind to the active site and form the enzyme-substrate complex required for catalysis. </p>

A chelate complex (also called a coordination complex) is the complex that forms when a metal ion is coordinated by a chelator. The formation of such complexes is known as chelation (or coordination). During chelation, a chelator forms multiple coordinate bonds with the metal ion (two bonds are formed if the chelator is bidentate, more than two bonds are formed if the chelator is polydentate), displacing its pre-existing ligands.

Specifically, the methods of the invention may increase enzymes and proteins involved in iron uptake, transport, and processing. Such enzymes and proteins include, but are not limited to, transferrin and transferrin receptor, which together facilitate iron transport to and uptake by, e.g., erythroid tissue, and ceruloplasmin, a ferroxidase required to oxidize ferrous iron to ferric iron. As transferrin can only bind and transport ferric iron, ceruloplasmin is important for supply of iron to tissues. The ability of the methods of the invention to increase both endogenous erythropoietin and transport and utilization of iron in a single course of treatment provides benefits not addressed by current anemia therapeutics, such as administration of recombinant erythropoietin, in the treatment of anemic disorders including, but not limited to, rheumatoid arthritis, sideroblastic anemia, etc.” </p>

Following incubation, the tissue culture media was collected and analysed for Epo levels. This experiment represents a preliminary screen for in vitro activity in respect of the ability of the compounds to increase the level of endogenous Epo. The data presented in Figure 1 appear to show that each of compounds A to I induced an increase in the Epo level of the tissue culture media compared to the control, although it appears from the absence of error bars that a single experiment was performed for each compound without replicates. The range of the observed increase in Epo was from about 2-fold (Compounds E and F) to about 32-fold (Compounds A and I). Compounds C, D and H were the next best performing compounds after Compounds A and I. </p>

Before turning to consider those, I should note that there is no dispute that, in order to be common general knowledge, the information must be common general knowledge to the skilled person in the UK. There is also no dispute that, in December 2001, there were certain differences between the practices of clinical nephrologists in the UK and those in the USA: in particular, higher doses of epoetin alpha were prescribed in the USA than the UK (epoetin beta was not available in the USA at that date).

It is clear that cobalt chloride was used for this purpose at least to some extent from the 1940s to the 1970s, when it was discontinued due to concerns over toxicity. Prof Haase thought that this would have been common general knowledge. In support of this, he relied upon Corner, Berk, Kriss and (rather more persuasively) an editorial in The Lancet published on 3 July 1976 (which cites Kriss and a fair number of other papers, but not Corner or Berk). Prof Winearls’ opinion was that this would not have been common general knowledge to the clinical nephrologist, and he gave cogent reasons for this: many clinical nephrologists had trained after the 1970s; it was not mentioned in clinical sources; he personally had never heard of cobalt being prescribed for anaemia (although he had been aware of the historical usage in 2001); and there was no real need for it once r-HuEpo became available. As he made clear in paragraph 37 of his fourth report, Prof Haase did not dispute this. He maintained, however, that in his opinion it was likely to be something that the pre-clinical researcher would have come across. I am not persuaded that it was common general knowledge even to the pre-clinical researcher, however. The materials relied on are simply too old and obscure.    </p>

He gave a number of examples of this, including papers by M.A. Goldberg et al in 1987 and 1988 and by Semenza and Wang in 1993 and 1995 (three of which were published in Science and Proc Natl Acad Sci USA). By contrast with Corner, Berk and Kriss, these are not old or obscure papers. On the contrary, Prof Haase gave unchallenged evidence that the 1988 Goldberg paper had been cited 610 times by the end of 2001. He also pointed out that cobalt was used in both Ivan and Jaakkola.

That evidence was not challenged, and I accept it. (This is also consistent with my conclusion as to the pre-clinical researcher’s knowledge of HIF.)   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.00in">My conclusion based on the texts of the granted Patents and the evidence of the experts is that the skilled team would not necessarily follow up any of the cited publications. They would appreciate that there were a large number of them, and that the specification gives little, if any, direction as to which would be worth following up. They would also appreciate that the papers appear to be cited as providing scientific support for statements made in the specification, and that the cited papers would inevitably refer to a considerable number of other papers, leading to the question of how far they should go in reviewing such material. (Indeed, counsel for the Claimants put it to Prof Ward, and submitted in closing, that the skilled medicinal chemist would follow up a reference in Friedman even though no such suggestion was ever advanced or assumed by Dr Bhalay.) Whether they would review the cited publications would therefore depend in part on the time and resources available, which would vary between skilled teams. In my view they would be most likely to read Majamaa 1984 and Majamaa 1985, since these papers are cited in a manner that suggests that they may shed light on what is meant by “structural mimetics of 2-OG” and, as discussed below, the skilled reader would find that expression unclear. Even if the medicinal chemist did follow up all the six papers cited in [0075]-[0076] and [0084] of WO 997, what they would be looking for would be information about the chemistry and activities of specific compounds discussed in those papers, rather than for explanations of such activity. There is no basis whatsoever for thinking that the skilled team would single out US 305, US 995 and US 730 from the other cited patents and applications for review. </p>

When questioned about Bickel, however, he was reluctant to accept the statement quoted above. He did not offer any reason to doubt the methodology, the results or the presentation of the data.

Günzler and K. Weidmann, “Prolyl 4-Hydroxylase Inhibitors” in N. A. Guzman (ed), Prolyl Hydroxylase, Protein Disulfide Isomerase, and Other Structurally Related Proteins (Marcel Dekker, 1998) at pages 65-95. Indeed, in the Claimants’ written closing submissions, Günzler and Weidmann was identified as one of three “key publications” (together with Majamaa 1984 and Majamaa 1985) that the medicinal chemist would read. Counsel for the Claimants submitted that Prof Ward had accepted that the medicinal chemist would read Günzler and Weidmann, but I disagree. In the first place, the witness did not accept that the medicinal chemist would go beyond the abstract of Friedman, because it was a detailed biological paper in an organism of no interest to them. What the witness then accepted was that, if he had to read Friedman, and if he got to the last paragraph of Friedman, he would “look at what the reference was” cited in that paragraph. I am not satisfied that the medicinal chemist would read Günzler and Weidmann even if they got as far as Friedman. </p>

It is also common ground that the criteria for efficacy for this purpose are that indicated by the Examples in the specification, namely that the compound in question must inhibit HIF-PH in an appropriate biochemical (in vitro) assay and induce the production of endogenous Epo in vivo in a suitable animal model (such as a mouse or rat). (I would have thought that it must also increase haematocrit in a suitable animal model, but this point was not explored in closing submissions and so I shall say no more about it.) The claims obviously cover using the compounds for the treatment of human patients, but neither side suggests that they require efficacy in humans to be demonstrated even to the level of a Phase II clinical trial. </p>

It was addressed by all three medicinal chemists in their evidence. As will appear, however, the issue of interpretation depends not on medicinal chemistry, but on the structure of the lists of substituents, and in particular the manner in which the relevant list is punctuated and laid out, and on the way in which certain substitutions are described, and in particular the fact that some groups are said to be “optionally substituted” without more. All three medicinal chemists agreed in cross-examination that there was no chemical reason why the substitution in question should or should not be permitted. It follows that their opinions as to the correct interpretation of Formula (I) are all inadmissible. </p>

The Claimants contend that this shows that the Defendants’ interpretations cannot be right. I do not accept this. Example 16 is just one of a very large number of compounds identified in patents cited in EP 823. Even if, contrary to the conclusion I have reached above, the skilled medicinal chemist would read at least the 15 patents cited in [0078]-[0088] of WO 997, no reason has been given as to why the skilled person seeking to interpret Formula (I) would alight on Example 16 of US 164 as a means of checking their interpretation. US 164 is not even one of the patents singled out for review by Dr Bhalay. Nor has any reason been given as to why the skilled person would comb systematically through all the compounds listed in cited patents and applications to see which ones fell inside or outside on different interpretations, an exercise which would be a very laborious and time-consuming task indeed.    </p>

As Dr Bhalay accepted, it would be apparent to the medicinal chemist that NOG inhibits the hydroxylation of HIF-α by PHD-1 and that 2-OG competes with NOG.

As Prof Haase explained, the authors may have chosen to single out ischaemic/hypoxic disease in the concluding paragraph because it is one of the two main causes of mortality and morbidity in Western societies, and thus would emphasise the significance of their research.

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, counsel for the Claimants put to Prof Haase a series of 10 papers about HIF, including Ivan and Jaakkola, published in the period from 2000 to 2003 which do not mention the treatment of anaemia as a possible application of HIF-PHIs, whereas there are a number of mentions of ischaemia and a couple of mentions of stroke and cancer. Again, counsel for the Claimants submitted that, if the treatment of anaemia had been obvious, at least some of these papers would have been bound to mention it. Again, Prof Haase did not accept this, and nor do I. The evidence relied upon is a dog that did not bark in the night; but it is only probative if there is some reason why the dog should have barked. I am not persuaded that there is. One of the papers (Jaakkola) does not discuss clinical applications at all. More importantly, it was not established, or even put to Prof Haase, that the authors of all the papers included one or more persons corresponding to the skilled nephrologist: although some did, it appears that some did not (such as a review written by at least two oncologists). Even in the case of papers which do satisfy that criterion, the point remains that a perfectly good explanation why cancer, heart disease and stroke are mentioned is to draw attention to the significance of HIF, particularly in journals not aimed at nephrologists. Furthermore, an alternative explanation for the failure to mention the potential application of HIF-PHIs to induction of Epo is that it was considered by many to be unremarkable in the light of Epstein. Yet further, as Prof Haase pointed out in his third report, two review articles, one by Ratcliffe and one by Patrick Maxwell, were published during the same period (in September 2002 and 2003 respectively) which cited Epstein and which did expressly mention “erythropoietin deficiency” and “promot[ing] erythropoiesis” as potential therapeutic applications for HIF-PHIs. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.00in">Thirdly, the Claimants pointed out that on 21 March 2002 Isis Innovation Ltd (“Isis”) filed a priority patent application in the UK (0206711.4) naming a number of inventors, including Ratcliffe, for an invention relating to HIF-PHIs which mentioned a number of potential therapeutic applications but not anaemia, although it did mention the “critical” role of HIF in (among other things) erythropoiesis. When Isis came to file an international application (WO 03/080566) claiming priority from the UK filing on 21 March 2003, additional applications were included, including “the treatment of anaemia”. Counsel for the Claimants suggested that this showed this application had not occurred to the Ratcliffe group by March 2002, but only later. This does not necessarily follow.

First, Prof Haase had no way of knowing whether there was any such meeting, or if so, what was said; and the Claimants adduced not a jot of evidence to show that there even was such a meeting when they would have been well able to do so if it had happened. Secondly, it amounts to an accusation of impropriety on the part of Professor Ratcliffe in circumstances where he was unable to defend himself.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.00in">Turning to Prof Winearls’ second concern, this was that there could be a problem due to the fact that HIF turns on other genes as well as Epo. This is not a concern he had raised in his written evidence, however. Moreover, as he accepted, it is not something that is addressed in the Family A Patents. Nor was it put to Prof Haase as being something that would deter the skilled nephrologist from testing HIF-PHIs for anaemia.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.00in">The final point that requires consideration before reaching a conclusion on the second question concerns cobalt. As counsel for the Claimants pointed out, part of Prof Haase’s reasoning in relation to this question in his first report was that “it was well established … that the induction of HIF by cobalt salts was clinically effective in stimulating erythropoiesis …”. I have concluded that it was not common general knowledge that cobalt chloride had been used to treat anaemia. To that extent, Prof Haase’s opinion was misplaced. On the other hand, I have concluded that it was common general knowledge that cobalt stimulated the production of Epo, and that it did so by the induction of HIF-α, although there was still debate as to whether this was the same mechanism as hypoxia. This would have given the skilled reader of Epstein, which refers to the role of cobalt in HIF induction, reason to believe that the authors were correct in implying that inhibition of HIF might affect erythropoiesis. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.00in">In any event, this was an additional reason which was introduced by Prof Haase after he had already concluded that the skilled nephrologist reading Epstein would readily appreciate that inhibition of HIF-PHs by 2-OG analogues such as DMOG, resulting in the stabilisation of HIF-α, would result in an increase in the expression of (among other genes) Epo. That in itself was a sufficient foundation for his opinion that the skilled team would take DMOG forward into pre-clinical testing for the treatment of anaemia.   </p>

In other words, it was obvious to try. </p>

Although the question of how many compounds would be screened initially was not discussed with any of the experts, it is inherently probable that the skilled team would proceed iteratively, screening a certain number of compounds at a time in the search for a hit compound. If no hit compound was identified, another batch would be screened. If a hit compound was identified, then the medicinal chemist would embark upon a drug development programme beginning with an SAR investigation. </p>

As I have observed in a number of previous judgments, although insufficiency is a single ground of invalidity, it embraces three distinct types of objection: where the invention cannot be performed at all without undue burden (sometimes called “classical insufficiency”); where the invention cannot be performed across the breadth of the claim without undue burden (sometimes called “Biogen insufficiency” and also referred to as “excessive claim breadth”); and where the claim does not enable the skilled person to know whether they are within the claim or outside (previously called “ambiguity” and recently re-named “uncertainty”).

The authoritative statement of the law is that of the majority of the Supreme Court in Warner-Lambert Co LLC v Generics (UK) Ltd [2018] UKSC 56, [2019] Bus LR 360, which was given by Lord Sumption. That case was concerned with a second medical use claim in Swiss form of a known pharmaceutical. This part of the present case is concerned with a first medical use of (largely) known compounds, even though there are claims framed as second medical use claims both in Swiss form and in EPC 2000 form. There is no dispute that the guidance given by Lord Sumption is applicable, although the Claimants contend that, for the reasons explained below, it is not the whole story. (To avoid returning to this subject later, I would add that the claims in the Family B Patents are true second medical use claims, and thus Lord Sumption’s guidance is directly applicable.) </p>

That may well be a particular risk in the case of patents for new uses of known compounds, especially when they are commercially successful in their existing use. In reality, however, speculative claiming of this kind is simply one of a number of ways in which a patentee may attempt to claim a monopoly more extensive than anything which is justified by his contribution to the art. Other ways in which this can happen include claiming a monopoly wider than the disclosure in the patent can support. An over-broad claim will not necessarily be speculative. The inventor may really have invented something corresponding to the full breadth of the claim. Research may subsequently demonstrate this. But the claim will still exceed his contribution to the art if that contribution is not sufficiently disclosed in the patent.” </p>

The disclosure of those grounds marks the difference between a speculation and a contribution to the art. This is in substance what the Technical Board of Appeal has held in the context of article 56, when addressing the sufficiency of disclosure made in support of claims extending beyond the teaching of the patent. In my opinion, there is no reason to apply a lower standard of plausibility when the sufficiency of disclosure arises in the context of EPC articles 83 and 84 and their analogues in section 14 of the Patents Act.

Nonetheless, variously formulated claims to pharmaceutical products have been granted under the EPC, all through the years. The patent system takes account of the intrinsic difficulties for a compound to be officially certified as a drug by not requiring an absolute proof that the compound is approved as a drug before it may be claimed as such. The boards of appeal have accepted that for a sufficient disclosure of a therapeutic application, it is not always necessary that results of applying the claimed composition in clinical trials, or at least to animals are reported. Yet, this does not mean that a simple verbal statement in a patent specification that compound X may be used to treat disease Y is enough to ensure sufficiency of disclosure in relation to a claim to a pharmaceutical. It is required that the patent provides some information in the form of, for example, experimental tests, to the avail that the claimed compound has a direct effect on a metabolic mechanism specifically involved in the disease, this mechanism being either known from the prior art or demonstrated in the patent per se. Showing a pharmaceutical effect in vitro may be sufficient if for the skilled person this observed effect directly and unambiguously reflects such a therapeutic application (T 241/95, OJ EPO 2001, 103, point 4.1.2 of the reasons, see also T 158/96 of 28 October 1998, point 3.5.2 of the reasons) or, as decision T 158/96 also put it, if there is a “clear and accepted established relationship” between the shown physiological activities and the disease (loc. cit.).

Second, many of the compounds would be predicted to be ineffective drugs because of the presence of groups known to have the potential to cause toxic side effects. Third, many of the compounds are likely to be challenging to synthesise either because of steric effects due to the close proximity of large substituents or due to a lack of literature precedent.

The parties agreed at trial, however, that the validity of claim 1 should be assessed on the basis that it was to be construed as a claim to compounds which had anti-Flaviviridae activity (see [2014] EWHC 3916 (Pat) at [306]). I concluded that claim 1 was invalid for lack of inventive step on AgrEvo grounds because it covered compounds which the skilled team would not have considered plausible had anti-Flaviviridae activity and which therefore did not plausibly solve the technical problem of providing compounds which did have such activity, and thus the claim covered compounds which made no technical contribution to the art (see [449]-[450)]). For the same reasons, I concluded that the disclosure of the patent, read in the light of the common general knowledge of the skilled team, did not make it plausible that the invention would work across the scope of the claim, and therefore the claim was insufficient (see [469]). </p>

Importantly, when considering the question of plausibility for the purposes of inventive step, Kitchin LJ referred in his judgment not once but twice to the fact that it was agreed that the claim should be construed as a claim to compounds which had anti-Flaviviridae activity (see [116] and [124]).</p>

It is not hard to see, however, why the very experienced team of specialist counsel who represented the appellant did not make that submission, and why neither of the two very experienced specialist judges (the other being Floyd LJ) who sat on the appeal thought that it was an answer to the objection of lack of plausibility. The reason is that it was implicit in the agreed construction of the claim that the patent was promising that substantially all compounds having the defined structure did have anti-Flaviviridae activity. Otherwise the patentee would have been saying, in effect, “I claim those compounds which are among the billions covered by the structural definition which happen to have anti-Flaviviridae activity, but I make no promise that any of them do, and you, dear reader, can go and find out which if any do have such activity”. That would not have involved an inventive step, because it would not have solved the technical problem of providing compounds which did have anti-Flaviviridae activity. Equally, it would have meant that the specification did not sufficiently disclose the invention, because it was leaving the task of finding compounds which had antiFlaviviridae activity to the reader.

First, none of the Examples interrogates the inhibitory activity of the Compounds against HIF-PH in an isolated enzyme assay, which makes it impossible to tell the extent to which the differences between them are attributable to differences in cellular permeability, stability or solubility. Secondly, none of Compounds A-K is reported to be inactive, which means it impossible to determine which functional groups are key for activity. Thirdly, the structural differences between Compounds C-K are both very limited and non-systematic, while Compounds A and B are too structurally distinct to be compared to the others yet are shown to be active in inducing Epo (indeed, as noted above, Compound A is one of the two most active compounds in this respect).

Prof Ward thought that a single skilled medicinal chemist could make approximately 150 compounds a year, while Dr Bhalay said that using combinatorial or parallel synthesis it would have been feasible to make “many thousands of compounds in a year”. It does not matter who is right about this, and I will assume Dr Bhalay is, at least if “many” is interpreted as being low single digits. </p>

He maintained that the exercise was one of iterative research. Moreover, consistently with the approach taken by Dr Bhalay, it was not suggested to Prof Ward that the skilled medicinal chemist could possibly synthesise and test even an infinitesimal proportion of the compounds covered by Formula (I) no matter how long they spent on the exercise.

Leaving aside the fact that there is no witness evidence concerning this work, as the Defendants point out, some caution is required because it is evident that some of it was carried out after the publication of a crystal structure of HIF-PH and Compound C in 2006 (see N.C.

It would require a substantial research project to identify any compounds other than those specifically identified in the specification which met the criteria for efficacy, and success would not be guaranteed. While it is probable that, if sufficient resources were thrown at the project, the skilled medicinal chemist would be able to identify some compounds falling within Formula (I) (and more which constituted Carboxamides) which were effective, they would not be able even in many lifetimes of sustained effort to make and test more than a tiny fraction of such compounds, and a substantial proportion either could not be made or would not work. This is not only setting the skilled team a research project and claiming the results, it is a never-ending one.

Although a passage from this paper was put to Prof Ward in cross-examination, however, that proposition was not to put to him, and it does not appear to me that the paper goes quite that far. What the authors say at 7653-7655 is that vadadustat shows a “similar binding mode” to FG-2216 (Compound C) involving metal coordination via glycinamide oxygen and pyridine/isoquinoline nitrogen and electrostatic interactions of glycinamide carboxylate with Tyr-239 and Arg-383 in PHD2. They go on, however, to discuss the rotational freedom of the chlorophenyl group around the C-C axis that connects the two aromatic rings in vadadustat, something that has no counterpart in Compound C. </p>

As noted above, Prof Ward accepted that, having read Majamaa 1984 and Bickel, the skilled medicinal chemist would consider that it was a reasonable hypothesis that Compound C was a competitive inhibitor to 2-OG because of its similarity of structure to 2-OG, but he said they would have to test it. He also accepted that Warshakoon was fair to state that Compound C acts as a 2-OG mimetic. The latter piece of information would not, however, be available to the skilled team reading EP 531 in December 2001. Moreover, it is still not known even now whether Compound C is a competitive inhibitor to 2-OG. On the other hand, there is evidence (in a conference abstract from a number of Akebia scientists published in November 2019) that vadadustat shows 2-OG competitive inhibition against human HIF-PHDs.</p>

FibroGen chose to limit the scope of claim 1 of EP 531 to compounds of Formula (I) in order to overcome an objection from the examiner that the previous claims, which were directed to “a heterocyclic carboxamide compound”, lacked novelty over prior art referred to as D11. FibroGen thereby represented that it was not seeking to contend that the patent, if granted, would have a scope that extended to heterocyclic carboxamides beyond the confines of Formula (I). Yet extending the scope of claim 17A in this way is precisely what the Claimants are now seeking to do.

FibroGen cannot have it both ways. If it wanted a broader claim, it should have maintained its position in the face of the examiner’s objection and, if necessary, appealed to the Board of Appeal (as was its right). It did not do so, but accepted a narrower claim. It is inconsistent with that acceptance for it now to say that the claim extends beyond that.

The only issue as to the allowability of the amendments to the Family A claims which remained live at the end of the trial concerns the amendments to granted claim 1 of EP 531 to produce amended claim 17A. On its face, these amendments amount to a drastic narrowing of the claim. Nevertheless, the Defendants contend that, if claim 17A is infringed by virtue of the doctrine of equivalents, then the amendments are not permissible because they extend the scope of protection of granted claim 1. If I am correct that vadadustat does not infringe claim 17A, this issue does not arise. If I am wrong in that conclusion, I do not consider the amendments are impermissible. Vadadustat would, on my construction of Formula (I), have fallen within the granted claim as well as the amended claim, and thus infringement would not demonstrate any extension of protection. The fact that the granted claim would, having regard to my conclusions on insufficiency, be invalid, whereas claim 17A is valid, does not mean that the scope of protection of the claim has been extended. </p>

Ceruloplasmin expression was increased in mouse kidneys over a period up to 72 hours, as shown in Table 3. Table 4 shows down-regulation of hepcidin expression over a period up to 16 hours. The figures reported do not appear to show a clear trend, however, and there is no statistical information. As Prof Haase explained, and Prof Winearls accepted, there is nothing to demonstrate that this effect is independent of erythropoiesis, although both witnesses considered that this was a possibility. Data are also provided showing upregulation of expression of the transferrin receptor (Figure 6A), the gut duodenal transporter NRAMP2 (Figure 6A; Figure 6B) and the first enzyme in the haem synthetic pathway ALAS-2 (Figure 6C). </p>

The same model was also used to measure serum iron and transferrin saturation, which are both reduced in patients with ACD. As shown in Figures 18A and 18B, administration of 40 mg/kg of Compound A resulted in a significant increase in both serum iron and TSAT in nonanaemic control animals. This increase was not observed to the same extent in anaemic animals, however, although administration of 40 mg/kg of Compound A produced lower levels of serum iron and TSAT than 20 mg/kg. Compound A was also found to increase expression of NRAMP2 and sproutin in the intestine (Figure 19), suggesting a beneficial effect on iron absorption. </p>

There is no dispute that everything which was common general knowledge at the Family A Priority Date remained common general knowledge at the Family B Priority Date. There are three areas of dispute as to the common general knowledge of the skilled nephrologist at the latter date. In the case of the first two, I understand it to be common ground that there was little, if any, relevant difference between the state of the common general knowledge as at December 2001 and as at April 2004, but the issues are relevant to Family B rather than Family A.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.00in">As noted above, there is no dispute that patients with ACD were sometimes treated with ESAs, but there is a minor dispute as to the effectiveness of such treatment. ACD was not an approved indication for ESAs, and so such treatment was “off-label” (i.e. prescribed by the responsible clinician on the basis of their own clinical judgment of the potential of the treatment to meet the needs of a specific patient). Prof Winearls agreed that this use of ESAs was conventional (although he later contradicted himself by saying that it was not conventional, but was done on an ad hoc basis). He said that in his view it was “somewhat misguided”, but nevertheless volunteered that it was an obvious thing to try because it was hoped to compensate for reduced Epo production by the kidneys and reduced responsiveness to Epo by the bone marrow. His opinion was that the treatment was generally ineffective, but he accepted that it worked in some patients.  </p>

As he pointed out, that view is supported by several contemporaneous textbooks, such as E. Beutler et al (eds), Williams Hematology (6th ed, McGraw-Hill, 2001) at pages 484-485. Prof Haase agreed that it was thought that ESAs achieved such therapeutic effect as they did by compensating for reduced Epo production and responsiveness to Epo, and that ESAs were not thought to act by unblocking iron. Thus there was little difference between the experts. </p>

This inhibition prevents the export of iron to the transferrin in the blood plasma and instead leads to iron sequestration in cells. Thus, increased hepcidin levels reduce iron absorption from the duodenum and also reduce the release of iron from macrophage stores. Conversely, decreased levels of hepcidin increase iron absorption and increase its release from stores.  </p>

It was known that the body systematically balances iron levels through the absorption of dietary iron and the release of iron from macrophages, regulated via hepcidin. Hepcidin is synthesised in the liver and its production is regulated in response to circulating iron levels. Hepatocytes sense the increased levels of transferrin-bound iron and hepcidin production is induced, resulting in inhibition of iron uptake in the duodenum and the prevention of iron release from macrophages. It was therefore thought that ACD, which is associated with functional iron deficiency, may be due to elevated plasma levels of hepcidin. Hepcidin transcription is suppressed in response to anaemia and hypoxia, resulting in the increased mobilisation of iron for use in erythropoiesis. It had therefore been proposed that Epo might be involved in the transcriptional downregulation of hepcidin. Hepcidin transcription was also thought to be upregulated by inflammatory cytokines. In support of this account, Prof Haase cited a number of papers. </p>

When anemia/hypoxia occurs, e.g., following severe bleeding or after PHZ [phenylhydrazine] treatment, erythropoietin expression increases, leading to a stimulation of the erythropoietic activity. In parallel, hepcidin gene expression is decreased, inducing a rapid mobilization of iron from reticuloendothelial cells to supply sufficient amounts of iron for the erythropoietic activity. Indeed, we demonstrated previously that a deficiency in hepcidin gene expression results in a dramatic decrease in iron stores in reticuloendothelial cells (6). At the moment, we cannot specify whether erythropoietin is involved in hepcidin downregulation or whether hepcidin and erythropoietin responses to hypoxia are independent.” </p>

Before turning to the issues on obviousness, it is convenient first to consider in general terms what the skilled team, and in particular the nephrologist, would make of [0072] (quoted in paragraph 133 above). As is common ground, there are no data in WO 997 to support the suggestion that the methods of the invention increase iron transport, processing and utilisation. Prof Winearls described this as “a very bold claim” that was “totally unsubstantiated”, but he accepted that it would have been an interesting one. Prof Haase agreed that, as a scientist, he would want to see data before accepting that the effect was a real one. Prof Winearls agreed that the pre-clinical researcher in the skilled team, who would have known that HIF regulated transferrin, transferrin receptor and ceruloplasmin, would have thought that the statements about HIF-PHIs increasing the amount of transferrin, transferrin receptor and ceruloplasmin were plausible. On the other hand, Prof Haase agreed that none of transferrin, transferrin receptor and ceruloplasmin had been implicated in 2004 as a cause of iron deficiency or ACD or anaemia in general. </p>

Unsurprisingly, Prof Haase agreed that that would be an obvious course to adopt. It simply does not follow, however, that other possibilities were not obvious.     </p>

The Claimants suggest that this means that there was no need to treat patients with a TSAT of less than 20% or 16% with anything else, but that would mean that there was no technical problem to solve. In any event, the evidence is clear that it is precisely because supplemental iron was not always effective that ESAs were used to treat ACD, as discussed above.

If and in so far as there is such a benefit, however, the Defendants contend that this would have been discovered by the skilled team by taking obvious steps. As Prof Winearls accepted, the skilled team would have been motivated by WO 997 to do some relatively straightforward tests. These would have included the transferrin and transferrin receptor tests in animal cells in WO 121, which would (if WO 121 is correct in its assertions) have shown an “enhancement” of erythropoiesis through increasing iron transport etc. This would have led to the other tests done in WO 121 to measure iron uptake, including measuring haemoglobin levels, and then ultimately comparative tests on iron uptake over ESAs.

As Prof Winearls accepted, any effect of HIF-PHIs on hepcidin is an inevitable and inherent part of administering the drug. Moreover, there is no evidence that decreasing hepcidin expression was in April 2004, or even now, a therapeutic objective in its own right. </p>

It is common ground, however, that, if and when vadadustat is authorised, the Defendants intend to market it in the UK. Moreover, the Defendants have given evidence (by way of a Product and Process Description) as to the scope of the marketing authorisation that they presently intend to seek. The therapeutic indications for which authorisation will be sought are “treatment of anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults who are non-dialysis-dependent (NDD) and those who are dialysis-dependent (DD)”.</p>

As noted above, most of the claims in issue are in EPC 2000 form, whereas claim 1 of EP 823 is in Swiss form. The difference between the two is that a Swiss-form claim is a purpose-limited process claim (see Generics (UK) Ltd v Warner-Lambert Co LLC [2018] UKSC 56, [2019] Bus LR 360 at [2], [63]), whereas an EPC 2000-form claim is a purpose-limited product claim. As such, they have a different scope of protection: see T 1373/11 GENZYME/Treatment of Pompe’s Disease [2016] EPOR 33 at [21] cited in Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office at page 522. In particular, direct infringement of EPC 2000 claims falls to be determined under section 60(1)(a) of the Patents Act 1977, whereas direct infringement of Swiss-form claims falls to be determined under section 60(1)(c). Furthermore, whereas claims for indirect infringement of Swiss-form claims by downstream dealings in the product of the manufacturing step are unsustainable for the reasons explained by Lord Sumption (with whom all the other members of the Supreme Court agreed on in this issue) in Generics v Warner-Lambert at [87]-[88], no such problem arises in the case of EPC 2000 claims. </p>

To take an extreme case, if a man began taking actual preparatory steps to commit some unlawful act seriously damaging to the claimant and in infringement of the claimant's rights and did so in full view of the claimant and well aware that the claimant could see them, he could hardly complain if the claimant started proceedings and the court decided to grant a final injunction to prevent it.

If the evidence before the Court does not establish that the Defendants are presently threatening to infringe the Family B Patents, then the cross-claim should be dismissed. Given that there is no claim by the Defendants for a declaration of noninfringement, there would be nothing to prevent the Claimants from bringing a further claim for infringement if the circumstances change in the future.      </p>

(Indeed, although there are quite a lot of Phase III trials underway in which HIF-PHIs are being compared with ESAs, there is no evidence that iron parameters are a primary end point in any of them.) The Claimants do not dispute that it follows that at present there is no foreseeable prospect of vadadustat receiving a marketing authorisation for such uses. The Claimants nevertheless contend that it is foreseeable that clinicians will prescribe vadadustat for such uses off-label because there is a growing body of clinical evidence that HIF-PHIs have advantages over ESAs in terms of their effects on increasing iron mobilisation. This contention requires me to consider two questions. First, what is the current state of the clinical evidence?

As Prof Haase pointed out in his fourth report, however, supplemental iron was made available to the patients and the paper does not identify those patients who received the supplemental iron or whether or not those patients who received supplemental iron were iron replete at the outset or not. Accordingly, as Prof Winearls accepted, it is not possible to conclude whether the reported effects of increased iron availability for erythropoiesis was the result of exogenous iron or the administration of the HIF-PHI (roxadustat). Furthermore, as a matter of common sense, it is likely that those who were not iron replete at the start of the trial were the most likely patients to receive oral iron.  </p>

Hepcidin plays a central role in the pathogenesis of functional iron deficiency as it inhibits gastrointestinal iron uptake and iron release from internal stores by down-regulating the surface expression of ferroportin, the only known cellular iron exporter. Clinical data from phase II studies have consistently shown ‘positive’ effects on iron metabolism as manifested by a reduction in plasma ferritin and hepcidin and simultaneous increase in plasma transferrin and TIBC … These results are consistent with experimental data from animal and cell culture studies, which demonstrated that the PHD/HIF axis coordinates iron metabolism with erythropoiesis via transcriptional regulation of genes involved in iron uptake, iron release and transport. … The observed effects on plasma hepcidin levels in CKD patients receiving HIF-PHIs are most likely indirect, as hepcidin is not a direct transcriptional target of HIF. Transcriptional suppression of hepcidin in the context of HIF activation requires erythropoietic activity and is mediated by bone-marrow derived factors such as erythroferrone. It is unclear, however, whether the effects of oral HIF-PHI therapy on iron metabolism are primarily mediated via the hepcidin-ferroportin axis (increase in erythropoietic activity with subsequent suppression of hepcidin and increased ferroportin-mediated iron release) or through direct transcriptional regulation of iron metabolism gene expression. Although several iron metabolism genes … are bona fide HIF-regulated genes and can be upregulated by oral prolyl hydroxylase inhibition, it has not been examined whether HIF-PHI doses currently used in clinical trials are sufficient to induce the expression of these genes in CKD patients. Nevertheless, the added HIF-PHI effect on iron mobilisation has the potential to reduce the need for IV iron supplementation in patients with renal anemia as suggested by Besarab and colleagues.”  </p>

One group of 24 patients received no iron, and that group showed a statistically significant decrease in levels of both serum iron and TSAT. The authors noted (at page 1228) that “Neither transferrin saturation (TSAT) levels nor reticulocyte Hb content changed significantly in the groups receiving oral or IV iron, but both decreased in those not receiving iron”.

Counsel for the Claimants submitted that this was immaterial because nephrologists were capable of reading and drawing conclusions from papers like Provenzano 1, Provenzano 2 and Chen. The relevance of this evidence, however, is that, in the absence of a proper analysis of the clinical evidence by persons who are qualified to undertake it of the kind that is available to, for example, NICE when formulating its Guidelines, it is less likely that clinicians will be inclined to take the risk of prescribing vadadustat off-label. </p>

This tendency is due to the influential PIVOTAL study published in 2019. This was one of the largest renal clinical trials ever undertaken exclusively in the UK, and was designed to investigate the optimum amount of intravenous iron that can be given to patients on dialysis to treat anaemia effectively and safely. Previously it was thought that giving high doses of IV iron might lead to a greater risk of infection, but the PIVOTAL trial showed that a high dose regime is safe and more effective than the (more commonly used) low dose regime, and leads to a reduction in the dose of ESAs required, which is both clinically and financially advantageous. The PIVOTAL study therefore provides a basis for nephrologists to use iron supplementation more liberally in haemodialysis patients in order to achieve better patient outcomes, and Dr Ashman explained that Barts (one of the leading renal units in the UK) has already changed to a high-iron regime. </p>

This relies on the theory that the hepcidin effects of HIF-PHIs may have a clinically beneficial effect on iron mobilisation, such that patients may be given HIF-PHIs without first being made iron replete, i.e. when they have a TSAT &lt;16% or even &lt;20%. </p>

In terms of prescribing to patients with TSAT &lt;20%, he suggested that the label “would be unlikely to deter nephrologists from taking this approach if they obtained adequate reassurance, from relevant academic publications, that this approach is safe and effective”.
