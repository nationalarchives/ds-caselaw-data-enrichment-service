There is no challenge to the earliest claimed priority date of 8 July 2003. Genentech counterclaims for infringement. Genentech has also applied to amend the Patent both unconditionally and conditionally. Lilly opposes the amendments on grounds of added matter, extension of protection and lack of clarity as well as contending that they do not cure the invalidity of the claims. Although both the application for the Patent and the Patent as granted contained claims directed to the treatment of any immune-related disorder, Genentech only maintains claims directed to rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”) and psoriasis. Claims directed to inflammatory diseases generally and asthma specifically were abandoned as recently as 4 January 2019. </p>

There are a large number of issues, and a formidable body of material addressing them. Some indication of this is provided by the following metrics. Lilly’s written closing submissions run to 607 paragraphs and Genentech’s to 423 paragraphs, and both documents incorporate by reference additional sections from the parties’ respective opening skeleton arguments. There are 24 reports from nine expert witnesses running to 676 pages (including annexes, but excluding exhibits). The experts were efficiently cross-examined over seven and a half days. There are over 300 scientific papers (including a few abstracts) in the trial bundles (although I estimate that only about half were referred to), plus extracts from two books. I have done my best to take all this material into account; but I cannot possibly refer to all of it in this judgment. As will appear, I have been able to deal quite briefly with some of the issues. Even so, it cannot avoid being a lengthy judgment. </p>

Prof Krueger has published over 300 peer-reviewed publications, primarily in relation to psoriasis biology and treatment. Since 1995 he has been a member of advisory boards for a number of pharmaceutical companies and he has been consulted by a number of companies that have being developing treatments for psoriasis, including both Lilly (in relation to ixekizumab) and Genentech (in relation to efalizumab, an anti-CD11 antibody which received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration in October 2003, but was withdrawn from the market in 2009 due to adverse reactions).

He also gave a presentation entitled “IL-17 Family Cytokines and Psoriasis” at a Psoriasis: Gene to Clinic meeting in December 2017 in which he reviewed the history of discoveries relating to the IL-17 family and its role in psoriasis. Counsel for Genentech criticised Prof Krueger for not re-reading Kreuger 2002 when writing his reports even though he had referred to it, but Prof Krueger explained that he remembered it very well. In any event, as Prof Krueger also explained, the field had moved on by July 2003.

The first was the exhibition of a selective extract from Freedberg <span style="font-style:italic">et al</span> (eds), <span style="font-style:italic">Fitzpatrick’s Dermatology in General Medicine</span> (6th ed, 2003). Prof Prens explained that the particular pages had been selected by the legal team, and he had not seen the selection at the time he signed his report.

This in itself does not strike me as significant, particularly given the age of the review. What is more significant is, as counsel for Lilly submitted, the brevity and superficiality of Prof Prens’ exposition of the common general knowledge of the skilled person in his first report compared to that of Prof Krueger, something which I noted when I first read the reports. For example, there was little discussion of the complexity of the cytokine network, and no mention at all of the phenomenon of redundancy. </p>

As this stage, it is sufficient to record that I do not accept that the cross-examination of Prof Prens on this matter was, as counsel for Genentech submitted, “bizarre”, “inappropriate”, “aggressive” or “bullying”, although it is fair to say that some of the questions were mis-directed. I found Prof Prens’ evidence on the topic deeply unsatisfactory for the reasons I shall explain. While it may be said to be an isolated and somewhat peripheral topic which does not necessarily affect Prof Prens’ evidence on the other issues in the case, I am bound to say that it did reduce my confidence in Prof Prens’ evidence and thus the weight which I am able to give it.    </p>

After the formation of GlaxoWellcome in 1995 he held the positions of Unit Head of the Immunology Research Unit overseeing the early Discovery Portfolio (1995-1999), Head of the Immunology and Virology Department (1999-2001) and Acting Director of Biological Sciences Division (2000-2001). After the merger of GlaxoWellcome and SmithKline Beecham to form GlaxoSmithKline plc, he was Vice-President, Gene and Protein Therapeutics, Discovery Research (2001-2003) and Vice-President for Discovery Biology within the Biopharm Centre of Excellence for Drug Discovery (2003-2008). During the latter period he was also Chair of the Board of Trustees of the Edward Jenner Institute for Vaccine Research. From 2009 to 2012 he was the founding Chief Executive Officer of Bicycle Therapeutics Ltd, which had a proprietary technology for the development of highly stable bicyclic peptides as novel biopharmaceutical agents. He established Pannier Consulting Ltd in 2012. </p>

Counsel submitted that it was regrettable that certain points made by Dr Tite in his oral evidence had not been included in Dr Tite’s written reports, but accepted that this may have been the fault of Lilly’s legal team. More importantly, counsel pointed out that Dr Tite was an immunologist, not an expert in structural biology, and that he had had no experience of working with IL-17 cytokines or antibodies to them. Accordingly, Dr Tite accepted that he was not in a position to question Prof Carr’s structural analysis of what antibodies would be expected to be raised against IL17A and how they would be expected to interact with IL-17A/F. As counsel for Lilly pointed out, however, Dr Tite emphasised that he was in a position to consider the question from the perspective of an immunologist.      </p>

There are four types of nucleotide in each type of nucleic acid, determined by the nature of nitrogenous base: adenine (A), thymine (T) (in DNA) / uracil (U) (in RNA), guanine (G) and cytosine (C). Nucleotides are joined together by a ligation reaction. The ligation covalently links the phosphate group on the second nucleotide and the hydroxyl group on the first nucleotide to form a sugar-phosphate backbone from which the bases are projected (see Figure 1). Repetition of this reaction creates a long chain of nucleotides (a polynucleotide chain). </p>

An α-helix is a spiral structure within a protein in which hydrogen bonding links one amino acid to the amino acid four residues along in the chain. This binding forms a backbone core that is tightly packed, with the amino acid side chains extending away from this central axis. In contrast, a β-strand consists of an extended amino acid chain that must interact via backbone hydrogen bonds with another βstrand to form a stable structure known as a β-sheet. Such strands may be arranged in a parallel fashion (where the strands run in the same direction) or an anti-parallel fashion (where the strands run in opposite directions).

Some components of innate immunity, e.g. production of anti-microbial proteins by epithelial cells, are constitutive, but can also be induced or increased rapidly to augment the constitutive levels. Other components are cellular or cytokine pathways that can be rapidly activated to provide protective responses. Innate mechanisms can be divided into a number of categories: anatomic (e.g. epithelial cell surfaces), physiologic (e.g. body temperature), engulfment (e.g. phagocytes) and the complement system (plasma proteins that induce a series of inflammatory responses). Generally, microbes or microbial products directly trigger cellular pathways which produce an “active” innate immune response, e.g. lipopolysaccharide from Gram negative bacteria activate macrophages to release pre-synthesised tumour necrosis factor (TNF) which then induces a “chain reaction” of subsequent cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, amongst others) which rapidly (within hours) bring neutrophils to a site of infection. Neutrophils release anti-microbial products that kill bacteria, and bacteria are also engulfed by macrophages, neutrophils, and other phagocytes that kill them in the cytoplasm. Natural killer (NK) cells are a type of lymphocyte of the innate immune system that when activated also release inflammatory cytokines and can kill cellular targets using products stored in the cytoplasm. </p>

A common method employed to measure the binding affinity of an antibody to its antigen is surface plasmon resonance (SPR). SPR is based on the measurement of the refractive index near a sensor surface. The phenomenon occurs when a surface plasmon, which is a charge density wave that occurs at the interface between a metal (often gold) and a dielectricum, is excited by light. When the light is directed at a particular angle, the photon energy is transferred to the charge density wave, which is observed as a sharp dip in the refracted light intensity. If an antigen is adsorbed onto the metal and an antibody is passed over the surface, binding of the proteins causes a shift in the SPR angle (see Figure 12). </p>

To do so, the antigen of interest may be coated to a surface and exposed to the phage in order that the phage that express a Fab/scFv which binds the antigen of interest are captured while the phage that do not bind are washed away. Bacteria may be infected with the captured phage to amplify the relevant phage.

The first antibody for the antigen is attached to the bottom of the wells of a microtitre plate; this is referred to as the capture antibody. The test solution containing the antigen of interest is then introduced. The antigen is captured by the fixed antibody and any unbound proteins are washed away. An antibody which recognises the antigen via a different epitope is then added and the binding of this second antibody, referred to as a detection antibody, will be used to detect that the antigen has been captured. Figure 14 shows this being performed using an indirect method, but a direct method using an enzyme conjugated to the detection antibody is possible. The signal is developed and the detectable response is measured as outlined above. </p>

The amount of primary antibody bound is detected at each concentration of the unlabelled antibody.

	    <p style="margin-left:1.06in;margin-right:1.54in;text-indent:-0.55in">[0017]  Consistent with IL-17's wide-range of effects, the cell surface receptor for IL-17 has been found to be widely expressed in many tissues and cell types (Yao et al., Cytokine, 9:794 [1997]). While the amino acid sequence of the human IL-17 receptor (IL-R) (866 amino acids) predicts a protein with a single transmembrane domain and a long, 525 amino acid intracellular domain, the receptor sequence is unique and is not similar to that of any of the receptors from the cytokine/growth factor receptor family. This coupled with the lack of similarity of IL-17 itself to other known proteins indicates that IL-17 and its receptor may be part of a novel family of signaling proteins and receptors. It has been demonstrated that IL-17 activity is mediated through binding to its unique cell surface receptor (designated herein as human IL-17R), wherein previous studies have shown that contacting T cells with a soluble form of the IL-17 receptor polypeptide inhibited T cell proliferation and IL-2 production induced by PHA, concanavalin A and anti-TCR monoclonal antibody (Yao et al., J. Immunol., 155:5483-5486 [1995]). As such, there is significant interest in identifying and characterizing novel polypeptides having homology to the known cytokine receptors, specifically IL-17 receptors.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.06in;margin-right:1.54in;text-indent:-0.55in">“[0018] Interleukin 17 is now recognized as the prototype member of an emerging family of cytokines. The large scale sequencing of the human and other vertebrate genomes has revealed the presence of additional genes encoding proteins clearly related to IL-17, thus defining a new family of cytokines. There are at least 6 members of the IL-17 family in humans and mice including IL-17B, IL-17C, IL-17D, IL-17E and IL-17F as well as novel receptors IL-17RH1, IL-17RH2, IL-17RH3 and IL17RH4 (see W001/46420 published June 28, 2001). One such IL-17 member (designated as IL-17F) has been demonstrated to bind to the human IL-17 receptor (IL-17R) (Yao et al., Cytokine, 9(11):794-800 (1997)). Initial characterization suggests that, like IL-17, several of these newly identified molecules have the ability to modulate immune function. The potent inflammatory actions that have been identified for several of these factors and the emerging associations with major human diseases suggest that these proteins may have significant roles in inflammatory processes and may offer opportunities for therapeutic intervention. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.06in;margin-right:1.54in;text-indent:-0.55in">[0019]  The gene encoding human IL-17F is located adjacent to IL-17 (Hymowitz, S.G., et al., Embo J, 20(19):5332-41 (2001)). IL17 and IL-17F share 44% amino acid identity whereas the other members of the IL-17 family share a more limited 1527% amino acid identity suggesting that IL-17 and IL-17F form a distinct subgroup within the IL-17 family (Starnes, T., et al., J Immunol, 167(8):4137-40 (2001); <span style="font-weight:bold">Aggarwal, S. and Gurney, A.L., J. Leukoc Biol, 71 (1):1-8 (2002)</span>). IL-17F appears to have similar biological actions as IL-17, and is able to promote the production of IL-6, IL-8, and GCSF from a wide variety of cells. Similar to IL-17, it is able to induce cartilage matrix release and inhibit new cartilage matrix synthesis (see US-2002-0177188-A1 published November 28, 2002). Thus, like IL-17, IL-17F may potentially contribute to the pathology of inflammatory disorders. Recently, these authors have observed that both IL-17 and IL-17F are induced in T cells by the action of interleukin 23 (IL-23) (<span style="font-weight:bold">Aggarwal, </span></p>

Human IL-17A/F is a distinctly new cytokine, distinguishable from human IL-17 and 1L-17F in both protein structure and in cell-based activity assays. Through the use of purified recombinant human IL-17 A/F as a standard, a human IL-17AF-specific ELISA has been developed. Through the use of this specific ELISA, the induced expression of human IL-17A/F was detected, confirming that IL-17A/F is naturally produced from activated human T cells in culture. Hence, IL-17A/F is a distinctly new cytokine, detectable as a natural product of isolated activated human T cells, whose recombinant form has been characterized, in both protein structure and cell-based assays, as to be different and distinguishable from related cytokines. Thus, these studies provide and identify a novel immune stimulant (i.e. IL-17 A/F) that can boost the immune system to respond to a particular antigen that may not have been immunologically active previously. As such, the newly identified immune stimulant has important clinical applications. This novel IL-17A/F cytokine or agonists thereof, would therefore find practical utility as an immune stimulant, whereas molecules which inhibit IL-17A/F activity (antagonists) would be expected to find practical utility when an inhibition of the immune response is desired, such as in autoimmune diseases. Specifically, antibodies to this new cytokine which either mimic (agonist antibodies) or inhibit (antagonist antibodies) the immunological activities of IL-17 A/F would possess therapeutic qualities. Small molecules which act to inhibit the activity of this novel cytokine would also have potential therapeutic uses.” </p>

For example, specific binding can be determined by competition with a control molecule that is similar to the target, for example, an excess of non-labeled target.

To achieve this goal, according to a preferred method, humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using threedimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic, such as increased affinity/or the target antigen(s), is achieved.” </p>

The difference in activity differs from IL-17 and IL-17F by roughly an order of magnitude in each case. The substantially greater activity of IL-17 A/F than IL-17F in this assay suggests that IL17A/F may comprise a critical component of the cytokine activity resulting from the IL-17F gene product. This unique potency may enable the molecule to possess distinct range of actions in vivo. IL-17A/F also induced production of IL-6 from this cell line (Figure 5B). Additionally, it is likely that IL17A/F may possess additional characteristics not present in either IL-17 or IL-17F as a result of its novel heterodimeric composition that may alter the kinetics and utilization of receptor subunits in vivo, resulting in unique biological consequences.” </p>

Given that IL17A/F is a heterodimer of A and F, the skilled reader would not be surprised to find that its potency is intermediate between that of IL-17A/A and IL-17F/F.  </p>

Example 2, headed “Identification of a novel IL-17 cytokine produced in activated human T cells”, demonstrates that IL-17A/F is naturally produced in activated human T-cells. Human blood was first extracted from a healthy donor. Human T-lymphocytes were then isolated from the blood and activated using anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. Samples of media were collected at various time points following plating and assayed for IL-17A/F by a sandwich ELISA. An anti-human IL-17A antibody was coated onto a microtitre plate, and after the test sample had been added a biotinylated anti-human IL-17F antibody as a detection antibody diluted in assay buffer. A positive signal would only be detected in response to the IL-17A/F heterodimer – the anti-human IL-17A coat antibody first binds to the IL-17A chain and immobilises the molecule, and the anti-human IL-17F antibody binds to the IL-17F chain to visualise it. IL-17A and IL-17F were used as positive controls to demonstrate that the assay was specific for IL-17A/F. </p>

This confirms that the ELISA was able to selectively and reproducibly detect IL-17A/F (but not IL17A/A or IL-17F/F). </p>

Psoriasis is characterised by scaly red patches on the skin which can be itchy as well as unsightly. Depending on its severity, psoriasis can have a great impact on a patient’s quality of life. The incidence of psoriasis varies from country to country. In 1999 it was estimated to affect 2.6% of the US population. There are five main types with plaque psoriasis (also called psoriasis vulgaris) being the most common. </p>

The PASI score is calculated by grading the intensity of the redness, thickness and scaling of psoriasis plaques in four body regions (head, trunk, arms and legs) on a five-point scale of 0-4 and multiplied by the extent of psoriasis plaques found in the region and by the proportion of that region with respect to the entire body. The total PASI score ranges from 0 to 72. In July 2003 it was common to specify a primary efficacy endpoint of a 75% or greater reduction in PASI from the start of treatment, referred to as PASI75, in clinical trials. </p>

By chance, an anti-TNFα antibody, infliximab, had been found to clear psoriasis in a patient being treated for inflammatory bowel disease in 2000. A clinical trial of a TNF-receptor-Ig fusion protein, etanercept, which as noted above is also a TNFα inhibitor, in psoriatic arthritis patients reported in 2000 showed efficacy in some patients, but the relevance of that finding to psoriasis was uncertain. Subsequently a small clinical trial of infliximab in psoriasis patients was reported in 2001 showing impressive efficacy and good tolerability.

IL-6 was known to be expressed at a considerably higher level in psoriasis lesions than in normal skin and to simulate keratinocyte proliferation. A number of other factors such as transforming growth factor alpha (TGFα) and IL-1 were also known to be present in psoriasis lesions and to induce keratinocyte proliferation, however. Thus there was a potential problem of redundancy. Although the stimulus for IL-6 overproduction in psoriasis was not known, studies had shown that both TNFα and IFNγ induced IL-6 production by keratinoctyes.  In summary, it was uncertain as to whether IL-6 had a therapeutically relevant role in psoriasis. </p>

The passage relied on discusses how IL-6 was recognised as a major growth factor in multiple myeloma in the early 1990s. This led to clinical trials with neutralising antiIL-6 antibodies, but it was found that this led to massive systemic elevation of IL-6. To overcome this problem, blockade of IL-6’s receptor, IL-6R, was targeted. This led to the development of tocilizumab, which inhibits the binding of IL-6 to IL-6R. This was the subject of clinical trials in a variety of conditions after 2003, and tocilizumab has been approved for the treatment of RA since 2010. There is no reference to psoriasis in this passage (or anywhere else in the review so far as I can see), and Prof Krueger said that he was not familiar with this work. Moreover, Prof Prens confirmed that information relating to tocilizumab was not publicly available before July 2003. As Prof Krueger had pointed out in his first report, it has recently been found that tocilizumab can lead to the onset of psoriasis in patients with no prior history of it. </p>

When it was put to him that this showed that IL-6 continued to be considered to be a relevant target for psoriasis even after 2003, Prof Krueger disagreed, explaining that the two diseases were different. Although there was some overlap in the cytokine networks, the position was far less clear for psoriatic arthritis and there were far less satisfactory treatments of it available.

As can be seen, it is referred to in most of the reviews discussed in paragraphs 240-252 above. There is no dispute that, prior to May 2002, it was regarded as a plausible therapeutic target. This is despite the fact that it was recognised that there was a potential problem with redundancy, particular with respect to growth-regulated oncogene-alpha (Gro-α, also known as CXCL1).

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.54in;text-indent:0.00in">“According to the pathogenic model drawn in Fig 6, IL-8 is a chemokine that amplifies T-cell–‘driven’ inflammation by recruiting neutrophils into psoriasis lesions. Although this chemokine might also affect T-cell recruitment into lesions, there is no evidence for selectivity of its receptor (CCR1) in regulating type 1 T-cell responses. ABX–IL-8 (Abgenix, Inc, Fremont, Calif), [is] a fully human anti–IL-8 antibody that neutralizes this chemokine. Moderate clinical improvements observed in most patients with psoriasis treated with anti–IL8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">135</span> support the role of this chemokine as a part of an inflammatory cascade, but not as a sole mediator. There is also a difficult anatomic problem with respect to IL-8 neutralization in that upper spinous keratinocytes synthesize large amounts of this chemokine, whereas penetration of large proteins (anti-IL-8 antibodies) into the epidermis is likely to be quite limited. In addition, a general problem with antagonizing single chemokines is that considerable redundancy exists.  For example, both IL-8 and Gro-α are neutrophil chemoattractants that bind to surface receptors CXCR1 or CXCR2. Gro-α is highly expressed in psoriatic lesions<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">85</span> and could still stimulate neutrophil trafficking even though IL-8 is fully neutralized by an antibody. The situation in T lymphocytes is similar in that multiple chemokines control T-cell migration responses.  However, there is additional redundancy in that some receptors bind 2 or more chemokine ligands (Fig 5). Despite these problems, chemokines and chemokine receptors are attractive therapeutic targets because highly specific immune blockade can be obtained with[out] producing generalized immune suppression.” </p>

As mentioned in the passage from Krueger 2002 quoted in the preceding paragraph, Abgenix had developed an anti-IL-8 antibody which had been tested in clinical trials. There is no dispute that, in fact, Abgenix stopped development of its anti-IL-8 antibody in May 2002 due to its failure in one of those trials. There is a vigorous dispute, however, as to whether this fact was common general knowledge in July 2003, and if so, the impact that would have had on the skilled person’s thinking. </p>

He gave two reasons for his disagreement. First, he did not think that the skilled person would have been aware of the failure of Abgenix’s antibody in July 2003 because it was not the subject of any articles and he (Prof Prens) did not recall finding out about it until much later. In cross-examination Prof Prens accepted that it was likely that word would have got around in the USA by July 2003, but maintained that it had not in Europe.  </p>

Section 2 of the document (page 1-13) describes certain <span style="font-style:italic">in vitro</span> studies. No dates for these are given. Section 3 (pages 13-27) describes a Phase II/Phase III trial which is attributed to six people (not including Huang) from various different institutions in China. The document states that the trial was carried out from October 1999 to June 2000. It describes the trial as a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, but with the inclusion of an open-label treatment group. It states at pages 14-15 that 208 patients (treatment group), 234 patients (control group) and 231 patients (open-label group) were enrolled, of whom 202, 221 and 210 respectively completed the trial. Later on page 15, however, it gives the numbers of the first two groups as 197 and 215 respectively, giving a total of 412. The total figure of 412 is reported at the beginning of paragraph 3.4 on page 17, although the end of the same paragraph gives the numbers of the treatment and control groups as 202 and 228. After six weeks, it is reported the efficacy in the treatment group was 49% against 14.9% in the control group, a statistically significant result. It appears that this was based on a system of scoring symptoms on a scale of 0 to 4 (i.e. not PASI or PGA). The adverse reaction rates reported are 5.9% and 6.6%.

When I asked him why he had not mentioned this in either his second or his third report, he said that it was “a detail”.

Nevertheless, as stated above, I regard Prof Prens’ evidence on this topic as deeply unsatisfactory. Given the dates of references 85 and 86 in Tsai and Tsai (2002 and 2003), Prof Prens should have been cautious about relying upon Tsai and Tsai as evidence of “further research” after May 2002. Given that he looked at the Wikipedia entry and saw the date of 2003 given for approval of Abcream, he should have been even more cautious. When he downloaded and read the Anogen document, he should have appreciated that it was not safe to rely upon this material at all because (a) the dates mentioned in it pre-date May 2002, (b) the description of the Phase II/III trial is at best unclear, (c) there is no mention of Abcream having been approved and (d) there is no mention of the supposed Phase IV trial. Even if he considered that it was appropriate to rely upon the material, he ought to have put the material properly before the court in his second report, which would have involved him explaining the searches he had done and exhibiting the Anogen document. Finally, I was particularly concerned by Prof Prens’ reluctance to accept, even after being shown the translation of reference 86, that the material does not demonstrate there was “further research” after May 2002. </p>

In any event, I do not consider that there is any reliable evidence that Abcream, and therefore IL-8 inhibition, is efficacious against psoriasis. Mr Chacksfield relied upon the results of the Phase II/Phase III trial reported in the Anogen document, but that document has not been published in the scientific literature and there is no evidence that it has ever been peer-reviewed. Given the document is internally inconsistent as to the numbers of patients in the relevant groups, I do not consider it a reliable report of whatever trial was carried out. Moreover, the trial included an open-label arm, which, as Prof Prens agreed, is irregular. Finally, as noted above, there is no list of ingredients, and thus one cannot be sure that the cream did not include e.g. a corticosteroid. Reliance was also placed on the supposed fact that Abcream is on the market in China, but the only evidence of that is the statement in Tsai and Tsai which I do not regard as reliable. In any event, that would not demonstrate that it is effective. </p>

The result of a placebo-controlled phase IIb clinical trial for treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis with this Ab, however, was disappointing (39). This failure might well have resulted from the low and infrequent dosing used in these studies, leading to insufficient Ab concentrations in situ.  Additionally, heterogeneity in clearance rates of the human IgG2 Ab resulting from a polymorphism for FcγRIIa that is known to affect IgG2 serum concentrations (40) may have played a role.” </p>

Thus the pathogenesis is different, and it is widely debated even today whether there was any similarity between the two. (Prof Krueger also pointed out the data appeared to show that efficacy was flat across the dose ranges tested and that there was no placebo. Accordingly, he questioned whether the study had any validity. That is a separate issue, however.)

Dr Tite identified two meanings as being used in the art. The first was that the antibody bound authentically as an antibody, rather than non-specifically due to proteins adhering to each other without binding. The second was that the antibody bound to a single antigen. Even in the second case, he acknowledged that it was possible for someone to speak of an antibody being specific for one antigen, but cross-reactive to other antigen to which it bound with lower affinity. </p>

As is common ground, the interpretation of the wording of the claim is a matter for the court, but expert evidence as to the technical content of the specification which bears upon the question is both admissible and of assistance. Given the issue is one of antibody binding, this would fall within the province of the antibody engineer. Hence it was primarily addressed by Dr Tite for Lilly and by Prof Martin for Genentech. Some of the other experts also gave relevant evidence on the point, however. </p>

Lilly’s case is that this paragraph either supports Lilly’s construction or is incoherent. Dr Tite’s evidence was that it is somewhat confusing. It was clear from his oral evidence, however, that the principal source of his confusion was the first sentence of section A, and in particular the statement that an antibody “which binds” is “one that binds the antigen with sufficient affinity …, and does not significantly cross-react with other proteins”. Dr Tite’s view was that the effect of this was to conflate the meaning of “binds” and “specifically binds”. </p>

The first is to take the definition of “which binds” in section [A] literally, and therefore to read the definition of “specifically binds to” in section [C] as meaning something different to its literal meaning. The second is to take the definition of “specifically binds to” in section [C] as being the key definition, and to seek to reconcile the definition of “which binds” in section [A] with it. In my judgment the skilled reader would do the latter. The skilled reader is deemed to read the whole of the definition (in its context of the specification as a whole) and with a mind willing to understand it. It is section [C] which defines the words used in the claim, and the skilled reader would give that most weight. Moreover, the skilled reader would consider that this is supported by the statement in section [D] that “specific binding” has a more restricted meaning in one embodiment. Although the skilled reader might on a first reading be confused by the definition of “which binds” in section [A],  on reflection after reading [0118] as a whole, the skilled reader would conclude that, as Prof Martin explained, it was possible to reconcile section [A] with the remainder of the paragraph by interpreting the words “does not significantly cross-react with other proteins” as meaning that the antibody does not react non-specifically with other proteins i.e. by adherence.         </p>

They were only screened for their ability to bind IL-17A/F. The specification describes these antibodies in [0398] as “specific antibodies which bind selectively to the novel heterodimeric complex of IL-17A/F”.

Example 9 provides a specific instance of this. Lilly rely on the fact that Example 9 does not describe a negative selection step either, and ask the rhetorical question why the skilled reader would understand that it was to be performed in Example 9 but had not been performed in Example 1. In my judgment the answer to this is supplied by the point which Lilly make that the skilled reader would appreciate that Example 9 is a prophetic example. Thus Example 9 merely sets out an outline of a proposed experiment. By contrast, Example 1 describes an actual experiment carried out by the inventors, reports the results obtained and analyses those results, which as I have already observed form part of the central core of the teaching of the Patent. In those circumstances, the skilled person would expect that, if an important step like negative selection had been carried out in Example 1, the inventors would have described it, but would consider that Example 9 fell into a different category. The same applies to the diagnostic applications referred to in [0028]-[0032] and [0235].

This evidence is consistent with that of Prof Kamradt looking at the matter from the perspective of the rheumatologist. Prof Krueger’s opinion looking at the matter from the perspective of the dermatologist was different, but I do not find his reasoning persuasive so far as the interpretation of the expression “specifically binds” is concerned (its impact on other aspects of the case is another matter).

In any event, the relevant words were again contained in the granted claims and therefore no objection can be taken on the application to amend.         </p>

That decision is presently under appeal, and I am informed that a decision of the Technical Board of Appeal is not expected before January 2020 at the earliest. (I am not aware that any request has been made for acceleration due to these proceedings. Certainly, the parties did not request this Court to support such a request, as they could have done. This is particularly unfortunate given that the Opposition Division did not determine any of the other grounds of opposition, and thus if Genentech’s appeal is allowed the case will need to be remitted to the Opposition Division with the potential for a further appeal to the Board of Appeal thereafter.) Secondly, the Comptroller-General of Patents has filed comments on Genentech’s amendment application in a letter dated 3 January 2019 stating that, in the Comptroller’s opinion, the proposed amendments are unallowable on this ground. </p>

In Genentech’s skeleton argument it was accepted that the key findings of Lubberts 2001 were part of the skilled rheumatologist’s common general knowledge. Although Lilly’s written closing submissions referred back to their skeleton argument, no arguments were advanced specifically by reference to any of these items of prior art. I asked counsel for Lilly if Lilly were still relying on Lubberts 2001, and he replied that they were not, having regard to the common ground as to the common general knowledge concerning IL17A/A.

Lilly contend that such antibodies will inherently inhibit production of IL-6 and IL-8, but in any event rely upon the evidence of Prof Kamradt that it was common practice by July 2003 to test IL-17 family members for inducing IL-6 and IL-8 production as showing that it was obvious to raise antibodies which inhibited this. Lilly further rely upon the evidence of Prof Martin that the effect on IL-6 and IL-8 was what the skilled person would be looking for as confirming this. In any event, Example 6 of US344 itself would make it obvious to do this. Finally, Lilly rely upon the evidence of Prof Martin that humanised antibodies were desired not only for use in therapy, but also for use in diagnostics, as showing that it was obvious to make humanised antibodies.

(This was because Lilly’s legal team had asked Prof Krueger to address it in his first report, and were trying to avoid duplication. As counsel for Lilly acknowledged, this was a mistake on the part of Lilly’s legal team.)

As noted above, it does not particularly matter for Lilly’s purposes which of the items of prior art one starts from, or indeed whether one starts from the common general knowledge that there was a good expectation that targeting IL-17A/A would be effective for treating RA. Lilly’s case is that, even if it was not inevitable that working the prior art would produce antibodies that bound to IL-17A/F as well as IL17A/A, nevertheless obvious methods of working the prior art would do so. </p>

This has led to extensive expert evidence from Dr Tite, Dr Reichmann and Prof Lesk on the one hand and Prof Martin and Prof Carr on the other hand. A number of issues of considerable complexity have been raised. It is Lilly’s contention, however, that, despite the number and complexity of the issues that have been raised, in substance Genentech’s criticisms of the experiments consist of points which do not make any practical difference. Moreover, Lilly contend that, for reasons that will appear, many of the criticisms of the experiments, even if wellfounded, do not prevent Lilly from succeeding in their obviousness case.   </p>

He did so on 26 October 2017. He indicated that the skilled person would proceed by using purified biologically active recombinant human IL-17A/A either for the immunisation of animals and the generation of hybridomas producing IL-17A/A-specific monoclonal antibodies or to select scFv antibodies which bound to IL-17A/A from a phage display library. In the former case the skilled person would then test the panel of resultant antibodies for binding to and neutralising activity against IL-17A/A and select antibodies for humanisation using certain criteria. In the latter case the skilled person would convert the scFv antibodies into full human antibodies. Genentech makes no criticism of Dr Tite’s protocols. It points out, however, that Lilly did not follow the immunisation part of the first two protocols. Nor did Lilly follow the phage display protocols.   </p>

His first main reason was that he did not think that isolated monomer would be an effective immunogen once it had been put in complete Freund’s adjuvant. His second main reason was that it did not appear that the lysate was a very effective immunogen at all. Rather, it appeared that it had mainly served to prime antigen-specific B cells to IL-17A, leading to a greater increase in the numbers of antibodies in the last round of immunisations with the purified protein. In addition, his view was that, owing to the functional criteria that were applied to the antibodies that were taken forward, the particular immunogen that was used to generate them in the first place was less significant. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">This criticism assumes, however, that the skilled person would follow the protocol in the Adair patent rigidly and without modification. Dr Riechmann pointed out, however, that in the Adair paper the authors had mutated H78 and not H71 and H73. Prof Martin’s interpretation of the paper was that what the authors had done was first to mutate all three and then try only mutating H78. Even if that is the correct reading of the paper, however, the upshot is the same, which is that the skilled reader would appreciate that it may not be necessary to back mutate all three residues, consistently with the general principle that one should do the minimum. The same thinking would justify back-mutating only H71 (rather than only H78). Accordingly, I conclude that an obvious possibility would be for the skilled person to be guided by the message of the Adair paper, rather than blindly following the protocol in the Adair patent, and hence to choose only to back mutate H71. </p>

The Queen method involves considering the proximity of the framework residues (FRs), which are different between the donor and acceptor sequences, to the CDRs measured in Ångstrom units. The proximity is determined by measuring the distance between all atoms of a FR residue of interest and all atoms of the CDR residues. If a pair of FR and CDR residues is within a certain distance, it is inferred that they interact with one another and that the FR residue provides structural support to the CDR. Alternatively, FR residues in close proximity to the CDRs may make direct contact with the antigen and contribute. Queen suggests applying a distance criterion of “about” 3Å, and Dr Riechmann chose 3.5Å. </p>

A common method is that of homology modelling, in which a computer program is used to predict the position of each of the residues in the murine (donor) antibody by comparing the sequence of the donor antibody to other antibodies in the PDB and identifying those that are most homologous. Alternatively, the PDB can be searched for antibodies of known structure which are homologous to the murine donor and preferably have equivalent CDR lengths to the murine donor. Distances between the atoms in the models of the predicted or known structure are then calculated. </p>

It follows that the majority of the back mutations are ones that that the skilled team could have chosen to make applying two obvious methods.

Secondly, although Genentech served a response to the Notice of Experiments, it did not notify Lilly that it intended to take a point based on a quantitative comparison between the SPR results until it served its expert evidence in reply.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">As I have explained, it is Lilly’s case that it is inevitable that antibodies to IL-17A/A produced in accordance with the prior art will also bind to and inhibit IL-17A/F. As well as attacking Lilly’s experiments, Genentech relies upon the evidence of Prof Carr as showing that this is not inevitable, but on the contrary it is probable that some IL17A/A antibodies will not bind to IL-17A/F at all and some may not inhibit IL-17A/F even if they bind. If I am right in my conclusions so far, it is not strictly necessarily for me to address this issue. For reasons that will appear, however, I consider that the evidence on it reinforces the conclusions that the claims in dispute are not lacking in novelty, but are obvious.   </p>

The first is that the parties’ cases on this issue were to some extent like the proverbial ships sailing in the night. As explained above, Prof Carr approached the matter as a structural biologist and not as an immunologist. By contrast, Dr Tite approached it as an immunologist and not as a structural biologist. Consistently with that approach to the evidence, Genentech contends that it is the structural analysis that matters, while Lilly contends that it is the immunological considerations which matter. </p>

He pointed out that, as I shall explain in more detail below, Prof Carr had not been instructed to consider what the skilled person would in fact have achieved by working the prior art. Rather, he had been instructed to consider the matter from a theoretical perspective based on current knowledge. Counsel for Lilly submitted that this was the wrong question, of purely academic interest and of no assistance to the Court. I disagree. Prof Carr’s evidence was directed to the issue of inevitability. For that purpose, it was appropriate for Genentech to instruct him in the manner it did.        </p>

Furthermore, he expressed the opinion that even antibodies which inhibit IL-17A/A by an orthosteric mechanism may not bind to and/or inhibit IL17A/F. In his view some antibodies which bind IL-17A/A across the extensive dimer interface and therefore recognise parts of each subunit would be expected not to bind IL-17A/F. This is because of the different residues in, and/or the conformational differences between, the two cytokines. In general, a single residue difference in an epitope can destroy (or at least significantly reduce) antibody binding. Similarly, antibodies which bind to part of a single IL-17A or IL-17F subunit which adopts a different conformation in IL-17A/F may not be able to bind the heterodimer due to those conformational differences. Furthermore, antibodies which can bind only to the A face of IL-17A/F may not be sufficient to inhibit binding to IL-17RA via the F face and inducing signalling (whereas such antibodies would bind and block both faces of IL-17A/A). </p>

It is not necessary for me to consider the various complicated points that were discussed, however, because the bottom line is that Dr Tite accepted that, based on the available evidence about the structures of the IL-17s and their binding to the receptors, it was theoretically possible for there to be antibodies which bound to and inhibited IL17A/A but not IL-17A/F. As he pointed out, however, this begs the question why no such IL-17A/A-only antibody has yet been reported. In his view, there were immunological reasons why such antibodies might not actually be produced. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">For his part, Prof Carr acknowledged that there were at least two areas of uncertainty as to how the antibodies would bind. First, he accepted that the missing information about the A face from the available structure of free IL-17A meant that it was difficult to make predictions about whether antibodies would bind to the homodimer or the heterodimer around the loop region. Secondly, Prof Carr’s response to Dr Tite’s point about the 10-fold higher affinity of the IL-17RA receptor was to point out that it might be the case that the antibody initially bound to the IL-17RC receptor, in which case the affinity would be the same. He also pointed out that it might depend on the concentration of antibody present. It follows in my view that Prof Carr’s theoretical analysis cannot be taken to be conclusive as to what actually happens in practice.       </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Furthermore, when Prof Carr was asked what proportion of antibodies he estimated would bind to IL-17A/A, but not IL-17A/F, he said that it was speculation, but he estimated “may be between 1 in 5, 1 in 25, something like that”. As he accepted, that estimate was based on the top third of the molecule where the most diverse surfaces were, and the ratio of dual binders to sole binders would go up once the whole molecule was considered. It is not clear to me from the transcript whether he also agreed that the ratio would be increased by the functional issues raised by Dr Tite, and I will assume he did not. Even on that basis, it is clear that the great majority of antibodies would bind to both IL-17A/A and IL-17A/F.           </p>

Although Dr Tite accepted that there were some flaws in the exercise, he maintained that it appeared to show that the epitopes were clustered in what he called “hotspots” of diversity between the murine and human, whereas there were other areas that were relatively conserved between the two species. Prof Carr accepted that the evidence from the epitope mapping exercise was consistent with epitope clustering, but considered that it did not provide any positive evidence of it, particularly once one took into account the small size of the sample given that some of the antibodies had been generated by phage display rather than mouse immunisation.      </p>

If not, the claims will be insufficient. (Lilly contend that they would be obvious as well, but I consider that in the present case the objection is more conveniently analysed as one of insufficiency.) </p>

The Court divided 3:2 on this issue. The judgment of the majority was given by Lord Sumption. That case was concerned with a second medical use claim in Swiss form of a known pharmaceutical. The present case is concerned with a first medical use, given that the claimed antibodies were not known, although there are claims framed as second medical use claims both in Swiss form (purpose-limited process claims, namely claim 12 and 20) and in EPC2000 form (a purpose-limited product claim, namely claim 22). There is no dispute that the guidance given by Lord Sumption is applicable, although Genentech contends that it is necessary when applying it to bear in mind the different context.

That may well be a particular risk in the case of patents for new uses of known compounds, especially when they are commercially successful in their existing use. In reality, however, speculative claiming of this kind is simply one of a number of ways in which a patentee may attempt to claim a monopoly more extensive than anything which is justified by his contribution to the art. Other ways in which this can happen include claiming a monopoly wider than the disclosure in the patent can support. An over-broad claim will not necessarily be speculative. The inventor may really have invented something corresponding to the full breadth of the claim. Research may subsequently demonstrate this. But the claim will still exceed his contribution to the art if that contribution is not sufficiently disclosed in the patent” </p>

The disclosure of those grounds marks the difference between a speculation and a contribution to the art. This is in substance what the Technical Board of Appeal has held in the context of article 56, when addressing the sufficiency of disclosure made in support of claims extending beyond the teaching of the patent. In my opinion, there is no reason to apply a lower standard of plausibility when the sufficiency of disclosure arises in the context of EPC articles 83 and 84 and their analogues in section 14 of the Patents Act. In both contexts, the test has the same purpose.  </p>

Secondly, it is common ground that, in considering the plausibility of the claims, the dermatologist would obtain and read the key papers cited in the Patent at [0015]-[0019], in particular the three papers cited at the end of [0019] as concerning the role of IL-17 in psoriasis, but also certain other papers.

Although IFNγ triggers a broader spectrum of activities in keratinocytes, IL-17 enhances the production of IL-6 and IL-8, which are thought to be important mediators of inflammation. Thus IL-17 can also be considered as a pro-inflammatory cytokine. The authors suggest that the synergy between IL-17 and IFN<span style="font-family:'Segoe UI Symbol'"></span> “may probably” occur <span style="font-style:italic">in vivo</span> leading to vigorous production of IL-8 and IL-6 by the keratinocytes in lesional skin.

Prof Prens replied that ACD was thought to be a type 1 T cell mediated disease, a point he was not challenged on. In cross-examination Prof Krueger modified his position and said that ACD involved a mixed response which depended on the genetic background of the animal in question and on whether one was focussing on delayed hypersensitivity or the allergic reaction and that both type 1 and type 2 T cells could be involved. He maintained that Albanesi’s findings would be considered less relevant to psoriasis, but re-iterated his acceptance that it supported the idea that IL-17 induced a limited range of cytokines in keratinocytes and that its effect may be augmented by its reactions with other cytokines. For his part, Prof Prens accepted that ACD differed from psoriasis in that it can often be cured by removing the source of the allergy whereas psoriasis cannot (although, as Prof Prens pointed out, psoriasis can be triggered by an allergic reaction). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.54in;text-indent:0.00in">“The current authors believe that IFN-γ is a pivotal cytokine in the development and maintenance of psoriatic lesions. Fig. 3 outlines a sequential pathway of type 1 T-cell activation, release of T-cell–derived cytokines, and production of several inflammatory mediators that the authors term the type 1 pathogenic pathway. IFN-γ is produced by effector memory CD8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">+</span> T cells, epidermal Tc1, CD4+ T cells, and NK and NK-T cells. Psoriatic CD8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">+</span> Tc1 cell lines and clones have been shown to produce heterogeneous levels of IFN-γ [15]. There is also evidence of the effects of IFN-γ at the tissue level in psoriatic lesions: keratinocytes show increased levels of HLA-DR, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) [27], and CD40 [28]; increased CXCR3 expression on lymphocytes [8]; and greater levels of keratinocyte-derived MIG and IP-10 [8]. Furthermore, this cytokine may also increase expression of costimulatory molecules on DCs [29]. IFN-γ potently activates macrophages and may also induce TNF-α release from monocytes and macrophages, which acts synergistically with IFN-γ in an inflammatory response [30]. Endothelial cells are also responsive to IFN-γ, up-regulating several adhesion molecules, such as ICAM-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), which facilitates the complex process of leukocyte trafficking into tissues. The sum of cytokines and chemokines made in response to IFN-γ and TNF-α (see Fig. 3) can explain many features of the pathogenic process: angiogenesis and vascular ectasia, T-cell and neutrophil emigration into lesions, and some components of the psoriatic epidermal response.” </p>

As Abrams explains, the B7 family of molecules on APCs regulate T-cell activation by delivering antigen-independent stimulatory signals through CD28 and inhibitory signals through CD152 (also known as CTLA-4). CTLA4Ig is a soluble chimeric protein consisting of the extracellular domain of human CTLA-4 and a fragment of the Fc portion of human IgG1. CTLA4Ig had been found to bind to B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) molecules on APCs and thereby block the CD28-mediated costimulatory signal for T cell activation. Biological activity of CTLA4Ig had been demonstrated in a variety of animal models of auto-immunity. In some animal models of auto-immunity, CTLA4Ig not only prevented the induction of an auto-immune process, but also suppressed disease activity late in the course of an established autoimmune response. <span style="font-style:italic">In vitro</span> experiments had shown that CTLA4Ig inhibited, in a dosedependent fashion, the capacity of B7 molecules present on epidermal Langerhans’ cells and dermal dendritic cells to serve as costimulatory molecules for the proliferation of T cells in a primary immune response. Based on this previous work, Prof Krueger and his co-works carried out a Phase I open-label dose-escalation trial of CTLA4Ig in psoriasis patients.   </p>

It was not put to Prof Krueger that this work was inconsistent with his evidence about IL-17.

IL-6 was simply thought to be one of a large number of cytokines potentially implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis whose role was uncertain and which might suffer from redundancy, and so there was little interest in targeting it. As a matter of common general knowledge, there was more interest in IL-8 as a potential therapeutic target; but the skilled person considering plausibility would do a literature search that would lead them to discover that Abgenix had discontinued trials of its anti-IL-8 antibody and to question IL-8 as a therapeutic target. </p>

I would emphasise five points. First, the absence from the Patent of any experimental data concerning the role or effect of IL-17A/F, let alone an anti-IL-17A/F antibody, in psoriasis. Secondly, the absence of any discussion of the role or effect of IL-17A/F in psoriasis. Thirdly, the limited support for IL17A/A (let alone IL-17A/F) having a pathogenic role in psoriasis provided by the papers cited in the Patent, particularly given the common general knowledge as to all the other cytokines which were implicated in psoriasis. Fourthly, the fact that the Patent shows that IL-17A/F is an order of magnitude less potent than IL-17A/A. Fifthly, the fact that the specification claims efficacy against a broad list of conditions which it is wholly implausible that an anti-IL-17A/F antibody (or any form of IL17A/F therapy) would be effective against. Moreover, there is no emphasis on psoriasis in the specification. Such emphasis as there is concerns RA, which the skilled dermatologist would appreciate raised different considerations to psoriasis. In short, the claim of efficacy against psoriasis is speculative.   </p>

Genentech did not in terms rely upon later evidence as supporting its case on plausibility, but did rely upon it in relation to infringement. Accordingly, I shall discuss the evidence relied on in that context. It is convenient to note here, however, that, so far as the evidence goes, no-one has made an antibody which binds to IL-17A/F, but not IL-17A/A, and tested its effect on psoriasis. As the Patent notes, it is theoretically possible that, by binding to IL-17A/F, such an antibody could remove a competitive antagonist to IL-17A/A, thus exacerbating IL-17A/A’s pro-inflammatory effects. Nor is there any evidence that blockade of IL-6 or IL-8 is therapeutically beneficial in psoriasis. Indeed, current evidence suggests otherwise. More generally, as Prof Krueger explained, there is later evidence that inhibition of IL-17A/F has failed as a treatment for three of the indications listed in the Patent, namely (i) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, (ii) asthma and (iii) inflammatory bowel disease. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Lilly also contend that the claims are insufficient because it would be an undue burden on the skilled team to identify human or humanised antibodies that bind and inhibit IL-17A/F, not IL-17A/A (or IL-17F/F). Genentech contends that this insufficiency does not arise on its construction of the claims, since they are satisfied by antibodies that bind to IL-17A/F and IL-17A/A and there is no dispute that the skilled person can make such antibodies without undue burden. I do not accept this. It is well established that the specification must be sufficient to allow the invention to performed without undue burden across the full scope of the claims: see e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc v Genentech Inc</span> [2013] EWCA 93, [2013] RPC 8 at [95] (Kitchin LJ, as he was). Here the claims plainly encompass anti-IL-17A/F only antibodies. If the skilled team cannot make such antibodies, or cannot do so without undue burden, then the claims are insufficient.     </p>

It was common ground between Dr Tite and Prof Martin that the skilled person would know how to do this and that the techniques were routine. Dr Tite’s opinion was that it would nevertheless be an undue burden because it does not appear than anyone has yet succeeded in making such antibodies. Dr Tite accepted, however, that some murine IL-17A/F antibodies which do not bind to IL17A/A have been identified and that are regions of human IL-17A/F which would be expected to generate anti-IL-17A/F only antibodies. Moreover, there is no evidence that anyone has tried and failed. It is possible that such antibodies have been generated, but not made public.  </p>

Dr Kikly accepted that the document was based on information by Lilly and therefore this statement represented Lilly’s understanding at that date. She was not asked about the meaning of this statement, however. In her witness statement, she had referred to tests Lilly carried out to see “whether IL-17A/F was biologically active (i.e. could activate human cell receptors)”, which were <span style="font-style:italic">in vitro</span> tests.

Overproduction of interleukins 17A, 17F, and 17A/F induces the expression of proinflammatory cytokines with pathologic consequences, including the proliferation of keratinocytes and inflammation of epithelial cells in psoriasis. Therapies targeting this pathway, including interleukin-17 and interleukin-17R, are currently under investigation for the treatment of inflammatory conditions, such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis.<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">19,28-30</span> Brodalumab, which targets interleukin-17RA, blocks signalling of interleukins 17A and 17F and the interleukin-17A/F heterodimer, all of which play a role in the inflammation of psoriasis.” </p>

Prof Prens’ opinion was it was therefore it was inherently likely that T cells in psoriasis lesions also expressed IL-17A/F. Prof Krueger’s opinion was that this did not necessarily follow, since there was evidence that some T cell clones expressed IL17A and others IL-17F.    </p>

This shows that differentiated T cells expressed IL-17A/F in significantly higher amounts than either IL-17A or IL17F. Although this was an <span style="font-style:italic">in vitro</span> test, it was common ground between the experts that differentiated T cells are an approximation to how T cells present <span style="font-style:italic">in vivo</span> in peripheral organs (such as skin) respond after secondary stimulation. Prof Prens considered that this supported the hypothesis that T cells in psoriatic lesions expressed IL-17A/F.

Genentech bears the burden of proof on this question, and it has not carried out any experiment to establish that there is such a contribution (but nor has Lilly established by experiment that there is not). Counsel for Genentech accepted that there was no evidence which clearly established the position one way or the other. He nevertheless submitted that, on the available evidence, it was more likely than not that it did. Having regard in particular to the Liang paper, I accept that submission. </p>
