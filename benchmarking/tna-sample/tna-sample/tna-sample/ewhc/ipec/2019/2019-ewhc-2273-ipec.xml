	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">On 5 May 2005, the Claimant, Volumatic Limited (<span style="font-weight:bold">Volumatic</span>) and the Defendant, Ideas for Life Limited (<span style="font-weight:bold">IFL</span>) signed a document (the <span style="font-weight:bold">Agreement</span>) relating to the design and production of a banknote pouch (the <span style="font-weight:bold">Pouch</span>) to fit Volumatic’s cash counting machines. Although I have adopted the parties’ nomenclature for that document as “the Agreement”, what in fact was agreed by and in that document is the subject matter of these proceedings. The Agreement included a requirement that “all property rights” in the Pouch be assigned to Volumatic. By these proceedings, Volumatic alleges that the Agreement was binding on the parties, and seeks specific performance of that term.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">It is common ground that the expression “all property rights” includes a number of patents, hence Volumatic’s action can be said to have been properly brought in the Intellectual Property Enterprise Court, even though no issues of intellectual property law fall to be decided. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">Applying an objective test, in my judgment, the parties did not intend the Agreement to be legally binding. It was a document designed to record the consensus reached at the Warwick Meeting – both parties conceded that the Warwick Meeting had no legal effect. Whilst the document is signed, this was done, in my judgment, not to create legal relations, but for the purposes of the parties recording the consensus – the signatures indicate the agreement of both sides that the document accurately expresses what was agreed in Warwick. This is recognised in the Agreement itself, where it records “It is recognised etc”. The Agreement is, in my judgment, no more than that. As summarised by Mr Amos in his email of 16 March 2012, the Agreement “best captures the substance of what both companies hoped to achieve”: it was not intended to create legal relations. The heavy burden that IFL set out to prove has been met. In reaching this conclusion, I have been mindful that a lack of terms of economic or other significance does not necessarily negate an intention to create legal relations. I am also mindful that there could be an intention to create legal relations even where further agreements were contemplated. But on its terms, viewed objectively, the Agreement was not, in my judgment, intended to create legal relations.  I agree with IFL’s submission set out in paragraph 21(a), (b), (d) and (f) above.  The arguments advanced by Volumatic, summarised in paragraph 22 above, are not inconsistent with my findings – it is not unusual that a set of minutes would be reviewed by lawyers, and even so, the use of </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">Each party argued that the behaviour of the parties following the signing of the Agreement supported its suggested interpretation – Volumatic saying that the parties largely carried out the terms of the Agreement, whilst negotiating variations, and IFL saying that the parties carried on as if the Agreement was not binding. Mr Tilley cautioned me in looking at subsequent conduct, and I accept his position on that front: what is relevant is the intention of the parties at the time the Agreement was entered into. Mr Tilley therefore cautioned me against relying on later comments by Mr Amos, who was not at Volumatic in May 2005. I agree. But that does not resolve the issue. The clear documentary evidence was that no-one involved suggested that the Agreement was binding until the email of Mr Amos of 18 October 2016, long after several sets of legal advisors had been involved on each side. Meanwhile, the parties carried on as if the Agreement was not binding, with neither party seeking to rely on its terms, including important terms such as price, royalty rate and payment terms. Also, whilst many documents were disclosed in the proceedings, and many emails were in evidence, none of them suggests that the Agreement was binding until Mr Amos’ email of 18 October 2016. To the extent Mr Amos suggested in his second witness statement that other statements were made orally, I do not accept that. When asked in crossexamination, he could not recall specific conversations, but rather relied on the notion that the issue must have come up. Rather, I conclude from the absence of such documents that the subsequent conduct over a period of more than 11 years, up until 18 October 2016, was entirely consistent with the Agreement not being binding.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">I have found above that the Agreement merely records the consensus of the parties at the Warwick Meeting – and I have found that that is how they behaved following the signing of the Agreement. It was not treated as a binding agreement. No-one sought to enforce its terms. No-one called for, or provided, the £20,000 referred to. Volumatic did not call for an assignment of the patents. The 10p per Pouch aim was never achieved. The royalty rates fluctuated, without reference to the Agreement. It was not until late 2016 that either party suggested that the Agreement was binding. In my judgment, this is sufficient to create an estoppel by convention. There was, in my judgment, a common assumption communicated by conduct which “crossed the line” – both parties acted on the basis that the Agreement was not legally binding, and it would now be unfair, unjust and unconscionable to go back on that shared assumption. I find, and do so clearly, that the prejudice submitted in paragraphs 36 (a) and (d) above is made out. I say more below in relation to the prejudice summarised in paragraphs 36 (b) and (c). I accept that the five factors set out by Briggs J (as he then was) in <span style="font-style:italic">Revenue &amp; Customs Commissioners v Benchdollar Ltd </span>[2010] 1 All ER 174 and the four factors set out by Joanna Smith QC at paragraph 113 of <span style="font-style:italic">First National Trustco </span>have been made out on the facts of this case. Parties who act for 10 or more years on one legal basis cannot then turn around and suggest something contrary to that basis. Therefore, had I found that the Agreement was binding, I would have found that Volumatic is now estopped by convention from asserting its terms.   </p>

His argument was that the Agreement records the consensus of the Warwick Meeting; in Volumatic’s summary of that meeting, the £20,000 payment came first; this was within the background knowledge of the parties; therefore that is the only interpretation open to the Court.  I disagree.  Mr Johnson’s summary of 7 February 2005 was never signed by the parties. The Agreement was.  It stretches too far the guidance in <span style="font-style:italic">Lukoil</span> to suggest that an earlier, unsigned document trumps the language of a later signed one.

Adopting the text of Stage 2 of the Agreement, following mutual acknowledgment, “IFL will assign”. That assignment is said to be “subject to a noted charge”, and the charge, not the assignment, is “based on” Volumatic’s “honouring the terms below”. Thus, the intellectual property is assigned and charged, and IFL may rely on the charge to enforce Volumatic’s compliance with the three requirements. If Volumatic fails to perform, then the charge bites.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">IFL’s construction sits less well with the language of the Agreement, and with business common sense. If Volumatic is first required to provide a 10 year royalty payment, that would suggest that the intellectual property does not have to be assigned until the end of the 10 year period, as paragraph 1 will only have been complied with at that time. Alternatively, if Volumatic complied with paragraph 1 of Stage 2 by entering into a 10 year royalty agreement then IFL would have the benefit of the charge to enforce it – but that is not what the clause says. Similarly, DFL having the rights to exclusive manufacture for 10 years would not be known until the end of a 10 year period - the Agreement does not mandate a separate agreement.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">Further, the charge over the intellectual property makes less sense on IFL’s construction. For example, if the requirement is that the £20,000 be paid prior to assignment, and the amount is paid, then the charge is not necessary to ensure that Volumatic “honour[s] the terms below in full”, as it will already have done so by making the payment. Any offset of the £20,000 against future royalty payments is to Volumatic’s benefit, not IFL’s, and so IFL does not require the charge to enforce any on-going “honouring” of that term.  I accept, as Mr Popplewell submitted, that the charge helps to enforce the other two requirements, but, again, that is not what the Agreement says.   </p>

I cannot see any justification for this submission on the language of the document or in the wider context. On the terms of the Agreement, following mutual acknowledgement (that is, conclusion of development and testing of the Pouch), IFL was obliged to assign the intellectual property in the Pouch. If Volumatic was unwilling to move forward with the immediate payment, royalties and exclusive manufacture, IFL’s remedy was through its charge over the transferred intellectual property.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">Volumatic conceded that the £20,000 “immediate” payment was never made. I do not accept Volumatic’s argument that payment of royalties adding up to £20,000 over the next several years in effect complied with the requirement. Nor do I accept that IFL needed to call for the payment, or that IFL is estopped from asserting that Volumatic has failed to provide immediate payment. If IFL’s construction of the condition precedent is correct, IFL was entitled to immediate payment on mutual acknowledgment. That payment having never been made, Volumatic would not have satisfied the conditions precedent, therefore there can be no obligation on IFL to transfer the intellectual property in the Pouch. Similarly, I do not accept that a 10 year relationship that, in the end, turned out to have been exclusive is the same as a 10 year exclusive manufacturing agreement: the latter would have given IFL certainty. In any event, Volumatic was very clear that it was not prepared to enter into a 10 year exclusive manufacturing agreement, then, later or now. I also do not accept Volumatic’s argument that, as IFL owned the relevant patents, it in effect had an exclusive agreement anyway, as any third party manufacturing the Pouch would have infringed the patents. There is a difference between enforcing an exclusive manufacturing agreement and enforcing a patent (not least because patents are not worldwide). In my judgment, there would have been value to IFL/DFL in an exclusive manufacturing agreement, which it never had.  </p>

Volumatic, on the other hand, said that I should take into account the ongoing negotiations over the past 10 years, the lack of urgency to regularising the ownership of the intellectual property, the uninterrupted supply of Pouches and the continuing commercial relationship between the parties. Whilst noting that 11 years is a long time, Volumatic’s behaviour, it said, was reasonable.  </p>

I have found that Volumatic has not complied with any of the three requirements set out in Stage 2.  Could it do so now? Volumatic’s own evidence was clear – there was not in 2007 and there is not now a willingness on Volumatic’s part to provide DFL with a 10 year exclusive manufacturing agreement. Mr Amos’ evidence in the witness box was clear – Volumatic was not at any time since 2005 willing to enter into a 10 year exclusivity agreement, because it had been advised by its then legal advisors not to. Thus, some 10 years later, it does not matter whether 10 years would be a reasonable period or not: Volumatic remains unwilling to enter into a 10 year exclusivity agreement, despite the fact that it has now purchased Pouches only from DFL for 10 years. So whether a reasonable period was 3 months or 10 years does not matter – Volumatic’s case on this issue still fails.  </p>

One account is that Mr Bonné said “in the millions”. Another account is that Mr Bonné said “10 million pouches per year”. Mr Williams suggested that he understood Mr Bonné to mean that the figure would be achieved in a year. I do not need to decide exactly what was said by Mr Bonné because it does not matter - it is clear from the evidence before me that IFL/DFL did not rely on this statement, whichever version of it was made. It was not written down at the time (or even mentioned in any written correspondence), nor was it (or any other reference to quantity) included in the Agreement or in any of the other documents passed between the parties at the time. In my judgment, it was no more than the overly enthusiastic puff of an entrepreneur: IFL/DFL appreciated that and did not rely on it. </p>

In those years, sales had been slow, and orders were in the hundreds of thousands – considerably short of “millions” or “10 million”. IFL/DFL were aware of Volumatic’s customer base, and aware that IFL/DFL did not have customers with requirements anywhere near those levels. IFL/DFL knew that a significant number of new customers would be needed in order to achieve sales of those levels. Further, 10 years later, as the business has grown steadily, annual orders remain at a quarter of the 10 million figure. Further, Mr Williams told me candidly from the witness box that he would never have been able to make 10 million Pouches had they been ordered, and certainly would have been unable to ramp up production to be able to make 10 million Pouches within a year.  </p>
