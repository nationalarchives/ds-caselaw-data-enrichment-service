The Second Defendant, Mr William Storey, is the director and sole shareholder of the First Defendant. The Third Defendant, Staxoweb Limited, is a digital marketing company founded by Mr Sean Kelly, who is a childhood friend of Mr Storey. The Defendants say Mr Storey commissioned the Third Defendant in May 2015 to design a brand identity for the First Defendant and that Mr Kelly, working with the Mr Storey, designed a logo (“D1’s Logo”) of which a stag’s head device is a substantial part (“D1’s Device”). It is not disputed that the First Defendant has used D1’s Device in the course of its business since it was incorporated in September 2015.  </p>

The court undertakes a visual comparison of the two designs, noting the similarities and the differences. The purpose of the examination is not to see whether the overall appearance of the two designs is similar, but to judge whether the particular similarities relied on are sufficiently close, numerous or extensive to be more likely to be the result of copying than coincidence. It is at this stage that similarities may be disregarded because they are commonplace, unoriginal or consist of general ideas. If the plaintiff demonstrates sufficient similarity, not in the works as a whole but in the features which he alleges have been copied, and establishes that the defendant had prior access to the copyright work, the burden passes to the defendant to satisfy the judge that, despite the similarities, they did not result from copying.  </p>

There are many cases where dishonesty is suspected but there is insufficient material for a party to plead it. The Claimant submits that this is one of them.  </p>

It is only then that a court may properly be invited to, and may make, an evidential finding that such a witness was indeed dishonest. This is part of the court’s ordinary adjudicative function. In this case, the facts from which dishonesty may be inferred are clearly set out in the pleadings and arise from the cause of action. The Claimant pleads that the Defendants have copied C’s Device, and the Defendants deny any familiarity with the Claimant or C’s Device and deny copying it. It is for the court to sift and evaluate the evidence to determine the case. The court’s hands will not be tied in the manner that the Defendants seek, by the fact that dishonesty has not been pleaded. </p>

Again, what is meant by authentic? The Defendants say the Brand Document was created in July 2018 and finalised in August 2018. That was not challenged and is deemed to be authentic in as much as that is the deemed date of creation. The CAD renderings were stated to be created in July 2015. Those are unchallenged and deemed to be authentic. The “Finals Rich Logo” page dated 25 June 2015 is not challenged and is deemed to be authentic, although I have found it is made up of sketches which predate it and whose dates of creation are not known. The various separately-disclosed pages of the Brand Document are dated the same as the Brand Document and to that extent they are authentic, inasmuch as those pages were created on that date, albeit they are not what they were presented as being when disclosed or in the RFI Response. The hand-drawn sketches from 2015 have never been disclosed, only scanned images which, on Mr Kelly’s evidence, were digitised in 2018 and have in some cases, he accepts, been manipulated since then by mirroring and cleaning up.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.00in">I have compared the two devices side by side. Although they are not identical, they are strikingly similar. D1’s Device looks like C’s Device. It is only on a closer inspection that certain differences reveal themselves, in particular the additional smaller two tines, and the thickening of the inner tines. I remind myself that <span style="font-style:italic">Designers Guild</span> posits as a first step a visual comparison of the two designs. The small differences in height of the antlers and specific angles are not noticeable on a strictly visual, side-by-side comparison, only on a measured analysis. The similarities are not merely that both have a triangular head, splayed antlers and inner tines which I agree are commonplace in representation of stag’s head logos. It is the unusual proportions of the pointed, triangular face; the elegant pointed antlers; the placement of the inner, angled antlers; and the specific manner in which this stag’s head is highly reduced and simplified; which can be seen in both C’s Device are D1’s Device.  In my judgment, these similarities are sufficiently close, numerous and extensive to be more likely to be the result of copying than coincidence. I am also satisfied that there is sufficient evidence of the possibility of access by the Defendants to C’s Device, because C’s Device was available on the Claimant’s website from as early as 2010; and the evidence of both Mr Storey and Mr Kelly is that in 2015 they looked at “hundreds” of stag head logos for inspiration. Together, I am satisfied that there is a strong prima facie presumption of copying which shifts the burden to the Defendants to satisfy the court that, despite the similarities, they did not result from copying, because of lack of actual access or because D1’s Device was independently created. </p>

In my judgment, people take selfies with all sorts of celebrities, whether they are interested in their achievements or not. Mr Farrant in cross-examination confirmed that Mr Cavendish does not ride the Claimant’s bikes, is not sponsored by the Claimant and does not ride in events in which the type of bikes that the Claimant makes may be used. As a British Olympic Medallist and past winner of BBC Sports Personality of the Year I accept that Mr Cavendish’s celebrity extends beyond the world of road and track cycling. Mr Storey is interested in boxing and so Rich Energy provides some boxing sponsorship. It does not appear to have any presence in the world of cycling. I do not think this takes me any further. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.60in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.00in">It is clear from Mr Storey’s oral evidence in relation to the Rich Energy can design, as acknowledged by Mr St Quintin in closing, that he has very little idea of what copyright is and no idea of the difference between copyright and trade marks, even after going through this litigation process. I have no doubt his state of knowledge was worse, not better, in 2015. In my view, it is therefore no argument for the Defendants to ask why he would be so careful about trade marks and less careful about copyright, when it appears that he did not understand them to be different. It may be that he and Mr Kelly simply thought that C’s Device was a great logo, and that it was one from a company sufficiently removed from their own business not to notice or complain about their copying, or that it did not attract copyright protection. Perhaps they thought that trade mark clearance was all that mattered. I cannot know. Certainly once they had obtained legal advice, their initial response to the letter before action, continued through the defence and up to Mr St Quintin’s skeleton argument lodged before trial, was that C’s Device was too simple and banal to attract copyright protection. They now accept that it is not.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.00in">Similarly, Mr St Quintin asks why Mr Kelly would make a number of sketches of different designs, and a number of renders of different designs, as I accept he did in June and July 2015, if he had copied C’s Device? I accept Mr Wyand’s submission that the fact that he produced several other designs for consideration (whether those were variations of C’s Device, or different simple geometric designs, or indeed curved renders quite different to earlier sketches) does not mean that the one Mr Storey chose was not a copy. It may be that they tried to create an original logo, but Mr Storey kept coming back to the inspiration logo he liked best. It may be that some of those other renders are copies of other existing logos. Again, I cannot know. However I am satisfied that the consideration of a variety of designs is not inconsistent with the final design chosen being a copy. </p>

First, both Mr Kelly and Mr Storey say that sum encompassed not only brand development but also a wider marketing strategy including developing, launching and maintaining the Rich Energy website. It does not all relate to logo design. Secondly, question marks remain in my mind about that invoice, which contains the Third Defendant’s VAT number on the top but does not include VAT. Mr Kelly was asked why this was, and confirmed that his company was registered for VAT at the time, but had no answer to give. </p>

The case of <span style="font-style:italic">Infopaq</span> related to the storage and printing of an extract of a work comprising only 11 words of the whole.

I consider the originality of C’s Device to be evidenced by the fact that despite the extensive searching that both the Defendants and the Claimant have carried out in 2018, neither has been able to find another stag’s head logo which has anything close to the level of similarity to C’s Device as D1’s Device displays, although almost all have general ideas of outer and inner antlers and a number display a triangular or triangular-shaped head.  </p>
