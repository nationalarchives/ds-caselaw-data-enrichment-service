Paragraph 1.5 of the Intellectual Property Enterprise Court Guide of July 2016 makes clear that the Judges of IPEC are able and willing to sit outside London if the parties wish it and inform the court in good time for arrangements to be made. The parties in this case asked for it to be heard in Birmingham for their convenience and the court was able to accommodate that request. I do not know why it has taken so long, but I hope that it is the first of many IPEC trials to be heard elsewhere in England and Wales. </p>

Dr Davies’ evidence is that more than 100,000 professionals and others have attended courses provided by the First Claimant, of which about 20,000 attended Raid Courses. He says the First Claimant employs circa 100 clinical and educational psychologists on a consultancy basis to deliver such courses. Dr Davies’ evidence is that the First Claimant has continually run RAID Courses, which have been the top selling courses for the First Claimant and its predecessors in title, for the last 30 years. He described the RAID Courses as <span style="font-style:italic">“the core of the First Claimant’s business”</span> and responsible for circa £300,000 of the First Claimant’s annual turnover.</p>

Dr Davies expressed his admiration for the work that the Defendant was doing within the D’s RAID Service, and made clear to the court that the Claimants have no desire to prevent that work continuing. They just wish it to continue under another name.</p>

In my judgment he did not give his evidence in a straightforward manner to assist the court with the facts as he remembered them, but rather I felt he sought to provide evidence which would best support the Defendant’s defence. He was somewhat argumentative in oral evidence and strayed into advocacy. For example, he repeated various ‘talking points’, even though he was not asked about them and I do not believe they have direct relevance to the issues: e.g. that the training the Defendant provided did not result in the issuance of certificates or accreditation; and that the training could not be ‘formal’ because the staff chose the topics themselves.   </p>

I found this evidence impossible to reconcile with the significant number of speeches/presentations, papers and other training-related documents relating to the D’s RAID Service disclosed by the Defendant to the Claimants during these proceedings. Not all of those have been placed in the bundle, but a selection of them have. I have considered them carefully and discuss them, and his evidence, later on in this judgment.  </p>

He then considered the previous authorities set out at paragraph 54 in his judgment, to see whether they assisted him on the point. He considered that only <span style="font-style:italic">Google France SARL v Louis Vuitton Malletier SA</span> (Joined Cases C-236-238/08) [2011] Bus LR 1 at paragraphs 51-58 provided such assistance.

To use the language of the Court of Justice in the Google France case… it is not use as part of (or even preparatory to) a commercial communication with a third party. Thus Google’s use of the signs complained of in the Google France case was neither infringing use, nor use that would suffice to maintain a trade mark registration for those signs.

Data on the three key areas of length of stay, reduced admissions and admission avoidance was independently collected an analysed to identify cost savings. It was found that RAID: Reduced the length of stay by 21,509 bed days over 12 months with an associated cost saving of around £4.5 million; Reduced admissions by 1,800 admissions over 12 months saving approximately £5.4 million; Saved £454,500 through admission avoidance with 202 patients being identified as not requiring admission to the medical assessment unit (MAU). Those patients received a reduced tariff of £750 rather than the £3000 an admission would have cost… the RAID service in City Hospital demonstrated that for every £1 spent, £4 could be saved. In recognition of the pilot’s success in improving patient care and substantial savings that it had created for City Hospital, funding was found to promote the adoption of the model across the West Midlands Region. In the Birmingham area, funding for the RAID service is now provided by Birmingham’s three acute hospitals and the pan-Birmingham Commissioners. There is now a RAID service established in every acute hospital in Birmingham and Solihull and in 2014 it was reported that 27 organisations nationwide had taken up RAID. In its 2014 document “Achieving Better Access to Mental Health Services by 2020”, the Department of Health highlighted strong evidence that the RAID model can deliver clinical and cost-effective care to patients with a range of mental health problems”. </p>

He said that his impression was that <span style="font-style:italic">“the Defendant was providing mental health services under the sign RAID and promoting these widely”.</span> He said that until then, the First Claimant had been the only organisation operating in the mental health sector which had utilised the term RAID, and it had spent a considerable amount of time and effort building up its reputation. Dr Davies said that he also found evidence online that the Defendant was providing training. He described what he saw as provision of shorter courses at a lower level than the First Claimant’s RAID Courses which concerned him as he thought it risked his RAID methodology as provided on the RAID Courses appearing to provide a less significant intervention than it is.</p>

Professor Tadros in cross-examination said that this training had not been in the way of a course, but by hands on clinical training given while he and other medical professionals were seeing patients. He said that he collected evaluation forms from each person involved in this ‘hands-on’ training during the pilot programme, but stopped collecting such forms after the pilot. I have no other evidence to support his contention that the evaluation forms related only to clinical training. However, in my judgment, training which requires participants to complete an evaluation form to assess the quality of that training is formalised training, whether provided in a clinical environment or not. </p>

The Evaluation Poster itself identifies that more advertising of the training programme is required. I also consider that it is supported by the inherent probabilities: I find it inherently implausible that the D’s RAID Service, which appears to be highly organised, very well run, achieved measurable successes and has been replicated in a number of other NHS Trusts (as discussed below), would not have a formalised training and evaluation programme of the type so succinctly yet comprehensively described in the Evaluation Poster.  </p>

Although the result is much the same, this does not mean that where a serious allegation is in issue the standard of proof required is higher. It means only that the inherent probability of the event is itself a matter to be taken into account when weighing the probabilities and deciding whether, on balance, the event occurred.”</p>

I consider it unlikely that: training courses were run at least three times over two years; evaluated on at least one occasion; promotional/advertising information material based on the training and evaluation was produced in the form of the Evaluation Poster; and the Evaluation Poster was published by the RCOP website; without Professor Tadros knowing about any of it. He could provide no explanation for how or why Dr Johnson could or would carry out such extensive training and evaluation work within the Birmingham Hospitals without informing him, merely saying <span style="font-style:italic">“she no longer works for the Defendant”.</span> I do not consider that to be a satisfactory answer.  </p>

The Claimants asked the court to reopen the trial, allow Professor Tadros to file a witness statement dealing with the issue if so advised, and then be recalled for crossexamination. The application was listed before me on 8 November 2018 and after hearing from counsel for both parties, I dismissed it.  I then put it out of my mind.

Dr Davies’ accepted that there was a distinction between liaison and forensic psychiatry, but said that the RAID Courses were applicable across the board. He said <span style="font-style:italic">“The idea is that when working with difficult and challenging behaviour, it is better to play it down so far as safety allows and work on developing adaptive and helpful behaviours so they displace challenging behaviours. It can be applied wherever you like. It could be in a forensic setting but absolutely not exclusively a forensic setting”</span>. His evidence, which I accept, is that the First Claimant’s RAID Courses are attended by health care professionals from both within and outside the NHS, most of whom are employed at the level of healthcare assistant or qualified nurse, but some of whom are clinical psychologists and psychiatrists. </p>

Joseph Okanlawon, HCA, said <span style="font-style:italic">“The RAID training has definitely afforded me with the opportunity of better understanding of how to approach patients on my ward with extreme behaviour with ease.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.00in">Dr Davies’ evidence is that the professional mental health sector is a small community and the Claimants work with some of the same people as the Defendant appears to be targeting for the D’s RAID Service. Professor Tadros accepts Dr Davies’ characterisation of those working in Mental Health as a relatively small community, but says that it is a discriminating one and well informed. He does not consider that there is any possibility of confusion between the D’s RAID Service and the RAID Courses, and is not aware of any instances of actual confusion where anyone has thought that the D’s RAID Service was provided by or linked to the Claimants. I accept his evidence. </p>

The rules and procedures of IPEC are intended to prevent arguments being sprung upon one party by another a late stage. This was made at the last possible stage, without warning to the Claimants, which I consider was prejudicial to them as Ms Blythe was left in her reply trying to leaf through the bundle, find examples of where the Defendant’s Sign <span style="font-style:italic">simpliciter</span> was used, and make submissions on the hoof about whether they could or could not be said to be used as defined terms.

These lines are, she submits, wholly nondistinctive and would go unnoticed and be given no significance by the average consumer. If I am not with her on that, then Ms Blythe submits in the alternative that the Defendant’s Sign in stylised form is highly similar to the Registered Trade Marks: the differences are merely banal and wholly unimportant visual ones and the distinctive and dominant element of both marks, the word ‘RAID’, is identical.  </p>

If the stylisation consisted merely of use of the commonplace sans-serif all-capital font, with shadowing, with or without the addition of colour to the font, I would likely be persuaded on the point. However, I consider that the addition of the rays emanating from, and slightly obscuring the shape of, the letter ‘D’ are sufficiently distinctive that they would not go unnoticed by the average consumer (described later in this judgment) who, I remind myself, is reasonably observant.  </p>

Accordingly the overall impression is of key importance. In my judgment, those rays lift the Defendant’s Sign in stylised form out of identity with the Registered Marks, because the overall impression of the Defendant’s Mark in stylised form is that the rays are at least as dominant as the ‘RAID’ element, and more distinctive than the ‘RAID’ element. This is particularly the case in the coloured version, but I am satisfied it is also true of the monochrome version also used by the Defendant.  </p>

They used our RAID training and then their service was based on that. In my mind the training and service is inextricable. There is no point providing training unless it manifests itself in a service. It is applied psychology, not an academic exercise. The whole point is it is part of the service.” </span>Professor Tadros accepted that training was a necessary support for the D’s RAID Service. That importance is emphasised in the training materials and many of the speeches and presentations in the trial bundle. I am satisfied that it is artificial, as I think Ms Blythe put it, to sever one from the other. If the training and healthcare service are inextricably linked and necessary for each other, which I have found that they are, then it follows that that I am satisfied that the D’s RAID Service, which has as an integral and necessary part of it mental health training, is similar to the services the subject of the Registered Trade Marks, as it overlaps to a material extent with them.   </p>

I agree that the incorporation of the ‘rays’ element from the Defendant’s logo into the Defendant’s Sign in stylised form appears to form part of a cohesive brand strategy across the Defendant’s logos which increases the effect of the Defendant’s use of the Defendant’s Sign on the origin function of the Registered Trade Marks to the Claimants’ detriment. </p>

I accept Dr Davies’ account of his telephone call with the lady three years ago, but he has a very poor recollection of that conversation and so it is not possible for me to determine the extent of her confusion (or even if she was confused at all, or had merely got hold of the wrong telephone number when trying to contact the Defendant about its RAID Service). There is very little that I can do with it. Similarly, I can see a review on the First Claimant’s website from a Ms Young that appears to show that she thought the NHS had provided the RAID Course she attended (which the Claimants rely on as “wrong way around” evidence of confusion), but I cannot not know whether this had anything at all to do with the Defendant’s use of the Defendant’s Sign, or not. It may be no evidence of confusion at all. In my judgment I cannot place any weight on either of these accounts. </p>

The Defendant’s RAID Service launched as a pilot in September 2009 and was in each of the Birmingham Hospitals out of pilot by the end of December 2014, when the RAID Network was launched. It appears to have been extremely successful and highly publicised. Even on launch, the RAID Network had some 27 other NHS Trusts interested in what it had achieved. There has been opportunity for confusion to show itself. However I do accept that confusion about whether the First Claimant or the Defendant had run some training courses could have occurred but not been reported to either party. This is particularly so, in my judgment, given that both the First Claimant and the Defendant appear to be highly competent at what they do, and so any confusion is unlikely to have given rise to complaints.  </p>
