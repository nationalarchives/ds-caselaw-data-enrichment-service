She has designed over 2300 such cards, many of them involving swatches of fabric decorated with beads, sequins and/or stitching. Images of some of her cards appear later in this judgment. It is alleged that copyright in Mrs Fields’ card designs (the “Works”) has been infringed by Saffron Cards and Gifts Limited (“Saffron”). It is also alleged that the sole director and shareholder of Saffron, the Second Defendant Mr Paul Steele, is jointly and severally liable for the infringing acts of Saffron.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:0.00in">For present purposes, the allegedly infringing greeting cards fall into two groups: the first, which I will call Group A, are cards designed by Mrs Fields and produced and sold by Saffron after 21 March 2016, the date on which the Claimant, Mei Fields Designs Limited (“MFD”) terminated the licence it had with Saffron for Saffron to produce cards designed by Mrs Fields.  The second, Group B, are cards designed by Saffron’s designers which are alleged to be infringing copies of cards designed by Mrs Fields.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:0.00in">Saffron and Mr Steele both deny copyright infringement. In relation to the Group A cards, Saffron’s main argument is that ownership of copyright in Mrs Fields’ cards never sat with her, and so MFD does not own the relevant copyright, and cannot bring these proceedings. The bulk of the two day trial was taken up with the ownership issue. In short, MFD says that Mrs Fields designed the cards and assigned the copyright to it. The Defendants say that when Mrs Fields designed the cards, she was employed by Metropolis Worldwide Limited (“Metropolis”) and that Metropolis therefore solely owned the copyright in the cards. Alternatively the Defendants say that, as a director of Metropolis, Mrs Fields only holds any copyright on trust for Metropolis. In the further alternative, the Defendants say that Mrs Fields created the cards together with various employees of Metropolis, and so any copyright is jointly owned with Metropolis. In any event, the Defendants say that Metropolis sold its intellectual property to Saffron in 2014 and that therefore MFD no longer holds any enforceable rights in such property.  The ownership issue arises only in relation to cards produced by Mrs Fields prior to 23 December 2013.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:0.00in">MFD also alleges that 12 Group B cards created by Saffron in 2014 are unlawful copies of Mrs Fields’ designs. Saffron admits that it had access to Mrs Fields’ designs, and took the idea of a swatch of fabric attached to a card, but Saffron says that the cards simply are not close enough to infringe any copyright. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:0.00in">Further, Mr Steele says that whilst he was the sole director and sole shareholder of Saffron, he was not sufficiently responsible to be jointly liable for copyright infringement. This is important for MFD because earlier this year Saffron divested itself of most of its assets, so no longer has sufficient assets to meet any judgment against it for copyright infringement. </p>

On the same day that MFD was incorporated (10 April 2012), a document was signed purporting to be an assignment to MFD of all copyright owned by Mrs Fields in the cards she had designed and in all future cards (the “10 April 2012 Document”). The legal effect of that document is in dispute. On 12 April 2012, MFD entered into two licence agreements as licensor, one with Metropolis and one with Swan Mill Paper Company Limited. A Metropolis board minute of 17 April 2012 also mentions the set up. </p>

Mr Steele incorporated Saffron on 12 December 2013 as a corporate vehicle to own the assets acquired from Metropolis. Saffron entered into a licence with MFD on 23 December 2013 (the “Licence Agreement”) under which Saffron would produce cards to designs licenced from MFD. The Licence Agreement is clear on its terms that MFD owns all copyright in the designs created by Mrs Fields. Mr and Mrs Fields were paid out on the termination of their employment with Metropolis as at 31 December 2013. Whilst it was originally intended that Mr Fields be employed by Saffron as a sales director, that was not in the end pursued by Mr Steele. </p>

Three criticisms were made of her evidence. First, it was said that when pushed on some of the key details of her evidence, she was evasive and not willing to accept obvious points. Second, it was said that her evidence on her “understanding” of copyright ownership was “wholly unreliable” and “untrue”. Third, she was criticized for not having produced any design documents for the designs in issue. I return to the first two of these matters below, but in my judgment, Mrs Fields was a reliable witness. She gave her evidence frankly and carefully. Her oral evidence was consistent with her written testimony, and with that of other witnesses. She maintained her position in the face of a skilful and sustained attack on her credibility in cross-examination. She did not always recall events of some years ago, but she accepted this. I do not accept the criticisms of her evidence.  In relation to the third criticism, I do not accept that Mrs Fields was required to adduce her design documents, given the way in which the Defence was pleaded.

Again, I do not accept these criticisms, to which I will return below. Mr Fields was excluded from the courtroom whilst his wife was cross-examined. He, too, was skilfully cross-examined by Mr Moss.

She gave evidence of her design process, and how she “[went] out of [her] way to progress new swatch based greeting card ranges”. MFD’s counsel criticised Mrs Marsh as an unreliable witness, suggesting that she was trying to protect Mr Steele. Counsel for MFD said that Mrs Marsh often looked at Mr Steele in court before answering. Two inconsistencies in her evidence were highlighted: the whereabouts of her own design drawings (whether they were disposed of, or kept in six or so folders) and the process by which beads were chosen in India. A further criticism of Mrs Marsh was that she had not provided her design drawings for any of the allegedly infringing Group B cards. Having had the benefit of seeing Mrs Marsh giving her oral testimony, she was, in my judgment, trying to do her best, but against a background of attempting to refute allegations that she and another Saffron designer, Ms Mandy Manley, had copied cards designed by Mrs Fields. At times, she was keener to defend herself than to answer the question put to her. Her evidence was also at times internally inconsistent. Where Mrs Marsh’s evidence is inconsistent with the documentary evidence, I prefer the documentary evidence. It therefore follows that I do not accept her evidence on a number of issues, to which I return below.</p>

Each defence contained another, which contained another. Pleading and disclosure issues were raised. Four contracts required interpretation. This all occupied court time, such that counsel had to cut themselves short in dealing with issues. Indeed, unusually for a copyright case, I was never actually taken to the allegedly infringing cards at issue in these proceedings. As HHJ Birss QC (as he then was) set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Comic Enterprises Limited v Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation</span> [2012] EWPCC 13 at paragraph 49, a party taking advantage of the IPEC needs to “trim its case to focus down on the essentials”. This means being realistic about what points ought and ought not to be taken to ensure there is sufficient court time to assist the court on all the main issues to be determined. It is as a result of how the case was run that this judgment is longer than would normally be desirable.    </p>

In my judgment, it is quite understandable that a CVA Proposal of this sort would not mention the various licences that Metropolis had entered into to obtain the rights to produce various cards. The evidence was that there had been, over time, various licences, none of which was mentioned in the CVA other than the initial licence from the BBC in relation to “Walking with Dinosaurs”. There was no evidence that such things ought to have been mentioned, and Mr Armstrong, the joint administrator of Metropolis who was therefore well placed to comment on what would or would not normally be included, was not asked about it. The Defendants’ case on this point was no more than an assertion made in the Defence and again in counsel’s skeleton argument. It seemed to me that, far from being “crucial”, consistently with MFD’s pleaded Reply, this whole issue was irrelevant to the proceedings.</p>

Further, the Defendants’ counsel noted that the case law relating to traditional “master/servant” relationships is less helpful in circumstances of small, family-run businesses such as this one, where, in effect, the master is also the servant: both Mr and Mrs Fields were directors (masters) and employees (servants) in the business.

One feature which seems to me to run through the instances is that, under a contact of service, a man is employed as part of the business and his work is done as an integral part of the business: whereas under a contract for services his work, although done for the business, is not integrated into it but is only accessory to it.”</p>

In answering this question, no strict rules can be laid down as to the relative weight which should be attached to the various considerations which apply. As already stated, the degree of control is important but no longer regarded as the determining factor. Other factors which may be important are whether the person provides his own equipment, hires his own helpers, what degree of financial risk he takes, what degree of responsibility for investment and management he has, and whether and how far he has an opportunity of profiting from sound management in the performance of his task. A genuine freedom to do the job either oneself or using a substitute negates the obligation to do the work personally and is inconsistent with employee status…Evaluation of the position is not a mechanical exercise of checking off the various factors but of evaluating the whole picture painted from the accumulation of detail.” </p>

Both believed that her card designing was outside the scope of her employment.  Mrs Fields explained clearly what her role as Design Director did include: pricing, sales performance, quality assurance, promotional materials, website development, exhibitions and preparing products for presentation at annual sales meetings. It did not include designing cards. She withstood questioning in cross-examination that she was a “design director who didn’t design”. In that context, it does not help the Defendants that Mrs Fields was paid a salary, that she was grouped within payroll records for the “art department”, that she was employed by Metropolis full time, or that she said that she was “in charge of product development”.  Nor does it assist to classify Metropolis as a design business as opposed to a licensing and marketing business. These facts are entirely consistent, in my judgment, with the position as Mrs Fields explained it. Nor does it assist the Defendants that Mrs Fields gave no evidence on how she “switched hats from being a Design Director one minute to not being one the next”.

In my judgment, this is a different situation to that which was before the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Credit Suisse</span>: there, summary judgment was based on a clause of the lease that had not been pleaded at all. Here, the “understanding” has been pleaded, and pleaded specifically, albeit that the relevant section of the CPDA has not been mentioned. That was remiss, but it is not fatal. </p>

But on its terms, issue 1 clearly goes beyond the question of joint ownership, because it refers to copyright being owned by Metropolis individually. If Metropolis employees contributed to the design of the copyright works, Metropolis would be a joint owner. It would only be if Mrs Fields had designed the cards in the course of her employment and there was no agreement to the contrary that copyright in the designs could be owned individually by Metropolis. The agreement to the contrary therefore stands to be decided.</p>

As set out above, I do not consider that that amendment is necessary. It does little to add to what is already in MFD’s Reply.

It is likely that the facts relevant to each determination overlap in full or in part, and, indeed, are similar to the facts relevant to the determination (below) in relation to the duties of a director.

He found that there was a contract of employment, and hence section 11(2) applied, but that there was no agreement to the contrary. That is not the case here.

In my judgment, this was no more than operating a scanner: the employees assisting Mrs Fields scanned the images and cleaned them up – they did not use sufficient skill, labour or judgment when doing so to qualify as joint authors.  Ms Dorange gave clear and unchallenged evidence as follows:</p>

Ms Dorange’s evidence was that she simply did what Mrs Fields told her to do. In my judgment, and meaning no disrespect to Metropolis’ junior designers, in this context, they were the equivalent of scribes. They were following Mrs Fields’ instructions. They demonstrated skills in using the scanner, and the computer programs in which they worked (Photoshop and InDesign). But they were not joint authors of the designs in the cards. It therefore does not matter that Mrs Fields is only now (in 2018) learning how to use Photoshop and InDesign. </p>

The Defendants’ counsel specifically (and quite rightly) rejected the notion that joint copyright was owned by the Indian entity, or by those assisting in the assembly of the cards. Similarly, no joint authorship rests with the printer who printed the cards.</p>

It was clear from the evidence that the junior designers employed by Metropolis did do design work – on catalogues, the website, and, indeed, other card ranges. It is therefore clear to me that the junior designers were at times designing for Metropolis. But this does not mean that the work they did on Mrs Fields’ greeting cards was design work. The only one of them to give evidence was very clear that she merely did as she was told, like a scribe or amanuensis.  There was no collaboration, no sufficiently substantial contribution, no personality of the author.   </p>

The court must consider the contract as a whole and, depending on the nature, formality and quality of drafting of the contract, give more or less weight to elements of the wider context in reaching its view as to the objective meaning of the language used. <span style="font-style:italic">If there are two possible constructions, the court is entitled to prefer the construction which is consistent with business common sense and to reject the other.</span> Interpretation is a unitary exercise; in striking a balance between the indications given by the language and the implications of the competing constructions, the court must consider the quality of drafting of the clause and it must also be alive to the possibility that one side may have agreed to something which with hindsight did not serve his interest; similarly, the court must not lose sight of the possibility that a provision may be a negotiated compromise or that the negotiators were not able to agree more precise terms. This unitary exercise involves an iterative process by which each suggested interpretation is checked against the provisions of the contract and its commercial consequences are investigated. It does not matter whether the more detailed analysis commences with the factual background and the implications of rival constructions or a close examination of the relevant language in the contract, so long as the court balances the indications given by each.”</p>

If an assignment, it should not also mention licensing or termination. If a licence, then the word “assignment” is misplaced. It is certainly not clear on its terms what it means. I must therefore look at the commercial context and ask myself which interpretation is consistent with business common sense. In doing so, I have come to the conclusion that the document is an assignment, because that is the interpretation more consistent with the commercial consequences. MFD went on to licence Ms Fields’ card designs to third parties. These licences are not expressed to be sub-licences. Whilst some of the words of the document are inconsistent with that interpretation, interpreting it as an assignment does less violence to the main claim “I … transfer ownership of copyright” than interpreting the document as a licence. </p>

As I have found above that MFD owns copyright in these cards, then it follows that any cards sold following the termination of the Licence Agreement infringed MFD’s copyright, and I so find. If I am wrong in that, then it is beyond contention that MFD owned copyright in cards designed by Mrs Fields after the winding up of Metropolis. Copyright in these cards could never have been owned by Metropolis.

Mrs Marsh tried to explain this by suggesting that the entity Saffron used to make the swatches in India would only use the beads etc that they were used to: this contradicted her earlier evidence that she could have designated whatever beads etc she wanted to on the sketch. I prefer her earlier explanation – which she later repeated. In designing Met 5017, I accept that Mrs Marsh and Ms Manley could have written down whatever beads they wished (for example, Mrs Marsh accepted that she could have designated gold rather than silver beads). I therefore find that the stark similarity in beads etc is a result of copying Mrs Fields’ Met 2536 design. This is reinforced by the annotation on Met 5017 that the “silver flower sequin” was “Used previously on Met 2536”.  It follows that I reject Mrs Marsh’s evidence to the extent that she said that she did not copy Mrs Fields’ designs. She and Ms Manley may well have been attempting to “design-around” Mrs Fields’ earlier design. But the similarities are, in my judgment, too great to have been accidental. </p>

Mrs Marsh was cross-examined, but she did not provide an adequate or consistent explanation for the lack of any design documents relating to Adorn and Couture greeting cards at issue in these proceedings. In my judgment, there is sufficient evidence to find that copying took place – as Mrs Marsh accepted, elements of Mrs Fields’ designs were “carried over” into Saffron’s designs.  This finding is reinforced by the Group B cards themselves.  They are simply too close to be the product of independent creation.

Counsel for MFD submitted that copying the text was enough – as the changes Mrs Fields made to the standard Edwardian font are an expression of her skill, creativity and judgment.

	      </a>, where an allegation of joint tortfeasance is raised against an individual who is the sole shareholder and director of the company, in effect there is evidential burden on the person to explain why the court should not assume that he or she personally carried out the acts of the company which are complained of in the proceedings. In this instance, I had the opportunity to ask Mr Grainger whether any other person took any significant role in the running of the first to third defendants. He said very fairly that while he took advice, including professional advice, from others about the running of the companies, the buck stopped with him, and that he took all significant decisions. That being so, it seems to me that Mr Grainger is liable as a joint tortfeasor.”</p>

This would take things to September 2014. It was in September 2014 that his family’s health issues began. The uncontested evidence from both sides was that greeting card ranges take at least six months to prepare from initial planning to product launch. The Adorn and Couture ranges were launched in October 2014. Therefore, it is clear on Mr Steele’s own evidence that he had “thrown [himself] into the business” at the time that the Adorn and Couture ranges were being designed and developed that is, in the six months prior to October 2014. Ms Manley’s sketch for Met 5017 is undated, but the first set of revisions is dated 29 August 2014. Mr Steele’s time away from the office to assist with his family issues had not yet begun – he was, on his own evidence, still deeply involved in the business at this time. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:0.00in">The position is similar in relation to the Group A card designs that Saffron continued to sell after the Licence Agreement was terminated on 21 March 2016. The shift of onus set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Grenade</span> is engaged.  Mr Steele has not put forward a positive case of one of Saffron’s employees reaching the decision to continue selling Mrs Fields’ designs. Mr Steele was responsible for negotiating the Licence Agreement. He understood its terms. He was aware of its termination. It can have been his decision alone to continue to sell cards the subject of the Licence Agreement after its termination. This was clearly a major decision – and all the evidence (including Mr Steele’s) was that no major decision was made at Saffron without Mr Steele’s say so. I accept Mr Steele’s evidence that his family and health issues were on-going at this time. But he did say that he still went into the office (indeed, his evidence was that he usually attended three days each week), and he did have access to email. It is inconceivable that it did not occur to him in light of the termination of the Licence Agreement that he needed to stop selling the licenced products, and he does not suggest that this was the case. Indeed, there are in evidence several emails authored by Mr Steele from around that time that deal with the issues. He was clearly aware of what was going on, and driving Saffron’s decision making at that time. Therefore, in relation to the Group A infringements, I find that Mr Steele made the decision to keep selling Mrs Fields’ designs. He is therefore liable as a joint tortfeasor.  Again, he actively co-operated to bring about the acts of Saffron and he intended that his co-operation would help bring about those acts.  </p>
