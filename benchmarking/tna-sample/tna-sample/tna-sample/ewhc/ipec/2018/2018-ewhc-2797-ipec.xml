	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.22in;text-indent:0.00in">Catheters are inserted into the patient’s urethra to assist in the emptying of the bladder.  An important feature is its ability to slide as easily as is possible through the urethra giving minimum discomfort and without damaging the urethra walls.  It was known to coat the relevant part of the catheter with a hydrophilic surface layer.  Immediately prior to use this layer was exposed to what the Patent calls ‘a liquid swelling medium’, causing the layer to expand and impart a very slippery character to the catheter and thus facilitate insertion.  Typically the liquid swelling medium is water.  For brevity I will hereafter refer just to water, save in the case of one item of prior art in which the liquid swelling medium is a drug solution. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.22in;text-indent:0.00in">Urinary catheters were divided into two relevant types.  The first, indwelling catheters, consists of catheters which remain in the urethra for a prolonged period, possibly some weeks.  They are used for patients who are infirm or who are undergoing either surgery or other lengthy treatment in hospital.  They are administered by nursing staff and require a means to fasten the catheter securely in place for the period required. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.22in;text-indent:0.00in">The second type are ‘intermittent catheters’.  These are used for a one-off insertion to empty the bladder, generally several times a day, after which they are removed and very often discarded without reuse.  Intermittent catheters are usually administered by the patient themselves at home or elsewhere outside a hospital.  Ease of insertion and removal is therefore of particular importance for intermittent catheters. </p>

Yet it was not in doubt that the addressee would have known that catheters come in two varieties and the words of the claims did not specify just one of them.  Of course, claims must be construed in the context of the specification as a whole.  Had there been, for instance, a definition of ‘catheter’ in the specification, that would have been decisive.  There was none.  Moreover, this is not an instance in which a term of the claims is ambiguous.

In September 1997 Astra was the biggest player in the urinary catheter market, followed by Coloplast.  At that time the most used intermittent catheter in Europe, and possibly beyond, was an Astra product called ‘LoFric’.  It had been launched in 1983 and was the first urinary catheter to have a hydrophilic coating.  LoFric is still on the market today.

Coloplast may have been the first to overcome such barriers leading to the launch of Coloplast’s SpeediCath.

First, adding water was fiddly, especially for patients with limited manual dexterity.  Second, some patients disliked waiting for 30 seconds for the coating to become fully hydrated.  Third, filling catheter packages with water led to spending a long time in a toilet cubicle and this led to embarrassment.  Ms Cahill went on to say in her expert report that in the years leading up to September 1997 she and her colleagues had repeatedly told the catheter manufacturers that patients wanted a catheter package with the right amount of water contained in the package or a catheter that required no preparation and which could be used as soon as the package was opened. </p>

I reconcile their evidence by concluding that Ms Cahill and her colleagues did tell Astra, among other manufacturers, that patients would welcome a catheter package containing water but that at the brainstorming sessions referred to by Ms Israelsson it was not thought to be an idea worth following up.

One of the main concerns was the need for water to activate the hydrophilic coating of the catheter.  Water can be messy but a greater difficulty arises when the end user is away from home or travelling.  In such circumstances the end user had not only to rely upon facilities with water being available, but also facilities that are accessible and reasonably hygienic.

The executive summary does not convey the key point identified by Mr Svanum, namely that in around 1995 and 1996 the main concern among end users was that they wanted a catheter kit with water and that this was known to Coloplast. </p>

Categories 2 to 9 were categories of documents mentioned by Mr Svanum in his evidence in the PCC Action plus certain other documents.  Mr Austen, for MacGregor, told me that the documents disclosed in the PCC Action were all contained in two or three boxes held by Bird &amp; Bird, the solicitors who had then acted for Coloplast, and that consequently there would be little cost to Coloplast in providing them. </p>

It was not until I came to write the judgment that I noticed that Mr Svanum’s evidence in the PCC Action had established that there must be other documents held by Coloplast which were highly relevant to this issue.  In fact the analysis of February 1995 gave an impression quite different to that of Mr Svanum’s evidence in the PCC Action and the apparent effect of these undisclosed documents.  After I had handed down a draft of this judgment, I raised the matter with counsel.

By the time of the trial, and probably well before that, it was clear to the parties that the key issue of fact to be resolved at the trial was whether Coloplast and other manufacturers of catheters knew in September 1997 that users of intermittent catheters wanted a wet-stored catheter.  If so, it was likely that by inference the skilled team would have been aware of the idea of a wet-stored catheter at that date as part of their common general knowledge.  In opening Dr Baran went so far as to submit that the three cited items of prior art did not advance MacGregor’s case on the common general knowledge (Day 1, p.12).  In other words, Coloplast had taken a very clear view that MacGregor’s case was going to stand or fall on whether the idea of a wet-stored catheter was known, irrespective of argument over the cited prior art. </p>

Mr Svanum’s report strongly implies that those documents would have revealed that by September 1997 Coloplast knew that users wanted a wet-stored catheter.  Mr Inman did not state otherwise and has not lifted the suspicion.  His statement suggests rather that given the way the case management conference went, Coloplast was advised that highly relevant documents need not be disclosed.  I make two observations. </p>

The overriding objective, including making sure that the case is heard fairly, must always take precedence.  Notwithstanding the IPEC rules, an application for disclosure should be pursued, even after the CMC where appropriate, if it is based on solid evidence, i.e. more than speculation however keenly felt, that documents likely to shed light on an important issue are held by the opposing party.  However, such applications must be as narrowly focussed as is reasonably possible.  Part of the difficulty over disclosure in the present case may have been a lack of focus by MacGregor. </p>

Even if the skilled team did not contain such a developer and were interested only in intermittent catheters, to the extent that the structure and function of the two types of catheter overlap, new information about indwelling catheters in the area of overlap would have been of interest to a skilled developer of intermittent catheters.

The further features of claim 3 over claim 1 were that (a) the catheter as a whole is made of a gas impermeable material and (b) the package is formed from two sheets of the material connected by a gas impermeable joint.  Mr Torstensen said that Rødsten discloses the first of these and that the second is inevitable if aluminium-plastic laminates are used to make the package.  He was not challenged on this.  Ms Israelsson said nothing in her report about claim 3 being inventive over claim 1. 138.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>Coloplast did not allege that there was anything separately inventive in claim 5 139.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>Claims 3 and 5 lack inventive step over Rødsten. </p>

MacGregor argued that the Patent explained the known idea of a water-stored catheter but did not inform the reader how to make such a thing – how to overcome the technical difficulties. </p>

Mr Torstensen said that it was apparent to the team that a catheter packaged in water would require complex and lengthy research work and that such work was beyond the capability of the team. According to Mr Torstensen the known hydrophilic coatings were not suitable for storing the catheter in contact with water.  He also said that the gas impermeable packaging would require the use of electron beams as a means of sterilisation and that this tended to cause the hydrophilic layer to lose its low friction character. </p>

A new catheter would also be required as PVC swells when immersed in water for any length of time.  The product would need a shelf life of 3 years.

He said that finding a suitable hydrophilic coating was only regarded as a ‘major development’ because Coloplast had no specialist knowledge of its own in the field of hydrophilic coatings.  He added that that for environmental reasons and because Coloplast’s supplier of uncoated PVC catheters was developing a rival product, Coloplast decided to find a non-PVC alternative.  He suggested that nonetheless the existing EasiCath PVC catheter could possibly have been used to make a catheter assembly as claimed. </p>

Mr Torstensen accepted that of the many coatings disclosed by this document, the preferred coating was polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP).  The significance was that Ms Israelsson had said that in the course of the Astra trials, during which there was simulated storage of the catheter in water for 1-2 years, a catheter dipped in PVP had proved satisfactory.
