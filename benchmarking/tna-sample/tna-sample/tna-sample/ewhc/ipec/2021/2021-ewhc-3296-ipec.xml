Its case is that, in around February 2015, it started selling a high visibility jacket under the mark “mercury” and that, shortly afterwards, it expanded its use of that mark to high visibility rugs for horses and dogs and high visibility leg boots for horses. It says that, as a result of its activities, it acquired goodwill in the mark. </span>

It sells predominantly to trade customers (its stockists) through its websites at www.battles.co.uk and www.hy-equestrian.com. Non-trade customers can also look at those websites to identify stockists from whom they can acquire Battle’s products. The stockists themselves may also advertise Battle's products which they are looking to sell on.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">At some point, Battle started selling various products (a mobile phone holder, a gilet and a jacket) under the label “HyVIZ Silva Mercury Reflective” (the “HVSMR” label). For present purposes, the precise date when this happened is not particularly material, although the documents suggest that it was in late 2018 rather than in February 2019, as suggested in Battle’s Skeleton Argument for the trial. Battle’s activities came to Equisafety’s attention at some point in 2019 (again, the precise date is not material) and, on 6 June, Ms Fletcher emailed Battle demanding that it stop such use. On the following day, 7 June 2019, Equisafety applied to register the word “mercury” as a UK trade mark. The registration was duly made on 25 October 2019 as trade mark No. 3405069 in respect of the following goods:</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Having become aware of this, Ms Fletcher issued proceedings on 30 October 2019. She did so initially in her own name and in the small claims court. In March 2020, the case was transferred to the Intellectual Property Enterprise Court and the Claim Form was amended to substitute Equisafety as the claimant. Its claim is that Battle’s activities amounted to passing off and, insofar as they occurred after 7 June 2019, to infringements of the Mercury trade mark under each of s.10(1), 10(2) and 10(3) of the Trade Marks Act 1994. The Defendants deny this and counterclaim for a declaration that the mark is invalid under s.47(1) of the Trade Marks Act 1994 because it had been registered in breach of s.3(1)(b), s.3(1)(c), s.3(1)(d) and/or s.3(6) of that Act (i.e. that the word “Mercury” was devoid of distinctiveness, was descriptive, had become customary and/or had been registered in bad faith).</span>

However, as it did not admit liability for its past acts and as Equisafety points to some subsequent instances of use of the HVSMR label, the action has continued. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Equisafety relied on the evidence of Nicola Fletcher, its sole shareholder and director. A number of criticisms were made of her as a witness. One was that she had set out to deceive people by causing Equisafety to make and sell a range of high visibility products using the word “POLITE” in a way that resembled a “POLICE” sign. I reject this criticism. I cannot see that this involves any meaningful deception of anyone or that it is of any relevance to this case. As Ms Fletcher said, such products simply cause drivers to reduce speed – thereby protecting horses, riders and, indeed, drivers and there was no evidence to suggest that the police have any concerns about these products. Another criticism of Ms Fletcher was that she caused Equisafety to apply for a trade mark in respect of goods which it had no intention of selling. I will deal with this when addressing the bad faith issue but I do not see it as a reason to doubt her evidence. Yet another criticism was that Ms Fletcher had written to Battle’s customers asserting that Battle had admitted infringement of the Mercury trade mark when, in fact, it had simply agreed to stop using the Mercury sign without any admission of liability. Whilst I accept Ms Fletcher’s evidence that she had genuinely thought that Battle was admitting liability, it does seem to me that this reflects a tendency in Ms Fletcher to be rather single minded in her views about Equisafety's rights. Despite this, I found her to be a good witness who was seeking to assist the court and who gave clear evidence with regard to matters within her knowledge. However, as will appear, there are occasions where I have felt unable to rely on assertions which she makes but which are unsupported by other evidence. </span>

I will return to the significance of this later. Another criticism was that his statement contained material (especially as regards the allegation of bad faith) that was more in the nature of submissions drafted by his lawyers than of evidence of facts known to him. Again, I have borne these matters in mind where relevant, but I do not see them as reasons to doubt Mr Dewey’s evidence on matters within his knowledge and I find that he too was an honest witness seeking to assist the court. </span>

It may be that the average consumer would be aware that mercury is a metallic substance and has the properties referred to in the above dictionary definitions. However, I do not accept that this means that the average consumer would easily recognise, let alone would immediately and without further reflection, regard the use of the word mercury in the present case as being descriptive of any characteristic of the relevant goods. The goods are not made from mercury and the mere fact that mercury (the substance) has a silver-white appearance and can be used in reflective surfaces does not mean that products with that appearance or qualities are or are likely to be described as mercury products. Indeed, in an email dated 22nd April 2015 to Equisafety's Chinese manufacturers, Ms. Fletcher referred to “the Mercury gilet, it is made from reflective silver fabric”. Similarly, in a packing list sent to Battle by its Chinese manufacturers and on the swing tags for Battle’s HVSMR products, the colour of those products was described as “Reflective silver”.</span>

Whilst Mr Carter accepted that that of itself would not be objectionable, he submitted that it became bad faith here because Equisafety was using the word mercury descriptively and because such use had been “staggeringly inconsistent” and had not given it any unregistered rights in the word. In this regard, he pointed to the fact that Equisafety’s Mercury products had been marketed as part of its “NightRider” range and of its “Charlotte Dujardin Collection” but that there had never been a Mercury range as such.

Given this, I do not accept that the average consumer would see the application to register the mark as a departure from accepted standards of ethical behaviour or honest commercial and business practices. Further, given the existence of s.3(1)(b) and (c), there is no need to stretch the meaning of bad faith under s.3(6) to cover a situation where a person applies to register a mark that turns out to be descriptive.</span>

Such an applicant is entitled to say "I am using the mark for specific goods falling within description X. I have no idea precisely where my business in goods of that description will develop in the next 5 years, but there will undoubtedly be more such goods than there are now." Such an applicant would always be forced to accept that there was no prospect whatsoever that it would use the mark for every variety of goods within the description. Such an applicant could not, however, be accused of bad faith in the light of its strategy for applying for protection of sufficient width to cover some further, as yet unformulated, goods within the same category. For this reason, I consider that the concession (see [102] above) that an applicant with but one item of computer software can apply in good faith for computer software as a whole to have been correctly made. It follows that the absence of a commercial rationale or strategy, if by that is meant a plan under which the mark is to be used for all goods or services within a category of the registration, is not relevant to the enquiry about bad faith.”</span>

Equisafety argues that Battle’s sign (if not identical) “could not be more similar” to the registered mark. In contrast, Battle argues that if there is any similarity at all it is at “a vanishingly low level”. In my judgment, the truth falls between these two extremes and I find that the average consumer (particularly bearing in mind the element of imperfect recollection) would see Battle’s sign as being moderately similar to the registered mark. This seems to me to follow from the obvious visual and aural similarities that clearly exist given that the word mercury is a part (and not an insignificant part) of Battle’s sign. There seems to me to be less conceptual similarity given that Battle’s sign overall conveys the concept of a high visibility, silver  coloured, reflective product whereas the mark Mercury conceptually does not point to a high visibility, reflective product but rather to a product with unusual (mercurial), god-like or even celestial but unspecified qualities.</span>

Against this Equisafety argues that the phone holder is at least moderately similar to the registered “Protective caps for cameras”. I agree with Equisafety. The registration for goods in class 9, taken as a whole, is clearly intended to cover goods that provide protection against injury or accident, including, as the reference to protective caps for cameras shows, injury or accident to a camera. In my judgment, a reflective case for a mobile phone is a similar product. </span>

In reaching this conclusion, I reject Mr Carter's submissions that the average consumer would be taken by the unusual spelling of the words “Hy VIZ” and “Silva” and by their earlier positioning within the HVSMR sign such that those words would dominate the overall impression of the HVSMR sign with the result that “no, or vanishingly little distinctive weight” would be attached to the word mercury. In my judgment, although Battle has used the word “Mercury” as part of the HVSMR sign or of the Silva Mercury sign, given the essentially descriptive nature of the words “Hy VIZ”, “Silva” and “Reflective”, I find that the average consumer would take notice of the word “Mercury” and would regard it as being of some trade mark significance. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I have concluded that there was a likelihood of confusion given the inherent distinctiveness (and non-descriptiveness) of the Mercury mark in relation to this type of goods. However, Equisafety also argued that that likelihood of confusion was increased by the distinctive character that the Mercury mark had acquired by reason of the uses it had made of it. In this regard, I have not been provided with any evidence regarding the size of the market in high visibility products for the equestrian market nor of Equisafety’s share of that market, although I am told that its highest annual turnover was £484,858 in 2018. Indeed, somewhat unhelpfully, Equisafety has redacted any information that might help determine the volume of its sales of Mercury products. Similarly, although I am told that Equisafety’s advertising spend is around £35,000 a year, I have no information as to what part of that figure relates to the Mercury mark. Nevertheless, I accept that the evidence before me is sufficient to establish that Equisafety’s use of the Mercury mark since 2015 has given that mark a distinctive character and that this increases the likelihood of confusion arising from Battle’s use of the word mercury. I also accept Equisafety’s case that that evidence is relevant even though it relates to uses made of the word Mercury before the application to register it as a trade mark.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In the first place, Equisafety’s Mercury products were referred to reasonably extensively in various equestrian publications in 2015, 2016 and 2017. This was in the form of advertisements placed by Equisafety in respect of its “new Mercury range”, its “BEST SELLING Mercury Range”, its “New Charlotte Dujardin Collection”, and its “Autumn/Winter 2018/19 collection” all of which included pictures of the Mercury jacket and/or of other Mercury products. There were also various product reviews of Mercury products under headings such as “Hi-viz that's set to shine!” (Equestrian Trade News, September 2015), “What a brilliant jacket!” (Equestrian Trade News, January 2016), “Equisafety – Mercury Jacket” (May 2016), “Look great, stay safe” (Your Horse, winter 2016), “Shine Bright - Stay Safe” (Equi-Ads, January 2017) and “Illuminating ideas” (Equestrian Trade News, February 2017).</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Also significant is the evidence of Equisafety’s Mercury products and the Mercury mark being referred to and promoted by Equisafety on Facebook and Instagram. As early as 2015, Equisafety's Facebook adverts for its Mercury jacket were attracting hundreds of “likes” and, by January 2016, this had risen to 2,323 “likes”. Ms Fletcher's evidence (which I accept) was that Equisafety has over 2,200 followers for its Instagram page and more than 57,880 likes and 58,683 followers for its Facebook page. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Against this, Mr. Carter pointed to the fact that Equisafety’s Mercury products had been marketed as part of Equisafety’s “Night Rider” range or of its “Charlotte Dujardin Collection”. This was certainly true in some (although not all) occasions. However, I do not agree with Mr Carter's conclusion that this shows that Equisafety’s use of the Mercury mark had been “staggeringly inconsistent” nor do I accept that this prevented the Mercury mark acquiring a distinctive character. The brand of an individual product can clearly be distinctive of that product, even though that product forms part of a wider range of products with its own separate brand. Mr Selmi’s example was of the Samsung Galaxy. Here, the marketing described above was clearly of products under the Mercury mark and was capable of giving that mark a distinctive character of its own.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Moreover, in my judgment, the distinctive character of the Mercury mark would have been very significantly enhanced by Equisafety's sponsorship of Charlotte Dujardin, which started in 2016. As the average consumer in this case would have been very well aware, Ms Dujardin is probably the leading dressage rider in the world and Equisafety used her name and picture extensively in its marketing materials. Whilst Ms Dujardin’s role was not limited to the Mercury products, the Mercury Jacket was marketed as part of Equisafety's “Charlotte Dujardin collection” and pictures of her in Equisafety's marketing materials between 2016 and December 2018 were usually of her wearing a Mercury jacket and seated on a horse wearing a Mercury rug and Mercury leg boots which products were often specifically captioned as being Mercury products. The evidence also includes an Instagram post by Ms Dujardin herself, featuring a photograph of her wearing a Mercury jacket and the comment </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">“as the nights are drawing in, do check out the Mercury range created with my sponsor @equisafety”</span>
	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">. Whilst this particular post (made on 22 October 2019) came after most of the events complained of, it demonstrates the impact of and value attached to Ms Dujardin’s name as it attracted 13,993 “likes”.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I should note that, in her evidence, Ms. Fletcher also relied on Equisafety’s sponsorship of a number of other very well-known riders.

Ms Fletcher’s evidence was that these events included the British Equestrian Trade Association (BETA) show, the Blenheim Horse Trials, the Badminton Horse Trials, the Cheshire Horse Show, the Blair Castle International Horse Trials, Your Horse Live, the West Country Christmas Show, the Horse of the Year Show in Birmingham and the London Horse Show at Olympia. I see no reason not to accept this evidence, particularly given the photographs produced showing some of these stands. In two of these photographs, a large scale advertisement for the MERCURY JACKET can be seen and in others products from the Mercury range are clearly on display and sale.</span>

However, it is difficult to place too much weight on this evidence given that Equisafety has not provided any evidence as to the level of sales to these retailers.</span>

The difficulty with this is that I have no evidence to assist me in determining what proportion of that turnover or of that decline related to Equisafety's Mercury products. Similarly, Ms Fletcher's evidence was that online sales of Equisafety’s Mercury products dropped by 50% in the period 2019/2020 compared with the period 2018/2019.

However, I have seen nothing to support these assertions.

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">For the same reasons, it seems to me that Battle’s defence based on s.11(2)(b) of the Trade Marks Act 1994 must fail. That defence only applies to signs or indications which are not distinctive or which concern the kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose, value, geographical origin, the time of production of goods or of rendering of services, or other characteristics of goods or services. Moreover, it only applies where the use is in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial matters. Here the word mercury was distinctive and was not being used descriptively. Nor, given my conclusions regarding the issues of unfair advantage and due cause, was its use in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial matters.</span>

Similarly, I have not been influenced by Ms Fletcher’s assertion that Battle has a reputation for copying the designs of other companies, or by the comments apparently made in this regard by certain employees or former employees of Battle. Without direct evidence from any witness from those other companies or from any of those employees or past employees, I am not in a position to make any findings in relation to this assertion. </span>

Understandably this led Equisafety to believe that Battle was not abiding by its undertaking. However, I accept Battle’s case that it had taken extensive steps to try to have references to mercury removed from its products and that ultimately it had no right to control the activities of its stockists. In any event, this seems to me to be something of a red herring. Battle may not be liable for the separate marketing and sales activities of its stockists, but it is liable for using the word by affixing it to the packaging of those goods in the first place and for exposing and offering them for sale to and via those stockists (see s.10(4) of the Trade Marks Act 1994).  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">It was common ground that, in order to succeed in a passing off claim, Equisafety must establish the elements of goodwill, misrepresentation and damage. On the basis of my findings above, I find that Equisafety had clearly acquired goodwill in the word mercury used in relation to high visibility equine products and that it had done so well before Battle started using the word for its products sold under the HVSMR label. I also find that that use by Battle clearly involved a misrepresentation that those products were derived from or connected in some material way with Equisafety. Finally, I find that such use inevitably resulted in damage to Equisafety. For these reasons, I accept Equisafety’s case that Battle’s activities amounted to passing off.</span>

As mentioned above, insofar as Battle’s actions took place before 7 June when Equisafety filed its application to register the mark, they cannot constitute infringements of the registered Mercury mark. By contrast, given my findings above, Battle’s uses of the mercury word all took place after Equisafety had acquired goodwill in the word in relation to high visibility equine products and are, therefore, capable of amounting to passing off.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Equisafety’s case is that Mr Dewey is Battle’s managing director and a shareholder in it, that he is its controlling mind and is heavily involved in its activities with overall responsibility for various departments. Ms Fletcher believes that Mr Dewey is likely to have played a role in the matters complained of. In this regard she points to the fact that he had been actively involved with her in 2009 to 2010 regarding a product design that he asked her to create for Battle and to the fact that he attended trade shows at which Battle was marketing its HVSMR labelled products and to the fact that he actively liaises with Battle’s customers.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">. It is true that Mr Dewey is Battle’s managing director and, on any basis, a significant shareholder in the company. However, Battle is a reasonably large company with 140 employees and there must be acts which it does but for which he cannot be held responsible. Whatever the position in relation to Mr Dewey’s involvement in the development of a product in 2009, there is no evidence to show that he was actively involved in decisions about new product ranges in 2018 either generally or specifically in relation to the products in issue here. Indeed, Battle’s internal emails after receiving Ms Fletcher’s email of 6 June 2019 suggest that Battle’s use of the word mercury was not something of which Mr Dewey had previously been aware and, given the scale of its operations, this is not as surprising as it might at first appear. Whilst the same cannot be said of the position after June 2019, there is still no evidence to link Mr Dewey personally to Battle’s continued uses of the word Mercury about which Equisafety complains. </span>
