	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.40in;text-indent:0.00in">Cormeton Fire Protection Limited, the Claimant, has since 1967 been in the business of providing mechanical fire protection solutions (including fire extinguishers). In 1989, to expand its business into electronic fire protection solutions (such as fire alarms), the Claimant teamed up (to use a neutral term) with Mr John Aitchison, the Second Defendant. Cormeton Electronics Limited, the First Defendant, was registered as the corporate entity to run this new endeavour from the Claimant’s premises. All went well. In 2003, the First Defendant, requiring more space, moved out. Both parties continued to trade under names which included the word CORMETON, and used similar logos. While there were some reports of alleged confusion (to which I refer below), the parties continued to cross-refer work to each other, and were on good terms. This changed in or about 2015, when the parties fell out. In 2016, the Claimant applied to register the word CORMETON as a trade mark. Following pre-action correspondence, these proceedings were commenced in 2019. The Court is thus required to address the issue of two businesses which have traded in similar fields and under similar names for a long period of time, and which used to work together but which are now hostile to one another. In short, the Court is asked to determine who gets to use the word CORMETON, and for what goods and services.   </p>

As various male members of the Warburton family are mentioned in the evidence before me, I will use first names to differentiate them: in doing so, I mean no disrespect. Michael Senior gave evidence that the business now operated by the Claimant was started in 1967 by his father, Mr Robert Warburton Senior.  Robert Senior named the business CORMETON – a portmanteau word combining elements of CORROSIVE, METAL and the family name, WARBURTON. Michael Senior’s brother, Mr Robert Warburton Junior, took over the business in 1968, and Michael Senior took over day-to-day operations in 1974. In 2014, Michael Senior’s son, Mr Michael Warburton Junior, took over the day-to-day operations of the business. </p>

I disagree. First, this criticism was never put to him. Second, Michael Senior was asked to recall events from many years ago, often of doubtful or peripheral relevance to the proceedings – including, for example, what make of vans were used by the Claimant at different times. I accept that the date of creation of the design drawings on which the Claimant relied is of importance to these proceedings, but it is unsurprising that he was unable to recall precise dates for what would have been at the time unimportant events. I found him to be an honest witness, doing his best to assist the Court. This does not mean that I have accepted all of his evidence: I have not. But in my judgment his evidence was honestly given.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.40in;text-indent:0.00in">Counsel for the Claimant criticised Mr Aitchison as a dishonest witness. Specifically, it was submitted that Mr Aitchison lied in the closing moments of his oral testimony, when he contradicted his written evidence to claim that conversations which his witness statement stated had occurred with his “staff” were actually had directly with him. It does seem to me, having watched Mr Aitchison give his evidence and having reviewed the transcript, that it is likely that Mr Aitchison’s written testimony is to be preferred on this point, because it seems to me inherently implausible that Mr Aitchison would have used the expression “a number of [the First Defendant’s] staff” when he meant himself. Mr Aitchison was professionally represented, and had assistance in preparing his witness statement. There is very little in the issue itself, as Counsel for the Claimant conceded, but he went further, suggesting that I should therefore treat all of Mr Aitchison’s evidence with care. He submitted that where Mr Aitchison’s evidence is inconsistent with another witness’s evidence, I should prefer that of the other witness. Counsel for the Claimant submitted that this included the evidence of what was agreed in 2003, and submitted that I should prefer Michael Senior’s evidence to that of Mr Aitchison. Counsel for the Defendants submitted that Mr Aitchison had been nervous, but had given his evidence honestly. I accept that Mr Aitchison’s evidence at the end of his crossexamination was not accurate. But I do not consider that that infects the remainder of his testimony to a degree that I should discount it where there is evidence to the contrary. I consider that, overall, Mr Aitchison was doing his best to assist the court. As will be apparent from what follows, there are facts on which his memory has failed him, and I have concluded that I prefer other evidence to the evidence given by Mr Aitchison on some issues. But having had the benefit of the totality of Mr Aitchison’s evidence, and in particular having seen him give his oral testimony in cross-examination, I do not conclude that Mr Aitchison was dishonest in his written testimony or in his crossexamination up to the last moments I have mentioned above.   </p>

That also means that I reject Mr Rush’s version of what Mrs Warburton <span style="font-style:italic">meant</span> by what she said to the extent that it differs from what Mrs Warburton said in her statements.

To the extent that there are documents, the Court can read them, and ascertain their meaning – questions to the witnesses as to what they thought those documents may have meant did not assist me. Neither counsel put to me that I should prefer any of the oral testimony to the written record where it was available. However, given the “defences” to infringement which have been raised by the Defendants, I must piece together the events that have occurred as between the two businesses since 1989, so as to ascertain the legal consequences for the parties. Of course, much of what has happened in that time is irrelevant to the determination of the issues in dispute – and each side sought to put its own spin on various events to assist its case.  </p>

Counsel for the Claimant stated that there had been a break-down in communication resulting in the wrong artistic work being included in the pleadings, but submitted first that, as there was an allegation that a “substantial part” of the Work had been reproduced, that was sufficient to enable the Claimant to rely on its pleaded case. I have no hesitation in rejecting this submission. It is not open to a Claimant to plead copyright infringement of an artistic work in which it does not own copyright on the basis that the pleaded copyright work is a substantial reproduction of other copyright works in which the Claimant says it owns copyright. Identification of the work in which rights are alleged to subsist is a fundamental and essential part of a copyright claim. Claimants must put forward the correct artistic work so that defendants can defend themselves and courts can determine the controversy on the basis of the correctly framed pleadings. This is particularly the case in the IPEC.  </p>

According to the evidence of Michael Senior, he did not create the Work – indeed, he considered the Work to have been created by the Defendants “shortly before 2013”. Issue 1 must therefore be answered in the negative – the Work is not an original artistic work created by Michael Senior. Therefore, issue 8 must also be answered in the negative – the Defendants have not infringed copyright in the Work contrary to sections 16(1)(a), (b) and (e) of the CDPA. Issue 17 therefore does not arise, as the Defendants do not need a defence of estoppel or acquiescence in relation to the Claimant’s copyright claim.  </p>

For my part, I find it highly unlikely, even taking into account the criticisms made of the disclosure on both sides, that such a document can have come into existence, and been handled by two firms of solicitors and the Claimant and First Defendant as comparatively recently as 2003, without leaving any trace, digitally or otherwise. There had been instances of actual confusion prior to 2003, and they continued once the First Defendant had relocated. Had there been a written agreement, it seems to me very likely indeed that the Claimant would have looked for it then and raised it with the First Defendant. As far as I can tell, neither party raised the existence of a written agreement until the Defendants filed their Defence. It therefore follows that I prefer Michael Senior’s evidence on this point, as it accords more readily with the business reality. A large sum of money changed hands, but there was a document trail for the transfer of the shares, and the deposit of the money. Michael Senior and Mr Aitchison were good friends, who continued to refer work to each other for more than a decade thereafter. I accept that neither felt it was necessary to pay solicitors to draw up an agreement. This was not the splitting of a partnership: one of two collocated but separate businesses decided it needed bigger premises, and moved out. That did not require the involvement of solicitors. Whilst I do not need to decide the matter, it seems to me that Michael Senior’s explanation for Mr Aitchison’s confusion it likely accurate.  </p>

Put another way, Mrs Warburton’s emails are to be understood as consistent with her other evidence that the 2003 agreement was that the First Defendant could not use CORMETON on its own. I cannot find in Mrs Warburton’s email any admission that the Claimant had, in 2003 or prior to 2015, consented to the First Defendant’s use of CORMETON on its own. Nor can I glean that from Mr Rush’s written or oral testimony. I understand the emails to record that, with the benefit of hindsight, Michael Senior on behalf of the Claimant considered that he ought to have made the First Defendant rebrand in 2003 to a name which did not include CORMETON: Michael Senior accepted as much in cross-examination.

Michael Senior gave oral testimony as follows: “I assumed that when [Mr Aitchison] left from under the umbrella of Cormeton, he would continue to use Cormeton Electronics Limited as his name without using … Cormeton on its own …”. I accept this evidence, again, because it is the only position consistent with common business practice and with what then happened for the next 12 or so years. Michael Senior had seen the First Defendant’s business grow, including because it now required new premises. He was aware that the supply and sale of electrical safety equipment was more profitable than the mechanical fire protection business. He was also aware by 2003 that there had already been examples of consumers confusing the Claimant and the First Defendant. He must therefore have been aware of the risk of “swamping” (although he may not have called it that) had he allowed the First Defendant to trade as only CORMETON, without the qualifier ELECTRONICS. Further, this is what in fact happened. I was taken to a small number of documents (as I have said, approximately 5) which counsel for the Defendant suggested prove that the First Defendant continued to use CORMETON on its own after it stepped out from under the umbrella brand in 2003. I do not accept that is what those documents do, because each also includes uses of CORMETON ELECTRONICS. Further, and more importantly, Mr Aitchison accepted in crossexamination that he had used CORMETON ELECTRONICS from 2003 until about 2016, when uses of CORMETON on its own increased. At that point, the relationship between the Claimant and the First Defendant had already broken down. I therefore do not consider that the First Defendant’s uses after 2016 tell me anything about what was agreed in 2003.  </p>

Michael Senior mentioned in cross-examination that he was “certainly not happy with it” after 2003. However, he accepted both that the Claimant had no right to require the First Defendant to cease using the Domain Name, and that in fact the Claimant never objected to the First Defendant’s use of the Domain Name. No request was made for it to be abandoned or transferred to the Claimant, and no attempt was made through the Nominet dispute resolution process to have the domain name transferred to the Claimant.

Rather, in 2010, the Claimant set up its own domain name. It is inconceivable that, by that time, if the Claimant considered that the First Defendant should not have been using the domain name, it did not take steps to stop the First Defendant from so doing.

It was Michael Senior’s evidence “that each company would not encroach on to the specialist area of the other (so [the Claimant] would not do electronics work, and [the First Defendant] would not do fire protection work.)” Mr Aitchison said the same thing. And that is what then happened for over a decade.

The Claimant, through the evidence of Michael Senior, accepts that it cannot unilaterally withdraw that licence. That means that, in relation to that activity, the Defendants’ case in relation to honest concurrent use, estoppel, acquiescence and invalidity of the Mark does not arise. It may continue to trade under the licence granted in 2003. But I need to address the trade mark infringement and passing off case in relation to those aspects of the First Defendant’s business that fall outside the licence – that is, use of CORMETON on its own, and use of the Signs and the CE Sign in relation to the mechanical fire protection goods and services. In doing so, I also need to address the “defences” raised by the Defendants: invalidity of the Mark, revocation of the Mark, honest concurrent use, estoppel and acquiescence.

Further, he submitted that “it cannot realistically be said that, where use was made by a defendant with the claimant’s permission, that it was “concurrent” use. It was use with the claimant’s consent.” I agree. Use under a licence is generally considered to be use that inures for the benefit of the trade mark proprietor. It would be odd indeed that a licensee, at the end of a period of trading under a licence, were able to say “I no longer need a licence because I have traded so long under the licence that you can no longer sue me for trade mark infringement: honest concurrent use protects me from infringement”. I therefore have no hesitation in rejecting the claim of honest concurrent use in relation to any services licensed under the 2003 agreement.  </p>

These, too, can be dealt with briefly. In relation to the former, whilst there were a handful of examples before the Court of uses of CORMETON on its own between 2003 and 2016, it was not seriously submitted that these were sufficient to establish honest concurrent use. For the uses that commenced in or around 2016 (the change of van livery, the changes to the website, the trading in relation to mechanical fire protection goods and services), I do not consider that the time between 2016 and the commencement of these proceedings in </p>

For this reason alone, no honest concurrent use can arise in relation to those uses. I also do not consider that that use was honest: beginning to trade for the exact services provided by the Claimant does not meet the First Defendant’s duty to act fairly in relation to the legitimate interests of the trade mark proprietor. Rather, to the contrary, the First Defendant, in starting to provide mechanical fire protection goods and services “has taken steps which exacerbate the level of confusion beyond that which is inevitable and so has encroached upon the [C]laimant’s goodwill”, to borrow the words of Henry Carr J in <span style="font-style:italic">Victoria Plum</span> (at paragraph 126).  </p>

It would therefore be unconscionable for the First Defendant to be prevented from continuing to trade in the same manner.
