It ultimately led to the end of broadcasting seeds by hand in agriculture, pushing forward the agricultural revolution of the time.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.00in">Both Patents were granted to the Third Party (“Mr Claydon”) and thereafter assigned to Claydon.  It is common ground that at the date of the claim form, although Claydon held the equitable ownership of the 296 Patent, the legal ownership remained with Mr Claydon.  For that reason Mr Claydon was joined as the Third Party by way of being a defendant to Mzuri’s counterclaim.  Mr Claydon had a central role as a witness for Claydon but played no active part as Third Party. </p>

Mr Claydon was a good witness, giving clear answers.  It was suggested in closing that he was obviously not impartial.  Perfect impartiality would be a lot to expect from Mr Claydon but it does not follow that the answers he gave – principally directed to an alleged prior use – were inaccurate.  Any material impartiality was not obvious. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.00in">The 296 Patent has a priority date of 29 March 2003.  The specification begins by saying that the invention relates to a new method and apparatus for planting seed to produce agricultural crops.  The section on the background to the invention explains that it concerns a seed drilling apparatus of the type pulled by a tractor.  The invention may be used for sowing in minimally cultivated seed beds, creating conservation tillage in which the soil between the newly sown rows of the new crop is left relatively undisturbed.  “Conservation tillage” is, as its name implies, a means of tilling soil in a manner better to conserve it, in particular by reducing soil erosion. </p>

If he understood that the skilled person’s common general knowledge did not extend beyond that which would be known to ordinarily competent engineers engaged in the design and manufacture of farming industry, he had the right idea.  Should Dr Scarlett’s understanding have been that the common general knowledge of a skilled person was in some way more limited, he did not.

Depending upon crop inter-row spacing, only 30-50% of soil residues are left on the surface to reduce wind and water erosion.  The technique was developed in the US during the late-1990 as a departure from No-Tillage, particularly to suit wide-row (maize and soybean) cropping systems.  In these instances tillage is undertaken as a separate operation from seeding, often the former in the autumn and the latter in the spring.  The tillage operation may also be combined with deep fertilizer placement.  Tilling and seeding are not undertaken as a combined single-pass operation and, before the (2003)  priority date, I am unaware of the commercial adoption of this technique in the UK.” </p>

A firming roller is set behind each Rotavator blade.  In front of the Rotavator a tine 2cm wide is set at 20cm depth in the centre of each cultivated strip to loosen the soil at depth.  This is a most important feature because it moves the soil where the tap roots of the beet will have to grow.

I have no doubt that it is.  Each of the tines in the second row moves through the trench created by the corresponding tine in the first row.  The claim says that in use the lateral wings lift the disturbed and broken up soil in the trench, not that the wings do the disturbing and breaking up.  In my view the words “created by the first tines” refer back both to the trench and the disturbed and broken up soil – both have been created by the first tine.  The seed is planted below the lifted soil and the lifted soil then falls back to cover the seed before the soil is flattened. </p>

The horizontal pivots in the trailing arms of the Pro-Til allows for the alignment between the first and second tines to ensure that in use that result is achieved. </p>

Putting a publication in a library makes it accessible to the public, and so available to be read, even if no-one does: it could have been read and the law does not require you to show that it was.  Similarly putting a traffic light controller on a public road, or giving contractors access to it, makes it accessible to the public and it could have been observed, and the information that could have been thereby obtained is therefore available to the public, even if no-one stops to look at it; a mat hired to a customer could have been examined, even if it is known for certain that no-one did. </p>

If it is right as a matter of fact (as I have found that it is) that if any member of the public had tried to observe Mr Berardi in his garden, Mr Berardi would have stopped what he was doing, it seems a misuse of language to say that what he was doing could have been observed, even in theory. If anyone had tried to observe him they would not have seen anything because he would have packed everything up. In other words although any member of the public could have turned up at Skylark Point and stopped to look, had anyone done so, whether a skilled person or anyone else, he would not have been given access to any information. That seems to me to be very different from a publication left in a library for all to read if they choose, or an article left in a public place for all to see if they choose. </p>

I do not need to decide the point but on the view I take it would all depend on what he was doing. It is quite difficult to think of plausible scenarios where this might actually happen in the real world but if, for example, the inventor advertised a public lecture and, even though noone came, proceeded to give it so it could be recorded for his own purposes, that would on the view I take be an oral disclosure that was accessible, and hence made available, to the public and it would not matter that no-one had in fact turned up. But that would be very different from the inventor talking out loud to himself while taking a walk along a deserted but public footpath over the moors. If in the latter case he would have stopped talking as soon as any member of the public was close enough to hear, I do not think he would have made anything available to the public. </p>

This was a patent action concerned with devices used in chimney stacks to monitor the level of dust flowing up the chimney.  There was an allegation of prior use of the invention by the sale and delivery of devices in Australia before the priority date.  Laddie J found that the devices had been made available as alleged and went on to consider what that prior use disclosed to those in the art.  The sale of the devices and their accompanying literature did not describe in any detail how the circuitry in the devices operated, knowledge of which was necessary for the enablement of the invention.  Laddie J said that three questions had to be answered: (1) what tests or analyses would it be obvious to carry out on the product, (2) what would be the result of those tests and (3) how would those results be interpreted by the man skilled in the art.  In other words, Laddie J was addressing an argument based on the hypothetical reverse engineering of the device.  That is not the same as the point at issue here. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.00in">It seems to me that there is no absolute bar in law to the enablement of an invention by reason of the hypothetical skilled person having gained an understanding of it with the assistance of technical equipment.  There are, though, potential difficulties which may prevent such enablement.  I give two examples in a contemporary context.  If enablement required a phone with a sufficient zoom facility and the evidence showed that at the relevant time and place a member of the public could reasonably have been expected to carry such a phone and use the zoom and could have done so lawfully, then it may be that the hypothesis will go forward on the basis that the information made available included information obtained using the phone, whether seen at the time or recorded and discerned later.  On the other hand, it will not be often that evidence will establish that the skilled person would have had a swarm of drones to hand at the relevant time and place and even if they did, use of the swarm may be liable to give rise to issues of privacy and breach of confidence.  Both examples assume that the skilled person is a passer-by, in that he or she is not to be taken to have planned the observation in advance. </p>

Brief speculation by Mr Wright was not enough.  Nor did it explore what could have been discerned in the prevailing conditions using binoculars or a video camera typically available in August 2002.  In my view, therefore, enablement in the present case must be assessed by reference to hypothetical observation with the naked eye. </p>

At the end of August 2002 it was tested in a field on the farm for ten hours, including travel to and from the workshop, split over two days.

The skilled person would have noted the two rows of tines and would have understood that (a) those in the first row were cultivating tines and those in the second row were seeding tines; and (b) each seeding tine would need to be in line with a cultivating tine.  The latter would have been understood because it would be apparent that the drill left in its wake strips of undisturbed soil between strips of disturbed soil.

The tubular housing is connected to a bracket (18) by parallel linkage (19 and 20).  The relative depths of the planting sweep and the banding knife can be altered by adjustment of the packer wheel using adjustment means (26).

The skilled person reading Handy would understand that the seeds must be sown in a zone separate from the fertilizer, on the shelves to each side of the trench and his or her common general knowledge would reinforce a sense of importance that this separation should be maintained to avoid scorching. </p>

The important point is that the soil in the zone of the shelves is not the disturbed and broken up soil in the trench created by the first tine.  In my view, a skilled person implementing the teaching of Handy would actively seek to avoid that result.  I do not believe that it would be obvious to vary the drill disclosed in Handy to create a drill achieving that result. </p>

I have found that it was, more specifically that one-pass strip-tillage, as defined by Mr Wright was common general knowledge.  Mr Wright’s evidence was that it would have been obvious to apply Handy in such a way as to implement strip-tillage.  I was persuaded by Mr Wright in this regard. </p>

Mr Wright’s response was that this would mean an unnecessary consumption of power when drilling the rest of the field, more fuel consumption and slower travel.

So much so, that he or she would not have considered the matter further.  In effect, Claydon’s case was that the invention of the 576 Patent lay solely in appreciating that there was a problem to be solved. </p>

I accept Mr Wright’s evidence on this.  By the common consent of the experts, once the skilled person considered the matter, the answer disclosed in the 576 Patent would have been obvious. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.00in">Mr Wright proposed a development of Handy which he said would have been obvious to the skilled person.  He drew attention the parallel connectors which link the digging tine and the seeding tine, what Handy calls “parallel linkage” (19 and 20 in the diagram shown above).  Mr Wright identified problems with this design.  First, the digging tine of the Handy drill would be weak and liable to be bent out of shape.  Secondly, the digging tines would have to be custom made.  Thirdly, sprung leaf digging tines, commonly used with this type of machine, flex, particularly under high load.  The parallel linkage would transfer this flexing motion to the seeding making both oscillate.  This would compromise the consistency of drilling depth. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.00in">A way of avoiding these disadvantages would be to connect the parallel linkage to a strong, rigid and relatively lightweight hollow frame, rather than directly to the digging tine.  This would eliminate the foregoing disadvantages and allow the parallel linkage to be moved higher, making the machine less prone to blockages.  It would also bring the drill within the scope of claim 1 of the 576 Patent on the construction advanced by Claydon. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.00in">Dr Scarlett agreed with Mr Wright on the disadvantages identified, but he said that they applied only to one embodiment of Handy.  Mr Wright’s proposed amendments would add to the mass and cost of the machine.  Moving the parallel linkage up would subject the components to extra stress and require that more robust components were used.  Rather than blockages being removed, they may just be moved to a different location.  Dr Scarlett agreed that the modifications proposed by Mr Wright would present no technical difficulty, but the skilled person would have seen no practical justification for them. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.00in">Both experts maintained their evidence in cross-examination, but I found Dr Scarlett to be more convincing on this topic.  It would no doubt have been technically straightforward to make adaptations of Handy to arrive at a drill which fell within claim 1 of the 576 Patent.  However, I am not persuaded that the skilled person would have been driven to make the particular changes proposed by Mr Wright.  I think they would have been obvious only if the destination of a drill within claim 1 had been in the skilled person’s mind. </p>
