It is the proprietor of UK Patent No. GB2455635B (“the Patent”) which claims an invention entitled “Removeable blind fastener”.  “Blind” is a term of art in the context of fasteners, meaning that the fastener can be fitted from one side of the workpiece, essential if the technician only has access to one side.  I will later say more about “removeable”.  </p>

Mr McClure’s evidence should have been limited to a short point.  Airbus relied on an allegation of prior use of the invention by reason of the marketing of a fastener called the “E-Nut”.  At the CMC Airbus was given permission to file evidence from a witness of fact to deal with the question whether the E-Nut was publicly available before the priority date.  Mr McClure gave evidence about that issue.   </p>

My reservation was that among the more expansive sections of Mr McClure’s evidence, he had challenged assertions of fact made by Mr McKay about the E-Nut.  The E-Nut was referred to by both experts in their reports by way of discussion of the common general knowledge.  I was persuaded at the start of the trial that unless at least those parts of Mr McClure’s witness statement remained in evidence, the balance of evidence regarding the structure and extent of use of the E-Nut might be unfairly skewed in Kwikbolt’s favour.  I allowed his witness statement to </p>

Generally, documents for cross- examination should be supplied at least 48 hours before the witness gives evidence. However, more time may be required depending on the nature and number of the documents intended to be relied upon. The number of documents should be kept within manageable bounds.

There can be other types of exceptional case in which the court will allow the use of new documents in cross-examination even if the contents are new. </p>

I agree.  The sting in the tail of Mr Ward’s submission was that by contrast Mr McKay’s reports were full of factual inaccuracies, some corrected after the relevant report had been sworn and others not, and that Mr McKay had in cross-examination abandoned every important proposition made in his report in relation to the Patent and the prior art.  Mr Ward said that Mr McKay’s reports had been prepared in a way that did not reflect his honest views and should be treated with the highest degree of scepticism.

There was a break from Boeing between 1970 and 1977, during which Mr Jack spent time at the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, North American Rockwell, the Northrop Corporation and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.  After he retired as an employee, Mr Jack founded his own consulting company, OMT Inc (he said that it stood for Old Man’s Thoughts), through which he provided consultancy services to Boeing.

I will call this the upper workpiece, as did the experts, since the technician will generally be above the two workpieces.  Here it is shown to the left.  It is also passed through an aperture in the lower workpiece 50, shown to the right.  The head 12 of the first member engages the upper workpiece such that the first member can move no further down.  Rotation of the screw member into the threaded aperture of the second member causes the second member to slide upwards, towards the first member.  At the same time the tapered end of the screw member pushes against the flexible fingers of the second member (22A, 22C – as shown in Figure 1; typically there are four).  The fingers are thereby biased radially outwards.  As the second member moves further towards the first member, the planar surfaces of the splayed fingers engage with the face of the lower workpiece.  Further rotation of the screw member draws the two workpieces together so that they are fastened. </p>

It must therefore be larger in diameter than the aperture of the workpiece against which it bears.  In the context of the claim, the relative diameter of the head and the rest of the first member is of no purposive significance.

It takes priority from the UK application for the Patent.  Its specification is more developed than that of the Patent.  The description of the prior art refers to a Figure 1 (not in the Patent) which illustrates what is described as a conventional fastener.  It states: </p>

This is a particular problem in automated assembly processes; tool heads sweep rapidly across the surface of the materials and protruding fasteners will impede the movement of these automated tools.  Another problem with the prior art shown in Figure 1 is that the maximum clamping pressure is determined by the strength of the internal spring.” </p>

However, the PCT Application is Kwikbolt’s own representation and provides a potential guide as to what the skilled person would have understood the inventive concept of the Patent to be, viewed through the lens of his or her common general knowledge.  The first two sentences of the passage I have quoted are consistent with what Mr McKay had to say.  He confirmed in crossexamination that at the priority date the skilled person would have been interested in making a fastener compatible with automated machinery used in aircraft assembly.  Generally, if the fastener was proud of the workpiece surface this complicated the programming of automated machinery, requiring the machinery to dodge the fasteners.  Further, there was no evidence of a prior art fastener within the skilled person’s common general knowledge which was blind, removable and which did not protrude above the surface of the workpiece when in clamping mode. </p>

I take the view that when a party pleads such a product in support of an allegation of lack of novelty and/or inventive step, it is essential that the pleading is entirely unambiguous as to which version of the product is relied on.  First, the patentee is entitled to know the case it has to meet.  Secondly, this court (and indeed the Patents Court) routinely limits a party seeking to challenge the validity of a patent to reliance on a small number of items of prior art.  It requires the party to focus its attention on its best case and thereby avoids a waste of time and expense, not least the time of the court.  This is plainly in conformity with the overriding objective.  It would undermine that routine approach if a party were entitled to plead reliance on product X without further detail and thereby to smuggle into the case any number of alternative versions of product X. </p>

Paragraph 3(a) would be understood to mean that this product was available from 2003 and that Annex 2 provides confirmation of this.  Paragraph 3(c) would be taken to mean that it was displayed at the Hamburg trade fair and that Annex 4 provides confirmation of that prior disclosure.  If any doubt were generated by the fact that Annexes 2 and 4 show alternative versions of the E-Nut, paragraph 3(d) would be taken to provide a clear answer: the version relied on is that made available to Kwikbolt for inspection.  One version only was made available.  In my view that is the single version pleaded and the only version on which Airbus is entitled to rely. </p>

I also think that Kwikbolt might be forgiven for having assumed that it made little difference so far as Airbus was concerned: on Airbus’s case McClure 1 disclosed everything about the E-Nut on which Airbus wished to rely. </p>

Mr Jack explained how the McClure 1 fastener works.  The collet body is inserted through the top of the sleeve insert.  The collet body is pushed down through the sleeve insert until its flange meets a rim or ledge in the sleeve insert.  The rim or ledge is designed to prevent the collet body from falling out of the base of the sleeve insert. The flexible fingers in their resting state are sufficiently converged so that they can extend through the sleeve insert’s base.  When the fastener is inserted into the apertures of the workpieces, the converged fingers can project through the aperture of the lower workpiece. </p>

Rotation of the stud causes the collet body to be drawn up along the stud towards and into the sleeve insert.  The bottom of the stud is forced through the collet body’s flexible fingers, causing them to expand outwards.  The collet body is prevented from rotating in the sleeve insert by complementary internal geometry.  As the collet body is drawn up, its flexible fingers, now pushed radially outwards, engage the surface of the lower workpiece.  The sleeve insert has a flared upper lip which bears upon the upper workpiece.  This and the flexible fingers bearing on the lower workpiece cause the two workpieces to be clamped. </p>

The only option disclosed in McClure 1 that does not expressly require the sleeve insert to be adhered or otherwise fixed to a workpiece is that of using knurling or vanes as discussed in one sentence of paragraph [0063].  In theory it was possible to use a loose enough fit between the sleeve insert and the aperture to make removal of the sleeve insert easy.

The collet body/second member is pushed into the sleeve insert, after which the screw is rotated into the collet.  The sleeve insert is not removable.  Further, Mr Jack accepted in cross-examination that the E-Nut is not a blind fastener because access is required to the far side of the workpiece in order to install it. </p>

I have found that the head of the first member is whichever end it is that bears against the top workpiece.  As represented in Figure 3, that is the bottom of the first member.  It follows that the head of the first member is not adjacent the screw head, namely the cap and tommy bar. </p>

Mr Vanhegan conceded that the Figure 1 embodiment of Wylie was shown as having planar finger heads but submitted that it was not obvious to introduce these into the Figure 3 embodiment.  He supported this by evidence from Mr Jack that Wylie was an old disclosure, multi-component and expensive and unlikely to be suitable for automation in use, which was the focus of attention at the filing date.  </p>

As I discussed earlier, the two workpieces are shown to be at a distance from each other without any bracing between them.  Taken literally, as soon as a clamping force was applied, they would collapse towards each other.  But by the end of cross-examination both experts treated Figures 3A and 3B as schematics, not to be taken literally, agreeing that the skilled person would be fully capable of implementing the invention claimed.  The insufficiency argument fails. </p>
