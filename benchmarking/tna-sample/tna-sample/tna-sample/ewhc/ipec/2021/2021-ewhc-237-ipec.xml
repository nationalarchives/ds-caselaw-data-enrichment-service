The Defendants filed a Defence which, broadly, (i) denied that BTB v5 infringed the Claimants’ rights, asserting that in 2004/5 it had been completely rewritten from the versions created by the Second Claimant; and (ii) asserted that the Defendants had acquired all intellectual property rights in BTB v5 from the administrators of the Ultrasis group of companies in 2015.  </p>

A CMC took place before HHJ Hacon on 29 November 2019 which identified (and to a certain extent limited) the issues to be determined at trial. Expert evidence was then served sequentially. About a month before trial, being some 5 years after the dispute arose, and four years after the claim was issued, the Defendants notified the Claimants that they did not intend to serve any fact evidence and conceded liability on a number of issues.  </p>

The way in which the slides or ‘frames’ are sequenced within a session is referred to as a ‘tree’, since there may be a number of different branching paths through the frames which are taken, depending on the user’s interactive choices.  The BTB application therefore includes a number of sessions each of which comprises a series of ‘frames’ (equivalent to Powerpoint slides) and a number of ‘trees’ (which represent lists of frames/slides in a defined order).

He wrote extensive documentation for the IDEA System which is in the trial bundle, and which predates the 2002 Transaction.

In fact, as he had to agree with Mr Riordan in cross-examination later, he left a number of matters uncorrected which should also have been corrected. Mr Smith sought to raise a number of matters in oral evidence which he had not mentioned in the Defence and he was unable to explain to my satisfaction why he had neither amended the Defence nor filed witness evidence in the usual way. The Defendants submit that he was an honest witness whose evidence held although his credibility was attacked. However, the Claimants have had no opportunity to investigate or properly challenge evidence which was given for the first time at trial. For that reason, I look for some corroboration from the documentary evidence, other witness evidence or the inherent probabilities before accepting Mr Smith’s evidence, and where it conflicts with the Claimants’ witnesses, I prefer their evidence.   </p>

Each value in an XML file is individually accessible by electronic means by parsing the XML file so as to extract the values from each of their associated elements. Dr Young states that the key characteristics of systematic hierarchical design and the ability to extract data are independent of the method of storage, so that XML formatted text can be stored (for example) in individual computer files as XML files or in records in a database as XML text records. He makes clear at para 92 of his first report that within his report he refers to a distinct block of XML data as a ‘file’ whether it is, in fact, held in a text file or a database record: either can be retrieved and read by a computer program. </p>

It is common ground that neither of these versions of BTB utilised explicit XML Schema Definition or XSD files, and so Dr Young generated XML schemas using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017, so that he could then compare that generated for BTB v2 and that generated for BTB v5 in a text editor (para 85, para 97 first report).

Taking Mr Tritton’s analogy of the BTB application as a book, I consider a better (but still imperfect) analogy is that the XML Schema is a scheme for categorising and organising books in a library, no matter how vast – like the Dewey decimal system, perhaps. Such a scheme exists to categorise all the books in a library, irrespective of author, so that librarians can shelve them and library users can find them, and is not limited to the system reference placed on the spine of any individual book in that library. Similarly, the XML Schema exists to provide a structure or format to validate and verify the contents of the XML files of any number of applications created on the IDEA System, not just BTB. </p>

These XML files are plain text files and not computer programs. The XML Schema which was used to create, validate and run the BTB application and which is implicit in the BTB XML files is substantially the same XML Schema which is utilised to create, validate and run any interactive multimedia self-help application created on the IDEA System.  </p>

References to both the generic objects and components and the author-provided content can be found in the BTB XML files: but the mere fact that the XML Schema is implicit in those XML files and can be generated from them does not mean that the XML Schema is nothing more than a few lines of code in the XML files.  </p>

It does seem to me that the Claimants’ description of the XML Schema as being ‘at the heart’ of the IDEA System is as good as any.

In relation to Clause 3.2.1 this really has been covered by Dr Young, as I have addressed in paragraph 70 and 71 above. Although the XML Schema is not object code, I am satisfied on the evidence, including the expert evidence, that the unique logic elements of the XML Schema act in a way which is almost like code, and a number of the named IDEA components (including the IDEA Player) cannot be used as the licence intends without the concurrent use of the XML Schema, and I am satisfied that this was in the knowledge of both parties (i.e. Mr Orbach) at the time of the 2002 Transaction.  </p>

He described how negotiations on the SPA, associated financing documentation and other documents including the 2002 Licence and 2002 Assignment, carried on during 28 November 2002 through the night until signing the next day. He said that he had to represent both the future of the Second Claimant and also Ultrasis itself and so it appears he was, effectively, the ‘client’ giving instructions to both of the Manches solicitors acting on each side. To that extent, it seems to me that Mr Orbach’s knowledge at the time of execution of the documents can be imputed to both Ultrasis and the Second Defendant and, therefore, to the reasonable person with all the background knowledge which would have been available to both parties, when deciding what that reasonable person would have understood them to be using the language in the agreements to mean. </p>

I remind myself that ‘independent’ data are data which are <span style="font-style:italic">“separable from one another without their informative, literary… or other value being affected”.</span> The question appears to be whether they have autonomous informative value, per [33] of <span style="font-style:italic">Fixtures</span>. That case related to a structure for recording the date, time and identity of teams for various fixtures in a football league. This was held to be a database even without being populated by the results of various matches, as that data (date, time and identity of teams) was held to have an independent value in that they provided interested third parties with relevant information (at [34] of the judgment). The Claimants in this case have not drawn my attention to any evidence which can satisfy me that the various elements making up the XML Schema have autonomous informative value. Much as the individual words in a literary work cannot be separated without losing their literary value (per [29] of <span style="font-style:italic">Fixtures</span>), it seems to me (in the absence of any submissions otherwise) that the individual categories of what elements, attributes and data are validly contained in the XML Schema cannot be separated without losing the informative value of the rules as a whole. </p>

The 2002 agreement licences Ultrasis to use the IDEA software to enable ‘running’ Beating the Blues. <span style="font-weight:bold">Subsequently (not sure of the date - but probably about 2006), Ultrasis wished to develop a web version of beating the Blues and chose a different route that didn't use IDEA.</span> A company called Agilisys was contracted to build this version. Ultrasis wished to be independent of [Mr Orbach’s] company because of failure to provide adequate support and costs. (As an example he quoted £90K to put the programme into escrow - an activity which would have cost much less than £1000.) Subsequently, Ultrasis redeveloped BtB again on a commercially available software platform (can't remember which - probably Java), and again developed a further US version using ‘Articulate Storyline’ as the platform. If Ultrasis still has CDs of Beating the Blues in the field (probably within the prison service) then these operate on IDEA but they will be few in number”   </p>

What are these minor exceptions? Secondly, he appears to be confused with his timing, as the request for escrow was in 2007 after v4 had been produced by Agilisys, so it cannot have prompted the decision to contract with Agilisys as he states. Thirdly, I struggle to understand how Dr Martin’s assertion in 2015 that Agilisys did not use IDEA in the 2004/5 rewrite can be reconciled with his request in 2007 that he needed the IDEA source code to be deposited in escrow, and as I have noted, Mr Smith could not assist me with that. In addition, I accept the Claimants’ submissions that this email does not evidence any discussion between Mr Smith and Dr Martin; nor does it appear from that email that Dr Martin carried out any personal investigations into the underlying code. For those reasons I cannot be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the conversation with Dr Martin took place at all, or if it did, what Dr Martin said and whether it was reasonable for Mr Smith to accept it.  </p>

However this does not fit with the evidence of Mr Orbach and Mr Smith that Mr Simonov was honest. Closing his eyes to it in 2004/5 when the code came back from Agilisys, and when he described himself as young and naïve, is not the same as lying to Mr Smith, and Mr Simonov states in his proof of evidence that if it had happened now, when he is older and wiser, he would speak up (I paraphrase).   </p>

Mr Tyrell-Croft was not such a person being junior, non-technical and not familiar with the “back end” of BTB, and Mr Smith as CEO and Chairman of the First Defendant should have known that.

I am also reminded that Mr Riordan did put to Mr Smith a number of related points in cross-examination, including (i) that his approach to the litigation was about seeing who would blink first before he chose to reveal the truth and only did so when he was pressed, which Mr Smith denied; and (ii) that he had deliberately sought to derive a commercial benefit, to which Mr Smith answered that he had not purposefully tried to delay the outcome. I have thought about this and Mr Smith’s other oral evidence again, carefully, against the background of mistrust that the Claimants concede the Defendants had at the time about allowing the Claimants to access their software, and it remains the case that I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the Defendants deliberately and strategically delayed and obfuscated disclosure to gain commercial advantage.

Mr Uliel is measured and does not wear his heart on his sleeve, but it was apparent to me that he is a decent and honest man who feels the unfairness of the Defendants’ infringements keenly.
