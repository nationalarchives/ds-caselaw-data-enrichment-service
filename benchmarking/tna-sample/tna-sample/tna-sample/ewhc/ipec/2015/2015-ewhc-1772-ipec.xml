In 1985 they founded and have since operated a group of musicians who play ukuleles and who collectively perform under the name ‘The Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain’.  Over the years their gigs have developed a certain style, with the members wearing evening dress – black tie or gowns as the case may be – telling jokes and delivering mostly well known rock songs and film themes on their ukuleles.  UOGB has enjoyed considerable success, particularly in this country and in Germany. </p>

The partners are the First Defendant (“Mr Clausen”) and Dieter Tings.  UKUO was set up in 2009 by Mr Clausen, Mr Tings and Peter Moss who is an experienced professional musician and part-time ukulele player.  Having been approached by Mr Clausen and Mr Tings, Mr Moss brought together a group of players to form UKUO under his leadership.  It is based in Germany but is comprised of British players.  UKUO was first operated by another partnership, Yellow Promotion GbR, but this partnership came to an end on 31 December 2013.  Yellow Promotion took over from 8 January 2014, the date on which it was registered under German law and thus came into existence.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.00in">me by UOGB on 23 September 2014 for an interim injunction, he thought that matters between the parties would be made worse if references to UOGB were left on UKUO’s website.  So he asked a junior member of Yellow Promotion’s staff to delete them.  He said that the website does not always publish articles in full, but when there is a deletion Yellow Promotion uses an ellipsis to mark that words have been removed.  The source of the article is given so that a reader can look at the whole thing if he or she wishes.  Mr Clausen said that when he was later told by the defendants’ English lawyers about the requirement to give disclosure of relevant documents in the defendants’ possession, the redacted articles as they appeared on UKUO’s website were disclosed but not the unredacted articles because the originals had not been kept and were consequently not in the defendants’ possession. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.00in">Mr Engelman, who appeared for UOGB, alleged that the deletions in the defendants’ disclosure had two consequences.  First, it was not going to be possible for there to be a fair trial.  When this was questioned he suggested that since the defendants were capable of making the deletions that had been discovered, they were capable of other acts to mislead that court which have not been discovered and this was why a fair trial was not possible.  Secondly he submitted that the defendants had by their behaviour forfeited their right to defend themselves at trial, that the defendants lacked clean hands and that to continue the trial would constitute an unjustified waste of court resources.  Mr Engelman took me to <span style="font-style:italic">Summers v Fairclough Homes Ltd</span> [2012] UKSC 26; [2012] 1 W.L.R. 2004, <span style="font-style:italic">Arrow Nominees Inc v Blackledge </span>[2001] B.C.C. 591 and <span style="font-style:italic">Bilta (UK) Ltd v Nazir</span> [2010] EWHC 3227 (Ch). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.00in">To my mind there was no merit whatever in the application for two principal reasons.  First, the suggestion that the redactions in the three articles would prevent a fair trial made no sense at all since the full versions were before the court.  The response to this – that I should infer the defendants had made other and undiscovered redactions elsewhere in documents – was based on nothing more than speculation.  Secondly, to the extent that the redactions were relevant to what I had to decide at trial, in my view it would have been wholly wrong to strike out the Defence without first hearing from Mr Clausen, who was due to be cross-examined the following day.  Mr Engelman submitted that I could and should find that Mr Clausen was lying without hearing from him.  I say no more than that I disagree. </p>

Mr Clausen speaks good English but he had the occasional assistance of an interpreter when he had difficulty in understanding the questions put to him.  In my view he did his best to explain honestly the events he was asked about as he knew them.</p>

Mr Engelman relied on this to suggest that Mr Clausen’s statement in his witness statement that he had arranged for all references to be deleted was yet further evidence of Mr Clausen’s dishonesty.  I think it was evidence of Mr Clausen’s assistant not having done a thorough job. </p>

In that regard, it should be noted that, as is apparent from paragraphs 18 and 19 of the contested decision, there is from the point of view of the relevant public a direct and specific link between the sign ‘1000’ and some of the characteristics of the goods concerned. The sign ‘1000’ alludes to a quantity and will immediately be perceived by the relevant public, without further thought, as a description of the characteristics of the goods in question, in particular the number of pages and works, amount of data, or the number of puzzles in a collection, or the ranking of items referred to in them. That conclusion cannot be invalidated by the fact that the mark applied for is composed only of figures, since … the missing information may be readily identified by the relevant public, the association between the figure and those characteristics of the goods in question being immediate. </p>

This strengthens the descriptive relationship that exists from the point of view of the average consumer between the goods in question and the [sign ‘1000’]. The court considered that, in that context, the average consumer would perceive 1000 as an indication of the number of puzzles, and for that reason it was unregistrable.” </p>

Although the entire passage repays reading, I will summarise his three points as: (i) how factual and objective is the relationship between an indication and the product or one of its characteristics? (ii) how readily is the message of the indication conveyed? and (iii) how significant or central to the product is the characteristic?

I am not satisfied that this is correct. As the hearing officer held and the Registrar's representative submitted, consideration of the copyright position suggests the opposite. The first owner of copyright in a photograph of the Group will be the photographer or the photographer's employer. Accordingly, exploitation of photographs of the Group will not necessarily require the Group's licence. Accordingly, even if performers' or authors' names may be registered in respect of compact discs and books on the basis that members of the public would expect such items to be authorised by the performer or author (contrary to what is suggested above), that would not mean that such marks were registrable for posters. </p>

First, in <span style="font-style:italic">Nestlé v Cadbury</span> I noted that the English courts have thus far held that it was not enough to prove that at the relevant date a significant proportion of the relevant class of persons recognise the mark and associate it with the applicant for registration’s goods in the sense that, if they were to consider who marketed goods bearing that mark, they would identify the applicant. Rather, the applicant must prove that a significant proportion of the relevant class of persons rely upon the mark (as opposed to any other trademarks which may also be present) as indicating the origin of the goods. Since it is not clear that this is a correct statement of the law, however, I referred the following question to the CJEU (question 1 in C215/14):  </p>

It is clear that the Court was not saying that, where an opinion poll is relied on, it has to be shown that the sign has become distinctive to any particular percentage of consumers. Rather, as I read this passage, what the Court is saying is that what percentage will suffice depends on the circumstances of the case, which it is for the competent authority to assess.

It would be paradoxical to accept, on the one hand, pursuant to Article 3(1)(b) of Directive 2008/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2008 to approximate the laws of the Member States relating to trade marks (OJ 2008 L 299, p. 25), that a Member State has to refuse to register as a national mark a sign that is devoid of any distinctive character in its territory and, on the other, that that same Member State has to respect a Community trade mark relating to that sign for the sole reason that it has acquired distinctive character in the territory of another Member State (see, by analogy, υγεία, paragraph 98 above, paragraph 53).” </p>

The list was confirmed by Mr Hinchliffe in reexamination at trial.  Mr Hinchliffe indicated that the list was not complete which, given the dates, must be true but there was nothing in evidence which would add to the list, certainly not so far as use outside the UK is concerned.  Oddly, a list annexed to the Particulars of Claim indicates that concerts were given in only 14 Member States aside from the UK and Germany and there was only one performance in each of those States up to the date of the Counterclaim.  I will assume in UOGB’s favour that the list referred to by Mr Hinchliffe is more accurate.  UOGB also sought to rely on the contents of a letter dated 22 August 2014 written by Mr Engelman under the public access rules of the Bar Code of Conduct, in particular sections of it which made assertions about UOGB’s use of the CTM in the Community.  These assertions were not admitted by UKUO, they were not confirmed by any of UOGB’s witnesses in their witness statements and were not put to any witness at trial.  I therefore disregard them. </p>

Thirdly, the evidence showed that the German for ‘ukulele orchestra’ is <span style="font-style:italic">Ukulelenorchester</span>.  There was also a letter dated 17 May 2010 in evidence from the German Patent and Trade Mark Office to an agent of Yellow Promotion GbR refusing an application to register ‘The United Kingdom Ukulele Orchestra’ on the ground that this sign was descriptive in Germany.   The officer stated that the relevant public in Germany would readily understand ‘United Kingdom’.  Mr Elias submitted that there must be an inference that both ‘Great Britain’ and ‘The Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain’ would be understood by the average consumer in German to mean, descriptively, a ukulele orchestra from Great Britain.

Once UOGB had raised a pleaded response to the allegation of invalidity, i.e. relying on defence of acquired distinctiveness under art.7(3), the burden shifted to UKUO to plead and show that this defence was not good in any particular Member State.  For instance, UKUO did not plead any reliance on lack of acquired distinctiveness in Malta and Cyprus.  UOGB had therefore not come to trial expecting to deal with distinctiveness in those countries and both should be deleted from the list of relevant Member States for the purposes of acquired distinctiveness, along with all the others. </p>

Lest there is any doubt about the usual rule applying, the General Court has made it clear that the burden in relation to art.7(3) and art.52(2) rests on the CTM proprietor, see <span style="font-style:italic">Liz Earle</span> at [49] and the cases there referred to. </p>

This could only have happened since Yellow Promotion existed, i.e. since 8 January 2014.  It does not follow, however, that alleged instances of confusion which happened before that date are irrelevant.  If it can be shown that the use of the sign THE UNITED KINGDOM UKULELE ORCHESTRA generated a likelihood of confusion in the mind of the average consumer before 8 January 2014, it may be reasonable to infer that confusion continued after that date.  I accept that the inference is not an inevitable one – it is possible that by January 2014 confusion had dissipated in the mind of the average consumer.  But as will be seen, the main evidence of confusion adduced by UOGB, in the form of two witnesses who attended for cross-examination, concerned events after January 2014. </p>

There was a finding of passing off.  On appeal the Court of Appeal identified four possible reasons for the confusion.  One was the reason the plaintiff had relied on: that the defendant’s use of the words ‘Chicago Pizza Co’ as part of its trading name constituted a misrepresentation that the defendant’s restaurant was connected in the course of trade with the plaintiff.  The plaintiff’s case was that this misrepresentation had resulted in the acknowledged confusion.  Yet at first instance ‘Chicago pizza’ had been found by the judge to be descriptive of a certain type of pizza.  Consequently the defendant’s use of that term could not have been the cause of any misrepresentation.  The confusion among the public must have been due to something else – something which did not give rise to actionable passing off.  A possibility was that the public wrongly believed that Chicago pizzas must all come from a single trade source. </p>

They looked at UOGB on YouTube, liked what they saw, and few days later bought tickets for the show in Rhyl on 17 October 2014.  Before the show they bought and enjoyed UOGB DVDs.  The DVDs came with a free gift from UOGB.  On 6 September 2014 Mr Potter emailed his thanks for the gift, mentioning that his and his wife’s interest had been sparked by the advertisement for the group’s upcoming show in Rhyl.  Some days later Mr Potter received a reply from Ian Wood, UOGB’s merchandising officer, pointing out that the concert to be given in Rhyl would feature UKUO, not UOGB.  Mr Potter and his wife attended the show but apparently liked the performance less than those of UOGB seen on screen.  Mr Potter said that had he and his wife realised there were two groups and gone on to compare online video clips of rival performances beforehand, they would not have bought the tickets for the UKUO show. </p>

They establish that a proprietor of a trade mark with a reputation is not necessarily entitled to prohibit the use by a competitor of his mark in relation to goods for which it is registered even though the mark has been adopted with the intention and for the purpose of taking advantage of its distinctive character and repute, the competitor will derive a real advantage from his use of the mark, and the competitor will not pay any compensation in respect of that use. Consideration must be given to whether the use is without due cause. Specifically, the use of a trade mark as a keyword in order to advertise goods which are an alternative to but not mere imitations of the goods of the proprietor and in a way which does not cause dilution or tarnishment and which does not adversely affect the functions of the trade mark must be regarded as fair competition and cannot be prohibited.” </p>

This condition qualifies all of the defences in art.12 of the Regulation and has been interpreted by the Court of Justice on numerous occasions as importing a duty to act fairly in relation to the legitimate interests of a trade mark proprietor. It also involves the balancing or reconciliation of potentially conflicting fundamental interests. The Court put it this way in <span style="font-style:italic">Bayerische Motorenwerke AG v Deenik </span>(C-63/97) [1999] E.C.R.

Lastly, the condition requiring use of the trade mark to be made in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial matters must be regarded as constituting in substance the expression of a duty to act fairly in relation to the legitimate interests of the trade mark owner, similar to that imposed on the reseller where he uses another’s trade mark to advertise the resale of products covered by that mark. </p>

Just like Article 7, Article 6 seeks to reconcile the fundamental interests of trade-mark protection with those of free movement of goods and freedom to provide services in the common market in such a way that trade mark rights are able to fulfil their essential role in the system of undistorted competition which the Treaty seeks to establish and maintain (see, in particular, <span style="font-style:italic">HAG II</span>, paragraph 13).” </p>

The national court must carry out an overall assessment of all the circumstances and determine whether the defendant is competing unfairly. This emerges from the guidance given by the Court of Justice in <span style="font-style:italic">Anheuser-Busch Inc v Budejovicky Budvar Národní Podnik </span>(C-245/02) [2004] E.C.R.

In that regard, it must be noted that, in assessing whether the condition of honest practice is satisfied, account must be taken first of the extent to which the use of the third party’s name is understood by the relevant public, or at least a significant section of that public, as indicating a link between the third party’s goods or services and the trade mark proprietor or a person authorised to use the trade mark, and secondly of the extent to which the third party ought to have been aware of that. Another factor to be taken into account when making the assessment is whether the trade mark concerned enjoys a certain reputation in the Member State in which it is registered and its protection is sought, from which the third party might profit in marketing his goods or services (<span style="font-style:italic">Anheuser-Busch</span> at [83]).  </p>

The mere fact that there exists a likelihood of aural confusion between a word mark registered in one Member State and an indication of geographical origin from another Member State is therefore insufficient to conclude that the use of that indication in the course of trade is not in accordance with honest practices. In a Community of 15 Member States, with great linguistic diversity, the chance that there exists some phonetic similarity between a trade mark registered in one Member State and an indication of geographical origin from another Member State is already substantial and will be even greater after the impending enlargement. </p>

Since the case concerns bottled drinks, the circumstances to be taken into account by that court would include in particular the shape and labelling of the bottle in order to assess, more particularly, whether the producer of the drink bearing the indication of geographical origin might be regarded as unfairly competing with the proprietor of the trade mark.” </p>

Thus, a copyright work is not the medium on which the recording was made, it is the expression of the author’s intellectual creation.  Here, for instance, the work is not the photograph, tape or other medium used for visual or sound recording, it is the performance itself by UOGB.

In the normal course one would have expected UOGB to have presented to the court the photograph, sound recording and video which would have communicated the detailed nature of the two performances.  Assuming both to be original works, each would have been compared to one or more performances by UKUO and there would have been argument as to whether UOGB had established (a) copying of one or other of UOGB’s dramatic works and (b) if so, whether there had been copying in substantial part. </p>

Although the photograph and the sound recording of the first performance were in evidence, neither was drawn to my attention.  I was supplied with a number of DVDs of UOGB’s performances of which I watched one (<span style="font-style:italic">Live at the Sydney Opera House</span>) outside court.  I was told that the others would have given me a sense of the continuous nature of the style of performance over the years, nothing more, so I did not watch anything else.  The two particular performances in which dramatic copyright might subsist were not addressed at trial.  Instead the two lists of nine or ten elements were each themselves characterised as the dramatic works relied on, in the form of a ‘format’.  It was argued that most of the elements of the two formats could be found in UKUO’s performances and so the latter infringed the two dramatic works. </p>

I have already referred to <span style="font-style:italic">Green v Broadcasting Corp of New Zealand</span>.  The appellant, Mr Green, was the author and presenter of a television show called ‘Opportunity Knocks’.  He alleged that the copyright in ‘the scripts and dramatic format’ of his show had been infringed by the respondent.  The dramatic format was defined by a list of features of the show which were repeated each time: the title, catch phrases and the use of a device called a ‘clapometer’.  Lord Bridge said this at page 702: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.00in">“It is stretching the original use of the word “format” a long way to use it metaphorically to describe the features of a television series such as a talent, quiz or game show which is presented in a particular way, with repeated but unconnected use of set phrases and with the aid of particular accessories. Alternative terms suggested in the course of argument were “structure” or “package”. This difficulty in finding an appropriate term to describe the nature of the “work” in which the copyright subsists reflects the difficulty of the concept that a number of allegedly distinctive features of a television series can be isolated from the changing material presented in each separate performance (the acts of the performers in the talent show, the questions and answers in the quiz show etc.) and identified as an “original dramatic work”. No case was cited to their Lordships in which copyright of the kind claimed had been established.” </p>

This has been held to be arguable, see <span style="font-style:italic">Robin George Le Strange Meakin v British Broadcasting Corporation</span> [2010] EWHC 2065 (Ch), at [30].  Each case will turn on its facts.   But to succeed a claimant would still have to base its case on particular copyright works – in the case of dramatic works, fixed by some means of recording the performances.  In the present instance, because the works relied on by UOGB are cut free from particular performances it seems to me </p>

It is not enough for UOGB to say that the pleaded lists of elements are certain – so were their equivalents in <span style="font-style:italic">Green</span>.  There is, at the least, uncertainty about the number of musicians, the precise nature of their formal attire, the particular music played (any will do and in any order), which songs are to be sung and in what order and what is to be spoken by way of jokes or otherwise.  Secondly, the vast array of alternative performances which would infringe the two formats gives rise to the second vice: lack of unity. </p>

As to the latter, most of the pleaded elements of the First and Second Dramatic Works could be found in a symphony orchestra.  The additional features are that (i) the instruments are solely (or in the case of the First Dramatic Work almost solely) ukuleles, (ii) the musicians sing, (iii) the musicians deliver monologues and (iv) they introduce themselves with the words “We are the Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain”.  Clearly performances by UKUO do not involve the last of these, so attention would have focussed on the first three, but also on the differences in songs, theme tunes and spoken words performed.  Perhaps for that reason this approach to infringement was not pursued by UOGB. </p>
