Sofaworks denies both infringement of the CTMs and passing off.  It also counterclaims for revocation of both CTMs for non-use pursuant to art.51 and for a declaration that both CTMs are invalid, having been registered contrary to both art.7(1)(b) and 7(1)(c) of the CTM Regulation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In its Defence to Counterclaim, Sofa Workshop admits non-use in relation to some of the goods in the respective specifications and therefore concedes that there should be partial revocation of both CTMs.  In relation to the allegation of invalidity because the marks are descriptive, aside from denying the allegation Sofa Workshop argues that (i) it applies only in relation to sofas, (ii) the CTMs have acquired a distinctive character in relation to sofas and (iii) if the allegation is made good and there is no acquired distinctive character, the specification of the CTMs can be appropriately narrowed to neutralise the objection.</p>

The CJEU rejected a challenge to the finding of the Court of First Instance that this qualified as genuine use of the national Spanish mark.

That article allows a proprietor whose Community mark has been revoked for non-use to request that it be converted into a national trade mark application in a Member State in which there has been genuine use.  It was argued that the availability of conversion led to the conclusion that genuine use in one Member State could never by itself qualify as genuine use in the Community as a whole.  The Court said this:</p>

In such a case, use of the Community trade mark on that territory might satisfy the conditions both for genuine use of a Community trade mark and for genuine use of a national trade mark.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Court’s ‘some justification for thinking’ could be taken to imply that in the general run of things – in the absence of one or more countervailing considerations – genuine use in just one Member State will not be sufficient to qualify as genuine use in the Community as a whole.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second argument presented to the Court (see [52]) was that a condition of genuine use should be that the trade mark has been used in a substantial part of the Community and that this may correspond to the territory of a single Member State.  The argument was advanced by analogy with the Court’s ruling as to the meaning of ‘reputation in the Community’ in the context of art.9(1)(c) of the CTM Regulation (see in particular <span style="font-style:italic">PAGO International GmbH v Tirolmilch Registrierte Genossenschaft mbH </span>(C-301/07) [2010] ETMR 5, at [27]-[29]).   The argument was rejected for two reasons.  The first was that ‘genuine use in the Community’ is not analogous to ‘reputation in the Community’ within the meaning of art.9(1)(c).  More importantly for present purposes, in giving its second reason the Court said there was a reasonable expectation that use of a Community mark should extend to more than one Member State, thereby again implying that this is a default requirement. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Although the Court did not develop its reasoning for the distinction between national and Community marks, it is possible to see what it might have been.  A rough and ready assumption can be made that a trade mark proprietor who sells his products to one customer in one town in Spain may in due course wish to trade all across that country.  This justifies maintenance of the mark for the whole of Spain.  It can not in the same way be assumed that a trader in one Member State will wish to expand his trade across the EU.  Accordingly in order to maintain a Community mark, some evidence should be required that the mark has been used to create or maintain a share in the market for the relevant goods or services across a section of the EU extending beyond one Member State.  Looked at another way, an applicant for a Community mark must be taken to intend to use it outside one Member State and has five years in which to justify his presumed intention.  Otherwise he risks having to make do with a national mark by conversion and leaving the sign in question free for use elsewhere in the Community.</p>

The claimant brought proceedings for infringement of its UK and Community trade marks, both for the words ‘Crate &amp; Barrel’.  The claimant applied for summary judgment, in relation to the UK mark only.  The application was dismissed.  One of the main issues before the court was whether there had been use of the mark in the United Kingdom.  There were only two alleged acts of infringement.  One was an advertisement in an issue of <span style="font-style:italic">Homes &amp; Gardens</span>, a magazine which is published in the UK and which circulates in this country and in Ireland.  The defendant argued that even if it had placed the advertisement in a magazine which had a substantial UK circulation, it was solely targeted at readers in the Irish republic, no products had ever been sold to the UK and that therefore there was no use of the mark in the UK.  Jacob J said this:</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.00in">“[19] … The right question, I think, is to ask whether a reasonable trader would regard the use concerned as ‘in the course of trade in relation to goods’ within the Member State concerned. Thus if a trader from state X is trying to sell goods or services <span style="font-style:italic">into </span>state Y, most people would regard that as having a sufficient link with state Y to be ‘in the course of trade’ there. But if the trader is merely carrying on business in X, and an advertisement of his slips over the border into Y, no businessman would regard that fact as meaning that he was trading in Y. This would especially be so if the advertisement were for a local business such as a shop or a local service rather than for goods. I think this conclusion follows from the fact that the Directive is concerned with what <span style="font-style:italic">national </span>law is to be, that it is a law governing what traders cannot do, and that it is unlikely that the Directive would set out to create conflict within the internal market. So I think Mr Miller is right. One needs to ask whether the defendant has any trade here, customers buying goods or services for consumption here. It was that sort of concept I had in mind in <a href="http://login.westlaw.co.uk/maf/wluk/app/document?src=doc&amp;linktype=ref&amp;context=12&amp;crumb-action=replace&amp;docguid=I469DDFE0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9">

Mr Staden also exhibited evidence of a few occasional tables having been sold between February 2011 and March 2013.  Andrea Summers, Store Manager of Sofa Workshop said that there were about 10 aerobed mattresses in stock but her evidence was not clear in that she may have been referring to entire aerobeds, of which she said that one was typically sold per month.  Mr Staden I think clarified matters.  Under the heading ‘Mattresses’ in his witness statement, he unambiguously indicated that what he meant by ‘mattresses’ was aerobed style inflatable mattress beds.  This was confirmed by the exhibited orders.  I take the view that use of the mark in relation to these goods was use in relation to beds.

The evidence suggested that sales of ‘textiles’ by Sofa Workshop amounted only to sales of fabric lengths.  ‘Textile articles’, which amounts to any article made from textiles, is broad.  I think the average consumer would sub-divide that category into more specific items.  Sofa Workshop’s evidence concerned the sale of scatter cushions, bolsters and throws.  Bolsters belong better in class 20, which leaves cushions and throws.  Sofaworks conceded that ‘loose covers of sofas and chairs’ should be included and consequently I think a fair specification would be:</p>

The sign ‘1000’ alludes to a quantity and will immediately be perceived by the relevant public, without further thought, as a description of the characteristics of the goods in question, in particular the number of pages and works, amount of data, or the number of puzzles in a collection, or the ranking of items referred to in them. That conclusion cannot be invalidated by the fact that the mark applied for is composed only of figures, since … the missing information may be readily identified by the relevant public, the association between the figure and those characteristics of the goods in question being immediate.</p>

This strengthens the descriptive relationship that exists from the point of view of the average consumer between the goods in question and the [sign ‘1000’]. The court considered that, in that context, the average consumer would perceive 1000 as an indication of the number of puzzles, and for that reason it was unregistrable.”</p>

Although the entire passage repays reading, I will summarise his three points as: (i) how factual and objective is the relationship between an indication and the product or one of its characteristics? (ii) how readily is the message of the indication conveyed? and (iii) how significant or central to the product is the characteristic?  Asking these questions will assist a fact-finding tribunal to determine whether it is likely that a particular indication may be used in trade to designate a characteristic of goods.”</p>

However, that meaning must be analysed in relation to the goods covered in the trade mark application (see paragraph 17 above). In that perspective, the word sign in question is perfectly appropriate to designate goods capable of being used in a nursery and, therefore, for use by babies or young children. Since the goods in question are all capable of being intended, exclusively or potentially, for those users, the relevant public will easily establish a direct and specific link between the sign and the goods in question. The fact, relied upon by the applicant, that the goods covered can obviously be used outside a nursery does not undermine that conclusion, since, for the average consumer, that possibility does not affect his understanding of the intended purpose of the goods in question.</p>

In other words, the characteristic must matter to the average consumer in that it affects his or her perception of the goods or services.  Mr Silverleaf referred me to no authority for this proposition of law and I do not accept it.  For instance, if POST OFFICE is descriptive of the sort of goods one might buy from a post office, there is no requirement in law, so far as I am aware, that the average consumer must be shown to care whether the goods come from a post office rather than, say, a stationer, in order for art.7(1)(c) to apply (see <span style="font-style:italic">Koninklijke KPN Nederland NV v Benelux-Merkenbureau</span> (Case C363/99) [2004] ECR I-1619).  Besides, in the present case it seems that the average consumer probably does care that a sofa comes from a sofa workshop because Sofa Workshop itself is at some pains to advertise the fact to its potential purchasers (see above).</p>

As the General Court stated, a mark which is descriptive to a native English speaker is liable to be equally descriptive elsewhere because of the widespread use of English: the Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands and Cyprus were cited.  Ireland and Malta must also be taken into account, where English is an official language.  In order to satisfy art.52(2), Sofa Workshop must prove acquired distinctiveness in all such countries.</p>

I find that the CTMs have not acquired a distinctive character within the meaning of art.52(2) in relation to sofas and related goods.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A particular feature of these proceedings has been the commercial strategy pursued by Sofa Workshop to gain an advantage over Sofaworks in online marketing.  Until December 2013 Sofaworks traded as ‘CSL’.  From the time of its change of name, or since very shortly thereafter, Sofa Workshop has conducted a campaign of purchasing ‘sofaworks’ as a Google adword.  The principal consequence has been that when consumers have searched for ‘sofaworks’ online, Google has presented a Google advertisement for Sofa Workshop much higher in the list than that Sofaworks’ advertisement.  Consequently those searching have been preferentially shown Sofa Workshop’s phone number and a link to Sofa Workshop’s website even though they were searching for ‘sofaworks’.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I should make it plain that it was not suggested by Sofaworks that there is anything improper in this sort of strategy for gaining Google prominence.  It is now a regular feature of marketing in many commercial sectors.  But from the point of view of a potential claimant in an action for trade mark infringement or passing off it carries a risk.  Online confusion which might formerly have provided a potent source of relevant evidence will in many instances be neutralised because of the impossibility of distinguishing art.9(1)(b) confusion or a misrepresentation from confusion merely generated by the claimant’s Google strategy.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Quite a lot of time was devoted to analysing how much effect this strategy had on the evidence of confusion.  No clear picture emerged.  However, as Sofaworks acknowledged, while the phenomenon of Sofa Workshop’s Google advertisement appearing prominently in response to a search for ‘Sofaworks’ occurred in the weeks immediately after Sofaworks’ rebranding from CSL to its present name in January 2014, it tailed off rapidly thereafter because of the number of searches under its name and the way that search engines work.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Sofaworks also alleged that Sofa Workshop’s strategy went beyond the commercially acceptable.  For a five week period during November and December 2014 one of the paid online advertisements placed by Sofa Workshop read ‘Sofaworks Sofa Workshop’.  Sofa Workshop has admitted that this should not have happened and blamed it on a mistake by a media company employee.  Also, in October and November 2014 an advertisement for autumn sales of sofas was placed by Sofa Workshop in the middle of a recruitment notice placed by Sofaworks.  This was also said to have been a mistake.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The conceptual meaning of ‘Sofa Workshop’ is clear and I have already discussed it in the context of the descriptive nature of the CTMs.  With regard to ‘Sofaworks’, Jason Tyldesley, who is the Chief Executive Officer of Sofaworks, acknowledged that ‘works’ can mean a factory or works where products (such as sofas) are made.  I agree with him.  A ‘furniture works’ would be an example.  I think the average consumer would know that one possible meaning of a ‘sofa works’ is a place where sofas are made.  I have accepted Sofaworks’ strong contention that ‘Sofa Workshop’ is descriptive of the place of manufacture of sofas.  Even though it consists of one word, I think the same applies with almost equal force to ‘Sofaworks’.</p>

It may be that consumers have become used to the idea that there are several sofa retailers with ‘Sofa’ in their name and that each is independent of the other.

Yet in the light of these three factors, namely (i) a descriptive allusion within the accused sign, (ii) the extent of side-by-side use of mark and sign and (iii) the circumstances in which the average consumer would download from the internet the defendant’s app complained of, Floyd LJ held that it was not appropriate to make a finding of infringement without testing it by reference to the evidence of confusion (at [160]-[161]).  In fact, even though Floyd LJ categorised the evidence of confusion as ‘secondary evidence’, on the facts of that case it was enough to overturn his initial view on the likelihood of confusion.  Taking the secondary evidence into account he was not prepared to reverse the finding of no infringement by the judge.  Floyd LJ explained that the principal reason for this was the extent of side-by-side use of mark and sign, which would have been expected to produce far more abundant evidence of confusion by the date of the trial than was the case (at [181]).</p>

A lot of time was spent analysing statistics from both sides of searches and website visits.  Part of this was in order to identify trends as they appeared from prepared graphs and thus to draw inferences of confusion and to dispel the suggestion that Google adword purchasing by either side had neutralised the impact of all of this evidence.  Some of the evidence was presented by Sofaworks for the opposite purpose – to show that adword purchasing had indeed been the real source of any apparent confusion.

I don’t think that is right.  I accept that the instances of confusion relied on by Sofa Workshop were not each fire tested to exclude any possibility of the confusion being irrelevant.  But Sofaworks itself assumed that in those cases where it was approached by an individual wishing to contact Sofa Workshop there had been confusion between Sofa Workshop and Sofaworks on the part of that individual.  No explanation for such confusion in these instances was offered other than the obvious one: the similarity between the parties’ names.  I think it is reasonable to make a similar broad assumption with regard to Sofa Workshops’ evidence of confusion.</p>

But that could never happen.  Relevant confusion in the mind of consumers will always be difficult to detect.  For instance, if an individual sees an advertisement for Sofa Workshop’s products, mistakenly goes to a Sofaworks store in the belief that it is the same retailer and finds a sofa which he or she likes enough to buy, there is no reason for that mistake to emerge.  Also, measuring instances of confusion against the total number of either Sofa Workshop’s or Sofaworks’ customers is based on a false premise.  The relevant base comprises those customers who are aware of Sofa Workshop as a trade mark and have also become aware of the Sofaworks sign.  It is not possible for me to know how many people fall within that group.</p>

The defendant could have a very small business.  If there is no need for relevant actual consumers to be aware of the defendant’s sign, then even if every one of them who comes across the sign is confused the proportion of relevant actual consumers who are confused would still be very small.</p>

Probably the same applies to the guarantee of quality of the goods and services.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For the reasons stated above in relation to whether Sofa Workshop’s CTMs have acquired distinctive character in the UK, I find that Sofa Workshop has goodwill in its business in England and Wales associated in the public mind with its trading name ‘Sofa Workshop’.  Notwithstanding the descriptive qualities of that trading name when used in relation to sofas and related goods and services, it has acquired a secondary meaning in the mind of the relevant public in England and Wales, that is to say as a badge of origin for such goods and services, see <span style="font-style:italic">Reddaway v Banham </span>[1896] A.C. 199, at 212-213.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In <span style="font-style:italic">Moroccanoil Israel Ltd v Aldi Stores Ltd </span>[2014] EWHC 1686 (IPEC); [2015] F.S.R. 4, I considered the proportion of the relevant public to which the defendant’s trade name must constitute a misrepresentation for the second element of passing off to be satisfied (at [13]-[16]).  I concluded that it had to be sufficient to cause material damage to the goodwill of the claimant.  I maintain the same criterion in this case.  For the reasons given in relation to infringement of the CTMs, I find that Sofaworks’ use of its SOFAWORKS sign results in a representation to a proportion of the relevant public in England and Wales that the goods and services of Sofaworks come from a source which is the same as, or is associated in the course of trade with, Sofa Workshop.  That proportion is sufficient for Sofaworks’ acts to cause material damage to Sofa Workshop’s goodwill.  It therefore constitutes a substantial proportion, that is to say enough to warrant a finding of misrepresentation on the part of Sofaworks.</p>

Had they been otherwise I would have found that they have been infringed by Sofaworks.  Sofa Workshop succeeds in its claim for passing off.</p>
