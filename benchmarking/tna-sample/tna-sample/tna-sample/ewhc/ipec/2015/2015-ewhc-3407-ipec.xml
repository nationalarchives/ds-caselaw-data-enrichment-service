	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in;text-indent:0.00in">The Claimant (“<span style="font-weight:bold">HHO</span>”) is an independent music distributor. Its case at trial has shifted from its pleaded case, but it now claims that copyright in each of the Recordings vested in the Second Defendant, a management company owned by Gordon Lorenz and his wife and through which Gordon Lorenz worked (“<span style="font-weight:bold">GLPL</span>”), as the author and first owner of copyright upon creation of each of the Recordings. HHO claims it is an exclusive licensee of some of the Recordings pursuant to an agreement with GLPL of February 2008, and the owner of copyright in the remainder of the Recordings pursuant to an assignment from GLPL of December 2008. It brings this claim as exclusive licensee to those Recordings marked with an asterisk in Annex 1 and as copyright owner of the rest of the Recordings. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in;text-indent:0.00in">HHO claims copyright infringement in the Recordings by the copying, issuing copies to the public and communicating to the public by Pickwick 2 of those Recordings and adaptations of those Recordings on various albums within a collection of CDs and digital downloads possessed, sold or let for hire or offered or exposed for sale or hire and distributed by it under the name “The Shows Collection” from October 2009 (“<span style="font-weight:bold">the Pickwick 2 Issued Recordings</span>”). It also claims secondary infringement as set out in the Claim. It seeks damages or an account of profits and injunctive relief.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in;text-indent:0.00in">Pickwick 2 is an independent music publisher and distributor. It accepts that it has no right, title or interest in the Recordings and, subject to paragraph 7 below, that the release of the Pickwick 2 Issued Recordings infringes copyright in those Recordings in the manner claimed. However, it denies that HHO is the owner or exclusive licensee of those copyrights and seeks dismissal of the Claim. It advances a positive case in the Amended Defence that the rights were owned by Pickwick 1/Carlton from the date of creation of the Recordings and never assigned to GLPL. Accordingly it asserts that GLPL had no rights capable of exclusive license or assignment to HHO in 2008.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in;text-indent:0.00in">Alternatively, if GLPL did own the copyright in the Recordings in 2008, Pickwick 2 denies that GLPL assigned such rights to HHO. To the extent that GLPL exclusively licensed them to HHO, it pleads a defence to infringement as it claims the Pickwick 2 Issued Recordings were released with the consent of GLPL.  </p>

He had worked with Mr Lorenz on a number of deals from 1999 until Mr Lorenz’s death in 2011 and in his evidence described him as a friend. Mr Hadaway is visually impaired and accordingly could not see documentation, but counsel read him those sections of documents they wished to question him on and he had no difficulty in responding to those questions. Mr Hadaway was closely cross-examined. He made a good witness who gave clear evidence on certain fundamental matters. He was careful only to give evidence that fell within the boundaries of his personal knowledge and resisted Mr Edwards’ attempts to get him to generalise about music industry “norms”. He readily admitted when he could not remember something but overall his memory appeared to be good. </p>

He sought to assist the court to the best of his ability and gave his evidence carefully and precisely.

Mr Diplock did his best to assist the court and gave his evidence fairly but his memory was poor. He was confused about the date on which he joined Pickwick 1/Carlton, originally stating it to be a date some years later than he eventually accepted it was. He remembered being present at about six meetings relating to the Shows Collection with Gordon Lorenz and others from Pickwick 1, but was unable to provide any detail of what was discussed at those meetings or when they were held. In cross-examination he recalled a Pickwick 1 executive, Walter Woyda, telling him in the presence of Mr Lorenz that he believed the copyright in the Recordings was owned by Carlton.  He described Mr Lorenz as “<span style="font-style:italic">not jumping out of his chair to object</span>”. This evidence was not contained in his witness statement. It was vague as to timing and location of the making of the statement.  Given Mr Diplock’s otherwise relatively poor memory of the events of that time, I give it accordingly little weight.  </p>

It evidences this in the form of an invoice from GLPL for £1440 plus VAT of 1 August 2009, which simply states “<span style="font-style:italic">Buyout physical and digital for 46 titles</span>”.

It was never shown to Mr Lorenz and it was never signed. At its highest, therefore, it evidences only that Pickwick 2 believed GLPL owned the copyright in the Recordings at the time it was produced.  </p>

Its pleaded case is that it collaborated with Mr Lorenz in doing so. HHO disputes that. Mr Betts accepted in cross-examination that he knew Pickwick 2 had no rights to the Recordings when it did so, but had taken a calculated risk. He said, “<span style="font-style:italic">It was our belief that the copyright had been vacated. We couldn’t find where the rights had gone from Pickwick 1/Carlton. We couldn’t believe Gordon Lorenz had the rights</span>”. Mr Hartley also accepted that Pickwick 2 had no copyright or other right to release the Pickwick 2 Issued Recordings. He said, “<span style="font-style:italic">With a lot of Pickwick stuff it was almost a presumption in the industry that rights vacated. We avoid licensing. We focus on public domain. It’s probably not correct, it’s probably not appropriate, but that’s the way it was</span>.” </p>

The defendant argued on various grounds that it owned the copyright.  One argument was that it had commissioned the creation of the copyright work in question by the claimant and therefore the defendant owned the copyright in equity.  Lightman J analysed the law on this question in detail from p640 to 644.  The whole analysis is relevant to the case before me.  It was approved in full by the Court of Appeal in R </span>

HHO’s case is that GLPL is the person by whom arrangements necessary for the making of the Recordings were made, and therefore the author of them. As the author of the Recordings it is the first owner of copyright in them. Mr Riordan submits that any submission by Pickwick 2 that the Recordings were commissioned works are irrelevant, “<span style="font-style:italic">absent a written assignment which does not occur</span>”, since the CDPA 88 does not contain any provision by which copyright vests in a commissioner of sound recordings. Mr Riordan submits in his skeleton that Pickwick 2 does not plead or suggest that such a written assignment exists and “<span style="font-style:italic">does not put forward any executed assignments to show how copyright could have been assigned by GLPL at any point since the creation of the Recordings</span>”.  </p>

Pickwick 2 now advances a positive case through its Amended Defence that Pickwick 1 was the author and first owner of copyright in the Recordings as the person by whom arrangements necessary for the making of the sound recordings were made. However, in Mr Edwards’ closing he made clear submissions that, even if the court does not find that Pickwick 1 was the author of the Recordings, it remains for HHO to prove on the balance of probabilities that Pickwick 1 did not obtain the rights of copyright in some other way, in order to successfully rebut the section 105 presumptions upon which Pickwick 2 relies. I accept this as a correct analysis of the law. Mr Edwards submits that in such a case, the copyright may have been obtained by Pickwick 1: (i) as commissioner of the Recordings, by express provision in the 1992 Agreement that the rights of copyright in the Recordings should vest in Pickwick 1; or (ii) if GLPL was the author and first owner of the copyright in the Recordings, by a written assignment of the copyright from GLPL to Pickwick 1 in the 1992 Agreement or later assignment.  </p>

HHO’s case on ownership is based purely upon GLPL’s alleged authorship of them. Mr Riordan submits merely, without mentioning the 1992 Agreement directly, that “<span style="font-style:italic">the arrangement between GLPL and Pickwick 1 was simply that Pickwick 1 was to have a licence to exploit the Recordings. This was to be exclusive for a fixed period of time…</span>”. HHO’s alternative case is that the GLPL and Pickwick 1 were joint authors and joint first owners of copyright in the Recordings. </p>

He described attending A&amp;R meetings with Mr Lorenz and others, in which the production of various albums for the Shows Collection was discussed in the mid 1990s although he was unable to give credible evidence if this was towards the beginning of the process in 1992/1993, or later. He described Mr Lorenz as heavily involved in the creation of the Recordings, but was unable to say which aspects were handled by GLPL and which were handled by Pickwick 1/Carlton. In particular he had no knowledge of who set the budget for an album.  His evidence was therefore of limited assistance to the court. He described Mr Lorenz as actively participating in a two way process in which he discussed potential albums and artists with Pickwick 1/Carlton A&amp;R and sales employees. He described Mr Woyda as having a very good knowledge of </p>

Mr Hadaway’s evidence is that Mr Lorenz had told him that he had spotted a gap in the market for the cost-effective recording of hits from musicals, being performed by well known artists, which could then be released as mid-price or budget recordings. Mr Diplock said that Mr Woyda at Pickwick 1 came up with a “<span style="font-style:italic">change of direction where Pickwick 1 would start to produce its own music instead of releasing the music of others</span>” and had come up with the name “the Shows Collection”.

In my judgment, these allegations do not accord with the lack of any documentary evidence, save the Pickwick/Carlton Statements, in support of Pickwick 2’s contention that Pickwick 1 ever owned the copyright in the Recordings. Finally, it does not accord with the very long, busy and successful career of Mr Lorenz as a highly respected independent record producer.

Mr Edwards submits that HHO needs to show that Pickwick 1 had not become the owner by some other means, but there is no evidence of any kind that there can have been any means other than the 1992 Agreement. The section 105 CDPA 88 presumptions do not afford Pickwick 2 any real corroborative evidence on this point, as the earliest presumption arises from the copyright statement showing Pickwick 1 as the copyright owner in 1993. There is no evidence of a later assignment to Pickwick 1 between the execution of the 1992 Agreement in November 1992 and the end of 1993. If there had been such an agreement, I would expect to see some reference to it in the 1993 Pickwick Correspondence File. There is none.

The difficulty which arises from Mr Hartley’s acceptance that at least some of the CDs are not the first issued versions, is that there is no evidence of the date of re-issue of those particular CDs to the public, save that they must date from after Pickwick 1 changed its name to Carlton in July 1995 and before the Point receivers were appointed in August 2000.

I have found there is no evidence of a later assignment to Pickwick 1. Indeed, it appears to be impossible to reconcile the evidence with a scenario where the copyright in the Recording was owned by Pickwick 1/Carlton in accordance with the Pickwick/Carlton Statements. Mr Betts almost said as much in crossexamination when he said, “<span style="font-style:italic">From our investigations it was our belief that the rights had been vacated. We couldn’t find where the copyrights had gone from Pickwick 1/Carlton. We couldn’t believe GLPL had the rights</span>”.  In my judgment it is more likely than not that the reason Pickwick 2 couldn’t find out ‘where the copyrights had gone’ from Pickwick 1/Carlton, was because the copyrights were never owned by Pickwick 1/Carlton.  </p>

Mr Santilli suggested that they were just template wording with the publication dates dropped in, again suggesting a mistake in the art or marketing department.

It is odd that such an agreement would be entered into if both parties actually intended to assign those rights, as Mr Hadaway states. It is particularly odd that this agreement, which is meant to rectify that mistake, does not use the word “assignment” within it, although he accepts that is not a requirement for an effective copyright assignment. However, he submits, the agreement is not effective to assign copyright because of the lack of clarity to Clause 7.  </p>
