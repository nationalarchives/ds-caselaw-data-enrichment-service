	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.36in;text-indent:0.00in">This is a case about a range of retro-style motor scooters based on the wellknown Lambretta scooters of the 1960s.  The Claimants’ range is sold under the marque Scomadi.  The dispute is about 3 different scooter models, each of which is made in China by the additional counterclaimant (“Hanway”) and which D3 wishes to distribute in the UK.  These 3 models are generally referred to as the Royal Alloy scooters, but more particularly are the GT, the GP mark I (“GP1), and the GP mark II (“GP2”).   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.36in;text-indent:0.00in">The background is that the Claimants came up with the idea of re-launching updated versions of the classic Lambretta scooters, and entered into two agreements with Hanway (referred to as the Design and Manufacture Agreement, and the Supplementary Agreement) relating to the production thereof.  This relationship later broke down, and resulted in the present litigation.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.36in;text-indent:0.00in">The parties to the present litigation fall into two groups.  I will refer generally to the Claimants (ie the two Scomadi companies, which are in the same control and ownership) as “the Claimants”, and to the Defendants to the original action plus Hanway as being “the Defendants” for ease of reference save where it is necessary to distinguish between them (as it is, for instance, in relation to the contractual claims).   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.36in;text-indent:0.00in">These proceedings are complicated by a wide range of claims and counterclaims covering breach of contract, trade mark infringement, passing off, Registered Community Design (“RCD”) infringement, UK unregistered design right infringement, negligent misrepresentation, negligent misstatement, infringement of copyright, and rescission .  As a result of various case management orders made on previous occasions, notably the order of Morgan J removing unregistered design right issues relating to the GP1 and GP2 scooters from the trial; and the cooperation of the parties, including the Defendants’ acceptance that the GT infringes some of C1’s unregistered design rights, the list of issues for trial reduced to the following. </p>

There is no reason in principle why parties to a contract should not agree that a certain state of affairs should form the basis for the transaction, whether it be the case or not. For example, it may be desirable to settle a disagreement as to an existing state of affairs in order to establish a clear basis for the contract itself and its subsequent performance. Where parties express an agreement of that kind in a contractual document neither can subsequently deny the existence of the facts and matters upon which they have agreed, at least so far as concerns those aspects of their relationship to which the agreement was directed. The contract itself gives rise to an estoppel: see Colchester Borough Council v Smith [1991] Ch. </span>

It was not put to him that there was anything incorrect about these exhibits.  The Claimants’ case was instead that these exhibits only showed that Hanway had done a limited amount of design work.  Mr Sanderson was dismissive of Hanway’s design contribution generally, calling it mere “productionisation”.  In his view this was not enough to create any rights.  Mr Chen disputed Mr Sanderson’s evidence on this topic.  He explained that the CAD drawings done by the Claimants largely focussed on the outside of individual panels, or how they connected together.  Mr Chen was not challenged on this.   </p>

The whole reason why the First Claimant approached Hanway in the first place was in order to turn its CAD drawings into designs for production-ready moulds.  One would not expect these detailed changes to have a major effect on the overall visual appearance of the original design.  However it does not follow that Hanway’s design contribution must have been trivial or unimportant.  This was because Hanway’s design changes were intended to implement the designs shown in the CAD drawings, as opposed to modifying them.  In particular these design changes were intended to make each and every part of the scooter fit together in a way which was suitable for mass production, as Mr Chen explained.  In short Hanway started off with CAD drawings which could not be used for manufacturing purposes and used them to create designs which could be so used.   </p>

This is apparent from an email sent by Cathy Huang, then Sales Manager of Hanway, to Mr Olsthoorn’s wife on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2013.  Ms Huang explained that when Hanway first saw a sample of the Claimants’ scooter (which was at a trade fair in Cologne), Hanway estimated that it would cost less than 150 000 euros to bring it to production, but that <span style="font-style:italic">”we now have invested more than $300 000 on this project not including all the staff costs, and we didn’t save any cost which is necessary for the model”.</span>  Ms Huang went on to propose that Mr Olsthoorn contribute another $100 000 to Hanway’s costs.  Mr Chen confirmed the contents of this email in his oral evidence, and he was not challenged on any of the statements made therein.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">I have found it difficult to quantify the precise extent of the design work which Hanway which actually did in order to create the final production designs.  However that precise extent does not matter since I am in no doubt that Hanway’s contribution to these final production designs was on any view significant.  I base this upon the evidence I have considered in paragraph [26][38] above, excluding the Elvis Lv email and Mr Chen’s 80% figure.  Mr Sanderson did not agree that Hanway’s design contribution was significant, but this was largely because of his view that “productionisation” could not create any relevant rights and I have rejected that argument for the reasons set out above.   </p>

I am sure this is his genuinely held view today, after so much litigation, but I am not sure that it would have been his view at the time given the amount of money which he had already invested in it by then.  However I am sure that if the SA had not been agreed in the form in which it was signed, Mr Chen would certainly have insisted on some sort of additional compensation or security (eg increased down payments) from the Claimants before going into any production.  In such circumstances the project would have become significantly more disadvantageous for the Claimants, to say nothing of delay. This is not an unrealistic analysis since it seems to be much the same as the Claimants themselves thought at the time.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">Drawing all of these points together, it seems to me that there are enough detailed differences to support the validity of both RCD2 and RCD1 over the pleaded prior art, in the sense that both of these designs are new and have individual character having regard to the same.  The major reason is the side panels, with the footplate having less impact.  This is more obvious in the case of RCD2 since the profile of its side panels is noticeably different to that of both the Jet 200 and the SX200.  However in both cases the scope of the monopoly conferred by registration is narrow and relies on detailed differences with the prior art.   </p>

In my judgment this is close to the borderline so far as RCD2 is concerned.  The difference in the footplate profile is not so trivial it can be ignored entirely, and nor can the rear indicators plus metal rack, but the similarity in the side panel size and profile is more important in design terms.  I conclude that the overall impression on the informed user is not different, so the GT infringes RCD2.
