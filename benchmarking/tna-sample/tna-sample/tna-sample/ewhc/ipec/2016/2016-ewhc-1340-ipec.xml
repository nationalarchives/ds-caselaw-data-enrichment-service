Remote computer facilities are provided to customers who can then store, manage and process their data on line.  The customers share and pay for use of the remote facilities, thus avoiding the need to invest in an installation which is dedicated to their own use.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Skyscape’s services are provided under the umbrella of a government scheme called ‘G-Cloud’.  G-Cloud enables public sector organisations to use cloud services provided by companies in the private sector on a pay-as-you-go basis.  In some cases the G-Cloud service enables the public sector body to provide access to the general public.  An example mentioned in evidence was the facility created for HMRC which enables taxpayers to file returns online as well as permitting HMRC to process the returns.</p>

Full details of four European Union trade marks and one United Kingdom trade mark were annexed to the letter (“the Cited Marks”) together with a list of 27 others.  It drew attention to what was then the quite recent judgment of Asplin J in <span style="font-style:italic">British Sky Broadcasting Group plc v Microsoft Corporation </span>[2013] EWHC 1826 (Ch); [2014] IP &amp; T 1, in which it was held, among other things, that the defendants’ use of the sign ‘SkyDrive’ for a product providing an on-line storage facility infringed the Sky Group’s registered trade marks for the word SKY.  Sections of the judgment were quoted in the letter.  A deadline of 4pm on 14 August 2014 was given to Skyscape to provide specified undertakings, in default of which the Sky Group reserved the right to bring proceedings.</p>

Four of the Cited Marks are owned by the third defendant and the other is owned by the second defendant.  There is no counterclaim for infringement by Sky and no challenge by Skyscape to either the validity or scope of the Cited Marks. </p>

Outside the threats provisions of the Trade Marks Act 1994 (s.21) the English jurisdiction for a DNI in relation to trade mark rights is derived solely from CPR Part 40.20 and the common law.  Council Regulation (EC) No. 207/2009 (“the Trade Mark Regulation”) as amended by Regulation (EU) 2015/2424 of 16 December 2015 provides that an EU Trade Mark Court has jurisdiction to grant a declaration of non-infringement of an EU Trade Mark if such an action is permitted under national law (art.96(b)).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.98in">However, as Mr Mann accepts, recent cases have adopted a more flexible approach.  Thus, in <span style="font-style:italic">Camilla Cotton Oil Co v Granadex SA</span> [1975] 1 LLR 470, [1976] 2 LLR 10, Lord Denning MR in the Court of Appeal and Lord Wilberforce in the House of Lords indicated, with varying degrees of emphasis, that the jurisdiction was not as confined as suggested by Pickford LJ, although Lord Wilberforce accepted that his words “warn us that we must apply some careful scrutiny” ([1976] 2 LLR 10, 14).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.48in">“41.<marker name="tab"/><marker name="tab"/>The approach is pragmatic. It is not a matter of jurisdiction, it is matter of discretion. The deployment of negative declarations should be scrutinised and their use rejected where it would serve no useful purpose. However, where a negative declaration would help to ensure that the aims of justice are achieved the court should not be reluctant to grant such declarations. They can and do assist in achieving justice ….</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.48in">42.<marker name="tab"/>While negative declarations can perform a positive role they are an unusual remedy insofar as they reverse the more usual roles of the parties. The natural defendant becomes a claimant and vice-versa. This can result in procedural complications and possible injustice to an unwilling ‘defendant’. This in itself justifies caution in extending the circumstances where negative declarations are granted, but, subject to the exercise of appropriate circumspection, there should be no reluctance to their being granted when it is useful to do so.”</p>

It became clear that the real application being made by Skyscape, couched in reassuring and characteristically persuasive language by Ms Michaels, was that were I to decide that the declaration in Annex 1 was too wide in this or that regard, I should make a declaration in whatever narrower form I thought appropriate.  Putting it bluntly (which Ms Michaels understandably did not), if I was not prepared to grant the DNI sought in full, Skyscape was willing to take whatever declaration it could get, at least pending any appeal.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">To see where this would lead, the starting point was the specific order sought by Skyscape.  It appears as Appendix 1 to this judgment.  It is a DNI relating to (i) the sign SKYSCAPE in a variety of fonts, alternative colours and in upper and lower case, (ii) the sign SKYSCAPE CLOUD SERVICES in similarly various presentations, and (iii) 18 logos.   For each of these signs the DNI is sought in relation to (a) 10 different types of service provided to the UK public sector in the UK and (b) the provision of services enabling transition to each of those 10 services.  It can be seen that the DNI sought covers a very large number of combinations of signs and services.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Potentially all of these combinations had to be compared with the Cited Marks.  The specifications of the five Cited Marks were long – in the case of four of them, spectacularly long.  So the possibility of infringement would have to be assessed by comparing all the combinations of signs and services contemplated in the DNI with the Cited Marks across the range of goods and services specified in each of them.  The logic of Skyscape’s case was that in the event that I were not prepared to accept the proposed DNI in full form, I should ring fence all of the combinations of Skyscape’s signs and services encompassed by the proposed order in respect of which I was prepared to grant a DNI.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I took the view that this would have been very unfair to Sky.  Sky was entitled to direct my attention to what, from its standpoint, was the most vulnerable part of the DNI.  It could point to a narrow range of Skyscape’s signs when used for a narrow range of services, or even just one of each.  In other words Sky could attempt to persuade me that Skyscape’s sign X, when used for Y services, would infringe part P of the specification of Cited Mark Q.  If I were convinced by Sky’s argument, the DNI sought would be refused.  It would be irrelevant that other combinations of Skyscape’s sign and service within the draft Order would not infringe any part of the specifications of any of the Cited Marks.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">By contrast, according to Skyscape’s preferred approach and assuming that I was not prepared to grant the DNI sought as a whole, after hearing the evidence I would be required to consider all combinations of sign and service within the draft order and then compare each combination with each field in the endless prairie of goods and services specified in Sky’s five Cited Marks.  No doubt some uses of Skyscape’s signs would not infringe some parts of the specifications (bleaching preparations, vehicles adapted for use with tidal power, vanity cases, horticulture and forestry services, etc.).  But the variables were such that there was a kaleidoscope of possible outcomes.  The point was that during the trial Mr Roberts, who appeared for Sky, would have had no clear idea where I might be tempted to draw the dividing lines between infringement and non-infringement – where I might draw the ring fences – and therefore where to direct his arguments.  Taken to extreme, his only alternative would have been exhaustively to go through all combinations of Skyscape’s signs and services, each combination to be compared with each of the goods and services specified in each of the five Cited Marks, or at least the ones that mattered to Sky, to make sure that I had been addressed on all such comparisons.  That was never going to happen.</p>

Groups of signs as used with particular groups of services could be lumped together, as could sections of the specification of each of the Cited Marks.  Ms Michaels suggested that Mr Roberts would be able to make submissions directed at groupings of signs and services when compared with just targeted sections of the specification of each of the Cited Marks.  His arguments on infringement for these groupings of sign and service would then stand or fall together.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Taking things out of order, on the second day of the trial and in support of this submission, Ms Michaels handed up a table.  The specifications of Sky’s Cited Marks were each divided into groups.  The goods or services which Sky had highlighted as being of particular concern were identified for each group.  If I understood correctly, 12 relevant groups were identified.  For each of these groups, another column stated whether any of Skyscape’s services were either (a) similar, (b) complementary or (c) dissimilar.  Unfortunately the supposed exercise in simplification broke down at this point because for many of the groups Skyscape’s services were not alleged to fall into just one of these three alternatives: some were similar, others complementary and others again dissimilar, depending on which part of the specification of the Cited Mark the comparison was directed to.  Also, the table was only concerned with similarity between Skyscape’s services and the goods and services specified in the Cited Marks.  It ignored whether, and the extent to which, each of Skyscape’s many signs identified in the draft DNI were identical or similar to each of the Cited Marks.  Nor did it take into account whether there might be different average consumers through whose eyes the comparison of mark and sign would have to be made.  Two layers of complexity were left out.   I have to say that the table had the opposite effect of the one intended.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The real problem with the table, though, was that it was produced far too late.  The categorisations of goods and services as being similar, complementary or dissimilar was Skyscape’s.  Sky was entitled to challenge the table, to direct evidence to those categorisations and to cross-examine Skyscape’s witnesses.  None of that was possible because the table emerged only after cross-examination was over.</p>

I am not sure this would have been easy, but to stand any chance of working it would have been essential for Skyscape to address this at an early stage, before the CMC, so that by the time of the CMC it could present alternative draft DNIs, of sufficiently small number to be manageable.  Both parties could then have prepared for trial on that basis.   I would add that on the facts of this case I doubt that it would ever have been appropriate for Skyscape to seek one or more alternative DNIs in any form other than being fully set out and fixed in a draft order filed in good time before the trial.</p>

This followed an earlier judgment in the trial of two actions.  In the first action Kingspan sued Rockwool and in the second action it was the other way around.  The companies were competitors and hotly contested what each was lawfully allowed to say about the other in comparative advertising campaigns.  They agreed to seek rival declarations from the court about what could be said, based on the laws of registered trade mark infringement and malicious falsehood.  In the first judgment certain declarations sought by Kingspan were made, those sought by Rockwool were not.  But Rockwell sought to make the most of the findings of fact contained in the judgment.  At a subsequent hearing Rockwool asked the court to make five alternative declarations based on those earlier findings.  Kitchin J agreed to consider this and the second time around made two of the five alternative declarations sought.  Ms Michaels said that Kitchin J’s willingness to contemplate making alternative declarations after giving judgment demonstrated just the sort of flexibility that I should emulate in the present case.</p>

Moreover Kitchin J was requested to review the consequences of five issues contested at trial.  He was not being asked to make fresh findings on a long series of points which neither party had directly addressed.</p>

It seems to me that there would have been the potential for some severe case management at the CMC, assuming Sky had not already streamlined their case.  Sky would first have been obliged to limit the scope of the specification of the Cited Marks on which they relied.  Secondly, Sky may have been ordered to adopt the grouping approach – grouping combinations of Skyscape’s signs with Skyscape’s services – so that infringement could be considered under a limited number of grouped heads.  Alternatively, Sky would have been invited to nominate a limited number of specific alleged infringements by Skyscape.  All this would have been argued out at the CMC.</p>

The final version was not served until 8 April 2016, two and a half weeks before the trial (Appendix 1).  In my view Sky was entitled to regard this document as Skyscape’s last word on the scope of the declaration it wanted.

For instance, I can see no real difficulty in granting a trade mark DNI if the declaration sought is in relation to, say, all fair and notional use of one or even a number of identified signs.  In such a case the court would test the application for a DNI by comparing the trade mark and the signs in relation to goods or services of the alleged infringer which are identical or closest to those for which the trade mark is registered – since, as I have said, the hypothesis would be that the defendant could use the sign for any goods or services.  And in such a case the court might be prepared hold that a DNI should be granted in relation to sign A, though not sign B.  Flexibility of outcome in that sense would be possible.</p>

The number of combinations of sign and service which would benefit from Skyscape’s proposed DNI is large.  In Skyscape’s perception, effectively all of them must be considered by the court so that a conclusion can be reached on infringement in respect of each of them.  In my view this contravenes Pumfrey J’s third principle in <span style="font-style:italic">Nokia</span>: the issue to be decided by the court has not been sufficiently clearly defined to render it properly justiciable.</p>

However I informed Ms Michaels that if Skyscape felt that it was able to present more limited proposed DNIs that could fairly be addressed as a whole by the court after the evidence was closed, Skyscape could serve them by the start of the following day and I would hear argument as to whether they should be considered.</p>

The limits of the proposed order are in practice known only to Skyscape.  If they had been explored, such as to make it possible to draw up an unambiguous list of Skyscape’s uses of its signs to date, any DNI could and should then have been drafted by reference to that list.

The services are accessed via an online catalogue called ‘the Digital Marketplace’.  A prospective customer follows a six-step process to identify the services it requires.  The catalogue will produce a list of results which can be further filtered.  Ultimately the potential customer will be presented with a shortlist of suitable suppliers of that service.

	      </a> at [52] and repeated above. If the mark and the sign have both been used and there has been actual confusion between them, this may be powerful evidence that their similarity is such that there exists a likelihood of confusion. But conversely, the absence of actual confusion despite side by side use may be powerful evidence that they are not sufficiently similar to give rise to a likelihood of confusion. This may not always be so, however. The reason for the absence of confusion may be that the mark has only been used to a limited extent or in relation to only some of the goods or services for which it is registered, or in such a way that there has been no possibility of the one being taken for the other. So there may, in truth, have been limited opportunity for real confusion to occur.”</p>

Since the trade mark proprietor is entitled to rely on a notional and fair use of the mark in relation to all of the goods and services in respect of which it is registered, the average consumer must be deemed to have imperfectly in mind the mark as used across the full range of specified goods and services.

That is notably the case when the earlier mark, which used to arouse immediate association with the goods and services for which it is registered, is no longer capable of doing so.”</p>

In summary, it is not necessary for the earlier mark to be unique, although the more “unique” it appears, the greater the likelihood that a later identical or similar mark will be detrimental to its distinctive character; second, the use of an identical or similar mark may suffice, in some circumstances, to cause actual and present detriment to the distinctive character of the earlier mark or to give rise to a serious likelihood that such detriment will occur in the future; and third, detriment to the distinctive character of the earlier mark is caused when that mark’s ability to identify the goods or services for which it is registered and used as coming from the proprietor of that mark is weakened.

Mr Hansford said that public sector entities would include any of the 29,000 or so entities which appear on a government website, the address of which he gave in his witness statement.  Mr Hansford described the list as ‘dynamic’, in the sense that entities are constantly being added to, or taken off the list.  It includes the British Film Institute, The Church Conservation Trust, the BBC, Channel 4.  Surprisingly, the list also includes Acer Ltd, British Telecom and KPMG.

The visual and aural similarities between ‘Sky’ and ‘Skyscape’ are obvious.  Ms Michaels concentrated, rightly in my view, on the conceptual aspects of mark and sign.  She said that although ‘scape’ was a word in the dictionary, it was not in common usage and therefore ‘Skyscape’ would be perceived only as a single word, connoting an image of the sky.  The ‘sky’ part of the word would not be singled out as having any prominence in the sign.   The average consumer would regard the mark and sign as conceptually distinct, with no real likelihood of confusion between them.</p>

There may be other such scape words that don’t come to mind.  I think the average consumer would likewise be familiar with those words.  As it happens, in my copy of the Shorter OED, among the other definitions of ‘scape’ (<span style="font-style:italic">a transgression due to thoughtlessness; a flower stalk arising directly from the root or rhizome; the first joint of the antenna of an insect</span>, and so on) there is this:</p>

For instance, as I will discuss below, in an action for infringement there can be no finding of detriment to the distinctive character of a trade mark unless the proprietor has established a change in the economic behaviour of the average consumer.  Arguably even in the context of an application for a DNI the evidential burden in respect of that issue remains with the proprietor.  Equally, detriment to the repute of a trade mark depends on the alleged infringer’s use of the mark generating a negative impact on the image of the trade mark.  Again, the evidential burden arguably remains on the proprietor even in the context of an application for a DNI.</p>

Resolving the issues arising under art.9(1)(c) is made more difficult by the fact that there is no direct evidence of any real value in relation to any of them.  This is not a criticism, but I am left to consider the evidence overall on each point, such as it is.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There was no evidence about change in economic behaviour.  But I know that Sky offers a cloud-based email service.  I think it is likely that a link between ‘Sky’ and ‘Skyscape’ is bound to lead to a ‘dilution’, ‘whittling away’ or ‘blurring’ of the SKY Mark such as to weaken its ability to serve as a badge of origin for email services, see <span style="font-style:italic">Intel </span>at [29], and thus, by inference, a change in the economic behaviour of the average consumer.  In my view Skyscape has failed to establish that there is no likelihood of detriment to the distinctive character of the SKY Mark.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">With regard to unfair advantage, Mr Roberts relied on a concession by Mr Hansford that there had been a trade mark search in 2012 by Skyscape, after Skyscape started to provide its cloud services in 2011.  The search presumably made Skyscape aware of the enormous breadth of Sky’s trade mark specifications.  Beyond that, I do not see that there is anything I can infer from the search.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I think the only material consideration available to the court, which did not require evidence, is that SKY is a very well known mark indeed.  It is likely that a significant proportion of all those interested in email services, and thus the average consumer, regard the mark favourably as denoting a large and competent supplier of TV and related services.  On balance I take the view that the link between ‘Sky’ and ‘Skyscape’ in the mind of the average consumer would enable Skyscape to benefit from the Sky’s undoubted reputation and goodwill.  Consequently Skyscape has failed to establish that unfair advantage would not be taken of the distinctive character or repute of the SKY Mark.</p>
