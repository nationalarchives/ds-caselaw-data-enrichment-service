It was clear in her oral evidence, by which time she had read the relevant underlying email documents, that she did not wholly accept what he said.

I accept that these are descriptions that can be levelled at his written evidence, which contained a great deal of commentary and argument and some intemperate accusations and language. However, in oral evidence he did not, in my judgment, present that way. He answered questions in a straightforward, candid fashion, he made concessions where appropriate, and he sought to simplify and explain the financial disclosure in a manner to assist both the court and the Claimants in their understanding of it. Accordingly I give greater weight to his oral evidence than his written evidence. Of course he has a completely different understanding of the commercial arrangement that he believes the parties reached to that of the Claimants, and to that extent he lacks objectivity, but I perceived both Mr Ragazzoni and Miss Boury as being equally certain of their own, differing understanding and they could also be described as lacking objectivity in the same way. I also note that the Claimants’ position at the start of this dispute, namely that no consent to merchandise goods was ever given to the Defendants, is now accepted by them to be wrong. It appears to me that witnesses on both sides have differing recollections and perceptions of events of 2007 to 2010 which have almost certainly solidified during the scrutiny of the litigation process and which they are now convinced are fact. Accordingly I do not prefer one witness to another </p>

The ECJ made a number of important points. First; consent amounts to renunciation of the right to the trademark proprietor, and must, therefore, be unequivocally demonstrated. Second; an intention to renounce will normally be gathered from an express statement. Third; there may be circumstances from which consent may be inferred, but it is an actual consent and not a deemed consent, that must be established. Fourth; it is, in almost all cases, for the trader to prove consent, not for the trademark proprietor to prove the absence of consent. Fifth; consent cannot be inferred from the trademark proprietor’s silence, nor from the fact that the goods carry no warning, nor from the fact that the trademark proprietor originally placed goods on the market without any further restriction on the onward sale of those goods.” </p>

It appears to be common ground that such use would be a misrepresentation to the public from which deception and damage inevitably would flow. Certainly this is the Claimants’ position which was made clear in Mr Campbell’s skeleton argument and closing submissions; Mr Lynn in cross-examination appeared to accept that proposition when put to him; and he made no submissions in closing which suggested otherwise. The Defendants’ position in the Defence that any unauthorised use by them of the Insignia would enhance the Claimants’ business, rather than damage it, because of the beneficial association with the highly respected POLISTAS brand of the First Defendant, appears to have been abandoned. </p>

I appreciate you are taking a risk (in terms of weather) but there is no date on the shirts, so I am presuming they could be used at a later date in the unlikely event that the weather is bad… I have given them the figures – and the feedback is that if we are to allow use of our logo then we should not need to pay for the 200 shirts you are offering to do for us at £10 and the caps at £5. I appreciate you are giving us a serious discount, but you will after all be making financial gain through VCP and not insignificant advertising if they are picked up in the press – which is highly likely… unless we discuss further the matter of the cost for the 200, we may be at stale-mate.”</span></p>

First, the number of free shirts offered is lower than the agreement from the previous year. Second, there is no mention of merchandising rights in this email. Mr Lynn in crossexamination said it ‘went without saying’ because ‘everyone’ knew that the deal included merchandising. Third, it contains details about advertisements, banner placement and location of trade stand which I understand is common ground actually relates to the terms of a deal agreed between the Defendants and Cowdray Park in the previous year. Ms Stanley-Hughes forwarded this email on 9 May 2008 to Cowdray Park and Liz Higgins, who confirmed those arrangements. Ms Higgins also responded with the statement <span style="font-style:italic">“the window in the month of June is irrelevant. We would want first three weeks of July.”</span> It can be seen on a later email from Ms McCarthy to Ms Stanley-Hughes of 5 June 2008 that the First Defendant did reserve one of their shop windows for the month of July 2008. </p>

It is clear from the documentary and witness evidence that in each year a new decision was required from the Claimants as to whether they were going to order shirts from the First Defendant for the VCGC that coming summer, and enter into an ‘official supplier’ arrangement, although the agreement of the previous year was used as a starting point for negotiating the new one. This is alluded to in Ms McCarthy’s email on 9 May 2008 when she refers to ‘the 2007 agreement’ in the context of seeking Ms Stanley-Hughes’ agreement to an agreement for 2008. Of course in 2011, the Claimants decided not to enter into a new agreement at all. That was their choice, in my judgment.  </p>

None of these alternatives reflect the case pleaded by the Defendants in the Amended Defence, nor were any of them set out by the Defendants’ witnesses in their witness statements, nor was Mr Lynn able to clearly articulate the legal basis of the second and third alternatives in his closing submissions.  </p>

The former contention was not put to Mr Ragazzoni by Mr Lynn, and I have no doubt that no deal was concluded at that 30 May meeting, because the offer by the First Defendant to provide 150 staff shirts to the Claimants for free was not made until 1 June 2007, which in my judgment was a key term without which the Claimants would not </p>

By a later variation of the concluded 2007 agreement, it was further agreed that (i) the First Defendant would provide the Claimants with a discount of 25% of retail price on additional purchases of merchandise; and (ii) the Claimants would provide VCGC-related props which the First Defendant would use to create a window display in the Burlington Arcade shop to promote the Branded Merchandise and the 2007 VCGC itself.  </p>

First, in my judgment, this statement was made in the context of an acknowledgment of the commercial risk that the First Defendant would be taking, by providing staff shirts to the Claimants for free. I accept Mr Lynn’s submission that it merely shows the Claimants accepting that merchandise could be sold after the VCGC itself, as Mr Ragazzoni conceded in cross-examination. Second, it is a statement made in contract negotiations. It cannot assist me in determining whether such a limitation on the sale period was actually agreed, and I cannot be satisfied on the balance of probabilities of such an express agreement given the difficulties I have identified with Mr Ragazzoni’s evidence, the lack of documentary evidence in what was a contract concluded by exchange of emails, and Mr Lynn’s and Ms McCarthy’s oral evidence that no such limitation was agreed.  </p>

However, I find as a matter of law that: (i) as no term or procedure for termination of the agreement was granted, the agreement could be terminated by the Claimants at will upon reasonable notice; and (ii) as no sell-off period was agreed, the First Defendant’s right to promote or sell existing stock also ceased on the date of termination of the agreement.  </p>

The Defendants have disclosed a draft agreement which does not appear to contain the indemnity to which the Defence refers and which, in any event, cannot help me as it is unsigned. There is no other evidence before me which supports the Defendants’ contention that the Claimants authorised Gaucho to sell merchandise branded with the Claimants’ Marks and/or Insignia, save Mr Lynn’s bare assertion. I accept Mr Soutar’s evidence and find on the balance of probabilities that the Claimants permitted use by Gaucho of the Marks and/or Insignia only on team shirts to be worn by the Gaucho polo team and not for retail sale.    </p>

Mr Campbell submits in response that there is no corroborative documentary evidence about that despite the 25 lever arch files of documents disclosed. I accept that submission. It seems to me that if there was an order of 250 units that failed quality control, there would be some documentary evidence about that but Mr Lynn puts none before me. Nor is this event mentioned in his witness evidence. Similarly there is no evidence about the First Defendant’s average wastage and short order figures. Accordingly I am not minded to give the Defendants the benefit of the doubt. I remain at 8060 units. </p>

I reject it, as an estimate entirely unsupported by evidence, in favour of the compelling evidence of actual sales presented by the Claimants.

That is about £1 per garment which is not far from the 70p per garment for which the Defendants contend. </p>

Mr Campbell identifies a number of those circumstances in his skeleton argument at paragraph 60 which I do not disagree with. He accepts that, in fact, the profit is <span style="font-style:italic">“impossible to work out given the deficiencies in the Defendants’ disclosure”</span> but, nonetheless, the Claimant’s solicitors have made an attempt to do just that, and arrived at a profit figure on unauthorised sales of just over £200,000. Mr Campbell submits that since this is almost certainly an underestimate, £120,000 is probably a more accurate guess of what a 50% profit share should be.    </p>

I accept that submission. Mr Ragazzoni conceded as much in cross-examination; (ii) a 50% profit share is not appropriate in a case such as this where all costs and risk is carried by the Defendants. This is not a joint venture where the costs and risks of the venture are shared between the parties. He suggests a figure of between 5-10% as being more appropriate and points to two agreements that he has disclosed which license the Polistas unregistered trade mark to companies in Japan and Canada for such a rate.  </p>

First, I agree with Mr Campbell that it is impossible to calculate such profits, because the Defendants have not disclosed the relevant financial information to do so; but I do not consider it appropriate to take a gross margin figure and treat it as a profit figure in those circumstances. Second, the Claimants’ suggested royalty rate of 50% is also unsupported by evidence. They offer no comparables, because as Mr Ragazzoni’s evidence makes clear, they do not license their trade marks and so they have none. The arrangement with the Defendants was, for them, </p>

However, I accept the Claimants’ submission that the comparables provided by the Defendants for use of the POLISTAS unregistered trade mark in Canada for unknown purposes, for example, is unlikely to assist me in setting the inevitably higher appropriate rate for use of the Claimants’ internationally renowned trade marks in connection with the most important polo tournament outside of Argentina.  </p>

I am satisfied that such an extremely low figure is entirely disproportionate to the benefit that the Defendants have received from their unauthorised use, not only in profits on sales of goods, but also the less tangible benefits arising from being associated with the Veuve Clicquot luxury brand.  </p>

After all, the First Defendant’s initial offer to the Second Claimant was simply that it should buy the goods at those corporate prices. The Claimants were only given free and discounted goods in return for the unlimited consent to merchandise in 2007 and limited consents to merchandise in 2008 - 2010. </p>

Similarly, the Claimants limit themselves to damages of £5,000 for sales of infringing goods for forty-six weeks a year from 2008 – 2010, when the value to the parties of the consent to sell such goods for six weeks a year was four times that. So be it. I am satisfied, broad axe aloft, that an appropriate licence fee between these two parties as willing licensor and willing licensee certainly cannot be any less than those figures contended for.  </p>
