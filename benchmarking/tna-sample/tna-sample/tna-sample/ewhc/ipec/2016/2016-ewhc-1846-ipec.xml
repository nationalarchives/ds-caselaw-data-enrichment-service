It is a family company which was set up by two brothers and a brother-in-law: Michael Melville, Peter Melville and Donall Dooley (married to their sister Noreen Mary Melville) in order to continue the existing family precast concrete business run since the mid 1970s through a previous company. Oran was incorporated in 1996 and has sold and offered for sale precast concrete products and related design and construction services in Ireland since that date and in the UK since 2008. Since its incorporation it has utilised a large number of other family members from that and the next generation as directors and employees. </p>

It also manufactures and sells precast concrete products and sells related design and construction services. It was incorporated in October 2011 and has traded in the UK since March 2012. The Second Defendant (Ross Melville) and Third Defendant (Richard Burke) are the founders and directors of Oranmore. Ross Melville was formerly a director of Oran. Richard Burke was formerly Oran’s General Manager. They are related to many of the current directors, shareholders and employees of Oran by marriage or blood. Ross Melville is Michael Melville’s son. Richard Burke was married to Donall Dooley’s daughter Linda. From October 2011 to September 2014 Ross Melville was a director of both companies, Oran and Oranmore, simultaneously.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">John Dooley presented as an articulate, courteous and controlled witness, but it was clear to me that he is hurt by, and resents, what he perceives to be the unfair actions of his first cousin and ex brother-in-law in setting up Oranmore and trading in identical products to Oran. As he gave his evidence he struck me as a non-confrontational person who would harbour that sort of deep resentment mainly in silence, only allowing it to surface in the form of occasional angry and sarcastic comments. As a witness, I found him to be basically honest but capable of misrepresenting the truth in order to further his case. I have no doubt that he felt that was justified, but of course it is not. For example, his evidence that: <span style="font-style:italic">“the negotiations which led to me signing [the Compromise Agreement] in May 2013 were all one continuous chain of discussions which started in 2011 and had nothing to do with Oranmore</span>” sits ill with Derek Duffy’s evidence, which I accept, that (i) Oran did not feel able to bring a claim for use of the Oranmore name until Richard Burke’s back pay claim had been settled; and (ii) <span style="font-style:italic">“the dispute with Richard as to his severance and his claim for €600,000 was resolved in May 2013 and it was a week or so later that we met with Acumen Business Law for the first time. We were advised to apply for a UK trade Mark for the Claimant’s trading name. I discussed this with the Claimant’s directors (with the exception of Ross… and Michael…) and we agreed that I would instruct Acumen Business Law to apply for a Trade Mark in the UK, which I subsequently did</span>”. I found Ross Melville to be a more obviously unsatisfactory witness. He was rather evasive and argumentative, resistant to giving a direct answer if he felt it might compromise his position, and on a number of occasions sought to establish what the line of questioning was seeking to establish before answering the questions. Richard Burke was less emotionally involved, gave his evidence in a more straightforward fashion and made the odd concession where necessary, but on a central point of whether he knew that Oran objected to the use of the Oranmore Signs I found him to be less than truthful. I treat the evidence of all three witnesses with some caution. For those reasons I don’t prefer the evidence of one or the other where there is a dispute, but seek corroboration from other credible evidence or the inherent probabilities of the matter before weighing the competing arguments and deciding which account is more likely than not.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I found the minor witnesses Christina Lines, Sean Sharkey and Derek Duffy to be honest and credible witnesses who did their best to assist the court. Sean Sharkey’s evidence was limited in subject matter and, ultimately, of limited assistance. I found Christina Lines to be a particularly reliable and impressive witness. Derek Duffy made appropriate admissions and was careful only to provide evidence within his own experience. I do not accept some of his evidence but I do not believe he sought to actively mislead the court.</p>

Oran had previously looked at leasing the Weeting facility in 2008, but Tarmac took a three year lease instead. That lease was coming to an end and not being renewed. In late summer of 2011 they proposed to Oran’s board that Oran acquire the lease to facilitate the expansion of Oran’s trade in the UK. Oran rejected the proposal. There is a dispute about whether this happened in late September or mid-October 2011, and how exactly it happened. Nothing turns on this for the purposes of construing the Compromise Agreement, as it is accepted by the Defendants that, at the latest, by the time of an Oran board meeting held on 18 October 2011 Richard Burke and Ross Melville knew that Oran had ceased considering acquiring the lease of the Weeting facility. </p>

At a meeting between those three parties in the first week of December, John Dooley told them that he was aware of the existence of such a company and what it was called, so they should tell him its name. They confirmed that it was called Oranmore. There is a dispute between the parties about whether there was any discussion of what the trading name of the new company would be. John Dooley’s evidence is that he asked if it would trade under that name and Ross Melville told him “it could be anything, it’s a work in progress.” Ross Melville disputes that, and both he and Richard Burke say that John Dooley did not make any comment or complaint about the name of Oranmore. That is a matter I will have to determine. I note as an aside that all parties accept that by the time of entry into the Compromise Agreement in May 2013, Oran was aware that Oranmore was trading under that name.</p>

I had a couple of good conversations with Richard on Monday and Tuesday about it and I believe if we all pull together and be straight up about things we shouldn’t have any problem. Again, I do wish ye luck with it.” </span> The Defendants rely on this as an unlimited, irrevocable consent provided by a director of Oran to use the ORANMORE Signs in renunciation of Oran’s own rights.

However that was reduced to writing by Michael Melville in the Copyright Licence, an undated document which Oranmore states was signed in ‘mid 2012’. In its entirety that states <span style="font-style:italic">“I, Michael Melville, of [home address] hereby give consent to ORANMORE PRECAST LIMITED to use the logo created by me in 1980 in my personal capacity. The logo is as indicated below; [logo].

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">John Dooley’s evidence was that the move away from Hollowcore into the UK was only ever temporary, and arose because in 2011 there were problems with transport out of Ireland connected with the peat crisis. Accordingly profit margins on Hollowcore were reduced as Hollowcore was a lower-margin, bulky, heavy and difficult to transport product. He said (i) there was no point in exporting Hollowcore at that time if there were no profits to be made; (ii) profits could be made later when the industry became busier and the transport crisis eased, as has in fact happened; (iii) there would be no point in ceasing completely when it maintained the facility to manufacture it; (iv) Oran did not at any time stop pricing Hollowcore jobs if asked and continued to fulfil orders if they could profit from them. His evidence was supported by Derek Duffy who was clear that no decision was made to cease the Hollowcore trade in the UK.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ross Melville’s evidence was that Oran decided to discontinue exporting Hollowcore to the UK save for the fulfilment of existing orders and the honouring of quotes already given. He points to monthly executive summaries preceding management produced by the finance director, Martin Hehir at the end of 2012 which show a reduction in turnover and refers to a <span style="font-style:italic">“move away from Hollowcore sales in the UK”</span>. His evidence was fundamentally undermined, in my judgment, by Oran’s financial information which shows that income attributable to UK Hollowcore sales continued through 2012, 2013 and 2014 and by Sean Sharkey’s witness evidence which is that when he was working in sales at Oran in 2011 he continued to price UK Hollowcore jobs if customers asked for a price. I prefer the evidence of Oran’s witnesses and find that no such decision was made in April 2011 or at all.</p>

His evidence is that he didn’t know that Oranmore was trading under that name until September 2012. Ross Melville denies saying this, but neither he nor Richard Burke make a positive statement that they did tell John Dooley that it would trade under that name. Mr Harbottle submits that John Dooley should have known that it was likely to trade under the name of Oranmore because companies usually do trade under their own name. I am not convinced by that argument – equally companies very often trade under a different name. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I prefer the evidence of John Dooley for the following reasons. First, his evidence was unshaken in cross-examination and I found him to be credible on this point. Second, in my judgment, the email of John Dooley of 11 June 2012, in which he adopted the Oranmore Precast signature and logo, suggests to me that this was the time that the penny dropped and he realised that Oranmore was trading under that name. I can perceive in that sarcastic email an undertone of fresh outrage and disbelief. I do not believe that he would have sent that email, and the later 22 June 2012 email and 29 June 2012 text message, if he had known since early December 2011 that Oranmore intended to trade under the ORANMORE Signs. For those reasons, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that he (and therefore Oran) only knew that Oranmore was trading under its own name around early June 2012. That means I reject John Dooley’s evidence that he didn’t find out until September 2012. In my judgment, that latter contention cannot survive consideration of those three June 2012 communications from John Dooley.</p>

John Dooley says that he was at the board meeting on 13 December 2011 and was present when Alan Melville had this conversation with Ross Melville. Ross Melville says that this was a fiction and he wasn’t at the board meeting because he was in the UK that day, attending meetings in Norfolk. During the overnight adjournment after the first day of trial, he produced some documentary evidence, which I allowed him to rely on, showing that he had a booking at a hotel in Norfolk, near the Weeting facility, on the nights of the 12 and 13 December 2011 only, and a copy of a credit card statement showing that he had paid for those two nights at the hotel. Mr Harbottle suggested to him that he could have flown back to Ireland to attend the meeting. Ross Melville denied it. </p>

First, the documentary evidence is clear that he booked and paid for hotels in Norfolk for two nights only on 12 and 13 December. Second, a return to Oranmore in Galway from Norfolk, attendance at the board meeting and a return back to Norfolk would have taken most of the day. It seems to me to be inherently unlikely that he would have booked a two night stay in the UK if he had known that he was going to spend the day in between travelling to and from Ireland. He would have been more likely to delay the trip or bring it forward by a day or two. Finally, I found John Dooley a less convincing witness than Ross Melville on this point. I find that no such request was made of Ross Melville.</p>

First, I found their evidence unconvincing in its delivery. In particular, Ross Melville appeared very uncomfortable when giving his evidence in cross-examination that he couldn’t understand how Oran could possibly object to Oranmore, because the names were completely different. Secondly, their case on this point in incompatible, in my judgment, with (a) the acknowledgement in Richard Burke’s second witness statement he was aware there might be <span style="font-style:italic">“trade mark issues”</span>, which is why he sought the Oran Release; and (b) Oranmore’s request of Michael Melville in mid-2012 to produce a written Copyright Licence for the First Defendant’s Device, rather than rely on the oral one which it says it already had. Ross Melville was asked about this point in cross-examination and found it very difficult to answer, resorting to saying that the Copyright Licence request was a <span style="font-style:italic">“belt and braces”</span> approach. Thirdly, the sarcastic emails of John Dooley relating to Sean Sharkey’s employment by Oranmore and his refusal to consider Richard Burke’s proposal that the companies work together can, in my view, only be read in this way, although they fall short of explicit objections. </p>

In relation to ‘commercial common sense’, Lord Neuberger stated in paragraph 19 that it was not to be invoked retrospectively: <span style="font-style:italic">“It is only relevant to the extent of how matters would or could have been perceived by the parties, or by reasonable people in the position of the parties, as at the date that the contract was made.”</span> In paragraph 20 he cautioned that: <span style="font-style:italic">“While commercial commonsense is a very important factor to take into account, a court should be slow to reject the natural meaning as correct simply because it appears to be a very imprudent term for one of the parties to have agreed, even ignoring the benefit of wisdom of hindsight. The purpose of interpretation is to identify what the parties have agreed, not what the court thinks that they should have agreed.”</span> In paragraph 21 he reminds us that when considering what facts are known to the parties, that means those which were <span style="font-style:italic">“known or reasonably available to both parties… it cannot be right, when interpreting a contractual provision, to take into account a fact or circumstance known only to one of the parties.”</span></p>

This termination was intimately and entirely connected, in my judgment, with his setting up of Oranmore, with Ross Melville, as a company to take a lease of the Weeting facility and start to manufacture and sell Hollowcore products in the UK. There has been made no suggestion to me in the documentation or in the evidence of the witnesses for either party that Richard Burke would have left the employment of Oran in December 2011 if Oran had decided to take on the lease of the Weeting facility itself. Both John Dooley and Richard Burke acknowledge that the former had been trying to push the latter out of Oran for some time, but John Dooley’s evidence was that it was impossible to do so while the Back Pay Claim remained unresolved. Accordingly it required Richard Burke to resign so that he could set up Oranmore in the UK, for Oran to get him out of the company. I accept that evidence, which was not challenged.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is necessary to distinguish the various releases provided for in the Compromise Agreement. The Discharge Form is in the identical form of a document originally provided to Richard Burke by Oran together with the letter notifying him of his redundancy dated 18 November 2011. That accepts <span style="font-style:italic">“</span>€26,092 <span style="font-style:italic">comprising notice, statutory redundancy, outstanding annual leave, ex-gratia payment and any monies owed by or to the company for termination of employment in full and final settlement of all statute and common law claims of every nature, type and kind whatsoever arising from my said former employment with the Company and the termination thereof by reason of my redundancy.”</span> The Burke Release is an acknowledgment that payment of €26,092 is in <span style="font-style:italic">“full and final settlement of all sums due and owing to me by Oran Pre-Cast Ltd whether arising by contract, common law and/or statute.”</span> I accept Mr Harbottle’s submission that these two documents together are unambiguous. The former provides a discharge which is clearly defined in terms of claims arising from Richard Burke’s employment and termination by redundancy for consideration which is equivalent to sums due for <span style="font-style:italic">“notice, statutory redundancy, outstanding annual leave and ex-gratia payment”</span>. The latter releases all claims that Richard Burke has against Oran in consideration of that same sum. Without more, I accept that the reasonable person having all the background knowledge available to the parties would not consider that the parties meant those two documents to encompass claims that Oran had against Richard Burke outside the closely-defined scope, namely ‘arising from’ his employment and termination by redundancy. </p>

The Oran Release is specifically expressed to be in consideration of <span style="font-style:italic">“you compromising the amount due and owing to you on foot of [the Back Pay Judgment]”.</span> It confirms that <span style="font-style:italic">“Oran Pre-Cast Limited have no claim against you, Richard Burke, whether it be in contract, common law and/or statute”.</span> This is a very concise but extremely wide-ranging release. The fact that it is bare and does not contain any assistive or explanatory text which one often sees in such clauses, and which can assist the court in defining the scope of the claims that the parties intended it to cover, means that the context in which the release was given becomes of particular importance. Per Lord Nicholls at paragraph 29 of <span style="text-decoration:underline">Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA v Ali</span> [2002] 1 AC 251 as cited in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Rainy Sky</span>: <span style="font-style:italic">“…the scope of general words of a release depends upon the context furnished by the surrounding circumstances in which the release was given.

That reasonable person would understand that the parties meant Richard Burke to waive his €600,000 Back Pay Judgment only in return for something which he valued over and above the €26,092 employment and redundancy settlement. That something was the Oran Release.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Turning to the Irish law point, I accept Mr Harbottle’s submission. There is no mention of Irish law in any of the documents of the Compromise Agreement. It is true that a number of Irish employment statutes are referred to in the Discharge Form, but only in a non-exhaustive list of examples of statutory claims that an employee might bring against an employer. Accordingly, in order to read the Compromise Agreement as being limited to claims under Irish law, I consider that such a term would need to be implied.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is clear from both Richard Burke and John Dooley’s evidence, and I am satisfied, that the Oran Release was an additional release required by Mr Burke, and agreed by Oran, before he would waive his right to the €600,000 Back Pay Judgment. This is supported by the fact that no equivalent release was sought by Richard Burke or given by Oran at the time of the 2012 Redundancy Agreement and 2012 Back Pay Agreement, when, far from waiving the Back Pay Claim, Richard Burke had agreed to settle it for the sum of €120,000. Now, in 2013, Richard Burke was in an even stronger negotiating position. He was holding a judgment, rather than a mere claim, for €600,000, which was in the process of being enforced against Oran by the Sheriff and which he knew Oran would not easily be able to pay. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">So what was Richard Burke buying, and Oran selling, for a waiver valued at €600,000? The commercial context is, in my judgment, that Richard Burke was seeking a wide-ranging release to enable him draw a line in the sand, end the wider family discord, and get on with his working life as a director and shareholder of Oranmore. Oran was selling a wide release of its claims against Richard Burke, in order to neutralise the Back Pay Judgment and free itself from the threat of enforcement by seizure of assets by the Sheriff’s office or, potentially, issuance of a winding up petition. I am satisfied that each party knew of the commercial imperatives of the other. Of course the subjective intentions of the parties are not relevant in themselves, but common knowledge of both parties is part of the background knowledge held by the reasonable person.</p>

That includes, in my judgment, any claims arising from the founding and trading of Oranmore, which I have found was intimately connected with Richard Burke’s departure from Oran. In order to achieve that clean slate, so that Oran could go forward without owing Richard Burke €600,000 and Richard Burke could continue running Oranmore in the UK, I find that the reasonable person would have understood the parties to have meant the Oran Release to encompass the present passing-off and registered trade mark infringement claims.  </p>

Similarly, the reasonable person would not, in my judgment, understand the parties to have meant that the Oran Release could be circumvented by the simple and foreseeable action of Oran applying for the Registered Mark and then suing for its infringement.

The general rule at common law is that where a person has a cause of action against two or more joint tortfeasors, a settlement by which he releases one or more of them operates as a release of the others. This is subject to an exception, namely where the settlement agreement for the release of one or more of them contains a reservation of his right to sue the others (<span style="text-decoration:underline">Watts v Aldington</span>). That reservation may be express or implied. Accordingly, it is not the case that where a settlement agreement is silent as to the reservation of a right to sue joint tortfeasors, as in the Compromise Agreement, joint tortfeasors are not released unless there is an express or implied term releasing them. Rather, joint tortfeasors are also released, unless a reservation of the right to sue can be implied.  Mr Moody-Stuart makes no argument for the implication of a term reserving the right to sue Oranmore and Ross Melville. In fact he specifically states in his Additional Submissions that he does not seek the implication of such a term. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in"><marker name="tab"/>(i) the average consumer is a hypothetical person or, as he has been called, a legal construct; he is a person who has been created to strike the right balance between the various competing interests including, on the one hand, the need to protect consumers and, on the other hand, the promotion of free trade in an openly competitive market, and also to provide a standard, defined in EU law, which national courts may then apply;</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">(ii) the average consumer is not a statistical test; the national court must exercise its own judgment in accordance with the principle of proportionality and the principles explained by the Court of Justice to determine the perceptions of the average consumer in any given case in the light of all the circumstances; the test provides the court with a perspective from which to assess the particular question it has to decide; </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">(iii) in a case involving ordinary goods and services, the court may be able to put itself in the position of the average consumer without requiring evidence from consumers, still less expert evidence or a consumer survey. In such a case, the judge can make up his or her own mind about the particular issue he or she has to decide in the absence of evidence and using his or her own common sense and experience of the world. A judge may nevertheless decide that it is necessary to have recourse to an expert’s opinion or a survey for the purpose of assisting the court to come to a conclusion as to whether there is a likelihood of deception;</p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">(iv) the issue of a trade mark’s distinctiveness is intimately tied to the scope of the protection to which it is entitled. So, in assessing an allegation of infringement under Article 5(1)(b) of the Directive arising from the use of a similar sign, the court must take into account the distinctiveness of the trade mark, and there will be a greater likelihood of confusion where the trade mark has a highly distinctive character either per se or as a result of the use which has been made of it. It follows that the court must necessarily have regard to the impact of the accused sign on the proportion of consumers to whom the trade mark is particularly distinctive;</p>

The Defendants rely on the oral evidence of Oran’s witness, Christina Lines, who agreed in cross examination with these principles. She additionally stated that such purchasing decisions on large scale projects with a main contractor were often made by a supply chain manager, and that such a role was generally occupied by persons with the relevant supply chain management professional qualification. Accordingly, Mr Harbottle for the Defendants submits that the average consumer is likely to be a sophisticated and knowledgeable individual who will pay a high degree of attention to the identity of the party from which it is purchasing and this renders confusion less likely.</p>

I find that the device reduces the similarity between the Registered Mark and ORANMORE Signs somewhat, but I find that reduction will be relatively small because I accept Mr Moody-Stuart’s submission that the words ORANMORE PRECAST retain their independent distinctive character within the composite sign.</p>

He dealt with Sean when he was working for Oran… he was surprised to learn that Oran and Oranmore were two separate companies. He said that he has dealt with Sean since Oranmore started up and was very clear that he was specifically led to believe by Oranmore that the two companies were one and the same, and he believed he was dealing with us”.</span> In cross-examination she confirmed that she didn’t ask him to explain how he had come to think they were connected, or how he had been led to believe they were ‘one and the same’, as she didn’t want to talk about the dispute between Oran and Oranmore with a customer. Mrs Lines’ evidence was that she had called Mr Hathaway to see if he would appear as a witness in this case but he didn’t want to get involved. Ross Melville’s evidence is that the only dealings Oranmore had with Mr Hathaway were with Sean Sharkey, some time after this call, in June 2015. His evidence was not challenged in cross-examination. Accordingly, Mr Harbottle submits that it is improbable that Mr Hathaway said what Mrs Lines’ note reports, and asks me to find that the note is not sufficiently accurate to rely on. I do not make that finding. It is inherently implausible, in my judgment, that Mr Hathaway would phone Oran looking for Sean Sharkey if he had never had any dealings with him before, or that he would raise the issue of confusion between the two companies unless he was actually confused. In any event, I find Mrs Lines to be a credible and reliable witness and so I accept Mrs Lines’ evidence that the note she made was contemporaneous and therefore likely to be accurate. The only alternative is that Mrs Lines fabricated this conversation with someone who, coincidentally, did deal with Sean Sharkey at Oranmore some months later. That has suggestion has not been made by the Defendants and seems equally implausible. Accordingly it seems more likely than not that Ross Melville is mistaken that Sean Sharkey had not dealt with Mr Hathaway for Oranmore before June 2015. Sean Sharkey was not cross-examined on this point as his evidence was closely limited as to subject matter not including this. Subject to the caveats that I do not know whether and how the confusion arose, I find that I cannot disregard this evidence and I do give it some probative weight.</p>

Mr Harbottle submits this is not sufficient to show evidence of actual confusion but concedes that it may give cause to wonder. I disagree and do consider this evidence to be quite powerful. In my judgment it shows an actual consumer in the process of inviting and managing tenders, aware of Oran and Oranmore as suppliers of identical or similar goods, with sight of both the Registered Mark and the ORANMORE PRECAST Sign,  being confused by whether Oran and Oranmore are a single company.

Mr Moody-Stuart submits that he must have considered who took over the plant and seeing Oranmore assumed it was Oran. I cannot draw this inference on the information before me. He could equally simply have heard that the plant had been taken over and assumed that the new lessee was Oran, who had recently been carrying out due diligence into it. I find this example has little probative value.</p>

I have found some evidence in support of the contention that the association between the mark and signs causes the public to wrongly believe that the respective goods and services come from the same or economically linked undertakings.

The ECJ made a number of important points. First; consent amounts to renunciation of the right to the trademark proprietor, and must, therefore, be unequivocally demonstrated. Second, and intention to renounce will normally be gathered from an express statement. Third; there may be circumstances from which consent may be inferred, but it is an actual consent and not a deemed consent, that must be established. Fourth; it is, in almost all cases, for the trader to prove consent, not for the trademark proprietor to prove the absence of consent. Fifth; consent cannot be inferred from the trademark proprietor’s silence, nor from the fact that the goods carry no warning, nor from the fact that the trademark proprietor originally placed goods on the market without any further restriction on the onward sale of those goods.”</p>

He asks me to consider the email in the context that Richard Burke and Ross Melville understood Oran to have decided to cease selling Hollowcore in the UK in April 2011 and so it would be ‘unsurprising’ that Oran’s directors would have no objection to the operation of a competing UK Hollowcore company run by members of their own families. Of course I have found they did not make that decision.</p>

I have accepted that evidence. Even if I had not, however, I would have found this email to be a very long way from complying with the stricture in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Davidoff</span> at paragraph 53 that: <span style="font-style:italic">“it follows… that consent must be expressed positively and that the factors taken into consideration in finding implied consent must unequivocally demonstrate that the trade mark proprietor has renounced any intention to enforce his exclusive rights.”</span>. In my judgment this email is nothing more than an acknowledgement by John Dooley that Ross Melville is starting a new company, an expression that perhaps it can work with Oran in the future, and some handsome good luck wishes. There is nothing whatsoever in it, in my view, which can be interpreted as a trade mark licence at all, let alone the wide ranging one for which the Defendants contend.

I am satisfied that my findings in respect of confusion for infringement of the Registered Mark are equally as persuasive of deception of the public for the part of passing off, in particular given the support provided by the examples of actual confusion relied on by Oran.
