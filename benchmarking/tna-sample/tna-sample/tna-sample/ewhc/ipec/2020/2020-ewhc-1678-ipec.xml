He called it a Kangaroo Court and said that he had evidence which could rebut the charges. Of course, the way to do so would have been to participate in the disciplinary proceedings. Mr Reed heard this submission but made no submissions on credibility of any witness, and in particular did not address this submission made by the Claimant.  In my draft judgment, which I circulated to the parties in the usual way, I commented that one of the charges proved against him was an allegation of dishonesty in his financial dealings with club members, and this, together with Mr Adams’ refusal to accept the findings of the disciplinary committee, adversely affected my view of his credibility.  </p>

Ms Jones describes his evidence as confused, muddled and evasive, and submits that he gave answers to suit his case while not being sure what his case was. I think that is fair comment. This was most evident in his evidence in cross-examination about whether the First Defendant was an NGB. He surprised Ms Jones, and the Court, by saying <span style="font-style:italic">“We’ve never called ourselves a national governing body. Basically, we are not a national governing body”</span> when the Defence explicitly states, <span style="font-style:italic">“The First Defendant is a national governing body”</span>. When Ms Jones challenged him on this and asked whether it was his understanding of the Defendants’ case that the First Defendant was an NGB or not, he provided an equivocal answer: <span style="font-style:italic">“It depends, we can be, or we can’t be”</span>. It was only after I pressed him to answer the question asked, that he said that the First Defendant was <span style="font-style:italic">“a national governing body for gymnastics in the UK”</span>. This equivocation is surprising, given that it is a key plank of the Defendants’ case that the First Defendant is a national governing body for gymnastics in the UK. </p>

I accept Mr Wise’s evidence because he was the person who drafted the membership rules and he was clear that he was still in the process of drafting them at that time. He also gave oral evidence that the Defendants wanted to distance themselves from the Claimant as much as possible, which was contradicted by a raft of evidence to the contrary, as I set out in paragraph 143 below. Finally, much of Mr Adams’ written evidence was inadmissible as it was not evidence of fact, but speculation about the Claimant’s motivation for doing various things including bringing the proceedings, adverse commentary on the strength of the Claimant’s case, and advocacy. For those reasons I consider that Mr Adams did not seek to assist the court by giving honest evidence to the best of his ability, but to say what he thought would assist the Defendants even when that was not true. I treat such of Mr Adams’ evidence which is admissible with caution and where it is disputed, I look for corroboration from other reliable evidence or the inherent probabilities before accepting it. </p>

Mr Smith gave the example of ‘England Athletics’ which takes responsibility for amateur local community athletics, and ‘UK Athletics’, which takes responsibility for high performance, typically preparing athletes for the Olympic Games or similar. Mr Smith said that it was a really important function of an NGB to provide a talent pathway so that young people can join their local community club one day and however long it takes, however many years later, they can become athletes representing their country.

He gave an example of equestrian sports, which have show jumping, dressage, eventing and a number of other disciplines. However, he said, in such situations the sports have a federated structure where there is an umbrella body that sits on top of all of these disciplines and that is the body that Sport England deals with and invests in. In the equestrian example, that was the British Equestrian Federation. He pointed out that there are a number of sports which are split into different disciplines, but which do not have different governing bodies, such as cycling.  </p>

Mr Smith said there are three because those three bodies have deliberately and specifically, and with agreement, set themselves up to perform different functions within the sport: one does ‘the talent part’, one does ‘the grassroots part’, and one does ‘the high performance part’.

Ms Allen points to the use of the ‘swirls’ on Ds’ Website, on its certificates of membership documents and on a membership advertisement of 12 March 2018 which describes itself as <span style="font-style:italic">“A UK GOVERNING BODY FOR THE SPORT OF GYMNASTICS”</span>. In fact, this advertisement was not published to the public as it was produced for insertion into one of the Claimant’s events, and the programme publisher refused it as the Defendants were not associated with the Claimant. However, the image that it contains, including the swirls, is found as the background to Ds’ Website. It can be found at Annex 1. </p>

She says <span style="font-style:italic">“I have received feedback from Kathryn [Bonner] who in turn has spoken to coaches who have attended both [Claimant] and [Defendant] run courses. The feedback from Kathryn is that coaches report that the [Claimant] courses are superior.

This does not assist the Court in determining the issues. It does not follow, in my judgement, that various reports that the Claimant’s courses are better than the First Defendant’s, means that the attendees or the public believe that the First Defendant’s courses are provided by the Claimant, and there is nothing in Ms Allen’s evidence (or in any documentary evidence which is, again, wholly lacking) to explain why she considers this is evidence of actual confusion. In my judgment, it is mere speculation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.00in">Lilleshall is owned by Sport England, run by Serco, and houses the Claimant’s base. Mr Wise in witness evidence explained that he was permitted to make that booking in May 2018, but it was cancelled by Lilleshall one week before the scheduled event, for the reason that: <span style="font-style:italic">“Sport England decided that we are not allowed to book the facility as we are not affiliated to [the Claimant]”</span>. The letter cancelling the booking stated that the decision also took into account that the Claimant was a tenant at Lilleshall. The Defendants rely on that as evidence that the Claimant was motivated in bringing these proceedings by a desire to prevent any other national governing body operating within gymnastics, a claim Ms Allen denied. Ms Allen said in oral evidence that it had always been the case that for an organisation to book Lilleshall, it needed to be affiliated to the Claimant, but upon investigation it was discovered that the person who took the booking was a new employee of Serco, thought that ‘UK Gymnastics’ was affiliated with ‘British Gymnastics’, and so allowed the booking to be made. This evidence was not contained in her witness statement and Mr Reed submits that she should not be permitted to rely on it. However, Miss Allen provided this evidence in cross-examination in answer to a situation raised by Mr Wise in his evidence, and so I do not object to it. I accept it as evidence of actual confusion by the Serco employee.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.00in">The second example was produced by Ms Allen for the first time in oral evidence. It related to a change in the Chair of the Claimant in March 2019. Ms Allen said that the current incumbent told her that when he was considering coming to the role, he decided to research the Claimant. Because his daughter was a member of UK Athletics, he looked up ‘UK Gymnastics’ on the internet, which brought him to the Defendants’ site, and it took him a while to realise that he was on the wrong site. Ms Allen said that if it was confusing to him, it would be confusing to others. Mr Reed submits that Ms Allen should not be permitted to rely on oral evidence which is not contained in her witness statement. In my judgment this cannot be an example of actual confusion caused by the Defendants’ acts, since it appears the future Chair made his mistake without even knowing of the existence of the First Defendant and without seeing any of its signs. He simply guessed at a search which might bring him to the Claimant’s website, and instead it brought him to Ds’ Website. At the most, in my judgment, it goes to the likelihood of confusion: that a member of the public may think ‘UK Gymnastics’ is interchangeable with ‘British Gymnastics’, or want to go to the recognised NGB for gymnastics and wrongly guess its name is UK Gymnastics, as the future Chair did. </p>

I note that Mr Adams <span style="font-style:italic">“cannot recall receiving anything from FIG or their solicitors asking us to remove the FIG logo from our site”</span>. There is no dispute that the First Defendant was not affiliated with FIG and so would not have had the right to use that logo on Ds’ Website. Although I do not have a screenshot of the use, I have seen a contemporaneous email from Ms Allen to FIG notifying it of what she had found and I am satisfied that it is more likely than not that the Defendants did use the logo on Ds’ Website, and were asked to cease its use by FIG. However, neither of these are evidence of actual confusion in my judgement, although I accept them as evidence which tends to support a likelihood of confusion.   </p>

She said that saying the First Defendant is an NGB does not make it so, and in doing so they are passing themselves off as connected to the work of the Claimant. The damage she identifies is that if people believe they are connected to or affiliated with the Claimant, they will believe that they are operating to the Claimant’s standards, when in fact it is not clear what the First Defendant’s standards are.

She is concerned that if their use of the Signs were allowed to continue, it would dilute the Claimant’s brand significantly. I will address these points in the discussions of the issues below. Ms Allen said she was seriously concerned that the Defendants may be providing or facilitating an environment that due to lack of scrutiny attracts undesirable personnel which could place its members at risk, and this in turn posed a reputational risk to the Claimant if consumers believe the Defendants to be the Claimant, or the NBG for gymnastics in the UK, or connected to or somehow authorised by the Claimant. Ms Allen had no evidence that any such undesirable personnel were attracted to the First Defendant. In fact, when the Claimant did observe a competition organised by the First Defendant, it had no criticism to make.  </p>

As at December 2019 his evidence was that the First Defendant was going to start certifying such coaches who have attended such a course. Mr Wise confirmed in oral evidence that it now does so.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.00in">The difficulty with this submission is that until very recently, and perhaps prompted by this litigation, there were no rules governing membership of the First Defendant: nothing to tell members what they were getting for their money and what their rights and responsibilities were. Looking at the definition in the Sports Council Recognition Policy 2017, there is, in my judgment, no real evidence of governance of the sport of gymnastics by the First Defendant anywhere, let alone throughout the UK, and no real evidence that the First Defendant is either a custodian or guardian of the sport of gymnastics. I have gone into quite extensive detail about the level and type of governance and stewardship evidenced by the Claimant, as in my judgement it puts into sharp relief the lack of similar processes and procedures by the First Defendant. Neither it nor the Second Defendant have objects of association that one would expect to see in a governing body. There is no transparency in the governance structure, no strength and depth in the board of directors. There is no quality assurance, no external audit or oversight or endorsement in the proficiency awards or coaching certifications that it sells. There are no defined disciplinary procedures. There is no evidence that it seeks to develop or improve the sport or its safety. There are only two employees, and Mr Wise, who is responsible for drafting policies for approval and implementation by the Board, admits he has no experience of doing so. The majority of the policies he has produced are of the type that are found in any organisation, particularly those working with children. The First Defendant has no connection or liaison or relationship with the Sports Councils, other NGBs or  international gymnastics organisations. The First Defendant’s talent pathway stops when, as Mr Adams states in evidence, gymnasts become “too good” for the First Defendant - when they then have to join the Claimant in order to compete at the top levels, including internationally. This is not conducive to a finding that the First Defendant is an NGB.  </p>

I would not expect a newly fledged, unrecognised NGB to do so. However, for the reasons I have given, I am not satisfied that the First Defendant fulfils the functions even of a young, cash-poor NGB. Rather, I find that it is an organisation that sells memberships to individuals and clubs for the purposes of promoting participation in its own gymnastics competitions, on-selling proficiency and coaching awards, and providing a number of benefits to members including insurance. There is nothing wrong with that, but it is not, now, a National Governing Body. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the Claimant is the only NGB for the sport of gymnastics in the UK, and the only recognised such NGB. I make no finding about whether the First Defendant may become one, or whether there is room for another NGB for the sport of gymnastics in the UK, apart from the Claimant, as it is not necessary for me to do so.  </p>

As regards detriment to the distinctive character of the mark, also referred to as ‘dilution’ ‘whittling away’ or ‘blurring’, such detriment is caused when that mark’s ability to identify the goods or services for which it is registered is weakened, since use of an identical or similar sign by a third party leads to dispersion of the identity and hold upon the public mind of the earlier mark. That is particularly the case when the mark, which at one time aroused immediate association with the goods or services for which it is registered, is no longer capable of doing so (see, to that effect,<span style="font-style:italic"> Intel</span>, paragraph 29). </p>

The Claimant therefore submits that there is a high degree of similarity between the earlier mark and the Word Sign, particularly taking into account imperfect recollection and the enhanced distinctive character of the earlier mark. The Claimant submits that the addition of the colours blue and red to one of the earlier marks in the series does not affect this, as there nevertheless remains a high degree of similarity between that earlier mark and the Word Sign, given that the dominant elements remain the same and appear in the same sequence. Miss Jones argues that, if anything, the use of colour brings the conceptual similarity even closer given that red and blue are colours used in the Union Jack, the flag of the UK.  </p>

In my judgment the dominant aspect of the Trade Marks is the wording and it is obvious that it is to be read, spoken and viewed as ‘British Gymnastics’. I also accept that where the phrase ‘more than a sport’ appears this does not detract from the dominance of ‘British Gymnastics’ and is negligible, because it is written in much smaller font. I remind myself that the average consumer normally perceives a mark as a whole and does not proceed to analyse its various details, and I consider that the overall impression is that ‘British Gymnastics” is by far the dominant component.  </p>

I accept the Defendants’ submission that those are visually and aurally very different giving the whole “UK Gymnastics’ and ‘British Gymnastics’ a low level of similarity. However, the conceptual similarity is, in my judgment, strong and I consider that does play a substantial part. Ms Jones in closing submissions argued that the conceptual similarity renders the Trade Marks similar to the Word Sign in two ways: (i) because the UK and British are references to similar geographical areas, and (ii) because of the connotation of some sort of formal or official status to the services being provided that those words ‘UK’ and ‘British’ give. I accept that submission. I agree with the Claimant that the ‘UK’ and ‘British’ are confusingly similar geographical concepts to many people. I remind myself that the Chair of the Claimant was so confused, and that one type of average consumer in this case is children who are more likely to have difficulty distinguishing between them conceptually.  </p>

I accept that as a relevant factor. In addition, I accept the Claimant’s submission that the degree of attention paid may vary amongst different types of average consumer.

Although direct confusion and indirect confusion both involve mistakes on the part of the consumer, it is important to remember that these mistakes are very different in nature. Direct confusion involves no process of reasoning – it is a simple matter of mistaking one mark for another. Indirect confusion, on the other hand, only arises where the consumer has actually recognized that the later mark is different from the earlier mark. It therefore requires a mental process of some kind on the part of the consumer when he or she sees the later mark, which may be conscious or subconscious but, analysed in formal terms, is something along the following lines: <span style="font-style:italic">“The later mark is different from the earlier mark, but also has something in common with it.

I accept the Claimant’s submission that the disparity in the scale of the Defendants’ operations compared those of the Claimant mean that it is very possible that instances of actual confusion have been masked or not brought to the Claimant’s attention. </p>
