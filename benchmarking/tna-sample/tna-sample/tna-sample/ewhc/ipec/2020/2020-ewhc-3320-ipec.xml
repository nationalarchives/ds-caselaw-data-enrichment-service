Neither of the signatories consented to the use of its own trade marks by the other.  Both agreed, rather, that they would not object to the other signatory's use of that other signatory's logo or to that other signatory filing further trade marks for its logo.  To my mind, that is not best characterised as a licence; it is an agreement not to start proceedings, a coexistence agreement.  Coexistence agreements were referred to in the Californian authorities I will discuss in a moment, sometimes called coexist agreements.

Waffle House, Inc.</span>, 534 U.S. 279, 293, 122 S.Ct. 754, 151 L.Ed.2d 755 (2002). But under California law, which applies here, nonsignatories to an agreement with an arbitration clause can be compelled to arbitrate for a variety of reasons. One such reason, and the one Uber *1095 seeks to apply here, exists when a nonsignatory should be equitably estopped from arguing that he cannot be bound by an arbitration clause. That exception applies when there are “claims that are dependent upon or inextricably intertwined with the obligations imposed by the contract containing the arbitration clause.” <span style="font-style:italic">JSM Tuscany, LLC v.

That is so, according to Uber, because Plaintiffs’ standing theory only works if they are assumed to be like another party who downloaded the Uber App and faced discrimination. But equitable estoppel is “inapplicable<span style="font-family:'Courier New'"> </span>violation of any duty, obligation, term or condition” imposed by the contract. <span style="font-style:italic">In re Henson,</span> 869 F.3d 1052, 1060 (9th </p>

There is also the unusual factual background to the <span style="font-style:italic">Namisnak </span>case which Mr Llewellyn highlights.  There had never been any contract between Uber and any relevant party.  The arbitration clause relied on by Uber was contained in the terms imposed on users of the Uber app.  The plaintiffs had never downloaded the app.  Uber was forced to argue that the plaintiffs were estopped from avoiding Uber's arbitration agreement because they had consciously avoided downloading the app.  It was that argument which was </p>
