They come in many variations – with differently shaped toes, different heel heights, and many types of materials. On 24 November 2017, the Claimant, Rothy’s Inc, a California-based company, launched its <span style="font-weight:bold">Pointed Loafer</span> shoe. The Pointed Loafer is a type of ballerina shoe with, as the name suggests, a pointed toe and a protruding tongue that gives the appearance of a loafer. The Pointed Loafer is shown here: </p>

It was common ground between the parties that The Flat and The Point were the first ballerina shoes to be made of knitted yarn made from recycled plastic. Gym shoes had previously been made from heavy knitted yarn, including yarn made from recycled plastic, but not ballerina shoes. </p>

The Court sat as a Community Design Court, that is, as one of the national courts designated to hear EU design matters under Article 80 of Council Regulation (EC) 6/2002 of 12 December 2001 on Community designs (the <span style="font-weight:bold">Regulation</span>). As things currently stand, this Court will be unable to sit as a Community Design Court after 11pm UK time on 31 December 2020, given the current end date to the transition period following the UK’s departure from the European Union. I was therefore urged by the Claimant to hand down this judgment in sufficient time to enable a form of order hearing to be held prior to 31 December 2020. This judgment has therefore been prepared at speed in an attempt to accommodate that request.  </p>

Again, I consider this criticism to be unfair. Ms Zuk answered the questions put to her to the best of her ability. She did not take kindly to the accusation that she had copied the Pointed Loafer, but to my mind that was no more than to be expected of a designer accused of copying.

Leave was given to each side to call expert evidence by an order of April 15, 1999. The spirit and effect of the new Rules require the court to look even more closely at the need for expert evidence. In future in registered design actions, I think the court should take care before allowing any expert evidence. In particular, the court should know precisely to what areas that expert evidence will be directed. If blanket permission is given, each side feels compelled to get an expert who then has to say something. What is then said has to be read by the other side. Thereby time and cost to no particular use is expended. </p>

I agree. I have therefore admitted the evidence of the experts as to the state of the design corpus as at 10 May 2017 (which was almost entirely agreed), but in relation to the issues that are for determination by the Court, I do not consider myself bound by the expert evidence: I have given it no weight.

The Court sat for an extra two hours on top of a usual sitting day of 5 hours. When parties agree to take advantage of the IPEC costs cap, they thereby agree to fit their case within the IPEC case limits. They must therefore trim their sails to ensure that the case can be determined within the allocated time. In this case, that could readily have been achieved, including by not cross-examining the experts. This is no criticism of the experts who gave of their time to assist the Court.   </p>

She is the third generation of her family involved in the shoe industry, through which work she has amassed a large archive of footwear-related paraphernalia, including catalogues, books, magazine, photographs, prototypes, lasts, components and materials. She considers that she has one of the largest archives of private reference data on footwear design and materials in the world. Section 1 of Ms Wright’s witness statement set out her report on the design corpus as at 10 May 2017 in 10 numbered paragraphs. Section 2 of her witness statement (39 paragraphs) was her “commentary on the design features of the Rothy’s Unregistered Design and explanation of design terms”. Section 3 undertook the same task in relation to the RCD (15 paragraphs). She concluded with what she considered to be the most distinctive features of the two claimed designs.

There is some force to that criticism, but I consider that issue to stem more from the questions Ms Wright was asked to consider (which are ultimately questions for the Court) than from any issue either with Ms Wright’s suitability or manner. I also reject criticisms that Ms Wright was not up to date with the design corpus on account of her expert evidence work: clearly, her report dealt with designs up to the Relevant Date. I consider that Ms Wright was doing her best to assist the Court – it was not her fault that she was asked to give evidence about issues which were for the Court.  </p>

However, looking at them closely, including by zooming in on the high resolution images maintained by the EUIPO on its website, it is clear to me that the lines indicate a knitted fabric, rather than any of the alternative textures for which the Defendant contends. As is apparent from these expanded images, the lines are not consistently applied across the design. For example, at the heel of the shoe, the lines radiate in a circular fashion following the counterline. Similarly, when viewed from the front, the lines radiate out from the toe. This patterning is inconsistent with a woven fabric, or unprinted animal hide such as nubuck or suede, which would not, for example, radiate as it does at the heel. Even a coarse weave would not change direction as the lines in the RCD do. The RCD is also entirely different from the CAD rendition shown in <span style="font-style:italic">Trunki</span>. In my judgment, the RCD shows a knitted fabric, and, more particularly, a fabric knitted from a comparatively heavy thread.  </p>

The Defendant had conceded that priority was properly claimed – which left it open to me to rely on the United States design patent. The difficulty with that argument is that the EUIPO does not review the scope of protection of the United States design patent in recording the priority claim. Further, US design patent drawing conventions differ, and the requirements of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (<span style="font-weight:bold">USPTO</span>) differ from those of the EUIPO. Therefore, whilst Nugee J (as he then was) relied on a United States patent claimed as priority in <span style="font-style:italic">E Mishan &amp; Sons Inc t/a Emson v Hozelock Limited and Ors </span>[2019] EWHC 991 (Pat) at paragraph 74, I do not consider that the position with respect to registered designs is clear cut, and full argument on the point may be appropriate in a future case.

Knitted fabric is different – whilst some (fine) knitted fabrics can be cut, the evidence was that a knitted fabric such as this would unravel if cut. Knitted fabrics such as the one depicted are therefore edged as part of the knitting process, such as at the neckline of a crew-neck knitted woollen sweater. Such an edge will not fray. Given my finding above, it would thus be illogical to interpret the two lines around the topline as indicating an anti-fray border or edge. Rather, in my judgement, these lines indicate the contrasting edge created in the knitting of the shoe (again, such as the neckline of a crew-neck knitted woollen sweater).  </p>

Ms Hawkins was shown the definition of the informed user set out in the Amended Particulars of Claim, and asked if “a buyer of women’s fashion shoes is discerning, knowledgeable and pays a high degree of attention”. She answered in the affirmative. She was then asked a series of questions about the reaction of “the informed user” to various features of various shoes. I had understood Ms Hawkins to have accepted the concept on the basis that the “buyer” was a buyer for, say, a department store. Counsel for the Defendant assured me he had meant a consumer – a customer buying the shoes in a retail store. They were not the words he used and this was never clarified with Ms Hawkins. At least in the fashion industry, a buyer refers to someone who buys as part of their job, rather than an individual customer. Ms Hawkins’ answers also suggested to me that she meant a wholesale buyer, because of the close level of attention she suggested such a person would pay, and how even very minor differences would “strike” her informed user. As <span style="font-style:italic">Shenzhen </span>makes clear, the informed user is a </p>

To her informed user, who is struck by every difference, many designs will be valid, but few will be infringed. Ms Wright, on the other hand, took the view that the most important thing about all the shoes in issue was that they were what she described as an Albert cut – this meant, to her, that the Allegra K and the Bonnibel were similar to the RCD and the UCD. This was too high a level of abstraction – to such an informed user, few designs will be valid, but those that are will have a very broad scope of protection.  </p>

Magmatic disputes this, and contends that the design corpus consists of the designs with which the informed user is likely to be familiar. Thus there may be designs which are not quite obscure enough to be excluded by the obscure designs exception, and thus can be relied upon as prior art for the purposes of Articles 5 and 6, but nevertheless do not form part of the design corpus when assessing the overall impression created by other designs for the purposes of Article 10.

Of course, as counsel for the Claimant conceded, it is not apparent from the RCD that the knitted thread used is made from recycled plastic. But it is obviously a heavy thread. Ms Hawkins’ evidence was that the knitted upper “made the shoe unique among others of the slipper cut style” and Ms Wright accepted that the knitted material of the upper was an “interesting design feature”. The heel and the counterline are among additional differences that would be noticed by the informed user, but they are variants on existing shoe designs, rather than a new departure, and will not have been as significant to the informed user as the choice of knitted material for the upper.  </p>

To this over-informed user who notices every difference, most designs will be valid, but few designs will ever be infringed.

To this under-informed user who does not notice differences, many designs will look the same, so few designs will be valid, but those that are valid will be granted a wide scope of protection.

In reaching that conclusion, I remind myself of the matters set out at paragraphs 74 and 75 above, including the agreed very large design freedom. Both the RCD and the Pointy Flat are pointed-toe slipper cut ballerina shoes, with a low heel, obvious counterline, protruding tongue and recognisable gussets. The differences in some measurements and ratios will be noticed by the informed user, but not to such an extent as to create a different overall impression, even in combination. The informed user may in some cases discriminate between elements of the respective designs, attaching different degrees of importance to similarities or differences. Most importantly, and what will most strike the informed user in <span style="font-style:italic">this</span> case, is that both the RCD and the Pointy Flat have uppers knitted from a heavy thread. As that was a departure for ballerina shoes, that will strike the informed user.

I accept that the legal case has been modified on both sides, but I do not detect in the Defendant’s evidence, or the disclosed documents with which I was provided, or from the honest way in which the Defendant’s witnesses of fact gave their evidence, any attempt to hide the fact of the purchase and use of the Claimant’s shoes.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">Turning to the first of the Claimant’s allegations, it was clear from Markus Giesswein’s and Ms Zuk’s evidence, unswayed under cross-examination, that Ms Zuk was the main designer of the Pointy Flat. The idea had been Markus Giesswein’s, but the actual design was by Ms Zuk. She took direction from both Markus and Johannes Giesswein, but there is nothing in the contemporaneous correspondence or the evidence that suggests that Johannes Giesswein either ever saw the Pointed Loafer, or was some-how secretly pulling the strings to copy that shoe. The Claimant accepted that disclosure had been properly carried out. Various documents were disclosed, including some which could be misconstrued as damaging to the Defendant’s case on copying. The Defendant was upfront about the shoes it bought, and the Claimant was aware of these from its own records. There is nothing in the written record to support the suggestion that Johannes Giesswein had, saw or copied the Pointed Loafer, and Markus Giesswein’s and Ms Zuk’s testimony flatly denied it. I also do not accept the submission that I should draw a negative inference about the Defendant’s case because Johannes Giesswein was not called to give evidence. As I have set out above, the Pointy Flat was Markus Giesswein’s idea, which Ms Zuk then implemented. Mr Jahoda and Johannes Giesswein were involved – but in the IPEC (where the Claimant commenced these proceedings), decisions have to be made to ensure that a trial can be held proportionately: see <span style="font-style:italic">Manvers Engineering Limited &amp; Anor v Lubetech Industries Limited &amp; Ors </span>[2013] EWHC 3393 (IPEC) per Mann J. Markus Giesswein and Ms Zuk were available to be questioned – and they were, skilfully and in depth. I therefore decline to draw any negative inference against the Defendant for its failure to adduce evidence from Johannes Giesswein.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">In relation to unconscious copying, again, this submission seems to me to be far-fetched. The Claimant conceded that the Pointed Loafer was a limited edition product, which was shown on its website for a short period of time only. I accept Markus Giesswein’s evidence that he and his brother Johannes were undertaking Internet-based research at the time, including visiting Instagram and </p>

However, the Pointed Loafer was not on the Claimant’s website on either of the occasions that Markus Giesswein is known to have visited – on both occasions, he bought all the shoes that were then available. There is no image or reference to the Pointed Loafer in any of the disclosed documents. I also do not accept that any of Markus or Johannes Giesswein or Ms Zuk would have trawled past copies of the Claimant’s website using the “Wayback Machine”: Markus Giesswein was cross-examined on this point, and stated that he was unaware of the Wayback Machine prior to these proceedings. I also do not accept that any of Markus or Johannes Giesswein or Ms Zuk would have gone back over past Instagram or Facebook postings once they had located the knitted plastic shoes in which they were interested.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">I reject that submission on the facts before the Court: in my judgment, the Defendant has set out its independent design case, which I find to be coherent and consistent. Markus Giesswein wanted to make a ballerina shoe of a summer-weight material. He, his brother and Ms Zuk all took inspiration from the three of the Claimant’s shoes they purchased. Two of those had a rounded toe, and one had a pointed toe. It is a small and readily apparent step for an entity wishing to make a pointy-toed ballerina shoe to do so. Ms Zuk, the designer of the Pointy Flat, was cross-examined, and unswayed on her version of how she designed the Pointy Flat. She sufficiently explained the Defendant’s independent design story.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">I also do not accept the submission that Markus Giesswein’s account of the design of the Pointy Flat “omitted key events in the time line”. Whilst his written account omitted some details, and some dates needed to be corrected, Markus Giesswein readily accepted additional steps when they were put to him in cross-examination, and nothing in his demeanour suggested that he was trying to obfuscate or dissemble. Further, I have accepted the evidence of Ms Zuk and Markus Giesswein that they never saw the Pointed Loafer – the actual shoe or an image of it. It was not put to me that the Pointed Loafer was so famous that any such failure to be familiar with it would be unreasonable (as set out in Article 19 of the Regulation). The Pointed Loafer was a short run product, only available on the Claimant’s website for a comparatively short period. In my judgment, the design of the Pointy Flat was an independent work of creation by a designer who may be reasonably thought not to be familiar with the Pointed Loafer. </p>

Both experts thought so, but as neither had correctly put themselves into the shoes of the informed user, I do not consider that that helps me. Looking very carefully at the RCD and the Pointed Loafer, I can discern the difference identified by counsel for the Defendant – but it is not sufficient to make a difference to my judgment above comparing the RCD and the Pointy Flat. Comparing the UCD and the Pointy Flat, and reminding myself of the matters set out at paragraphs 74 and 75 above, I reach the same conclusion as with the RCD for the same reasons I have set out above.

The UCD departs from the design corpus primarily through the use for the upper of a knitted heavy yarn. That is what will strike the informed user of ballerina shoes, who has seen all the other variations before. Together with the differences in the heel and the counterline (the Allegra K) and the counterline (the Bonnibel) that is sufficient to produce a different overall impression. </p>
