They can give the appearance of slimmer hips, whilst simultaneously lifting and separating the buttocks. Whilst body-enhancing undergarments have been popular for centuries, the emergence of shapewear as outer-garments is recent. The Claimant, Freddy SpA, introduced its WR.UP branded jeans in 2012. It says that these were a dramatic departure from what was previously available on the market, attracting significant consumer attention and commercial success. The Defendants, HUGZ Clothing Limited, CC Liverpool Limited and Mr Christopher Kavanagh, have admitted copying the WR.UP jeans and marketing the copies as their own HUGZ branded jeans. Having settled the Claimant’s initial complaint in a settlement agreement dated 3 April 2019 (the <span style="font-weight:bold">Settlement Agreement</span>), the Defendants then launched a second version of the HUGZ jeans. In doing so, the Claimant says the Defendants: </p>

The Defendants filed a Defence and Counterclaim, which was later amended following amendments to the Particulars of Claim allowed by order of HHJ Hacon made on 19 December 2019. His Honour also made various orders for the filing of fact and expert evidence, and listed the trial for three days from 5 October 2020. Three days is an unusually long listing for the IPEC – it was done in this case because of the number and complexity of the issues to be determined. Throughout this time, the Defendants were assisted by specialist intellectual property solicitors and counsel.  </p>

Since that time, the Defendants have played no active part in the proceedings. They filed neither fact evidence nor expert evidence. Therefore, again unusually for the IPEC, the Claimant (rightly) listed the matter for a Pre-Trial Review before me on 7 September 2020 to determine whether the Defendants intended to take part in the trial, and to ensure that the trial could take place efficiently and without wasting the parties’ and the court’s resources. The Defendants did not attend the Pre-Trial Review, and were not represented. At that hearing, I made orders relating to the management of the case, including shortening the listing of the trial from </p>

The rule applies in civil cases as it does in criminal. In general the CPR does not alter that position. This rule serves the important function of giving the witness the opportunity of explaining any contradiction or alleged problem with his evidence. If a party has decided not to cross-examine on a particular important point, he will be in difficulty in submitting that the evidence should be rejected. However, the rule is not an inflexible one. For example, if there is a time-limit imposed by the judge on cross-examination it may not be practicable to cross-examine on every minor point, particularly where a lengthy witness statement has been served and treated as evidence-in-chief. Thus, in practice there is bound to be at least some relaxation of the rule. Failure to put a relevant matter to a witness may be most appropriately remedied by the court permitting the recall of that witness to have the matter put to him.” </p>

She also set out her opinions on the skilled team, the common general knowledge and each of the pleaded pieces of prior art, prior to reviewing the Patent. She also considered the pleaded unregistered designs, and the Claimant’s passing off case. I return to her evidence on these points below. </p>

I agree. Ms Rogan’s report was, as I have said, carefully prepared and convincing. The facts on which she relies are set out in her report. I have read Ms Rogan’s report in detail and accept her evidence as to the facts on which she relies to support the opinions she has expressed: nothing is to be gained by setting her report out in full here.

The edge of the fabric below the cut is folded over so that the seam has four layers of fabric. In addition the edge of the silicon insert is sewn into the seam as a fifth layer.

In other words the area of fabric above the cut has to be sewn into place to fill the gap or aperture between the bottom of the yoke, and the cut which goes from the yoke down and then across almost all the way to the central vertical seam, so as to close it. I think this area of fabric would be understood by the skilled person as a second element in the terms of the Patent, since it covers the buttock, is separate at every point except between the inner edge of the rear pocket and the vertical seam (which itself is formed by sewing the rectilinear edges of the two pieces of the second element together), and has to be sewn into place around all its edges.” </p>

The fact that the lateral seam is fractionally shorter than it otherwise would have been will not make any significant difference to the overall effect that the curved seam and central seam have to outline and to separate the buttocks. Nor does it affect the way in which the insert panels work to smooth the hips and lift the buttocks. The connection between the lateral seam and the central vertical seam may be a little less firm, but I do not believe that this will make any real difference.” </p>

Typically, he said, this will involve an item of prior art that is acknowledged by the patent, or a piece of CGK that the patentee would, in the views of the skilled person, want to avoid. He submitted that there is no such material before me. I agree. Not only is none of the pleaded prior art mentioned in the Patent, I have found it could not be described as close or otherwise limiting on the Patent, particularly in relation to this particular seam. I have no hesitation at all in finding that, had I found that the Second HUGZ Jeans did not fall within a normal interpretation of the Patent, I would have found infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.  </p>

The Second HUGZ Jeans are an obvious rip-off of the WR.UP jeans. The Defendants have clearly adopted very similar branding elements, which, as Ms Rogan says, consumers will recognise as an indication of origin. That is clearly the Defendants’ intention – as Ms Rogan says, the Defendants promote the Second HUGZ Jeans (particularly with on-line sales) by reference to HUGZ Get-Up, which is very similar to the Freddy Get-Up. Whilst there are minor differences (differences in the image on the metallic badge, only one diagonal beltloop), these are insufficient to dispel the misrepresentation caused by the other elements. I also note that it does not matter that the trade mark under which the Second HUGZ Jeans are sold is different. The rear branding elements which comprise the HUGZ Get-Up are sufficiently strong that that is what consumers recognise: see the speech of Lord Oliver at page 411 in <span style="font-style:italic">Jif Lemon</span>.

Finally, as a matter of principle, I find it difficult to see why it should matter if confusion only arises after the goods have been sold. Suppose that a consumer orders goods from a third party’s website and, at the time of ordering, is not confused as the trade origin of the goods; but when the goods arrive some days later, the goods are labelled in a manner which wrongly leads the consumer to believe that the goods emanate from the trade mark proprietor. Why should such confusion not be actionable? It falls within the scope of a contextual assessment of the use of the sign. It is surely capable of being damaging to the trade mark proprietor. For example, it may cause the consumer to obtain the goods from the same website the next time he or she orders those goods under the same mistaken belief. And why should it make any difference for these purposes whether the goods are labelled with a sign identical to the trade mark or merely one that is similar to the trade mark i.e. whether the case falls within Article 5(1)(a) or 5(1)(b)?  </p>

There is no reason in principle why this aim should be frustrated. It is a legitimate and classic use of a mark. If the Kimbyr argument is correct the purpose of this mark would be negated. A defendant could insert a deliberately misleading mark on a garment, ensure that there was no confusion at point of sale, but continue to gain the benefit of its unethical trading by arguing that the confusion happened after sale only. This kind of result would cut against the clear objective of the trade marks legislation which is to support the use of trade marks to distinguish the goods of one manufacturer or trader from others and to minimise public confusion. To the extent that the protruding tab is a novel kind of mark, the court must respond appropriately to modern business developments: see the observations of Whitford J in <span style="font-style:italic">Unidoor Ltd v Marks and Spencer plc</span> [1988] RPC 275.” </p>

Since the misrepresentation is continuing to be caused by the Kimbyr jeans and it is damaging the reputation or goodwill of the plaintiffs, the cause of action has been established. The owner of the goodwill in a product is entitled to have this goodwill protected throughout the life of the product not just at the point of sale. Once again the purpose of the Levi Strauss mark is relevant. Since the plaintiffs have satisfied the court that the protruding tab device continues to operate as an effective badge of ownership connecting the jeans with the proprietor it is inevitable that Kimbyr actions in adopting a similar mark, for presumably the same purpose, must cause Kimbyr jeans to be passed off as Levi’s.” </p>

I accept Ms Rogan’s explanation, as far as it goes. However, the difficulty I have is that the Amended Particulars of Claim aver that the shape the jeans take when worn “will necessarily be influenced by the body shape of the wearer”. It is not enough to say that all wearers will have their buttocks both lifted and separated by the WR.UP jeans. I must assess the design as claimed. The Claimant itself avers that the shape of the jeans “when worn” will in part be determined by the shape of the wearer, and, even within a range of body shapes that would fit a given size of jeans, there will be a significant variation in body shapes. There was no evidence to say that the variously shaped wearers would all end up shaped the same when wearing the jeans. I accept Ms Rogan’s evidence that the wearers’ buttocks would be lifted and separated, but if those buttocks are of differing shapes, the resultant shapes of the jeans “when worn” will differ.  </p>

Counsel for the Claimant drew an analogy with a balloon, the rubber of which was of differing characteristics with different elasticities. When inflated, the balloon would not adopt a uniform shape. He said “when it is in its packet, it looks like a normal balloon, but when it is inflated, it adopts a fantastic shape of an animal. </p>

This expression has been held to exclude two types of claims. First, the exception has been used to exclude protection for abstract claims that are expressed too broadly beyond a claim to shape and/or configuration. Whilst a degree of abstraction is permitted, if the claim is taken too far, it will be found to be a method or principle of construction: <span style="font-style:italic">DKH Retail Limited v H Young (Operations) Limited </span>[2014] EWHC 4032 (IPEC) per HHJ Hacon.

One is the method whereby the case retains its rectangular box-like shape when the umbrella is not contained within it. Another is the stitching technique which creates the outward-pointing seams on the edges and at the corners of the case. However, the design of the case is the shape or configuration produced by those methods of construction, not the methods by which that shape or configuration is produced. The fact that a special method or principle of construction may have to be used in order to create an article with a particular shape or configuration does not mean that there is no design right in the shape or configuration. The law of design right will not prevent competitors using that method or principle of construction to create competing designs (of course other areas of the law, like patents, might prevent competitors doing that), as long as the competing designs do not have the same shape or configuration as the design right owner's design has.” </p>

However, this pleading misunderstands the statutory exception. The Claimant conceded that a knitted fabric is a method or principle of construction, as is the application of the rubberised panels – but that is not the design that is being claimed here. The JOTO Design is for the shape and/or configuration of a part of the jeans, made from various fabrics and materials. That is a claim to shape/configuration, not to a method or principle of construction. To paraphrase Park J, the design is the shape or configuration produced by those methods of construction, not the methods by which that shape or configuration is produced. </p>

It would be a mistake to go into more metaphysics to reach the answer. That lies in the policy of according ordinary copyright to surface decoration and UDR to original designs, irrespective of whether they are functional or not. The functional is to go into the UDR box. For that reason I would not include surface features which have significant function as “surface decoration”. Trivial additional function may not matter — for instance the function of covering cracks as in the case of the beading considered in <span style="font-style:italic">Mark Wilkinson</span> (if indeed you regard that as function at all, which, like the Judge, I doubt — covering visible cracks for appearance reasons is hardly functional). </p>

This is to misunderstand the statutory exception, which is to exclude protection for surface decoration. There is nothing in the CDPA to exclude protection for, for example, the shape of a piece of paper or the shape of a piece of fabric. Whilst these two examples are thin, and largely in two dimensions, they are still three-dimensional objects, even if one of those dimensions is difficult to measure. Similarly, the Inner Parts Design and the JOTO Design can be laid flat, but this part of the jeans remains a three-dimensional object, which is neither “a surface” nor “surface decoration”. This objection fails, as does the objection that the stitching is surface decoration: the stitching is functional, as Ms Rogan states.  </p>
