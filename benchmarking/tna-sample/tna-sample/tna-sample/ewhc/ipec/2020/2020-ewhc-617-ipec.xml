	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">The factual background is largely agreed, and can be briefly stated. The Claimant manufactures and sells raw pet food. Raw pet food is only part of the pet food market – and a comparatively small part at that. Significantly larger parts of the pet food market are occupied by dry food (such as kibble (which is extruded), flaked foods, biscuits (which are baked) and freeze-dried food) and wet food (which is cooked food with a high moisture content, usually sold in cans, foil trays or pouches). The Claimant’s raw pet food is sold frozen in plastic tubs under the brand NATURAL INSTINCT, which is also the name of the company. The Claimant also sells a small number of dried “treats” (such as liver treats and chicken hearts) as well as raw “treats” (such as chicken carcasses and bones). Approximately 80% of the Claimant’s business is dog food, and 20% is cat food.  </p>

Two examples were given. First, Mr Taylor told the court that all of the Defendant’s products included the house brand NATURES MENU, when, as I have set out above, that is not the case. Second, he was unable to answer questions put to him about when he had changed his mind about the Claimant’s bidding on “true instinct” as a Google Ad. I did not find Mr Taylor to be a helpful witness. He was argumentative, and prone to long exculpatory answers that did not address the questions put to him. He also refused to accept basic propositions put to him. In my judgment, he was neither frank nor forthright in his answers to the court, but was rather trying to give answers that he felt would assist the Defendant’s case or would not compromise the Defendant’s case. I therefore find myself, regrettably, unable to accept his evidence except in circumstances where it is corroborated by contemporaneous documents or other witnesses.  </p>

I do not accept counsel for the Claimant’s position that I should read the “and” as a disjunctive – that is, that the obligation was to provide disclosure of all documents in the Defendant’s control relating to the issue of passing off, and all documents on which the Defendant wished to rely in support of its case relating to the issue of passing off. I read “and” in his Honour’s order as a conjunctive – the documents must be both in the Defendant’s control <span style="font-style:italic">and also</span> documents on which the Defendant wishes to rely in support of its case. As the Defendant did not wish to rely on instances of confusion, in my judgment, it was not required to disclose any such documents under the terms of that order.  </p>

However, this, of itself, did not bring any relevant documents within the disclosure obligation set out in HHJ Hacon’s order. Whilst such documents would be documents on which the Defendant <span style="font-style:italic">could</span> rely, they were not documents on which the Defendant <span style="font-style:italic">wishes to</span> rely. In short, I do not read his Honour’s order as providing for disclosure of anything other than documents on which the Defendant wished to rely – the order merely brings forward the provision to the other side of documents which the party would otherwise have had to attach to a witness statement or otherwise adduce in court in order to rely on them. It did not require a search for or the provision of documents which a party wished to hide from the other.  </p>

I do not accept that submission. The Disclosure Pilot has been in operation for over 12 months. Professionals who litigate frequently in the IPEC (and that is the case here) know that the obligation to disclose known adverse documents applies: it is expressly set out in the IPEC Guide. Counsel for the Defendant readily conceded as much in court – his argument at trial was that this obligation subsists, but does not require a search, a proposition which I accept.  </p>

First, he must establish a goodwill or reputation attached to the goods or services which he supplies in the mind of the purchasing public by association with the identifying “get-up” (whether it consists simply of a brand name or a trade description, or the individual features of labelling or packaging) under which his particular goods or services are offered to the public, such that the get-up is recognised by the public as distinctive specifically of the plaintiff's goods or services. Secondly, he must demonstrate a misrepresentation by the defendant to the public (whether or not intentional) leading or likely to lead the public to believe that goods or services offered by him are the goods or services of the plaintiff. … Thirdly, he must demonstrate that he suffers or, in a <span style="font-style:italic">quia timet</span> action that he is likely to suffer, damage by reason of the erroneous belief engendered by the defendant's misrepresentation that the source of the defendant's goods or services is the same as the source of those offered by the plaintiff.” </p>

On page 16 of the IPSOS Report, the authors note under a heading “Category image, brand awareness and purchase” that “Natures:menu [sic], Natural Instinct and Country Hunter are the strongest raw food brands”. The first and last of these three are the Defendant’s brands – the second is the Claimant. Page 18 of the IPSOS Report sets out the authors’ survey of the market, in which they surveyed 1008 dog owners between </p>

Of those surveyed, 34% of respondents were aware of the Defendant’s NATURES MENU brand, and 22% were aware of the Claimant’s NATURAL INSTINCT brand. Whilst Mr Taylor sought to argue under cross-examination that this figure was not representative of the market, I do not accept his evidence on this point because it is not corroborated elsewhere – indeed, the IPSOS Report directly contradicts his position. I consider the IPSOS Report more likely to be correct – it was prepared at the relevant time, by an independent third party, prior to the first letter before action in these proceedings.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">The Claimant conceded issue 4 – that is that by the time of the launch of the Defendant’s TRUE INSTINCT range, its Natures Menu name was well-known to members of the relevant trade and the public as a leading specialist supplier of raw dog and cat food. The Defendant relied on this concession to submit that this reduced the risk of trade mark infringement under sections 10(2) and 10(3) of the Act, and reduced the risk of passing off. I disagree. I have found that the Defendant used both Natures Menu TRUE INSTINCT and TRUE INSTINCT on its own: the issue therefore does not arise in relation to uses of TRUE INSTINCT. Second, as the Court of Justice’s decision in <span style="font-style:italic">THOMSON LIFE</span> (Case C-120/04 <span style="font-style:italic">Medion v Thomson Multimedia Sales Germany &amp; Austria GmbH</span> [2005] ECR I-08551) demonstrates, a trader does not avoid trade mark infringement simply by adding a distinctive house mark. Arnold J (as he then was) applied that jurisprudence in <span style="font-style:italic">Aveda Corporation v Dabur India Ltd</span> [2013] EWHC 589 (Ch), a case where the non-house part of the mark was not identical to the earlier mark, but only similar. As a question of law, therefore, it cannot be said that adding a distinctive and reputed house mark to a mark which maintains its independent distinctive character avoids trade mark infringement. Further, on the facts of this case, the uses of Natures Menu are visually very small, such that the reasonably circumspect consumer will not pay them significant attention. Natures Menu is still part of the sign (as I have found), but it is not the dominant part of the sign. Further, I can see no reason why the Defendant’s submissions should succeed in relation to passing off when they have failed in relation to registered trade mark infringement. In my infringement assessment below, I have taken account of how the Defendant uses </p>

On the other hand, the Defendant’s signs consist of four words in one case and only two words in the other. The Claimant described “dog and cat food as nature intended” as “some extra laudatory wording underneath”. That may be putting the matter insufficiently highly – but it seems to me that the dominant element of the Trade Mark is the words NATURAL INSTINCT: that is what will strike consumers, and how the product will be referred to. Of course, I must not ignore the additional laudatory words, but I find that the dominant visual element is the words NATURAL INSTINCT. Similarly, in relation to the four word sign, I cannot ignore the words NATURES MENU and the roundel device, but they are presented in a much smaller font – I consider the dominant element of this sign to be TRUE INSTINCT. There is therefore a clear similarity of the word INSTINCT as between the Trade Mark and the two signs.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">It was suggested, based on Mr Taylor’s evidence, that INSTINCT is a descriptive term when it comes to pet food, because pets will “instinctively” eat the food they prefer. He listed in his first witness statement a number of third parties who he said sold products that include the word INSTINCT in their name. These included, for example, a German pet food company BEKURO Pet Food GmbH which sells an INSTINCT product in Germany, as well as other non-UK entities. Of the 13 examples he gave, most appeared to me not to be within the United Kingdom. As I have said, I have not accepted Mr Taylor’s evidence unless it is corroborated by other evidence. Under crossexamination, Ms Kinge accepted that Sussex-based Jack Wolf sells a range of food under the PRIMAL INSTINCT name and that K9 Instinct sells products under the K9 INSTINCT name in the UK. But there was no evidence as to how well-known these products were, the level of sales in the United Kingdom, the length of time they had been on the market, or whether they were available prior to the relevant date in 2017. This is therefore not sufficient to show significant use of INSTINCT for pet food in the United Kingdom so as to establish that the term is descriptive or even widely used. His written evidence also does not accord with what, in my judgment, consumers will take from the Trade Mark and from the signs. In my judgment, INSTINCT is not descriptive in relation to pet food.  </p>

I have found that the Trade Mark had, by September 2017, acquired a high degree of distinctiveness through use, making a likelihood of confusion more likely. I have also held that, whilst Natures Menu was at the relevant date a well-reputed brand, that does not exculpate the Defendant from trade mark infringement. The parties agreed that the relevant consumer was an average, reasonably circumspect consumer, and given the high number of pet cats and dogs in the United Kingdom, that must be the case. Whilst pet owners care for their animals, they are no more than usually attentive. Taking into account the similarity of both signs to the Trade Mark (to a medium degree) and the identity of the goods, taking into account the context in which the signs are used, and the case law to which I was referred, in my judgment, there is a likelihood of confusion. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">This argument was ingenious, but flawed, for two primary reasons. First, I have found above that the Defendant failed to comply with its obligations to disclose to the Claimant documents evidencing apparent actual confusion. Mr Taylor’s and Ms Guy’s evidence was that this happened “frequently”. Therefore, it cannot lie in the Defendant’s mouth to say “you have not provided enough examples” where it failed to comply with an obligation to provide the examples of which it was aware. I cannot say how many such examples the Defendant had – but Mr Taylor’s and Ms Guy’s evidence was that confusion was “frequent”. The Defendant cannot benefit from its failure to comply with its obligations: this argument is therefore not open to it. Second, I disagree with the Defendant on the basis of the facts of this case. Each case of trade mark infringement/passing off differs, but on the facts of this case, I do not consider that it can be said that the examples of apparent confusion that were evidenced were small in number, such that they annul my finding of a likelihood of confusion. There may be cases where a far greater number of instances of confusion might be expected – but this is not such a case. </p>

Counsel for the Defendant submitted that the usual approach in these sorts of cases is for the claimant to call a cohort of witnesses who are said to have been confused, and to allow them to be cross-examined to establish whether or not they were in fact confused and if so why. Rather, he said, the Claimant produced witnesses who can do no more than report on what they were told by the allegedly confused consumers. This was despite the Claimant having access to contact details for most of the relevant consumers, and the time and ability to approach them and bring them to court. As a result, said counsel for the Defendant, he was unable to ask the consumers questions, leaving the incidents of alleged confusion “floating and untested”. Thus, he submitted that I was deprived of the opportunity to hear directly from any of the individuals said to have been confused or deceived and what actually caused them mistakenly to contact the Claimant rather than the Defendant.  </p>

It seems to me that the approach taken by the Claimant was entirely appropriate for the IPEC. I start with the proposition that evidence of actual confusion is not necessary to succeed in a trade mark infringement/passing off case. The Claimant had that evidence, and wanted to present it in a cost-effective way appropriate to the IPEC jurisdiction (where, it is to be remembered, trials are limited in most instances to two days and cost recovery is capped). It is unlikely that cross-examination of 35 witnesses could have been achieved in the time available, and the Claimant would not be able to recover within the cap its costs of preparing 35 witness statements. The approach the Claimant adopted enabled the evidence to be before the court, and to be tested at a level appropriate to this jurisdiction.  </p>

In closing, counsel for the Defendant expressly said that he made no criticism of the Claimant for not negatively matching, but he did submit that if the Claimant wished to avoid administrative confusion, it should have negatively matched. It is difficult to see the difference between this submission as made and a criticism of the Claimant for not negatively matching. Either way, I reject the Defendant’s position. The very purpose of the Google Ads program is to increase internet traffic for the purchaser of search terms. So long as the system is used lawfully, it does not seem to me that a trade mark owner can be criticised for using the system lawfully when it brings trade mark infringement proceedings against a third party which adopts a mark later in time. Put another way, a defendant cannot reasonably say “these examples of confusion may have been caused by the trade mark owner’s failure to negatively match and therefore they cannot be relied on as evidence of actual consumer confusion”.

At that point, Ms Walker had not twigged to any confusion between the Claimant and the Defendant, and offered to discuss KC’s concerns. KC responded “I'm just very frustrated why this is clearly falsely advertised”. She attached a picture of the packaging to which she referred. The packaging is the Defendant’s product. Ms Walker responded stating as much.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">Again, counsel for the Defendant submitted that Ms Walker’s evidence is consistent with an angry and frustrated KC undertaking a Google search for TRUE INSTINCT, being provided with an ad for the Claimant, and then clicking through to the web contact form. That may be the case, but it does not explain why KC’s confusion was not corrected by (a) the clear uses of the Trade Mark on the Claimant’s website or (b) the clear uses of the Trade Mark in Ms Walker’s emails or (c) the use of Ms Walker’s email address @naturalinstinct.com. There was no suggestion that KC was other than a reasonably circumspect consumer – she expresses herself to be aware of other products on the market. I therefore find that she was confused/mislead by the similarity between the Defendant’s signs and the Trade Mark.   </p>

The Claimant responded saying that it only sold raw food. JB then said “Thanks I knew they were wrong but the person would not have it – says she works there and they stock it – so thanks for clarifying”.

Counsel for the Defendant also relied on the use of “seems” in JB’s comment about the apparent confusion by the salesperson. It is clear that JB herself was not confused – indeed, she was adamant that she was correct – she apparently knew the Claimant’s range well. But she reported apparent confusion by a salesperson at Pets at Home, who one would assume would be more knowledgeable and attentive than the reasonably circumspect consumer. Whilst clearly not as useful as a first-hand account, this would appear to me to be unsolicited evidence of confusion on the part of the salesperson at Pets at Home. It is less consistent with the Defendant’s submission that the salesperson undertook a Google search and was misdirected: a Pets at Home salesperson would know what they stock, and would not be using Google to locate it. </p>

I disagree. Whilst it is not completely clear on the exchange, it seems likely that ZW wanted to purchase the Claimant’s products, and, having sought the Claimant’s advice, and then mistakenly purchased the Defendant’s products on Amazon.com. Alternatively, ZW had already purchased “this food” prior to contacting the Claimant, but did so thinking that the Claimant and the Defendant were the same company. In either case, ZW would appear to be a reasonably circumspect consumer, who contacted the Claimant through the Claimant’s Facebook page, where she would have seen the Trade Mark prominently displayed. She clearly cared enough to ask the question on how to switch from one food brand to another, and admitted, in terms, to thinking the Claimant and the Defendant were the same company. In my judgment, she was clearly relevantly confused/misled.  </p>

Such evidence can be hard to come by, particularly in circumstances where the trade mark owner does not own and run its own bricks and mortar stores. Here, the Claimant deals directly with about half of its consumers, but these dealings are rarely face-to-face. Given that the majority of consumer contact is through the telephone, websites, Facebook etc, consumers’ true motivations will rarely be crystal clear. I have reviewed the evidence carefully: it is clear to me that there is ample evidence of actual consumer confusion by relevant consumers to confirm my findings above that there is a likelihood of confusion in this case.  </p>

Further, I have accepted that the Claimant’s evidence does show that there has been confusion of reasonably circumspect consumers. In my judgment, based on the evidence, the logical deduction can be made that there are changes to consumers’ economic behaviour: <span style="font-style:italic">Sky v SkyKick</span> at paragraph 311 and Case C-383/12 <span style="font-style:italic">Environmental Manufacturing LLP v OHIM</span>. </p>

As can probably be seen from the tone of some of the emails and messages that my colleagues and I have had to deal with, when the pet owners feel that they have been let down by the dog or cat food providers, they are very upset about this. My view is that, in this industry, if there is one bad experience of a product it could lead to a situation where you stop using a brand or indeed, in Natural Instinct’s case, if a customer or potential customer has confused us with a bad experience he or she has had with Natures Menu, we may never get another chance to supply product to that customer. It is a very sensitive market. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">In relation to unfair advantage, this seems to me to be less certain. I have considered carefully the Claimant’s submission that the Defendant adopted TRUE INSTINCT as a brand for raw food having received the IPSOS Report on 25 July 2017. Whilst the results of the IPSOS Report may have contributed to the Defendant proceeding with a launch of TRUE INSTINCT, it cannot, in my judgment, have been the instigator of the concept, because the Defendant registered the domain name <a href="http://www.trueinstinct.co.uk/">
		<span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#0000FF">www.trueinstinct.co.uk</span>
	      </a><a href="http://www.trueinstinct.co.uk/">
		<span> </span>
	      </a>in December 2016, some 7 months prior to the IPSOS Report, and, further, the day after receiving the IPSOS Report, the Defendant entered into a written licence with a third party owner of an EUTM for TRUE INSTINCT – it is extremely improbable that that licence was negotiated and signed in under 24 hours. I have no hesitation in concluding that the Defendant was aware of the Claimant and its products at the time it adopted the TRUE INSTINCT brand. At the time of the launch of its TRUE INSTINCT product, it was aware that NATURAL INSTINCT was the second largest raw food seller in the market, after products sold under its own Natures Menu brand. But whether the Defendant intended to or not, the trust shown in the NATURAL INSTINCT brand (as demonstrated by the <span style="font-style:italic">Dogs Monthly</span> survey) indicates that, in fact, the Defendant is likely to receive a leg up as a result of the link formed in consumers’ minds, and that advantage is, in my judgment, unfair.  </p>

The Defendant did not address this condition in any detail – however, it suggested in another context that it was operating under a licence provided by the owner of an EUTM for a word mark for TRUE INSTINCT registered for pet food. This is EUTM 012786547 referred to in issues 8 and 9 which were not ultimately pressed. Nevertheless, that does not establish due cause within the case law as it is presently understood: see <span style="font-style:italic">Sky v SkyKick</span> paragraph 316 citing Case C-65/12 <span style="font-style:italic">Leidseplein Beheer BV v Red Bull GmbH</span>.  </p>

A further argument was made, although not pressed with any enthusiasm, that the Claimant also has rights in the word “raw” and in the colourways it uses for its packaging, and that therefore the Defendant’s use of the word “raw” and similar colours on its packaging also lead to passing off. In my judgment, “raw” is clearly a descriptive term for pet food which is not cooked – indeed, “raw” is acknowledged by both parties to be the name of the relevant market segment in which they both operate. Therefore, no one trader can monopolise the term – that would be akin to an argument that one brand of milk was passing off another because both were described as “homogenised”. I also reject the Claimant’s arguments based on the packaging colourways. Whilst both use various shades of browns and oranges, the packaging is not sufficiently similar, in my judgment, to constitute a misrepresentation – it is simply too different.  </p>
