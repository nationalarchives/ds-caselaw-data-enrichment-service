An email sent (probably) in November 2012 from Professor Grosvenor showed that at that stage he considered that further amendment of the draft was required, but as I understand it the Claimant's position is that this complaint prevented her from finalising the thesis.

I believe that an article published in the journal, "Race, Ethnicity and Education" authored by him and entitled "A tradition in ceaseless motion: critical race theory and black intellectual spaces”, published online in January 2012, bears an extremely close resemblance to the original ideas and work that I had submitted towards my PhD thesis to my supervisors between 2007 - 2011. I also raised an additional concern that Dr Warmington had submitted a book proposal to Routledge publishers which I believe substantively bears an almost identical outline and content to my work related to the black British activism in education the 1960s onwards. … the theoretical framework, the use of sources and the substantive ideas that appear in the draft thesis and completed thesis that I submitted in December 2011 are almost identical to the article written by Dr Warmington and are outlined in the book proposal submitted by him to Routledge publishers. I've also been previously concerned that original work/draft chapters that I submitted to my supervisors towards my thesis had been reworked by them in two articles that were later published in journals. These include [the Myers and Grosvenor/Myers Articles]. I was not invited to contribute to his articles and my original work, although unpublished, was not acknowledged in the list of references or elsewhere. … I did not want to and was not able to raise my concerns with my previous supervisors regarding my concerns of the plagiarism of my work …” </p>

Professor Wolff ran the article by Dr Warmington and my submitted thesis through Turnitin. I had not published the work, therefore, the Turnitin tool was not an appropriate tool to undertake an investigation of plagiarism. I had submitted the draft thesis as evidence; this was never evaluated against the article written by Dr Warmington … This draft thesis and particularly the introductory chapter constituted the substantive evidence for the claim of plagiarism. Turnitin is a tool that can highlight similarities between texts, but its central purpose is to evidence where textual materials have been lifted verbatim with little or no alteration from an original text. Plagiarism that refers to the substantive replication of ideas and sources will require a more sophisticated form of investigation." </p>

On the other hand, it is clear that there was continuing communication between the University and the Claimant at least until January 2019. In particular, by a letter dated 6 August 2018 the University offered to carry out further investigations into the circumstantial evidence surrounding the submission of her material and how (if at all) that was accessed by Dr Warmington. However, the letter stated that the Warmington Article was date-stamped as finished by 16 March 2011 and the book proposal had first been discussed with the 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Defendant in January 2011, before submission of the thesis, although not before the submission of the individual chapters. It seems that the Claimant did not take the University up on that offer, but continued to threaten proceedings. The Claimant has, therefore, been corresponding about this matter with the Defendants for over 7 years. No limitation point was taken by the Defendants. </p>

Thus the court should hesitate about making a final decision without a trial, even where there is no obvious conflict of fact at the time of the application, where reasonable grounds exist for believing that a fuller investigation into the facts of the case would add to or alter the evidence available to a trial judge and so affect the outcome of the case: <span style="font-style:italic">Doncaster Pharmaceuticals Group Ltd v Bolton Pharmaceutical Co 100 Ltd</span> [2007] FSR 63; vii) On the other hand it is not uncommon for an application under Part 24 to give rise to a short point of law or construction and, if the court is satisfied that it has before it all the evidence necessary for the proper determination of the question and that the parties have had an adequate opportunity to address it in argument, it should grasp the nettle and decide it. The reason is quite simple: if the respondent's case is bad in law, he will in truth have no real prospect of succeeding on his claim or successfully defending the claim against him, as the case may be. Similarly, if the applicant's case is bad in law, the sooner that is determined, the better. If it is possible to show by evidence that although material in the form of documents or oral evidence that would put the documents in another light is not currently before the court, such material is likely to exist and can be expected to be available at trial, it would be wrong to give summary judgment because there would be a real, as opposed to a fanciful, prospect of success. However, it is not enough simply to argue that the case should be allowed to go to trial because something may turn up which would have a bearing on the question of construction: <span style="font-style:italic">ICI Chemicals &amp; Polymers Ltd v TTE Training Ltd </span>[2007] EWCA Civ 725." </p>

Even if (and there was no evidence to this effect) the phrase was coined by the Claimant, it seems to me of little inherent originality, and Dr Warmington could have come up with it independently.  In the absence of any other, more substantial evidence of copying, this single example does not strike me as indicative of copying, still less of copying of a substantial part of the Claimant’s works. It does not, in my view, amount to reproduction of a substantial part of any of the Claimant’s works, or the expression of the Claimant’s intellectual creation.</p>

An obligation of confidentiality might therefore arise in the case of the 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> and 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Defendants, and might equally apply to the University as their employer.

Her failure to do so may stem from her apparent belief that it is for the Defendants to justify their position, and to prove that they did not use her confidential information. If the Claimant is to make out her case of breach of confidence, she must identify the confidential information which she says has been misused. Indeed, she should have realised that was the case in the light of the correspondence from the Defendants’ respective solicitors and the Order made by HHJ Hacon. The Claimant has, in my judgment, failed to do that so far in these proceedings.  Indeed, strangely, at paragraph 28 of her witness statement of 23 July 2019, the Claimant “categorically” denied that the claims were about the "stealing of her ideas."</p>

However, many of these post-date 2007, such as the Student Concerns and Complaints Procedure (2011). The Claimant sets out a number of express or implied terms of that Procedure, without saying which terms are express and which implied.

The Claimant said at paragraph 8 of the Particulars of Claim that the contract between her and the University placed a common law duty of care on the University “in delivering its educational and pastoral duties.” She did not identify where in any document that duty was set out. Paragraph 49 of the Particulars of Claim sets out some particulars of alleged breaches of “contract/duty/care” relating to the University, such as a complaint that it failed to comply with requests for information from the OIA and sought to withhold information from it.  Similarly, in paragraph 55 she complains of the University's failure to provide all relevant documents regarding investigation of the copyright infringement claim when fulfilling her Subject Access Request. Those complaints do not seem to me to amount to allegations of negligence but are part and parcel of the Claimant’s claim for breach of contract.  </span>

In her witness statement of 23 July 2019, the Claimant complained that the University had not attempted to make a search of any documents pertaining to sex and race discrimination. She said that in the absence of such documents, it is only possible to infer that the failure of the University to fulfil its contractual obligations to the Claimant is the result of race and sex discrimination.
