In fact, it is common ground that it is impermissible to construe the claims by reference to the alleged infringement; (b) Mr Brewer’s report discloses that he addressed construction issues in a manner which sought to distinguish between the Prior Art and the claims of the Patent. It is, again, common ground that this is an impermissible approach (per <span style="font-style:italic">Beloit Technologies v Valmet</span> [1995] RPC 705).  </p>

I agree that he did give fair and independent oral evidence and, in my judgment, came to court to assist it to the best of his abilities, and did assist the court. In his oral evidence, Mr Brewer made a large number of concessions amending the opinions set out in his report and/or accepting propositions derived from Professor Landrock’s evidence. For that reason, I give greater weight to his oral evidence than his written evidence. The Defendants contend that Mr Brewer, who is not a patent expert, should have been given much greater assistance by the Claimant’s solicitors, who should have ensured that his written evidence was soundly based on the proper approach to issues of the skilled person, the common general knowledge, construction, etc. It would be wrong of me to criticise the Claimant’s solicitors when they have not had the opportunity to respond to this criticism and I have no evidence about the instructions given or clarifications provided by them.  </p>

He obtained his PhD in mathematics from the University of Chicago in 1974 and his academic career has included Professor of Mathematics at Aarhus University and visiting Professor at Princeton, Oxford and Leuven Universities. Since 1997 he has been a senior member of Wolfson College, Cambridge. In 1986 he founded a Danish limited company, Cryptomathic, and shifted focus from mathematics to cryptography. He has acted as a member of the Danish IT Security Council from 1999 to 2007, the Technical Advisory Board of Microsoft from 1997 to 2010 and the Technical Advisory Board of the Turing Gateway of Mathematics at Cambridge University from 2014 to date. He was nominated by the EPO as a finalist for a lifetime achievement award in European Inventor 2010 and was awarded the degree of Doctor of Science Honoris causa by the University of Bristol for his lifetime achievement in cryptographic technology. </p>

I do not consider that is fair criticism. I consider that he approached the key elements upon which he opined in the correct way, and gave neutral, professional, informed and clear evidence to the Court. She made other specific criticisms of his handling of Martens which I reject later in this judgment. I found him to be a good witness who provided significant assistance to the Court. </p>

It is common ground that a patent specification is addressed to those likely to have a real and practical interest in the subject matter of the invention (which includes making it as well as putting it into practice); such persons are those with practical knowledge and experience of the field in which the invention is intended to be used. The skilled addressee of the Patent reads the specification with the common general knowledge of persons skilled in the relevant art at the application date of the patent (here, 1 February 2013), and knowing that its purpose is to disclose and demarcate an invention. The skilled person reads prior art documents with interest but is unimaginative and has no inventive capacity. He may be a team of persons with differing expertise, or a single person with all the practical knowledge and experience needed.

Accordingly, I accept Professor Landrock’s opinion that the patent would be read by those with both financial/banking and cryptographic expertise, with the cryptographic expertise at the level which Professor Landrock describes in oral evidence.

They contend that the Patent requires decoding in order to check the security, and the only mechanism which the Patent discloses and teaches (generation of a code by conversion to a higher base) is capable of being decoded. The Defendants’ contention appears to be grounded in the fact that the example in the Patent uses decryption as part of the validation process. However, I accept the Claimant’s submission that Claims 1 and 6 do not specify the method of validation and are not limited to the example. Alternatively, the Claimant submits that the Defendants are attempting to construe the meaning of <span style="font-style:italic">“code”</span> with hindsight, by reference to the alleged infringement, which claims to use a non-decryptable or irreversible code in the form of a one-way hashing  function.

Professor Landrock referred to these ‘backwards’ and ‘forwards’ methods as utilising either ‘reversible’ or ‘one way’ cryptography respectively, and in his first report and in oral evidence he accepted that both methods were being used ubiquitously within the banking industry at the priority date of the Patent.  </p>

I remind myself that Mr Brewer does not stand in the shoes of the skilled addressee and I also keep in mind the errors in approach that I have found Mr Brewer has taken to construction. However, Mr Brewer at paragraph 79 of his report explains that <span style="font-style:italic">“the or each string of information is converted to a code by conversion to a higher base”</span> means <span style="font-style:italic">“</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">this is the process of disguising the Personalisation Data, or a subset of it by converting it from base 10 to a higher base</span><span style="font-style:italic"> which, of necessity, will involve use of non-numeric characters.” </span>(my emphasis).

Against integer 1.5 he opines that the meaning of the integer is as follows: <span style="font-style:italic">“The Personalisation Data is considered to be decimal data and is rendered into one of </span>[should be ‘or’]<span style="font-style:italic"> more strings. These are converted to a different, higher base”</span>.

In part, this is for practical reasons; the area available for printing on a cheque is limited by industry standards so that only relatively short strings can be conveniently printed and raising the base of a number usually results in a shorter string”</span> (my emphasis). Once again, Mr Brewer identifies the encryption, or ‘disguising’, or ‘obscuring’ element of Claim 1 as being provided by the conversion to a higher base. In neither description does he identify the possibility of another meaning, namely that that the skilled person might understand the Claim to cover encryption by another cryptographic process, followed by presentation of the output in a higher base, as the Claimant contends it should be construed. </p>

Mr Ward submits that would be a monopoly which exceeds by a very great way the Claimant’s contribution to the art. I accept that submission. I remind myself that a patent is a social contract between the inventor and the public. The inventor teaches a new product or process, and in doing so adds to the sum of the public’s knowledge, receiving as a reward a monopoly of that product or process for a period. The extent of the monopoly conferred by the patent must correspond with the extent of the contribution which it makes to the art, as the Supreme Court reminded us very recently in its discussion of sufficiency at paragraphs 23 and 24 of the judgment of Lord Briggs (with whom Lord Reed, Lord Hodge and Lord Sales agreed) in <span style="font-style:italic">Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc v Kymab Ltd</span> [2020] UKSC 27.  </p>

Given this contribution to the art (if it is a contribution to the art at all, which I will retUCN to), to construe the Patent as providing a monopoly of the width contended for by the Claimant would be, in my judgment, outwith the social contract and unjustifiable, even before looking at legitimate arguments which could be raised about the sufficiency of the Patent’s teaching across that width. </p>

The Defendants’ primary argument is both literal and purposive: the literal argument is that the plain language of the claim states that it is <span style="font-style:italic">“the generated code”</span> that must be applied, not ‘the whole or part of the generated code’; the purposive argument is founded in part on the Defendants’ argument that <span style="font-style:italic">“code”</span> is limited to ‘decryptable code’, and so the whole of the generated code must be printed in order for it to be decrypted.

Indeed, the Patent specification identifies this as an advantage of presenting the coded output in a higher base at page 6, lines 15-20, as space on a cheque for the printing of additional information in machine-readable form is limited. Accordingly, the Defendants submit that the skilled addressee of the Patent, aware that the Patent teaches generation of a code by conversion to a higher base, and aware both from the Patent description and the common general knowledge that conversion to a higher base would result in a code of fewer characters than the Personalisation Data or subset thereof forming the input, would understand the reference to “<span style="font-style:italic">application of the generated code</span>” on the cheque as meaning the whole code so generated, as there is no purpose disclosed by the Patent to printing only part of it.  </p>

Alternatively her earlier criticism may have been based on a misunderstanding by Dr Lawrence that Professor Landrock was opining that the word <span style="font-style:italic">“cheque”</span> as used in the patent did not include such a pre-printed ‘normal’ cheque as seen in the example, but I did not understand him to hold this opinion and Mr Ward clarified in closing that was not Professor Landrock’s opinion and not the Defendants’ case. In which case the criticism must also fall away. </p>

What it says is what it discloses, and the skilled person can be taken to have understood it in the absence of obvious error and subject to the Court determining any ambiguities in the wording. As I think I made apparent to Counsel before this submission was made, I had identified the two parts to the invention in Martens when carrying out my own pre-trial reading of that patent: it is in no way hidden or ambiguous, and I have no doubt the notional skilled person would understand that is what it discloses.  </p>

Dr Lawrence submits that, logically on this analysis, it cannot be obvious to the skilled person. I do not agree that this follows.

In relation to the second part of the invention, Mr Brewer accepted in crossexamination that the skilled reader would understand that there was limited space in the cheque, and so it would not be appropriate to present the code in binary, which would be too long to print in that space in a way that was legible. Accordingly, the code would need to be presented in a more compact form, and this would require conversion to a higher base, as I am satisfied the skilled reader would understand. Mr Brewer accepted it did not matter in what higher base it was presented, conceding in answer to a question of my own that it would be obvious to the skilled person, reading Martens at the priority date of the Patent, to present that code in hexadecimal.  </p>

It discloses the use of a machine to print cheques. The user types in the serial number of the cheque and the amount that the cheque is for, which is enciphered with a “<span style="font-style:italic">secret code</span>”. The result is called a “<span style="font-style:italic">crypto number</span>”, which is then applied to the payment document, together with the amount and the serial number of the cheque. The genuineness of the cheque can be checked by the use of another machine into which the amount and serial number printed on the cheque is again enciphered with the same “<span style="font-style:italic">secret code</span>” to produce another “<span style="font-style:italic">crypto number</span>”. If the crypto number so produced is identical to that printed on the cheque, the cheque is authenticated. If not, then either the serial number of the cheque or the cheque amount or both have been tampered with. </p>

The claims merely refer to a <span style="font-style:italic">“means for enciphering”</span> which gives rise to a <span style="font-style:italic">“crypto number”. </span>Professor Landrock’s evidence is that the skilled reader would understand at the time Ehrat was published (in 1976) the means of enciphering would likely be either DES (Data Encryption Standard) or Triple DES to ensure that the data could be encrypted and then printed to be read by a machine, since these were standard banking encryption standards at the time. Professor Landrock described the use of DES/triple DES at paragraphs 5.32 to 5.39 in his first report and I have already noted that in oral evidence Mr Brewer agreed with what he wrote. However, it would be obvious to the skilled person reading Ehrat at the priority date, that the crypto number could be produced by use of one of a number of common cryptographic methods such as RSA or SHA-1. Equally, it is obvious that it could be produced by conversion to a higher base, although once again it is likely that the skilled reader would consider that was poor security.   </p>

The program is <span style="font-style:italic">“linked to an apparatus that can print the check as well as a barcode on the check”</span> or alternatively prints the barcode on an adhesive sticker, which can then be stuck onto a cheque which may already printed with Personalisation Data: <span style="font-style:italic">“If the adhesive sticker bar code is used, then the check does not need to be generated by a software program”.</span> The barcode is then used to authenticate the cheque (column 7, line 31 – column 8, line 56). </p>

The common general knowledge of the skilled person includes knowledge of all sorts of cryptographic techniques. For the same reasons that I have given before, I am satisfied that it would be obvious to the skilled reader of Martin at the priority date that one method of encryption which could be used would be conversion to a higher base, although he would be likely to reject that for a cryptographic process that provided greater security such as a hashing function.  </p>

Mr Brewer accepted, in the context of Mr Ward’s cross-examination on Martens, that such a code printed on a cheque or credit instrument could be presented in binary, octal, hexadecimal, or anything else, although it would be both conventional and obvious to present it in hexadecimal. In my judgment it is the hashing function, not the presentational conversion to a higher base, which provides the cryptographic element by obscuring the underlying string of information derived from the Personalisation Data.  </p>
