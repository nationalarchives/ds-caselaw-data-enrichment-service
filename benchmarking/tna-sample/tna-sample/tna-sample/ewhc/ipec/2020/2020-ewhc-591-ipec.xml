It is further alleged that after they left they accessed a Trailfinders’ customer database to obtain further information.  Trailfinders says that the Second to Fifth Defendants were thereby in breach of implied terms in their contracts of employment and/or were in breach of equitable obligations of confidence owed to Trailfinders. </p>

Alternatively, TCL is said to have employed the other defendants and is accordingly vicariously liable for their acts.  By way of a further alternative argument, it is said that the Second to Fifth Defendants have acted as agents of TCL, making TCL liable for those acts as principal. </p>

The articles in Chapter II of the Directive set out the circumstances in which ‘trade secrets’ as defined in Chapter I may be lawfully acquired, used and disclosed and the circumstances in which they may not.  Art.6 sets out the general obligation imposed on Member States, namely to ensure the availability of civil redress against the unlawful acquisition, use and disclosure of ‘trade secrets’. </p>

The duty of good faith comes to an end upon the termination of employment and with it the end of any restraint on the use of class 2 information.

For the purposes of the present appeal it is not necessary to consider the precise limits of this implied term, but it may be noted: (a) that the extent of the duty of good faith will vary according to the nature of the contract (see <span style="font-style:italic">Vokes Ltd. v. Heather</span>, 62 R.P.C. 135); (b) that the duty of good faith will be broken if an employee makes or copies a list of the customers of the employer for use after his employment ends or deliberately memorises such a list, even though, except in special circumstances, there is no general restriction on an ex-employee canvassing or doing business with customers of his former employer: see <span style="font-style:italic">Robb v.

It is clear that the obligation not to use or disclose information may cover secret processes of manufacture such as chemical formulae (<span style="font-style:italic">Amber Size and Chemical Co. Ltd. v. Menzel </span>[1913] 2 Ch. 239), or designs or special methods of construction (<span style="font-style:italic">Reid &amp; Sigrist Ltd. v.

This distinction is clearly set out in the judgment of Cross J. in <span style="font-style:italic">Printers &amp; Finishers Ltd. v. Holloway </span>[1965] 1 W.L.R. 1; [1965] R.P.C. 239 where he had to consider whether an ex-employee should be restrained by injunction from making use of his recollection of the contents of certain written printing instructions which had been made available to him when he was working in his former employers' flock printing factory. In his judgment, delivered on 29 April 1964 (not reported on this point in [1965] 1 W.L.R. 1), he said [1965] R.P.C. 239, 253:  </p>

For example, the printing instructions were handed to Holloway to be used by him during his employment exclusively for the plaintiffs' benefit. It would have been a breach of duty on his part to divulge any of the contents to a stranger while he was employed, but many of these instructions are not really ‘trade secrets’ at all. Holloway was not, indeed, entitled to take a copy of the instructions away with him; but in so far as the instructions cannot be called ‘trade secrets’ and he carried them in his head, he is entitled to use them for his own benefit or the benefit of any future employer.’ </p>

If the information in issue falls within class 3, an implied term in the employee’s contract of employment restrains the use or disclosure of the trade secret without the employer’s consent, both during and after the period of employment.  If the information is confidential but is not within class 3, it falls within class 2.  The general duty of good faith restrains misuse of class 2 information during the period of employment, such as by disclosing it to a competitor of the employer, but that duty terminates when the employment ends. </p>

While I recognise that it would have been possible for Mr. Ellis to contact some, perhaps many, of the people concerned without using the card index, I am far from convinced that he would have been able to contact anywhere near all of those whom he did contact between February and April 1985.  Having made deliberate and unlawful use of the plaintiffs’ property, he cannot complain if he finds that the eye of the law is unable to distinguish between those whom, had he so chosen, he could have contacted lawfully and those whom he could not.

The court will not inquire at all into whether the defendants knew the name of the particular customer or contact anyway. I am not able to accept a proposition expressed in such comprehensive and rigid terms. In assessing and awarding damages here the object of the law is to award fair compensation to a plaintiff, for the wrong done to him by a defendant's misuse of his confidential information. Whether particular business obtained by a defendant was obtained as a result of misuse by him of a plaintiff's confidential information is essentially a question of fact in each case. </p>

In doing so, of course, a court will not take leave of commonsense. It will view with considerable circumspection, even scepticism, a contention by a defendant, who has chosen to use a list, that he already carried some of the information in his own head and that looking at the list for any particular name or names was quite superfluous and unnecessary. Moreover, any doubts and obscurities arising from the evidence are likely to be resolved against the defendant. So that, in practice, such a defendant will have a difficult row to hoe. But such an approach by the court is far removed from saying that in no circumstances will the court look further once user of the list is proved. That would be altogether too sweeping, and it could easily result in a plaintiff being awarded more than fair compensation for the loss suffered by him from the misuse of his confidential information. I do not understand Nourse L.J. to have said otherwise in <span style="font-style:italic">Roger Bullivant Ltd. v.

Thus, depending on the other facts of the case, a defendant who learns of a trade secret in circumstances where she reasonably does not appreciate that it is confidential, may none the less be liable to respect its confidentiality from the moment she is told, or otherwise appreciates, that it is in fact confidential. From that moment, it can be said that her conscience is affected in a way which should be recognised by equity.” </p>

I think that, consistently with the law on implied contractual terms of confidence, the balance will generally be achieved if a former employer is entitled to enforce an equitable duty of confidence to restrain the use of his confidential information by a former employer except where that information forms part of the experience and skills acquired by the former employee during the normal course of doing his or her job, held in mind at the time of leaving the employment.  The exception will not apply to any information deliberately memorised for use or disclosure after the conclusion of the employment or to any class 3 information (to use the classification taken from the law on implied terms). </p>

An important guideline is whether reliance on evidence or an argument is likely to come as a surprise to an opposing party if it is not pleaded (see the IPEC Guide, July 2019, para. 4.5(a)). </p>

Otherwise, the information on Viewtrail contained, as Mr La Gette accepted, information confidential to Trailfinders and was therefore, as a whole confidential. </p>

In crossexamination he admitted that there were no emails recording such a request from him or permission being given by any client.  He said that this was because all requests and permissions had been done by phone.  He also said that when clients told him of their booking references, which would have allowed access to their information on Viewtrail, he would have written the booking references down on an A4 sheet of names that was destroyed some time later.  Mr La Gette agreed that obtaining the agreement of his clients to access their information on Viewtrail was important to him.  It was suggested to him that it would therefore have been important to him to keep a record of the permissions given.  Mr La Gette replied that at the early times it was important but that as time went by, his new database superseded retained history on Viewtrail. </p>

He took information concerning 32 clients.  He said that he had obtained permission from 23 of them.  I accept that if he obtained permission from a client before he accessed their information on their behalf, the taking and using of that information was licensed by Trailfinders and could give rise to no liability on the part of Mr Bishop.  There was no written evidence of permission from any of the 23 clients in question.  Mr Bishop said that this was because the permission was always given in unrecorded phone calls.  But in cross-examination Mr Bishop, understandably, had only a vague recollection of what clients had said in all these phone calls and at one point he admitted that he had not had permission in the majority of cases.  I was not convinced that his conversations with former clients went further than informing them that he had left Trailfinders and raising the possibility that they might nonetheless wish to continue using Mr Bishop for booking holidays or other trips in the future.  I find on the balance of probabilities that Mr Bishop was not on any occasion given permission by a client to access information about them from Viewtrail. </p>

I do not accept the implied suggestion that his compilation of his contact book was sanctioned by Trailfinders.  Secondly, Mr Bishop said that the information taken from Superfacts was available from public sources.

To distil it to a single sentence I would say that an employee is one who is paid a wage or salary to work under some, if only slight, control of his employer in his employer’s business for his employer’s business.  The independent contractor works in and for his own business at his risk of profit or loss.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">Neither Mr La Gette nor Mr Bishop is paid a wage or salary by TCL.  They work in and for their own business.  While it true that TCL shares a risk as to the profit they make, the principal risk is that of Mr La Gette and Mr Bishop.  TCL shares no risk at all as to any loss.  I take the view that neither is employed by TCL.  This is consistent with a finding by HMRC in 2016 in connection with an investigation into eligibility for a VAT Flat Rate Scheme. </p>
