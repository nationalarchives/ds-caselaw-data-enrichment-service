The trade marks used by the parties for their respective products are not said to be similar or confusing. Instead, the Claimants allege that the Defendants used the Claimants’ trade marks in order to sell their own goods under their own distinct trade marks, and that this amounted to infringement by “bait and switch" selling. They also complain of passing off. The Defendants’ case is that they were making legitimate use of the Claimants’ marks in relation to genuine goods. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">The Claimants started to market and sell both GENIECLIP and GENIEMAT products in the UK in around 2009 or 2010 (the exact date is unclear, but not of significance). After the Second Claimant was incorporated in March 2011, Simon Jones was employed as its managing director, but it seems that Mr Downey has been the sole registered director of the Second Claimant throughout. Mr Downey gave evidence about the marketing and distribution channels used by the Claimants, which was not disputed by the Defendants. He said that GENIECLIP and GENIEMAT products have been very successful, and that the Claimants have spent significant sums advertising and promoting them in the UK since 2011, in architectural, construction, hospitality, fitness and building trade publications. As a result, according to Mr Downey, the Marks have become well-known to professionals in the construction business, such as architects, engineers and noise consultants, so that GENIECLIP and GENIEMAT products are specified by name in the building specifications of commercial building projects. Mr Downey also said that the Claimants’ goods had been tested and certified, and from 2017 the test results were available to specifiers on Pliteq’s EchoOne web platform. I do not think that any of those facts was contested by the Defendants. Currently some 380 professionals have access to EchoOne in the UK. It seems to me that the target customers for the Claimant’s products are acoustic consultants and the other professionals mentioned above. Mr Downey accepted in cross-examination that such customers would specify use of a GENIEMAT or GENIECLIP product in the light of the technical reports on the products and a contractor would not normally substitute another product, or would do so only after checking its properties with care.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">In 2011 Mr Downey asked Mr Jones to seek out potential distributors in the UK. This led to a meeting with the Defendants in late October 2011. At that stage, the First Defendant, iKoustic Ltd, was a relatively new business, which had been incorporated on 14 October 2010. Mr Ricky Parsons, the Second Defendant, was and remains its sole director and shareholder. I think that it was common ground that at that early stage in iKoustic’s business it was mainly supplying acoustic products made by third parties to small businesses or domestic customers. Mr Parsons said that he sold a combination of goods for use in a novel arrangement which he had designed to improve acoustic performance. He also said that he dealt in products from different suppliers, and that iKoustic’s business model was to provide customers with free technical advice. Although at trial the Claimants expressed doubts about Mr Parsons’ technical expertise as an acoustic engineer, which he explained was self-taught, plainly they were sufficiently impressed by him and his company in 2011 to agree that iKoustic should become one of its distributors, and it traded successfully as such distributor from 2012 until 2018.  Indeed, according to Mr Windle, now the managing director of the Second Claimant, iKoustic became a key distributor for Pliteq in the UK. Mr Parsons said that iKoustic marketed the Claimants’ products at its own cost.</p>

In some such cases at least, the customers were referred to iKoustic by the Claimants and Mr Parsons accepted that the Claimants’ advertising therefore benefited iKoustic indirectly, at least to some extent. No written terms were agreed between the parties. The Claimants relied at trial upon certain of their standard terms and conditions of sale, and I do not think that it was disputed that (in principle) those Ts &amp; Cs applied, although it was also common ground that Mr Jones had agreed to supply goods to iKoustic at a significant discount from the Claimants’ standard prices.</p>

	      <span style="color:#212121">Mr Parsons' evidence was that he felt that he was being unfairly treated by the Claimants in various ways. There were some problems with the quality of some GENIEMAT products. These seem to have been most acute in mid-2018 when some products had to be returned to the Second Claimant. A further significant problem related to the pricing of the goods supplied to iKoustic by the Second Claimant. As I have mentioned, Mr Parsons had negotiated discounts with Mr Jones from the Claimants' list prices. The Claimants suggested that Mr Parsons would have known that he was getting an exceptionally good deal, but I am not persuaded that there was any evidence that he did know it. That point arose from an unpleaded and unproved allegation that Mr Jones and Mr Parsons’ friendship had led him to give overfavourable treatment to Mr Parsons. Be that as it may, in about September 2018, the Claimants sought to require iKoustic to pay their standard list prices for new orders, doubtless so as to increase the Claimants’ profits on the goods. Although these included some discounts for larger orders, at least some of the new prices were higher than those paid previously. Mr Parsons objected to this, stating that this excluded iKoustic from bidding for key projects, despite the Claimants' attempt to persuade him that the Defendants would still be able to make a substantial profit on distributing the </span>

They were not then in stock and were not delivered until December 2018.  In the meantime, in late November 2018, iKoustic had placed at least one further order with the Second Claimant and was holding fairly substantial numbers of GENIEMAT and GENIECLIP products. </p>

Correspondence followed in which offers were made on each side, including an offer made on 1 May by the Defendants to give undertakings and to return the stock at cost price, but no agreement was reached. iKoustic therefore remained in possession of the goods and continued to sell the remaining stock. Mr Parsons accepted that had the stock gone back to the Claimants, this dispute might never have arisen, but it does not seem to me that this affects the issues I have to decide one way or another. Some of the emails disclosed by the Defendants show that an attempt was made to sell certain of the Claimants’ products in March 2019 “as an end of line” or excess stock, and then again as a small bundle of remaining stock, in November 2019. There was no evidence before me to explain why the whole of the stock was not disposed of at that time. iKoustic continued to offer Genie products for sale, and sold the last of the GENIECLIPs in November and the last of the GENIEMAT products in December 2019.</p>

All in all, I conclude that Mr Parsons was not the fundamentally dishonest witness claimed by the Claimants. However, Mr Parsons’ recollection of the dates of various events was unreliable. For instance, his evidence was that he first contacted the Claimants in September 2012 and placed the first order shortly afterwards but the documents showed that the contact was made in October 2011, and a late disclosed document showed that the first order was placed in January 2012.  I do not consider that this casts doubt on his overall veracity, especially as Mr Downey too thought that the first order had been placed in late 2012, but I conclude that Mr Parson’s recollection of matters of that kind required corroboration where such details mattered. </span>

That was compounded by the identification by the Claimants, in the Schedule, of numerous documents said to be relevant to alleged product substitution or infringement, which did not show how or why any one example was said to show infringing use. This all meant, said Mr Aikens, that Mr Parsons would be hard pressed to deal with any of these numerous new examples that might be put to him in cross-examination. I think that was indeed the case, as I have said, and I therefore feel it would be wrong to place much weight upon many of Mr Parsons’ answers to questions in cross-examination about particular transactions or chains of correspondence. It is safer to rely upon what can be seen in the documents before me. And, indeed, most of the items in the Schedule were not put to Mr Parsons.</p>

The Court restated that the use of a sign identical to another person’s trade mark in the Google referencing service did not adversely affect the advertising function of that mark, even though it might have repercussions on the use of the mark in advertising. In this connection the Court recognised that the use of such a sign as a keyword meant that the proprietor of the trade mark might have  to pay a higher price per click than the competitor if it wished to ensure that its advertisement appeared before that of the competitor.

The Marks were established brands and iKoustic was a longstanding and very successful distributor for those goods.

As I have said, no obligation of exclusivity had been imposed upon iKoustic, nor were the Defendants precluded from contacting customers who had previously bought the Claimants’ products from them to offer them iKoustic alternative products. Nevertheless, the Claimants submitted that such conduct "becomes impermissible …where it uses the Claimants' marks for the real purpose of promoting and selling the Defendants' alternative goods." They claimed that the Defendants could have sold the goods back to the Claimants, but chose to keep them “as a justification for continuing to list them on iKoustic’s website” and to bid on them as online search terms. This enabled iKoustic to attract custom which could be diverted to the MuteClip/MuteMat products. The Claimants alleged that the use of the Marks continued for months after iKoustic ceased to have “sufficient stock to meet any significant orders” at which point it was inevitable that customers seeking the Claimants’ goods would be served with the Mute products instead. Therefore, they said, any such use of the Marks was an infringement; it was bait and switch selling, and did not fall within the exhaustion defences. </p>

It is possible for a claim to succeed on that basis. However, I do not accept that in the present case there will be any initial confusion in the mind of the relevant average consumer. There will, in my view, be nothing more than an awareness that the product they are looking at is not the one it reminds them of.” </span>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.80in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:-0.01in">clear, the judge considered the doctrine of initial interest confusion in some detail in his judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Och-Ziff Management Europe Ltd v OCH Capital Ltd </span>[2010] EWHC 2599 (Ch); [2011] E.T.M.R. 1. As he there explained, initial interest confusion is an expression which derives from US trade mark law and has been used to encompass a range of situations, and the doctrine it identifies is highly controversial. For the purposes of that decision, he defined it (at [87]) as confusion on the part of the public as to the trade origin of the goods or services in relation to which the impugned sign has been used arising from use of the sign prior to purchase of those goods or services, and in particular confusion arising from use of the sign in promotional or advertising materials. He went on to hold (at [101]) that, as so defined, it was actionable under art.9(1)(b) of the Regulation. 155 In our judgment it is not helpful to seek to import the doctrine of initial interest confusion into EU trade mark law, at least so far as it applies to the use of a sign the same as or similar to a trade mark as a keyword in an internet referencing service, and it has the potential positively to mislead. We say that for the following reasons. The Court of Justice has already enunciated in clear and unambiguous terms the test that must be applied under the Directive and the Regulation in determining whether the accused sign has an adverse effect on the origin function of the trade mark. As we have seen, it did so first in <span style="font-style:italic">Google France </span>in addressing art.5(1)(a) of the Directive (and art.9(1)(a) of the Regulation) and then again in <span style="font-style:italic">BergSpechte </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Portakabin </span>in addressing both art.5(1)(a) and (b) (art.9(1)(a) and (b)). In either case it must be shown that the advertisement does not enable an average internet user, or enables that user only with difficulty, to ascertain whether the goods or services referred to therein originate from the trade mark proprietor or an undertaking economically connected to it or, on the contrary, originate from a third party. Of course, art.5(1)(a) and art.9(1)(a) also afford protection against use in this way of a sign identical to the trade mark if that use is liable adversely to affect one of the other functions of a trade mark, as the Court elaborated in its decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Interflora (CJEU)</span>. </p>

They extend from, at one end of the spectrum, initial attraction of consumers based upon some kind of association of advertised goods or services with those of the trade mark proprietor or even mere diversion, to, at the other end of the spectrum, initial confusion which gives rise to a real risk that consumers will actually buy the advertised goods or services even though they know they are not the goods or services of the trade mark proprietor. </p>

It was decided prior to the <span style="font-style:italic">Interflora</span> appeal discussed above. The infringement claim was based <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia </span>upon allegations that by buying the registered mark LUSH as a keyword for Google AdWords, the defendants had led people searching for “lush” or “<span style="color:#252525">lush </span>bath products” to be directed to the Amazon site, where they would be offered only competing goods, as no genuine LUSH goods were or had been sold by Amazon.

Further, he submitted that the reference in <span style="font-style:italic">Google France </span>to the concept of “without difficulty” embraced the notion of some inquiry being made, albeit not an inquiry of any difficulty.

I consider that the average consumer seeing the [Google] ad […] would expect to find <span style="color:#252525">Lush </span>soap available on the Amazon site and would expect to find it at a competitive price. Moreover, I consider that it is likely that if he were looking for <span style="color:#252525">Lush </span>soap and did not find it immediately on the Amazon site, then he would persevere somewhat before giving up. My reason is that the consumer is likely to think that Amazon is a reliable supplier of a very wide range of goods and he would not expect Amazon to be advertising <span style="color:#252525">Lush </span>soap for purchase if it were not in fact available for purchase. Thus, on the facts of this case, I reject Mr Carr’s argument to the effect that the average consumer would, without difficulty, ascertain that the goods referred to by the ad were not the goods of or connected with <span style="color:#252525">Lush</span>, the claimants.” </p>

The Defendants should not be found to have infringed where such an ad was not generated by current use of a Mark but only due to a time lag between the page being taken down and the site being "crawled" by the search engine. In my judgment, the difficulty for the Defendants is that despite taking down the particular webpage they had done nothing to block it from the dynamic ads service. As a result, this case is not like <span style="font-style:italic">Daimler</span>, where after determination of the contract between Daimler and the defendant, the latter had taken all reasonable steps to get third parties to take down or amend advertisements which used the mark, or like <span style="font-style:italic">mk advokaten</span>, where the advert had been reproduced without the defendant’s consent. </p>

The Defendants employed Google to produce the ads for it, and had they wished to do so they could have controlled the material to be included or excluded in adverts. The availability of negative matching in particular meant that these Defendants had the capacity to control of the use of the Marks generated by the dynamic ads services. Mr Parsons was asked about his knowledge of negative matching and said that he was aware that there were methods to do that, even if he was not aware of the mechanism for negative matching in the document shown to him at trial. Google was acting on the Defendants’ behalf. I am therefore satisfied that use of the Marks in those ads, even without positive choice of the terms, did amount to use by the Defendants.  </p>

Having regard to the essential function of a trade mark, which, in the area of electronic commerce, consists in particular in enabling internet users browsing the ads displayed in response to a search relating to a specific trade mark to distinguish the goods or services of the proprietor of that mark from those which have a different origin, that proprietor must be entitled to prohibit the display of thirdparty ads which internet users may erroneously perceive as emanating from that proprietor.” </p>

On the one hand, he confirmed that as iKoustic sold out of a particular product or decided it was unable to sell its remaining stock, the relevant pages were removed from the website. Where a search engine produced a link to a page that had been taken down, this would default to the Existing Customers Login page. One such example related to the GENIEMAT FIT08. The Amended Particulars of Claim referred to a search in February 2019 for this product (Annex A) leading to the Existing Customers Login page (like that at Annex B). At the time iKoustic thought it had none of the product in stock (a stray roll was found in a stocktake in late 2019). I consider that use of the Mark in the search result amounted to use of it by the Defendants, although the advertisement did not link to a display of the Mark on the iKoustic website. </span>

Due to his concerns that an order might be placed online which could not be fulfilled, the pages relating to such products on the website were changed to say "This product is not available to buy online." See an example of such a page at Annex B. That was the position for instance for the GENIEMAT FF10 from February 2019, pleaded as infringing at that date in the Amended Particulars of Claim. The Defendants said that the particular search results relied upon by the Claimants in relation to this product were natural search results, not prompted by the Defendants’ use of the Google ad services, (though possibly one was generated through Shopping) but in any event, it is clear that a search using the Mark with the product code could have led to links to the relevant pages of the iKoustic website which displayed the Mark.</span>

Mr Parsons said that if a customer wanted more stock than iKoustic could supply, they would be asked whether they would accept an alternative product, i.e. the MuteClip or MuteMat products, and there were examples of this happening in the documentary evidence.

However, some clips which remained in stock were eventually sold to a customer which had sufficient stock of the furring channels in December 2019, and Mr Parsons said that all references to the Marks on the website were then removed. The Claimants complained in the Amended Particulars of Claim, however, about one particular use of the GENIECLIP Mark on the website. This was seen on 30 October 2019; I do not know when the page went up. This is the use shown in Annex C of a page for GENIECLIPs, which in addition to saying that the product was not available to buy online, said that GENIECLIPs were no longer stocked and invited the customer to contact iKoustic: “</span>Click Here </p>

A customer looking at that page of the website could not have known that there was any residual stock. They might then have contacted the Defendants, or clicked through to the MuteClip page, or tried to buy GENIECLIPs elsewhere. Although Mr Parsons’ spreadsheets show some clicks being generated on searches for GENIECLIPS, I cannot tell whether anyone contacted the Defendants via this particular page when it took that form.</p>

I think it was common ground that this question was to be judged by reference to whether the average consumer would see the advertisement/use of the Mark as distinguishing the Claimants’ or someone else’s goods, and the average consumer of the Claimant’s goods was agreed to be a professional rather than a domestic customer. Mr Downey accepted that the small domestic customers served by iKoustic would be less likely to know of the Claimants’ goods by name, and would be more likely than professionals to find their way to the iKoustic website by use of generic search terms rather than use of the Marks. </p>

He said that when stock ran out of a product, the webpage for it was removed and I do not think that this was disputed. When that had happened the only use of the Marks in relation to such goods was through the failure to negative match terms in the dynamic ads service. Given the Defendants’ prompt removal of the pages from the website, it does not seem to me that the failure to use the negative matching facility shows that the Defendants' real motivation was to continue to attract custom for their goods by use of the Marks on those pages, as opposed to carelessness or a lack of full understanding of the failure to negative match those pages. I discuss this further below in relation to the section 12/Article 15 defence.</span></p>

Indeed, the first example discussed by Mr Silverleaf in opening appeared to me to relate to an inquiry in January 2019 for a third party product, Regupol. At that stage, iKoustic suggested using GENIEMAT products and sought additional supplies from the Claimants. The new products were mentioned, but not available. This does not seem to me to show switch selling of MuteMat for GENIEMAT or even an attempt to switch. In another example from January 2019, Mr Silverleaf QC asserted that the customer, Mr Jasbro, had asked for GENIEMAT.

In some cases, people were told (for example, in an email dated 11 October 2019 to a Mr Bargh) that iKoustic was no longer a distributor of the goods, without mention of the Mute product. Other customers inquiring for the Claimants’ goods were told that they were unavailable or that stocks were low. For example, Mr Windle’s witness statement listed an inquiry about the product’s decibel rating which came from a webpage advertising the GENIEMAT RST05. At that time, in April 2019,  iKoustic had 47 rolls of RST05 in stock. The customer was given the requested data but told “</span>we are running stock down on this particular product range since we launched our own range.” Information<span style="color:#212121"> was given about the MUTEMAT. When the customer did not get back to iKoustic, Mr Woodhouse emailed to say “</span>Let us know if you have any current projects that require GenieMat® RST05, as we do have a few hundred m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span> left. Once this stock has gone, we won’t be bringing any back in.” Mr Windle accepted that this amounted to no more than iKoustic trying to sell off its old stock of the Claimants’ products and promoting their new replacements.</p>

The inquiry came through the website, but it is not clear whether or not it arose from use of the Marks, or whether the customer asked for the Claimants’ goods, as the subject line of the email is just “ikoustic soundproofing.” The links given in the email supposedly to the GENIECLIP products were actually links to a MuteClip page on the iKoustic website. Mr Parsons ascribed this to teething troubles when the new products were put onto the system and various references to the Marks were taken off it. He said that no sales arose from it. It seems to me that if the recipient of that email had tried to click on a GENIECLIP link and been presented with a MuteClip page, he would have been bound to realise that it was an incorrect link to a different product. In my view it is unlikely that this was a deliberate ploy by the Defendants to sell only MuteClips, given that they quoted for two GENIECLIP products.</span>

It was not using the mark in relation to the claimant’s goods, but just to stimulate interest in its competing products. Furthermore, the fact that Amazon did not have genuine Lush goods to sell would not have been apparent to the average consumer (see [42]). Here, iKoustic did have a stock of genuine goods bearing the Marks used in most of its dynamic ads (the exception being where the ads had not kept up with changes made to the website when products were out of stock) and on its website<span style="color:#212121"> and relies on the exhaustion defence</span>.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">First, the Claimants submitted that damage to the origin function was inevitable when there was substitution of goods without the customer’s agreement or knowledge. That may be right as a proposition of law, but I am satisfied that the customers who bought Mute products in the examples discussed above were or would have been aware that they had a different origin to the Claimants’ goods. <span style="color:#212121">The Claimants’ submissions amounted to saying that offering any competing products to a potential purchaser affects the origin function, even where the consumer understands that he is buying a substitute. I do not accept that is right. It does not seem to me that the origin function is harmed when alternative products are offered to a customer who has inquired about goods by reference to a mark; at least in the absence of any obligation to sell the Claimants’ goods exclusively, this seems to me to be an everyday and unobjectionable commercial reality. Mr Silverleaf QC gave an example of </span>advertising Adidas trainers but supplying Puma trainers, which he said would be use of the mark Adidas in relation to Puma goods. However, <span style="color:#212121">it is commonplace to be offered alternatives to goods one has asked to see, or looked at on a website, and the fact that a shop or other outlet may have advertised its stock of goods by reference to a registered mark does not necessarily mean that there is any infringement in advertising, offering for sale or selling other branded goods as an alternative to the product requested. A consumer might well ask for Adidas trainers but be happy to buy trainers of another make. Such sales would not, it seems to me, affect the origin function of the Mark unless the substitute goods were supplied without the proposed substitution being drawn to the customer’s attention, which I find was not the case here. </span></p>

I am not persuaded that the Defendants’ motivation is either relevant or significant, in particular because in my view the possibility of relying upon the defence does not depend upon the question of the Defendants’ motivation for using the Marks, but only upon the objective question of fact: were the Marks being used in relation to goods previously put on the market with the consent of the proprietor? The Claimants cited no authority for the proposition that the Defendants' motivation might preclude their reliance upon the defence and there is nothing in the section/Article to suggest this. That can be contrasted in particular with the defence in section 11(2), which explicitly requires a defendant to use the mark consistently with honest practices. On the other hand, I will consider whether the Defendants’ motivation for using the Marks may be relevant to the consideration of whether the Claimants have legitimate reasons to oppose the resale of the goods bearing the Marks.</span>

	      <span style="color:#212121">factor which supports their case is that when in March a number of GenieClips were sold to a customer as an “end of line,” iKoustic kept a small number of certain clips (for instance, it sold 600 of its 648 LB2 clips). However, a number of other facts point against the Claimants’ case. It does not seem to me to be consistent with the sales of the Claimants’ goods by iKoustic throughout 2019, or with the kind of transactions discussed at paragraphs 78, 80 and 82 above, nor with the removal of pages from the website as particular goods became unavailable. The Defendants' open offer on 1 May 2019 to cease all use of the Marks if the Claimant bought back their remaining stock at cost also seems to me to suggest that their motivation was more to avoid making a loss on those goods than to exploit the Marks so as to help them launch their own Mute goods. I therefore reject the claim that the Defendants’ real motive was to use the Marks to sell Mute products. I consider that again there is one exception to that finding, in the single webpage shown at Annex C. It seems to me that the wording of that page, whilst it used the GENIECLIP Mark to identify the Claimants’ products, was designed to persuade the customer to look at the MuteClip alternatives. However, on balance, as this approach appears to be out of line with the rest of the Defendants’ behaviour, it does not affect my overall view about their motivation.</span>

The Defendants made the point that if that constituted trade mark infringement, no retailer could advertise goods under one mark but offer products from different undertakings on its website.  As the Claimants accepted at trial, the customer would not be confused in these circumstances, but it would be clear that they were being offered alternative products. Mr Downey accepted that where a product had been specified, a contractor would need to check that an alternative was acceptable, and such customers would be unlikely to switch easily from one acoustic product to another. Similarly, if a customer was offered both parties’ products after having asked for goods bearing one of the Marks, which plainly happened on some occasions, in my judgment that does not mean that the use of the marks was not made in relation to the Claimants’ goods, so as to disapply the defence. </p>

The sole question is whether the use of the mark relates to goods which have already been placed on the market by the proprietor or with his consent and would be seen by the average consumer as relating to the claimant’s goods. Otherwise, all resellers of marked goods would run the risk that at some indeterminate point the defence would become unavailable to them, simply because they had sold some but not all of their stock of the products. In my view, the rights in all of the Claimants’ goods held by iKoustic had been exhausted, and the defences apply in principle to the alleged infringements.</p>

I have discussed the evidence to that effect above. I do not consider that there is any evidence before me to show that the Marks or their reputation have been damaged by the further commercialisation of the Claimants’ goods by the Defendants. I accept that the categories of legitimate reasons to oppose the resale of the Claimants' products may not be closed, however the kinds of reasons identified in the case law mentioned above seem to me to be far from the facts of this case. The goods were not being sold through an inappropriate outlet or marketed in an inappropriate or damaging manner, liable to damage the reputation of the Marks, but by a distributor previously approved by the Claimants. There is no likelihood of damage to the Marks’ reputation. Nor was there any </span>false implication of a trade connection with the trade mark<span style="color:#212121"> or any evidence of confusion of as to origin. </span></p>

However, as I have said above, that was not the case. Moreover, Mr Parsons claimed to have been selling third party goods throughout (although the Claimants suggested that they were not directly competitive goods, despite the inquiry discussed at paragraph 78 above). </span></p>

Both Mr Jones and Mr Johnson of Pliteq were prepared to agree to Mr Parsons’ indication that he would like to sell the goods in parallel, and this in my judgment supports my view that merely selling competing goods does not amount to taking an unfair advantage in this case.  I conclude that the Defendants were not taking unfair advantage of the Marks by offering competing goods to customers inquiring about the Claimant’s goods. If they were selling genuine goods it seems to me the Defendants had due cause to use the Marks so there would be no infringement under Article 9(1)(c). I therefore reject this alternative basis for seeking to apply Article 15(2). </span>

However, there was no evidence that customers or potential customers identified the Claimants’ products by reference to their appearance or in reliance upon the photographs, and this would seem improbable where customers are professionals seeking a particular technical product.  Neither Mr Downey nor Mr Windle dealt with the alleged goodwill in the photographs in their witness statements, so there was no more than the Amended Particulars of Claim to support this claim. Furthermore, there was no evidence of use of the particular photograph copied by the Defendants; the types of images used were shown in a brochure annexed to the Amended Particulars of Claim, but I could not see that the particular photograph in issue appeared anywhere in it.  </p>

However, it seems to me extremely doubtful that goodwill was generated in that way here. A purchaser of a conservatory would be bound to be influenced by the images shown to him, given the nature of the product, but it does not seem likely to me, nor was there any evidence to suggest, that a banal photograph of the purely functional GENIEMAT would generate goodwill, as opposed to the name and/or the technical description of the product. On balance, I consider that the Claimants have not proved that this was a misrepresentation.  If I am wrong on that, I am comforted by the view that any such misrepresentation would not, realistically, have led to any damage to the Claimant’s goodwill. </p>
