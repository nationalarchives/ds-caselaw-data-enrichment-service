	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">This is by any standards a tragic case. In late 1993 Mrs Jane Manning,  who was then aged 35 and had two young children, was diagnosed at Kings College Hospital (“Kings”) with squamous cell carcinoma, (“SQC”) a rare form of tongue cancer. In January and February 1994 it was treated at the Royal Marsden Hospital (“The Marsden”) by external radiotherapy (“RT”) and brachytherapy (“BT”), the insertion of iridium wires to the tongue. On 11 September 2001 a biopsy of part of Mrs Manning’s tongue carried out by Professor Langdon at Kings was diagnosed by Dr Harrison, one of the two consultant oral pathologists at Kings, as a post-irradiation  malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Following review the same day by Dr Fisher, a renowned specialist in sarcomas at The Marsden, who considered that the tumour was more likely to be a recurrent carcinoma presenting as a spindle-cell or sarcomatoid carcinoma  than a post-irradiation sarcoma, Dr Harrison revised his diagnosis to that  of a recurrent spindle-cell or sarcomatoid carcinoma. When Mrs Manning was  seen a few weeks later in October 2001 by Mr Bridger,a surgeon in Devon where she was by then living, and two other maxillofacial consultants, it was unanimously agreed that this was one of the  worst oral cavity cancers they had ever seen. The tongue had been almost totally destroyed. It was by then in Mr Bridger’s view totally inoperable. Mrs Manning who by now was in a hospice was in agony and unable to eat or drink. In February 2002 she was still in excruciating pain and a third surgeon, Mr Rhys Evans at the Marsden, expressed the view that  the tumour was still at that late stage resectable with a reasonable chance of long term palliation and cure and that surgery would greatly improve her quality of life. Mrs Manning jumped at the chance, however remote, of a cure notwithstanding that the operation involved the complete removal of the tongue. The operation was performed on the 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2002 and succeeded in greatly alleviating her pain. It did not however succeed in curing the cancer and on 13 May 2002 Mrs Manning died in the Marsden.  Her son Henry was then eleven years old and her daughter Lucy was ten years old.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">The claims in this case were brought by Mrs Manning’s husband, Gary Manning, a dentist, suing both as the personal representative of Mrs Manning’s estate and on behalf of himself and their two children Henry and Lucy as dependents. By the time of the trial which began in October 2007 Mr Manning was himself suffering from the advanced stages of terminal cancer. Despite his illness and evident physical suffering he gave evidence at the trial and attended court throughout the trial with great dignity and courage. Sadly on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2008, Mr Manning also died. His children have good cause to take great pride in his bravery and commitment to maintaining this action at a time when his own death was imminent and his health was rapidly deteriorating.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">This case turns on the conduct of Mrs Manning’s medical care between the radiation treatment in early 1994 following the first diagnosis of SQC in late 1993 and the diagnosis of recurrent spindle-cell or sarcomatoid carcinoma in September 2001. Between those dates she was reviewed on a large number of occasions both at the Marsden and at Kings by Professor Langdon who was  based at Kings and Dr Henk, an oncologist based  at The  Marsden, who ran a joint practice from both hospitals supervising the care of cancer patients. In that period of nearly eight years seven biopsies were performed on her tongue by Professor Langdon, which were the subject of biopsy reports prepared in one instance by Professor Johnson, then the head of the Oral Pathology Department at Kings and in all the others by Dr Harrison. The principal purpose of the biopsies was to investigate whether there had been  a recurrence of the original SQC.  They were performed on 6 May 1994, 28 July 1995, 14 September 1995, 2 December 1996, 26 February 2001, 19 June 2001 and 7 August 2001.The latter was reported by Professor Johnson, the others by Dr Harrison. All the biopsy reports were negative. In fact, as was admitted by the Defendants who are the Trust responsible for the clinical staff at Kings, the three biopsies performed in February, June and August 2001 contained evidence of Spindle Cell Carcinoma (“SPCC”), which is a well known variant of SQC and Dr Harrison was negligent in failing to diagnose it as such in the February and June 2001 reports and Professor Johnson was negligent in failing to diagnose it as such in the August 2001 report. </p>

Since it was Mr Manning’s case that the biopsy reports submitted by Dr Harrison and Professor Johnson were fundamentally flawed and conveyed a misleading and false sense of the absence of any features suspicious of malignancy, Mr Grace QC accepted in opening that it was hard not to have a certain sympathy with Professor Langdon in being guided by those reports. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the first category, the admitted negligent misreporting of the three biopsies in February, June and August 2001, any  claim for substantial damages was faced with the insuperable obstacle of the decision of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Gregg v Scott</span> [2005] Lloyd’s Law Reports HL 130. In that case the House of Lords held that it is not possible in a clinical negligence case to recover damages for a percentage reduction in the prospects of survival caused by the defendant’s negligence if those prospects had never been more than 50%. The reason in short is that in such circumstances the claimant cannot discharge the burden of proving that on the balance of probabilities the losses consequent on the death of the victim of the negligence were caused by the negligence and would not have occurred but for that negligence. As a result it dismissed an appeal against a dismissal by the Court of Appeal of an appeal against the dismissal by the trial judge of a claim for damages by reason of the reduction from 42% to 25% in the chances of the Claimant’s survival caused by a nine month delay in diagnosing cancer due to the defendant doctor’s negligent misdiagnosis. In this case it was accepted by Mr Manning that if his wife’s SPCC had been properly diagnosed in February 2001,as the defendants accepted it should have been, instead of September 2001 her chances of survival would have been less than 50%. Mr. Brown, the expert surgeon who gave evidence for Mr Manning, put the chances at around 35%.It was thus accepted by Mr Grace QC that the case  falls squarely within the ratio of <span style="font-style:italic">Greg v Scott</span> with the result that the damages recoverable as a result of the admitted negligence in 2001 are confined principally to damages for pain and suffering. As appears below that pain and suffering, both physical and mental, was quite appalling and Mrs Manning was, as the Defendants accept, entitled to be compensated for it. But such is the law in this area that the scale of those damages is but a fraction of what she (or technically Mr Manning on behalf of her estate and her dependents) would be able to recover if it could be proved that but for a delay in diagnosis caused by a negligent biopsy report she would on the balance of probabilities have survived. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">It was for that reason that in order to recover substantial damages it would be necessary for Mr Manning to make good the second category of allegations in relation to the 1995 and/or 1996 biopsy reports and prove on the balance of probabilities both that Dr Harrison was negligent in his reporting of the biopsies and that but for his negligence the cancer which was diagnosed in 2001 would have been diagnosed in 1995 or 1996 and successfully removed by surgery with the result that Mrs Manning would have survived. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">When the trial opened the Defendants’ position in relation to the September 1995 and December 1996 biopsy reports was that even if (a)  Mrs Manning did have cancer in September 1995 and/or December 1996 and (b) that cancer would have been revealed at the time but for Dr Harrison’s alleged negligence(both of which hypotheses were vehemently denied) the salvage surgery which the parties agreed she would in such circumstances have undergone would not, on the balance of probabilities, have led to her survival. This position was maintained right up until a very late stage of the trial, at which point it was finally conceded by Ms Mishcon, who appeared on behalf of the Defendants, that on the balance of probabilities Mrs Manning would have survived if she had undergone salvage surgery in September 1995 or December 1996 ,always assuming, which was still vehemently denied, that cancer was present on either or both of those dates. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">As a result by the end of the trial the central dispute between the parties on liability concentrated on the second set of allegations and in particular on two main issues : (1) Was there a breach of duty of care on the part of Dr Harrison in relation to the 1995 and/or 1996 biopsies and (2) if there had been no breach of duty of care would Mrs Manning have survived? In the light of the Defendants’ concession referred to in the previous paragraph, this second question of causation turned on two subsidiary questions (i) Would a proper exercise of care by Dr Harrison in September 1995 and/or December 1996 have led to a further biopsy and (ii) if so would such a biopsy have disclosed cancer? In short was the cancer which it is admitted was visible in the 2001 biopsies already present, albeit undetected by Dr Harrison, in 1995 and/or 1996?  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">Both these issues were hotly contested and an enormous volume of evidence and submissions was devoted to them on both sides. The first issue involved an examination and assessment of the relevant standards applicable to the preparation of biopsy histopathology reports in 1995 and 1996 and whether Dr Harrison did or not fall short of them. This in turn involved both general questions as to the minimum standards which would have been met by a reasonably competent oral pathologist in those years and immensely detailed discussion as to the contents of the slides taken from the biopsies both at the time and subsequently for the purposes of this trial. That discussion was complemented by expert evidence from three consultant pathologists, two for the Claimant and one for the Defendants, which included their assessment  of photographs prepared by two of them of particular fields within not only the September 1995 and December 1996 biopsies but also by way of comparison  the 2001 and 2002 biopsies. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">On the second issue, which was a causation issue, the answer to the first question, namely would a proper exercise of care by Dr Harrison in September 1995 and/or December 1996 have led to a further biopsy is integrally bound up with the detail of the respects in which, if any, Dr Harrison was negligent as will become apparent from a review of the evidence and submissions on the issue of negligence. The answer to the second question was approached by both parties from two distinct vantage points. First there was again an enormous volume of evidence and submissions as to what, with the benefit of hindsight (a tool which of necessity could not be deployed in answering the question of whether Dr Harrison was negligent) can be deduced from an examination of the biopsies, the slides and the photographs. Second there was a theoretical analysis as a matter of oncology and clinical observation of Mrs Manning’s symptoms over an eight year period of the inherent probabilities or improbabilities of cancer having been present in September 1995 and/or 1996. On this front a fundamental difference between the parties and their experts lay in their answer to the question whether the admitted tumour which was present and visible in all four of the 2001 biopsies was a new radiogenic primary cancer, as contended by the Defendants, or a recurrence or persistence (albeit this time in the form of SPCC) of the original SQC which had been treated by radiation in 1994,as contended by Mr Manning. The significance of this debate lay in the fact that if the Defendants are right and there was no cancer present in 1995 and/or 1996 it appeared to be common ground that the 2001 SPCC must have been a new primary. Conversely and arguing backwards from 2001 if the 2001 cancer was a new radiogenic primary that argues strongly against there having been cancer present in 1995 and/or 1996.If on the other hand the 2001 SPCC was not a new primary but rather a recurrence or persistence of the original 1993 cancer that would support  the conclusion that the  2001 cancer was a recurrence or persistence of the original 1993 SQC which was present but undetected by Dr Harrison  in December 1996 and/or September 1995.</p>

In addition to Dr Harrison and Professor Johnson who  gave factual evidence about their involvement in the biopsy reports there were three pathology experts, one for  the Defendants  and two for Mr Manning, who gave expert  evidence on  both main liability issues namely (i) what should a reasonably competent pathologist in the position of Dr Harrison have done in September 1995 and December 2006 and (ii) on the balance of probabilities was there  cancer present on either or both those occasions? On the latter issue there was a remarkable degree of divergence between the experts for the two sides. The experts for Mr Manning, Professor Sloan and Dr Woolgar, were adamant, notwithstanding prolonged and hostile cross examination that it was very likely that there was cancer present on both occasions.</p>

To this stark division of expert opinion there was added a barely less strongly held opposition of views formed by the two oral surgery experts called by the parties, Mr Brown for Mr Manning and Mr Watt Smith for the Defendants and the two oncology experts, Dr Plowman for Mr Manning and Dr Barley for the Defendants. Although the surgeons were called principally to deal with the issue of whether Mrs Manning had a greater than 50% chance of surviving salvage surgery in 1995 and/or 1996 if it had been undertaken(the issue on which as mentioned above the Defendants conceded near the end of the trial that she did) they also gave evidence on whether in their view there was cancer present in 1995 and/or 1996, Mr Brown being strongly of the view that there was and Mr Watt Smith strongly of the view that there was not. More importantly the oncologists were equally divided, Dr Plowman being strongly of the view that there was and Dr Barley strongly of the view that there was not. </p>

In 1993 Mrs Manning developed an ulcer on the left side of her tongue which did not heal for some six months. She was seen Mr Brian O’Riordan, a consultant maxillofacial surgeon who performed a biopsy which revealed, according to the pathology report prepared by Dr Geoffrey Farrer-Brown at the Harley Street Clinic, “a moderately to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma..” The report stated: “There is focal ulceration and tumour is invading deeply into muscle. There is moderate chronic inflammation with occasional foreign body giant cells adjacent.”  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">SQC of the tongue is a comparatively rare form of cancer and according to Dr Woolgar it is exceptional and highly unusual for someone under the age of 40 to develop any kind of tongue cancer. Mr O’Riordan referred Mrs Manning to Professor Langdon because  of his special interest in head and neck cancer. Professor Langdon saw Mrs Manning on 9 December 1993. In evidence Professor Langdon said : “I saw Mrs Manning for the first time on 9 December 1993, when she gave a six month history of a non-healing ulcer on the left side of her tongue. She had no obvious risk factors – smoking or excessive alcohol consumption. Her medical history revealed that she was being treated at the Royal Brompton Hospital for severe sarcoid that had first manifested itself as a loss of visual acuity. She had experienced two retinal detachments as a result of this. She had also received a number of courses of steroids for her sarcoid during the preceding  three years. On examination , she had an ulcer on the left lateral border of her tongue measuring 2.5  x  1.0 centimetres. Clinically there were no enlarged lymph nodes in her neck. I arranged for Mrs Manning to have an urgent CT scan and to see Dr JM Henk as an emergency at the Royal Marsden Hospital. In 1993 all my head and neck patients were being seen in joint clinics with Dr Henk, Consultant Clinical Oncologist, at the Royal Marsden Hospital. We held regular joint clinics together either at the Royal Marsden Hospital or at King’s College Hospital.” </p>

(This is corroborated by the reference in Dr Harrison’s biopsy report dated 6 May 1994(as to which see below) under the heading clinical: “T2 squamous cell carcinoma”).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">In conjunction with Professor Langdon Dr Henk decided to treat Mrs Manning’s SQC by radiotherapy, according to Professor Langdon because of her age (she was then 35) and according to Dr Henk because their experience at the time at The Marsden and Kings was that radiotherapy (“RT”) had the same cure rate as surgery but caused less disability. The radiation treatment  took the form of external beam radiotherapy to her tongue and left side of her neck in January 1994 followed by brachytherapy (“BT”) by means of the implantation of iridium wires in her tongue in February 1994. This was carried out at the Marsden by  Dr Henk to whom she had been referred by Professor Langdon. The evidence at trial was that  subsequent experience of the adverse effects of radiation treatment, particularly the high dose involved in brachytherapy, has resulted in it being largely discontinued and replaced by surgery as the preferred treatment for SQC with the consequence that the pool of data on the effects of radiation and brachytherapy and the patterns of recurrence and subsequent clinical history is even more limited than would in any event have been the case given the comparative rareness of this particular form of cancer. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">According to Dr Henk Mrs Manning had a more severe than normal reaction to RT and continued to complain of pain in the tongue for several months afterwards. According to Professor Langdon she continued to improve until 5 May 1994  when she presented with an indurated ulcer at the site of the original cancer. On that day Mrs Manning was seen by Dr Henk. The notes record: “ Says the tongue has been a little sore for the past week. On examination there is a yellowish looking ulcer just under a centimetre in diameter right in the middle of the high dose volume. The edge all round is quite indurated and<span style="font-weight:bold"> I am suspicious that there is a recurrence here</span>.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left;margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">In his report dated 9 May 1994, the first of the pathology reports prepared by Dr Harrison on those biopsies, under the heading  “Clinical” Dr Harrison referred to the history of “ T2 SQC lateral border of tongue. Radiotherapy” and then included the expression: “? Residual unhealing ulcer-indurated margin.? Residual squamous cell carcinoma”. The latter expression was what was described in evidence as a differential diagnosis, which was explained to mean an indication given by the surgeon requesting the pathology report to the pathologist preparing it that the patient had had SQC and that one of the possibilities which the surgeon was asking the pathologist to consider, investigate and if appropriate exclude was a recurrence of the SQC. The former referred to the alternative possibility identified by Professor Langdon that the clinical symptoms were the manifestation of a residual ulcer which was not healing. It is pertinent to observe that these two possibilities and the question in each case which was right lay at the heart of all the subsequent biopsies and pathology reports which give rise to the allegations of negligence against Dr Harrison and Professor Johnson.

The reason he considered SQC to be a possibility was that the clinical features on this occasion were somewhat different to those of the previous biopsy in May 1994, in particular because the ulcer was elevated and the margins were raised up which he said can be a classical sign of a cancerous ulcer  and  the ulcer was indurated on palpation which is one of the clinical indications of cancer.- The Request recorded that the date of her next appointment was 1 August-i.e four days later. </p>

I saw her at one of the joint clinics at King’s College Hospital. I can still recall seeing the mass on the tongue, in view of its unusual appearance. I thought that it did not have the typical features of recurrent carcinoma and could be some sort of granulomatous reaction, perhaps related to her sarcoidosis.

Since her original treatment she has had a number of false alarms with exophytic ulcers arising in the site of the primary tumour. On each occasion, these have been diagnosis[sic]as non-specific ulcers(path reports 324/94.363/95,457/95).Neither Mike Henk or I have ever seen such florid, malignant-looking ulcers following iridium implants. There has been some suggestion that patients with sarcoid reactivating at the same site where they subsequently develop carcinomas. In view of the very strange appearance of these tongue lesions, I wonder if you would review the sections to see whether there is any possibility of such an association in this case. When we saw Jane yesterday, we were all very relieved to see that the latest ulcer had completely healed.”  </p>

He described it as a cauliflower-like florid, exophytic growth:  “After the radiotherapy in 1994 Jane was in severe pain.  She had lots of mucous and a distressing cough.  She could not look after the children on her own and we had to engage a nanny.  By May 1994, Jane had developed an ulcer in the same area of her tongue as the original tumour.  It was excised and biopsied but the area remained very painful. From the middle of 1994 until early 1997, Jane suffered repeated recurrences of the ulcer in the same place.  I think that on each occasion before the ulcer became obvious, she would sense that something was not right.  I remember clearly that we went to America at some time between the two biopsies in July and September 1995.  I was attending a dental course and Jane accompanied me.  I remember that at that time she had a cauliflower-like growth on her tongue in the area of the July biopsy.  It did not concern me particularly because we had been told that the biopsy was completely clear.  I thought the growth must be the result of aberrant healing of radiated tissue. When we returned to England from that dental course in America, Jane had to go back to the hospital.  There was no question about this, she could not leave her tongue as it was.  Whilst the other ulcers that developed on Jane’s tongue could be described as indurated – which I take to mean like an indentation – this one was actually a florid, exophytic growth.  The other ulcers she had were not visible if you looked casually into Jane’s mouth. This one was patently obvious.  Jane was admitted to King’s College Hospital, the growth was removed and again we were reassured that the biopsy showed nothing to worry about. Jane’s tongue was always extremely painful after it had been biopsied.  At some times the ulcers were also extremely painful; at other times they were more of a discomfort.  They were always very distressing.” </p>

Referring to Doctor Harrison’s biopsy report of 19 September 1995, he said: “Several pieces of tissue were submitted in the same container from a biopsy taken on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September. Again, on reviewing these, there is little to add. The area of ulceration is larger than before with a more extensive but feeble granulation tissue response and a widespread mixed acute chronic inflammatory infiltrate. Radiation-damaged fibroblasts are apparent as is endarteritis obliterans and the epithelium at the margins of the ulcer is somewhat atrophic. There is there no granulomatous or sarcoid reaction….I cannot comment on local irritating factors but the underlying pathogenesis would seem to involve radiation damage and reduce healing potential.

Given the subsequent clinical history I doubt if much would be gained by cutting serial sections or levels throughout the block. There is certainly no evidence of malignancy here. There is mild dysplasia of the adjacent epithelium explicable on the basis of the chronic inflammation associated with the ulcer…. There is considerable disruption of superficial striated muscle fibres and their replacement with fibrous tissue and considerable intimal thickening of mucosal blood vessels consistent with radiation change. There are no giant cell granulomata suggestive of sarcoid.” Referring to his own biopsy report dated 31 July 1995 (363/95) Professor Johnson wrote “I have little to add on reviewing the slides. There is a component of acute inflammation throughout the laminapropria, not surprising in view of the size of the ulcer and the continued acute insult. <span style="font-weight:bold">Radiation changes less marked than the previous biopsy.  </span>Once again there is no suggestion of sarcoid change.” (Emphasis added).

She had found a small (5 mm) nodule on the left side of her tongue. Clinically, this looked entirely innocent and in view of her previous negative biopsies I advised a “watch and wait” policy but when I saw her again on 2 December 1996, there was no change. She was clearly worried and I performed another excision biopsy. Again I queried whether the lesion was a recurrent lesion or a sarcoid lesion. The biopsy was an excision biopsy which means that I excised the entire nodule with a small cuff of adjacent tissue. As the nodule was only 5mm in diameter, the biopsy specimen itself was small. As there was no induration (thickening of the underlying tissues) I did not incise deeply into the underlying muscle as I did not want to risk precipitating further radiation necrosis in the tongue. I did not biopsy any other areas of her tongue because her tongue had not changed over a period of time and clinically there were no abnormalities to suggest the presence of a cancer. Unnecessary surgery in previously irradiated tissue should be avoided as there is always the risk of delayed healing. This biopsy was again reported as “no evidence of malignancy”. After this appointment her follow-up reverted back to the clinics at the Royal Marsden Hospital.” </p>

As you know we are both content that there is nothing in your tongue at the present time to cause us any concern regarding recurrence of your cancer. With regards to the pain you are experiencing this is essentially due to scarring around the nerve that supplies to the tongue and it is not uncommon for the pain to be referred to the ear. There is no magic treatment for this and if Nurofen is not entirely satisfactory there are a number of other treatments that we can try to see if it helps. I could either liaise with your medical practitioner in Devon or alternatively perhaps we should make an appointment for you to come up to one of my clinics at King’s and we can talk about possible treatments and start you off on some different tablets. In the long term I think you should let me see you once or twice a year on a formal basis.

He wrote: “ …she has remained tumour free since [the beginning of 1994] although she has developed a number of ulcers at the primary site. We have of course biopsied these whenever they have occurred, but they have all proved to be trophic ulcers following her radiation with no evidence of malignant disease. Jane came to see me at her own request on 15 January this year as she was concerned that in recent weeks the <span style="font-weight:bold">primary site</span> on her tongue had become painful once again. Apart from general soreness and burning at <span style="font-weight:bold">the site of the previous</span><span> </span><span style="font-weight:bold">treatment</span> she was also experiencing stabbing pains in her left ear. Clinically I could find nothing to be concerned about. There is certainly extensive scarring in the left side of her tongue, but <span style="font-weight:bold">there is no ulceration</span> or other evidence of tumour recurrence. Her neck is also clinically clear of disease. I took the precaution of asking my colleague Dr Henk at the Marsden who had treated her original tumour to have a look at her and to confirm that there was nothing indicating an obvious recurrence. Clearly with Jane now living in Devon it’s difficult to organise regular follow ups. Jane would however like us to help with the pain, particularly the stabbing pains in her left ear. My treatment strategy would be to start her on a low dose of Tegretol, perhaps 200mg daily in total. <span style="font-weight:bold">Sometimes the lingual nerve does get incorporated into the scar tissue and produces stabbing pain referred to the ear.</span> .. I would of course be happy to see Jane myself at any time when she wishes to come up to London but in the mean time I should be grateful if you would start her off with some medication.”  (Emphasis added).</p>

	      <span style="font-family:Arial">                            On examination of Mrs Manning’s mouth I found a small hole in the side of her tongue from which I understood Professor Langdon had been taking biopsies.  I also found a large area of induration occupying probably just under half of the left side of her tongue.  The combination of both severe and deteriorating pain with a palpable lump in the tongue, suggested to me the presence of cancer.  I would expect any head and neck specialist examining Mrs Manning to start from the assumption that the lump was cancerous and then look for other diagnoses to prove that it was not.  There was no doubt in my mind at that time that this was cancer and in view of the negative biopsies, I thought that an immediate MRI scan should be arranged. I did so because, when a cancer is actually deeply seated in the body of the tongue, it is perfectly possible that you will not obtain a positive diagnosis with superficial biopsies.  With the extent of induration present on examining Mrs Manning’s tongue and the extent of the involvement, I was in no doubt that an MRI scan would have shown an abnormality indicating the need for a much deeper biopsy. Given the background, if Mrs Manning had presented to me with an ulcer and underlying induration the first thing I would have done would have been to obtain an MRI.  There is a trap here into which you can fall.  It is that  the tissue in the base of a tongue ulcer is exposed to food and drink and saliva and so if only a superficial biopsy is obtained you might only get granulation tissue and you might not actually biopsy the true tumour which is much more deep-seated. Arrangements were also made for Mrs Manning to be seen by the multidisciplinary head and neck cancer team in Plymouth. Unfortunately Mrs Manning did not attend her next appointment…”  </span>

In view of the previous experiences we elected to watch this area which remained static. .. In January this year Jane came to see me complaining of severe pain radiating to her left ear. This had started in November 2000. Clinically the appearance of her tongue had not changed remaining scarred and indurated with the nodule first noted in 1996 still present. Both Dr Henk and myself were content that she was tumour free and we felt that her pain was due to involvement of the lingual nerve in the scar tissue. However she was clearly very worried and on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January I performed a very wide excision of the fibrous nodule. The pathology yet again was post radiation fibrosis with no evidence of recurrence. Unfortunately the biopsy site became infected and resulted in a secondary haemorrhage.

I thought that Professor Langdon’s suggestion that “Both Dr Henk and myself were content that she was tumour free and we felt that her pain was due to the involvement of the lingual nerve in the scar tissue” was absurd. I have had a special interest in cancer of the head and neck for 25 years and in all this time I have never known the development of severe pain due to the late involvement of the lingual nerve in benign scar tissue – I do not believe such a clinical picture exists. I felt Professor Langdon’s letter did not take my concerns seriously and that he would continue treating Mrs Manning in the same way that he had done in the past and ultimately Mrs Manning would suffer.

In a letter dated 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> May 2001 by Mr Heliotis a specialist registrar at King’s to the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery in Plymouth, Mr Heliotis wrote: “ …the primary reason for admission under Professor Langdon’s care this time was primarily to carry out some special investigations of the head and neck as she was getting pain from the ventral surface of the tongue radiating to the left ear hence <span style="font-weight:bold">causing some concern that there may still be tumour which for some bizarre reason we cannot diagnose histopathologically</span>. In addition she needed her pain placed under control. This has been done by the pain team and you should get a copy of the medication we have discharged her on from the discharge letter. Unfortunately the MRI imaging of the neck and the PET scanning were not as helpful as we would have wished for. I personally spoke to Dr Kane, Consultant Radiologist who did the MRI and without the previous clinical history and the background to this patient by simply looking at the MRI scans she would have thought that the lesion in the tongue was indeed a tumour. However knowing that this was recently excised in February and also knowing that the area has received a considerable amount of radiotherapy and refuses to heal, this could also be a low grade inflammatory process as a result of the necrotic material around the tongue which is not healing and therefore causing the oedema which has picked up on the MRI. Also on the MRI scans there was no lymphadenopathy on the left side of her neck. There were two lymph nodes on the contra lateral side at round about the level 4 site. This could of course be as a result of the sarcoidosis. The PET scanning was after discussion with Dr Buxton a disappointment. As a result of the previous sarcoid the PET scan showed a massive uptake of isotope which is very diffused and Dr Buxton ruled this out as any chance of metastasis He was concerned about some mediastinal lymph node uptake which he could not be certain as to what the cause of that is, but again sarcoid could not be excluded. I discussed the results with Professor Langdon and following a very long discussion we decided that as the histopathology revealed no evidence of cancer and the MRI and PET scans were far from helpful, this lady would best be suitable in your hands for hyperbaric therapy. As I discussed with you on the phone and with Professor Langdon it would be suitable probably for several doses of hyperbaric oxygen therapy after which she could come back to us and if the necrotic area is well demarcated we could excise this and then she could undergo further treatment with hyperbaric oxygen. Speaking to her today on 1 May as she was not quite happy leaving because the pain is still not under control…I had spoken to Dr Mitchell her physician at the Brompton. I discussed the treatment option of hyper baric therapy and what complications it may have for her sarcoidosis but he quite adamantly said that there is no previous evidence that it can exacerbate the condition and in his opinion we should certainly go ahead with this treatment.”   (Emphasis added).</p>

In view of these factors it is unlikely that the demonstrated oedema represents tumour and could represent ongoing inflammation related to radiation necrosis.” According to Dr Lewis-Jones, the Claimant’s expert consultant radiologist, the tumour as he described it shown on the MRI scan measured approximately 2.0 x 2.8 cms in diameter. The subsequent scan on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> January 2002 showed the tumour to have increased in size to measure 6.5 x 5.0 cms in diameter.

We reviewed all the scans. Dr Kane’s initial view was that the MRI scan showed tumour but when I explained the clinical background it was decided that as there were no enlarged lymph nodes on the left side of the neck, the changes were compatible with the post-radiation changes and recent biopsies. That is, the changes resulted from inflammation and scarring rather than tumour recurrence. I also recall going to personally speak to Dr Buxton-Thomas to review all the scans. She felt that the previous extensive sarcoid accounted for the pulmonary changes on the PET scan and that the changes noted did not represent pulmonary metastases. She was convinced that the uptake was due to sarcoid. PET scan is not specific for malignancies. Many inflammatory lesions can be responsible for the increased uptake of the radioactive marker. In conjunction with the other findings it was thought that the uptake was due to infection and inflammation in the tongue and sarcoid deposits in the chest. </p>

I had worked with Dr Henk since 1977 and would often telephone him at home to discuss patients. I cannot recall the exact dates of the discussions, nor would I have made any notes. The discussions were based on the fact that as 2001 progressed the necrotic ulcer was getting bigger and my gut feeling was that it was a cancer. I asked Dr Henk during one discussion whether it was possible that the iridium wire transplant treatment could have caused that much change in the blood vessels to lead to the spreading of ischaemic necrosis. We also discussed future treatment options. During April 2001 I had heard from Dr Bryson who agreed that a course of hyperbaric oxygen treatment might be helpful and Mrs Manning underwent the treatment from 9 May 2001 to 11 June 2001. The referral for hyperbaric oxygen therapy was on the basis that all the evidence suggested that we were dealing with a necrotic non-healing ulcer resulting from severe post-radiation changes. Multiple biopsies had not only excluded the presence of malignancy, but had been reported as showing post-radiation changes. It was hoped that by increasing oxygenation of the tissues healing would be promoted.”  </p>

I have arranged for her to have a course of hyperbaric oxygen therapy down at Derriford Hospital under the care of Philip Bryson. He gave her a preliminary course of 30 dives and then by agreement she came up to King’s to see me initially with a view that I would resect all the necrotic tissue on the lateral surface of her tongue. She was admitted last week and I was shocked to see that despite her hyperbaric oxygen treatment the necrosis had extended not only across to the midline of the tongue but deeply in the floor of her mouth. Under general anaesthetic I did a thorough EUA and undertook multiple geographical biopsies. The EUA showed an entirely soft neck with no lymphadenopathy whatsoever. Intra orally she now has a necrotic area on the left side of the tongue, this ulcer is undermined and it extends to the midline. The induration extends across the midline towards the right lateral margin. The necrotic ulcer also involves the floor of the mouth on the left and extends down to the maler hyoid muscle. All the geographical biopsies were once again negative and reported as showing radiation ulceration without evidence of neoplasia or sarcoid. When she was in hospital last week we noted that her ESR was 130 and undertook further additional investigations…. clearly she has some chronic inflammatory condition and I asked for a rheumatology opinion to see if perhaps she had an auto immune condition such as a vasculitis to account for the necrotic tissue. They felt that this was unlikely. Jane has now returned to Derriford for completion of her hyperbaric oxygen treatment with another 20 dives. I really am at a complete loss to know what to do with her. She has severe unremitting pain, for which she takes…<span style="font-weight:bold">Can you think of any explanation for what it going on? </span>I am sure if you felt it would be helpful Jane would come up to London and see you once again.” (Emphasis added).</p>

On the same day Professor Johnson circulated amongst an international group of oral pathologists particulars of Mrs Manning’s condition anonymously to try and obtain further expert opinion on the best treatment for Mrs Manning. His email stated: “ John Langdon has asked my advice on a patient of his- a young woman (born 1958) who had a squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue diagnosed in 1993 and treated by iridium implants and external beam to the upper neck. There has been no recurrence but the tongue has been almost continuously ulcerated since, and several biopsies performed. These all show non-specific features: no sign of neoplasm; there is endarteritis obliterans, radiation damage to fibroblasts and minimal wound healing. The angiogenesis is minimal and the inflammatory response beneath the ulcer non-specific. No vasculitis as such. No giant cells. A course of hyperbaric oxygen has not helped. Are either of you aware of any experimental treatments to promote wound healing (of soft connective tissues) by any cocktail of growth factors/cytokines? Do you know who I might approach to enquire further? There is the theoretical risk of activating latent neoplastic epithelium, but as she is a decade on I guess that is minimal. Needless to say her condition is very distressing and she is the wife of a dentist! Any thoughts would be welcome”. </p>

The aim was to attempt to stimulate cells for healing. Professor Johnson provided this information to Professor Langdon who on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2001 sought approval for use of  Growth Factors in a letter to Dr Costello the Chairman of the King’s Drug and Therapeutics Committee. In the letter he referred to the BT and RT: “ Jane showed a good response to this treatment and the primary tumour resolved. However intermittently over the ensuing years Jane has represented with an indolent area of ulceration on the left lateral border of the tongue <span style="font-weight:bold">at the site of the primary tumour</span>. <span style="font-weight:bold">Inevitably my first thought has always been that of tumour recurrence</span> and she has undergone repeated biopsies over the years, all of which have been reported as radiation fibrosis, non-specific ulceration with no evidence of neoplasia. In March this year she presented with a florid exophytic ulcer <span style="font-weight:bold">again at the site of the primary carcinoma.</span> Further biopsy again showed radiation fibrosis with no evidence of tumour. Notwithstanding this on the basis of the clinical appearance I admitted her to hospital for wide local excision of this ulcer. The definitive pathology report confirmed the incisional biopsy- radiation fibrosis with no evidence of neoplasia. Following this local excision Jane has developed a very nasty deep ulcer undermining the tongue, crossing the midline and extending down into the floor of the mouth. <span style="font-weight:bold">This ulcer is now 3cm x 2cm. </span>Following intensive discussions with colleagues at the Brompton and at the Marsden we tried Jane first on high-dose systemic steroids with no effect and then we treated her with a concentrated course of  hyperbaric oxygen 2 dives a day at 2.1 atmospheres. Again this manoeuvre was totally without benefit and indeed biopsy half way through the hyperbaric oxygen showed no evidence of neoangiogenesis! As you can imagine Jane has become very depressed and run-down. She has lost considerable weight and is now frankly cachectic. She has considerable pain and has had a period in a hospice in an attempt to obtain adequate pain control.” Professor Langdon then referred to the exchange about Regranex with Professor Ferguson: “ Following our helpful conversation yesterday I have since spoken to Brendan O’Sullivan and he is obtaining supplies for me to use on Jane as a named patient next week”.

In a letter dated 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2001 to Dr Eggleton, Mrs Manning’s new GP in Tavistock, he wrote: “ … to cut a long story short, Mrs Manning has been up to our clinic this morning and I examined her myself as did my two maxillofacial consultant colleagues. There was unanimous agreement that this was one of the worse oral cavity cancers we have ever seen. The tongue is almost totally destroyed and the tumour is involving the medial surface of the mandible and the tongue base as far as the epiglottis, along with the lateral wall of the pharynx. Although in theory surgery can almost always be carried out, there is little place for palliative surgery in this sort of thing and the morbidity of a total glossectomy, partial mandibulectomy etc, along with the negligible chance of a cure, make surgery not a realistic option for her. Mrs Manning did not want to hear the full implications of major surgery of this type, but they certainly would include worse speech than she has at present, chronic laryngeal aspiration almost certainly requiring tracheostomy and possibly even a laryngectomy along with percutaneous tube feeding. This might be worth it as a desperate measure if there was a chance of cure, but our unanimous feeling was that a cure was unlikely and therefore this sort of morbidity was unacceptable. Mrs Manning is fully informed about  this and she has been reassured that all the resources of palliative care to control symptoms and maintain the best possible quality of life will be made available to her. As it happens this news did not come as a complete surprise to her and she and her husband accepted it very stoically.” </p>

The drawing I made in my notes, when I first examined Mrs Manning in April, would suggest that approximately just under half of her tongue was involved.  By the time she came back to me her entire tongue was infiltrated by cancer.  In my view the tongue went from serious but operable in April to totally inoperable in October.  In my mind’s eye I can actually picture it and remember how it looked.  It was terrible. When I examined Mrs Manning in April she was in severe pain, she was lisping and had difficulty eating and drinking and was generally down.  By October her tongue was almost totally destroyed and the tumour involved the medial surface of the mandible and the base of her tongue as far as the epiglottis, along with the lateral wall of the pharynx. In my opinion, by October she had no useful tongue at all. She could not talk properly, she could not eat or drink and she was in as much pain as anybody ever could be from this type of thing.  She was in a terrible state, really bad.  Her oral cancer was, and remains, one of the worst I have ever seen.”  </p>

There is evidence of extensive alteration and deformity on its left side with the normal tongue contour being replaced by a nodular mass. The sagittal images show that the tumour has virtually replaced all normal tongue tissue. On the left side the base of the tongue is sufficiently involved that the tumour has extended posteriorly into the area of the lateral pharyngeal wall. It has extended superiorly from this level and has gained access to the anatomical site of the pterygo-mandibular raphe. The soft tissues therefore of the pterygoid muscles and the adjacent para-pharyngeal space show evidence of early infiltration. There is still no pathological lymphadenopathy. The coronal images show inferior extension of tumour through the muscles of the floor of the mouth with a right digastric muscle still just being visible and the left digastric muscle showing evidence of invasion. The appearances are those of an extensive T4 tumour with invasion of the subcutaneous fat layers in relation to the chin and posterior extension through the tongue base into the lower part of the infra-temporal fossa. These are all features associated with the poor prognosis and with a low likelihood of total surgical resection.”   </p>

She has also developed chronic aspiration with episodes of pneumonia and a lung abscess. Her speech is virtually impossible and she has been fed through a gastrostomy. She has lost a great deal of weight and is in excruciating pain requiring a high dose of analgesia. Her airway at the moment is not affected unduly. Fortunately she has had no cervical lymphadenopathy. The recent scans have shown involvement of the whole of the tongue mainly on the left side encroaching on the left wall of the oropharynx and the floor of the mouth. It also abuts against the mandible on the left side and extends anterioally to the mandibular arch. Inferiorly there is tumour around the hyoid bone and it appears to be extending just into the pre-epiglottic space. She was admitted for pharyngoscopy, laryngoscopy and assessment of the tumour. The tumour appears to have grown from the original site on the left side involving the whole of the tongue and left floor of mouth. … There is no obvious cervical lymphadenopathy although tumour is palpable in the left sub-mandibular triangle and it is difficult to determine whether this is direct spread or level 1 involvement. This unfortunate lady has a very poor quality of life because of excruciating pain, inability to eat and virtually no speech. In my opinion the tumour is still at this late stage resectable with a reasonable chance of long-term palliation and indeed cure. It would also greatly improve her quality of life. Surgery would involve total glossectomy and resection of at least the mandibular ramus. … she will need a covering temporary tracheostomy but I hope we will be able to restore reasonable function safely without the need for total laryngectomy. Mr Adam Searle and I will be discussing these options with Jane and her husband but they have indicated that they would like to proceed with surgery as soon as possible.”  In manuscript apparently in Mr Rhys-Evans’ handwriting there is then written “P.S. histology has confirmed spindle-cell carcinoma query radiation induced.”   The letter was copied to Professor Langdon.  </span></p>

The letter included the following: “…at the end of February 2001 she presented yet again, this time with a firm non-ulcerated nodule <span style="font-weight:bold">again at the site of the original primary carcinoma. </span>Biopsy of this lesion in February last year was again reported as post-radiation fibrosis. Following this biopsy once again the area did not heal and of course my suspicions were yet again aroused and in June 2001 I performed 3 geographical biopsies again all reported as radiation ulceration with no evidence of neoplasia. The ulcer became indolent and necrotic with no evidence of healing and again I repeated the biopsy in early August 2001 with again the diagnosis of radiation ulcer. Following discussion with Mike Henk we felt that this was probably chronic ulceration due to post-radiation ischaemia and I referred Jane to Philip Bryson at Plymouth for hyperbaric oxygen. Despite 60 dives the ulcer showed no evidence of healing or neovascularisation…. among others Dr Fisher at the Marsden reviewed the tissue [biopsied by Professor Langdon on 11 September 2001] and indeed the previous biopsies taken throughout 2001 and using monoclonal antibody markers he found that there was positive staining for one cytokeratin (CAM 5.2). On the basis of this he considered that the tumour was more likely to be a recurrent carcinoma rather than post-irradiation sarcoma. The final diagnosis was sarcomatoid carcinoma.” <span style="font-family:Arial">At this stage quite understandably Jane and her husband Gary had lost confidence in our management and as the family home was in Devon she transferred to Derriford Hospital under the care of Mike Bridger, Consultant ENT Surgeon. Prior to transferring her to Derriford I had spent considerable time counselling her. Thorough investigation failed to show any evidence of neck or pulmonary metastases despite a suspicious lesion in her lung fields for which she  underwent a bronchoscopy and needle biopsy here at King’s. I suggested to her that a total glossectomy with laryngeal suspension could be considered as a salvage procedure which would certainly make her pain free. However following a review of the multi-disciplinary meeting at Derriford there was unanimous agreement that this would be little more than palliative surgery with minimal chance of cure. The decision was made at that stage to refer her to Dr Mary Nugent of St Luke’s Hospital for Palliative Care.”  (Emphasis added).  </span></p>

	      <span style="font-family:Arial"> February. At surgery macroscopic clearance was achieved under frozen section, however the right upper internal alveolar margin was very close. There was also a suspicious node noted at the left skull base  which histologically was involved with poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Her histopathology results have demonstrated tumour present at several margins from the main specimen, however frozen sections were taken from all macroscopically suspicious areas and these were demonstrated to be clear. Mrs Manning has made a steady and uncomplicated post-operative recovery. It is now nearly 4 weeks since her surgery. It is possible to preserve the larynx at the level of the base of the tongue and the larynx was elevated using steel sutures attached to the mandible to aid her swallowing rehabilitation. She is currently managing with a size 4 uncuffed fenestrated Shiley tracheostomy tube. She is using a one-way speaking valve and managing good phonation and a comprehendible articulation which is improving under the care of the speech therapist. She is due for a video fluoroscopy with a view to initiating swallowing over the next few days. Her pain has improved considerably since her surgery and she is now on a careful reducing dose of opiode analgesia. The plan would be to keep her here at the Marsden probably for a further two weeks with a planned move to our rehabilitation ward early next week. It is hoped that prior to discharge we would be able to remove the tracheostomy tube and have initiated her swallowing although this is obviously dependant on the forthcoming video fluoroscopy.”   </span>

It was headed “Recurrent SCC tongue”. In the histology section there appeared the following: “ E5 to 24 and 30 to 32 tongue tumour. <span style="font-family:Arial">Sections show extensive involvement of both sides of the tongue by tumour. The tumour cells have spindle-cell morphology in areas and epithelioid morphology in other areas, all regarded as poorly differentiated carcinoma. Tumour invades into muscle, fat, salivary gland and is present with the marrow of the mandible. It is present in 18 out of the 20 slices into which the specimen was divided. There is perineurial venous and lymphatic invasion. Thrombosed vessels are seen within the tumour and there are areas of necrosis. Tumour is present at the right, left deep and posterior margins in several places. The adjacent tissue shows extensive fibrosis consistent with previous therapy. Two of the four lymph nodes identified within the specimen contain metastatic carcinoma.”  </span></p>

In his witness statement adopted by him as part of his evidence in chief Mr Manning said: “ In November 2001 we were told that Jane was likely to survive that Christmas but not the next. Jane was referred to the Royal Marsden. Contrary to what Mr Bridger said they felt that the cancer was operable. In February 2002 Jane underwent extensive surgery at the Royal Marsden. She underwent a total glossectomy and partial pharyngectomy with reconstruction. Whilst this did not save her it did reduce the pain she was in and she died relatively pain free in May 2002.” </p>

In relation to the February 2001 biopsy he said there were relatively few atypical cells in the deep aspect which were very suspicious in respect of which he was not able to allay his suspicions and which he thought were malignant. The June and August 2001 biopsies he accepted were “barn door obvious” (with the proviso that he did not like that word) and were obvious to any reasonably competent pathologist. He agreed that a malignant diagnosis should have been made in February 2001 by a reasonably competent pathologist and accepted that in relation to the June and August 2001 biopsies although the precise nature of the malignancy was not easy on the H and E slides, the fact that there was malignancy was quite straightforward and not difficult.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">Professor Speight accepted that it is rather remarkable that two senior pathologists should have made what he accepted were bad mistakes. He said it was surprising that Professor Johnson in his 2001 review of the previous biopsies missed the malignancy. It is striking that even in the September 2001 biopsy report when Dr Harrison finally diagnosed malignancy, he expressed the view that it had arisen since the June 2001 biopsy, thereby demonstrating that even with the benefit of hindsight having again reviewed the February and June 2001 biopsies, he still missed the evidence of malignancy in those biopsies. Professor Speight found that surprising and was of the view that it implies that Dr Harrison for some reason was in a false sense of security misinterpreting the features in those biopsies. He described it as an aberration which he could not explain. When it was suggested to him by Mr Grace QC that Dr Harrison was just stuck in a mindset: “This is Mrs Manning, it must be radiation ulceration again”, Professor Speight’s answer was: “ I suspect that is correct. Having seen radiation ulcers previously he was lulled into a false sense of security that this was a continuation of the previous disease.” There followed this exchange: “ Q - But based on his actions and his failings in 2001, with the things we have just been discussing, if he was one of your students you would put him to the bottom of the class would you not – in metaphorical terms? A - In metaphorical terms I would not be very pleased with him.”  In two long days of evidence in the witness box Professor Speight came across as a cautious and naturally fair-minded witness not given to over statement. While, as appears below, he did not accept Mr Grace QC’s suggestion that Dr Harrison’s mistakes in 2001 evidenced a reckless or arrogant approach on his part, it is perhaps a measure of the magnitude of the diagnostic errors made by Dr Harrison and Professor Johnson in 2001 that Professor Speight was prepared to express himself in such terms. </p>

The histopathological section of the report describes, `fibrous tissue...which varies from cellular with large nuclei and conspicuous mitosis to dense and relatively acellular'. The report concludes that `the development of the fibrous tissue to a dense and relatively acellular type indicates that the proliferative cellular part represents benign postradiation fibrosis and not sarcoma'. On reviewing the routine slide there were two distinct components. An area of radiation damaged fibrous tissue was present. The deeper aspect of the specimen showed very different features. Plump atypical spindle and kite-shaped cells were identified. Atypical mitotic figures are present and the spindle cells form distinct fascicles. There were three original immunostained sections supplied by Dr Harrison. The slide stained by Cam 5.2 (cytokeratin) shows strong staining of approximately one-third of the spindle cells. Given that the report was issued one day after receipt, it must be assumed that the cytokeratin staining was performed at a later date.  </p>

During the period between January and September the carcinoma appears to have been in a rapid growth phase. It is recognised that radiotherapy can slow down tumour growth and kill many tumour cells but in the recurrent situation a clone of cells can `evolve' with different biological features. The biopsies in 2001 show a high rate of cell division indicating rapid growth. The chances of achieving a cure by salvage surgery were significantly higher in February 2001 than in September 2001, although it is difficult to quantify with precision. Certainly Mrs Manning suffered severe pain, discomfort and anxiety between January and September 2001 which could have been relieved by surgery, had the tumour been recognised<span style="font-family:Arial">. </span>In my opinion the pathology reports issued between February and August 2001 would have misled the clinicians and contributed to the delay.

The appearances in this zone are not typical of a post-radiation reaction and in any case, it would be unusual to develop a marked reaction more than 7 years after treatment with iridium implants. Any fibroblastic proliferation would normally occur within 4 weeks of radiotherapy. The scattered abnormal fibroblasts seen later are normally associated with decreased cellularity. Abnormal cells, increased cellularity and increased mitotic figures should alert the pathologist to the possibility of a neoplasm. As a minimum, I would have expected the reporting pathologist to request immunostains and also, to discuss the case with a colleague. There is no indication in the report as to whether or not special stains were requested or if the case was discussed with a colleague. However, it should be noted that, according to the report, the specimen was received on 27 February and the report is dated 28 February.  </p>

The slide labelled Cam 5.2 (a cytokeratin) shows strong positive staining of around 40% of the atypical cells in the deeper portion of the biopsy specimen. In my opinion, this result confirms the diagnosis of spindle cell carcinoma. There is no date on any of the slides and since they are not mentioned in Dr Harrison's report of 28 February, I assume they were done when the case was reviewed at some later date.</p>

In my view, there is definite evidence of malignancy in parts I and 2 and a strong suspicion of malignancy in part 3. Conventional squamous cell carcinoma is not seen but the appearances are consistent with a spindle cell carcinoma. In part 1, the tumour bulk is undermining a largely intact surface epithelium but focally, there is microulceration and apparent merging of tumour cells with surface epithelial cells. In part 2, the surface is completely ulcerated and cytologically malignant cells are infiltrating fibrous tissue and around minor salivary glands. Part 3 is also ulcerated with the atypical spindle cells infiltrating muscle.  </p>

Furthermore in these deeper sections this lesion appears to have a quite well demarcated upper border, suggesting that this represents part of, or the superficial aspect of, a deeper lesion.

In relation to the June and August biopsies he was of the view that Dr Harrison and Professor Johnson respectively failed to recognise the presence of a malignancy and in respect of the February 2001 biopsy that Dr Harrison failed to recognise that the abnormalities were indicative of malignancy. In cross examination he said that in essence his criticism of Dr Harrison and the respects in which he fell below a proper standard in February 2001, were that he failed to take deeper sections, failed to carry out immuno stains, thought he could rely on H and E staining alone and failed to recognise on the H and E sections the stigmata of malignancy.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in"> In relation to June 2001 in cross examination Professor Speight added that there was a misinterpretation by Dr Harrison of the cytological features and “ the pattern of the lesion, in particular the pattern of  hypercellularity, in other words interlacing bands fascicles or sheets which was quite striking in June and thereafter.” He referred to big swathes of cells streaming through the biopsy in particular interlacing bands in the superficial aspect and sheets of atypical polygonal cells which were continuously overlying epithelium so that the pattern was really quite striking. Professor Speight accepted that Dr Harrison’s fundamental mistake in June 2001 was to diagnose a radiation ulcer in the face of these highly suspicious features. His assumption that the proliferating cells were due to a healing radiation ulcer was a failure of interpretation on his part. However  Professor Speight did not accept that Dr Harrison was guilty of an over confident reliance on his ability to make a diagnosis on the H and E slide alone, or that he was in some way recklessly arrogant. In his view the H and E stained section is the fundamental piece of evidence that a pathologist uses to make the diagnosis so that you can never over rely on the H and E stained sections. That is a fundamental tool for making a diagnosis. It is what pathologists use. However he did accept that Dr Harrison over relied on the H and E slide to the exclusion of other diagnostic tools that were available and that no reasonably competent pathologist could have excluded the diagnosis in June 2001 of carcinoma merely on the H and E slide alone. Professor Speight believed that Dr Harrison went through the deductive process of looking very carefully at the specimen and recording his findings but misinterpreted them in 2001.  </p>

In Professor Speight’s opinion “ after extensive and very careful examination of the 95 and 96 biopsies, I believe that his interpretation was correct.” In saying that he made it clear that he was talking not with the benefit of hindsight but referring to his own unaided interpretation of the same slides as were seen by Dr Harrison in September 1995 and December 1996.   </p>

The latter question is of course a part but only a part of the necessary element of causation which would have to be established for the claim to succeed. It is right that the breaches alleged include failing to take a further section and failing to discuss the biopsy with a colleague. However there is no evidence that if either of those steps had been taken by Dr Harrison either in September 1995 or December 1996 that would <span style="font-style:italic">ipso facto</span> have led to a diagnosis of carcinoma. In relation to taking further sections, the way it was put by Professor Sloan and Dr Woolgar was that Dr Harrison should have taken further sections because he should have realised that, in view of the suspicious features in the biopsies, either further sections would have revealed malignancy or if they did not then it would have been necessary to take further steps to seek to exclude malignancy. Similarly it was not suggested that a colleague to whom the biopsies was referred would necessarily have reached a diagnosis of malignancy. On the contrary, and this is a very important point, neither Professor Sloan nor Dr Woolgar suggested that the only proper diagnosis which a reasonably competent pathologist in the position of Dr Harrison in September 1995 or December 1996 could have made was one of malignancy. Again the suggestion was that a colleague would have expressed the view that it was not possible to exclude malignancy without taking further steps. The allegation that it was negligent to exclude malignancy on the basis of H and E slide alone applied only to the September 1995 biopsy because in December 1996 Dr Harrison did in fact carry out immuno staining. In relation to the failure to take immuno staining in September 1995, Professor Sloan and Dr Woolgar did not suggest that if Dr Harrison had performed an immuno stain that would have conclusively confirmed a diagnosis of malignancy. Rather the suggestion was that even a negative result on immuno staining would not have been sufficient to lead to a safe diagnosis of innocence because of the known existence of a significant false negative rate on immuno staining. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">Equally it was not suggested that in the absence of a positive diagnosis of malignancy Professor Langdon would or should have embarked on major salvage surgery. Indeed Professor Langdon gave convincing evidence to the effect that he would not have contemplated such a course in the absence of a positive diagnosis.  The only circumstances in which such a positive diagnosis would have been made would have been if Professor Langdon had performed a further biopsy which confirmed the presence of cancer. It follows in my judgment that the claim could not succeed unless it could be established that there was a breach or breaches of duty but for which Professor Langdon would have conducted a biopsy. Of course if that could be proved that is not the end of the story. It would still be necessary for Mr Manning to prove that if Professor Langdon had performed a further biopsy such a biopsy would have revealed malignancy. That raises the second main factual issue to which I have referred at the outset, namely whether there was or was not carcinoma present in 1995 and/or 1996,  which I address later in this judgment. </p>

There are interlacing bands of spindle cells and kite-shaped cells, most prominent towards the deep aspect of the biopsy. These cells do not have the features of radiation damaged fibroblasts and represent a spindle cell proliferation.

I agree that immunohistochemistry is not performed as a routine procedure on every biopsy. However immunohistochemistry has been part and parcel of everyday practice in histopathology for several years, certainly since 1994. The technique is used after the routinely stained section has been viewed. It is particularly useful for diagnosis of spindle cell tumours where different cancers can assume similar appearances in routinely stained sections. If technical biomedical support or reagents are not readily available in a small laboratory then the embedded tissue block can always be sent to a larger pathology department for a specialist opinion and immunohistochemical staining.  </p>

This biopsy shows much "busier" tissue than specimens 2 and 3. The surface epithelium is extensively ulcerated and the exuberant granulation tissue proliferating from the ulcer floor accounts for at least half of the thickness of the biopsy. This exuberant granulation tissue probably explains the "exophytic lesion" described in the clinical section of the pathology report. The narrow margin of muscle at the base of the biopsy is fibrosed with some degenerate muscle cells and scattered abnormal fibroblasts. The surface epithelium at the edge of the ulcer shows marked proliferation with long irregular processes and, at one side of the ulcer, the epithelial processes appear to be detached from the surface and almost blend with the granulation tissue<span style="font-weight:bold">. The granulation tissue includes interlacing bands of plump spindle cells which largely account for the "busyness" of the tissue at low magnification. The epithelial proliferation and the cellularity of the granulation tissue are worrisome and I would have cut further levels and requested immunohistochemistry for cytokeratins. I think it is important to cut further levels when there is a clinical suspicion of recurrent carcinoma since tumour may only involve part of the biopsy sample</span>. Immunohistochemistry may aid assessment of the nature and depth of the epithelial proliferation by highlighting irregular epithelial processes / islands. <span style="font-weight:bold">It has been well known for many years that biopsies of irradiated tissue can be difficult to interpret due to reactive changes related to radiation damage and in my experience, it is usual for pathologists (both general and oral) to exercise prudence and request additional sections and special stains before issuing the pathology report in cases such as this one.

The positive staining is restricted to cells around the edge of the ulcer and it could be argued that these cells represent tongues of regenerating cells dipping down into the granulation tissue rather than invasive neoplastic cells. There is no convincing staining of the plump spindle cells deeper within the granulation tissue. Even after careful consideration and examination of multiple slides, I am uncertain of the nature of the epithelial proliferation. This uncertainty arises mainly because cellular changes that occur in irradiated tissues may resemble the cellular changes of malignancy. In my opinion, an increase in cellularity and the "busy" appearances of the tissues compared to the previous biopsies is not expected given the long delay since the radiation treatment. The increase in cellularity due to reactive benign fibroblast proliferation usually occurs soon after radiotherapy and hence, I would be uneasy in explaining this late increased cellularity as an innocent reaction to radiotherapy<span style="font-weight:bold">. I would have issued a report that clearly indicated the presence of worrisome features and my uncertainty in distinguishing reactive post-radiation features from possible neoplastic features, and I would have recommended a repeat biopsy if there was ongoing clinical concern or continued suspicion of malignancy. In addition, I would have discussed the slides with experienced colleagues. In my opinion, a competent experienced pathologist (general and oral) would have taken a similar course - I would have expected them to notice and be concerned by the worrisome features; to examine multiple sections and express their concerns in the pathology report, and also, to advise a repeat biopsy if there was ongoing clinical concern. </span></p>

CK has stained the surface epithelium and high power examination shows weak positive staining of a few cells around the edge of the ulcer. The reporting pathologist, Dr Harrison, concluded that the atypical cells within the exuberant granulation tissue were fibroblasts and that there was no evidence of malignancy. I requested two immunostains - AE1-AE3 and MNF 116 which I find more reliable markers of oral epithelial cells. Both stains show positive staining for the small islands and scattered individual kite-shaped and spindle cells within the granulation tissue. The AE1-AE3 staining is strong and, in my opinion, this stain, together with the distribution of the atypical cells, confirms the presence of spindle cell carcinoma. The choice of immunostains depends on both the laboratory and the individual pathologist. Most laboratories and individual pathologists tend to try out a range of immunostains and select the ones that seem most reliable in their hands. The stains may be referred to by different names by different suppliers and laboratories and I am uncertain of the precise staining profile of CK and CK19. Nevertheless, it is likely that CK and CKI 9 were the stains that were used routinely by Dr Harrison at that time and that he considered they were reliable. Nevertheless<span style="font-weight:bold">, given the appearances in the routinely stained sections, I would have expected a competent experienced pathologist (general and oral) to continue to suspect a spindle cell carcinoma even though the immunostains were negative.

It is unfortunate that specimen 5 (642/96) was the shallowest specimen - only 2 mm thick. A larger biopsy at this stage may well have made the correct diagnosis more obvious. I would have expected an experienced pathologist (general and oral) who felt unable to make a firm diagnosis of malignancy on such a small, superficial specimen but was suspicious to request a larger / deeper biopsy as soon as possible since the risk of misdiagnosing cancer far outweighs the discomfort and potentially damaging effects of a re-biopsy procedure.</span> Furthermore, I believe that clinicians should always be led by the clinical behaviour of a lesion rather than the pathology report. If a lesion is behaving in a malignant or suspicious manner, then further repeated biopsies (larger and/or deeper than before) seem warranted……” (Emphasis added)</p>

However, Professor Sloan and Dr Woolgar felt that Dr Harrison should have raised the suspicion of spindle-cell carcinoma in the written report and also recorded the fact that the biopsy was superficial and did not contain muscle, and that the surgeon should have been alerted that a repeat biopsy should be carried out if there was ongoing clinical concern.  </p>

In his opinion, a Professor of Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Surgery should not need prompting to perform a further biopsy if clinical suspicion persisted. In Professor Speight’s opinion, it is not always necessary for a pathologist to record the need for a further biopsy in a written report. He noted from the witness statements that Dr Harrison had regular dialogue with Professor Langdon. There had also been three previous biopsies indicating that the patient was under regular review and that Professor Langdon carried out a biopsy of all suspicious lesions. Under these circumstances, Professor Speight felt it was entirely reasonable not to suggest the need for further biopsies if there were clinical concern. Indeed, to do so, may have been interpreted as patronizing to the surgeon…..”  </p>

That duty required him to exercise reasonable skill and care. In order to identify the content of that duty the starting point is to identify the requisite standard of skill and care. The classic formulation in the context of a medical practitioner is that adopted by Mc Nair J in his direction to the jury in <span style="font-style:italic">Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee </span>[1957] 1 WLR 582, 586:  “But where you get a situation which involves the use of some special skill or competence, then the test as to whether there has been negligence or not is not the test of the man on the top of a Clapham Omnibus, because he has not got this special skill. The test is the standard of the ordinary skilled man exercising and professing to have that special skill. A man need not possess the highest expert skill; it is well established law that it is sufficient if he exercises the ordinary skill of an ordinary competent man exercising that particular art”. In <span style="font-style:italic">Whitehouse v Jordan</span> [1981] 1 WLR 246 the House of Lords held that the Bolam test was applicable to medical treatment and in <span style="font-style:italic">Maynard v West Midlands Health Authority</span> [1984] 1 WLR 63 the House of Lords held that it was applicable to diagnosis. In <span style="font-style:italic">Sidaway v Governors of Bethlem Royal Hospital</span> [1985] AC 871 Lord Diplock said: “ My Lords, no convincing reason has in my view been advanced before your lordships that would justify treating the Bolam test as doing anything less than laying down a principle of English law that is comprehensive and applicable to every aspect of the duty of care owed by a doctor to his patient in the exercise of his healing functions as respects that patient.”  </p>

The true test for establishing negligence in diagnosis or treatment on the part of the doctor is whether he has been proved to be guilty of such failure as no doctor of ordinary skill would be guilty of, if acting with ordinary care."  </p>

Lord Browne-Wilkinson stated :<br/>"In my view the court is not bound to hold that a defendant doctor escapes liability for negligent treatment or diagnosis just because he leads evidence from a number of medical experts who are genuinely of the opinion that the defendants' treatment or diagnosis accorded with sound medical practice.. the court has to be satisfied that the exponents of the body of opinion relied on can demonstrate that such opinion has a logical basis. In particular in cases involving, as they often do, the weighing of risks against benefits, the judge before accepting a body of opinion as being responsible, reasonable or respectable will need to be satisfied that, in forming their views, the experts have directed their minds to the question of comparative risks and benefits and have reached a defensible conclusion on the matter." </p>

We agree. The screeners were exercising skill and judgment in determining what report they should make and in that respect the Bolam test was generally applicable. Later authorities make clear that this it is the appropriate standard to apply. However, as we will explain, the fact that two sets of competent experts genuinely hold differing opinions as to whether or not <span style="text-decoration:underline">at the relevant date</span>, which is the date of the examination, the screeners could without being negligent have diagnosed the smears as negative does not necessarily provide the solution to the dispute on liability in these cases.  </p>

In addition the Bolam test has no application where what the judge is required to do is to make findings of fact. This is so, even where those findings of fact are the subject of conflicting expert evidence. Thus in this case there were three questions which the judge had to answer : </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.87in;text-indent:-0.25in">      What was to be seen in the slides?<br/>At the relevant time could a screener exercising reasonable care fail to see what was on the slide?<br/>Could a reasonably competent screener, aware of what a screener exercising reasonable care would observe on the slide, treat the slide as negative?   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.87in;text-indent:-0.25in">      Thus, logically the starting point for the experts' reasoning was what was on the slides. Except in relation to the slide known as Palmer 2, as to which there was a striking conflict, as a result of a meeting which took place between the experts they were in substantial but by no means total agreement. In so far as they were not in agreement, the judge had the unenviable task of deciding as a matter of fact which of the experts were correct as to what the slides showed. This was a task which required expert evidence. However the evidence having been given, the judge had to make his own finding on the balance of probabilities on this issue of fact in order to proceed to the next step in answering the question of negligence or no negligence. Having come to his own conclusion as to what the slides showed, the judge had, therefore, then to answer the 2nd and 3rd questions in order to decide whether the screener was in breach of duty in giving a negative report. Whether the screener was in breach of duty would depend on the training and the amount of knowledge a screener should have had in order to properly perform his or her task at that time and how easy it was to discern what the judge had found was on the slide. These issues involved both questions of fact and questions of opinion as to the standards of care which the screeners should have exercised. As already indicated, there was virtually no evidence of the actual training provided to the primary screeners. The approach of the experts was to give their opinion, based on their respective interpretations of what was on the slide, on the general question of whether a reasonably competent screener, exercising the appropriate standard of care, could treat the slide as negative. </p>

One of the bases on which the trial judge had rejected the evidence of the pathologists called by the Defendant was that: “ …I do not consider that the evidence of Doctors Hudson and Boon stands up to the logical analysis as that phrase was used by Lord Brown-Wilkinson in <span style="font-style:italic">Bolitho</span> at page 1160 c to d. This is not to disparage the evidence of either. It is rather that in my judgment their opinions cannot stand with the “absolute confidence” test which Dr Hudson herself propounded with the agreement of the other experts. Here were admitted abnormalities which, to put it most favourably to the cytoscreener, he could not possibly have said were not pre-cancerous. Neither Dr Hudson nor Dr Boon had suggested that the cytoscreener had the ability to draw any such distinction, still less how they should apply it. It seems to me therefore that having regard for the potentially disastrous consequences of a mistaken classification a reasonably competent cytoscreener should have classified the smear as borderline even though that classification might have caused the patient short-term distress and perhaps the discomfort and embarrassment of a further smear. I cannot believe that any woman would not be prepared to put up with both if the alternative was an undiagnosed potential carcinoma.  </p>

There needed to be a balance on the part of the screeners because otherwise there would be an excessive risk of their reaching "false negative" or "false positive" conclusions. However, as the judge made clear, from the point of view of the patient, a false negative could have very adverse consequences. A false positive would have nothing like this disadvantage to the patient. This is because a false negative could have even fatal results for the patient, while as long as the checker or pathologist corrected the mistake made by the screener, a false positive annotation of the slide would have no adverse consequence to the patient. If they repeated the screener's mistake the patient could be caused anxiety, but this is a small price to pay for the protection against the adverse consequences that could result from a slide wrongly being classified as negative. We have no doubt on the evidence that the screening programme should aim by enhanced training of those who operate it to reduce so far as possible the number of false positives and false negatives. On the undisputed evidence before the judge however this cannot logically compromise the need for a primary screener to apply the absolute confidence test.  </p>

To come to such a decision it was not necessary to make a detailed analysis of the state of knowledge of the screeners in 1993. All the judge had to be satisfied of was that the reasonably competent screener should be able to recognise abnormalities which were present, and be unable to conclude with confidence that  there was an innocent explanation for their presence.” (ibid paras 50 and 51).   </p>

In cross-examination Professor Speight accepted that when a patient with a history of carcinoma is being dealt with and the surgeon asks the pathologist on the form “Query- recurrent carcinoma” the primary duty of the pathologist is to exclude carcinoma as close to 100% as he/she can: “Q In legal terms we might put it “beyond reasonable doubt”, do you understand what is meant by that? A- I do. It can never be 100%, but as close as we can get, yes I agree. Q- But 90% is not good enough because you have a 1 in 10 chance of missing it, have you not? A- That is probably right. Q- That would not be acceptable? A- No  Q- You agree?  A- I would like to be 99% if that were possible. Q- But 90% would not be enough because of the 1 in 10 chance?

Again in the context of the 1995 biopsy he was asked whether, if he had been aware that the pathologist had seen suspicious cells, he would expect the pathologist to do special staining or immunohistochemistry. His answer was: “ I would have expected the pathologist to do whatever in their judgment was necessary either to warn me about the suspicious cells or exclude them as being evidence of the cancer.”  Dr Harrison himself accepted in cross examination that when a surgeon asks a pathologist to prepare a pathology report after a biopsy the surgeon is asking the pathologist: “can you confidently exclude malignancy?” and that that is how he would see his task. In the context of a patient who has had a carcinoma where there is a concern that that there may be a further carcinoma at the same site he accepted that both the clinician and the pathologist have to have a high index of suspicion. Professor Langdon gave evidence to similar effect. If a patient with a history of carcinoma which has been treated, whether by surgery or radiotherapy, then presents with a lesion at the site of the original carcinoma he said the surgeon would need to have a high index of suspicion that it might be a recurrence. In those circumstances the surgeon would have to do all he could to exclude recurrence and he would expect the pathologist to do that as well. Implicitly if not explicitly  the question being asked of the pathologist by the surgeon is: “Can you confidently exclude carcinoma in this case?”. If he had been aware in 1995 that the pathologist had seen suspicious cells he would have expected him to do whatever in his judgment was necessary either to warn him about the suspicious cells or exclude them as being evidence of cancer. In Professor Langdon’s view if the pathologist cannot eliminate recurrent SQC it is his job to advise the surgeon that he is concerned about the diagnosis or cannot eliminate cancer.   </p>

A pathologist presented with a biopsy of a patient with a history of carcinoma and a differential diagnosis of possible carcinoma is taken to understand that the purpose of the request for a histopathology report is to seek to confirm or exclude the recurrence of the carcinoma. A negative biopsy report is liable to result in the surgeon deciding not to take any further clinical steps to investigate further or to seek to remove any carcinoma that may be present. The foreseeable consequence of a negative report in a case where in fact carcinoma is present is that the carcinoma may be allowed to remain and grow undetected with adverse and potentially fatal consequences that might have been avoided if such further steps had been taken.  </p>

This was both an exaggeration and an over-simplification. As appears below, on key aspects of a question of what was the requisite standard of care and whether there was a breach of that standard by Dr Harrison there was significant broad agreement between the three experts. By contrast on the separate and distinct factual question whether there was in fact carcinoma present in Mrs Manning in 1995 and/or 1996 and the related question whether the admitted SPCC in 2001 was a recurrence or a new primary, there was indeed a very marked difference of opinion between Dr Woolgar and Professor Sloan on the one hand and Professor Speight on the other which has contributed very greatly to the difficulty of the task I am required to perform of making a finding of fact on that crucial issue. </p>

The allegation when made came as a surprise to me because it seemed to me obvious throughout Professor Sloan’s evidence in the witness box that he was a transparently honest witness who conscientiously did his best to consider all the evidence and all the countervailing arguments. Indeed a point taken against him by Ms Mishcon when inviting me to prefer the evidence of Professor Speight as more reliable was that on two potentially important aspects Professor Sloan openly conceded  that he had changed his mind, in one case explicitly as a result of being persuaded by Professor Speight that his original view was wrong. In the event, at my invitation, Professor Sloan, at no small inconvenience to himself, given that he was between jobs, re-examined the 1996 biopsy slides, one weekend and took additional photographs of particular fields. Although the interpretation of what they showed remained in contention between the parties, it was plain that one at least of those photographs contained what Professor Sloan regarded as suspicious cells of the kind to which he had referred. Thereafter Ms Mishcon retracted the accusation of deliberate untruthfulness against Professor Sloan on her feet and repeated the retraction in her written reply submissions. </p>

This allegation was strongly denied by Professor Sloan and again I have no hesitation in rejecting it. It is true that there are similarities between sections in the two reports and Professor Sloan accepted that he thought that he had read Dr Woolgar’s report before writing his own. However he said that the language and phraseology in his report was taken from the literature and that both reports had described key features in the biopsies. Having made that point Professor Sloan said “ All I can say is that I looked at the material and I reached my conclusions independently.” I unhesitatingly accept the truthfulness of that response. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Grace QC for his part in his closing written submissions submitted that the Defendant’s expert witnesses including Professor Speight appeared at times to be acting as advocates for and arguing the Defendant’s case rather than demonstrating the impartiality required of them. While I accept that there was some force in that submission so far as Mr Watt-Smith and to a lesser extent Dr Barley were concerned, again I reject it so far as Professor Speight was concerned. Mr Grace QC made two specific criticisms of Professor Speight. The first was that his “Attempts to explain away all suspicious features by a “sectioning effect” … were altogether facile and unnecessarily favoured the Defendant’s position, since there is no reason why the random effect of sectioning should always favour the innocent explanation rather than malignancy…. The court should therefore be alive to the real prospect that Professor Speight’s evidence has at the very least been coloured by sympathy for, or a sense of loyalty towards, Dr Harrison.” (paragraph 10 (3) of the Claimants’ closing submission on liability). The second was that:      “ There is no logical distinction to be made between Professor Speight’s view that the appearances of the February 2001 biopsy (hyper-cellularity) as well as “on the deep aspect an area suspicion for a spindle-cell malignancy” … were such as to require further levels and immunostains, and the view of Professor Sloan and Dr Woolgar that the same appearances in 1996 required further action to be taken to exclude carcinoma. If such action was required in 2001 then it was also required in 1996. The only explanation for this discrepancy is Professor Speight’s desire to exculpate Dr Harrison in relation to 1996.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">Again I reject both these criticisms. In relation to the first point, there was indeed a difference of opinion between the experts as to whether particular features visible in the biopsies were evidence of malignancy or could be explained innocently by being attributed to the effect of sectioning in the preparation of the biopsy. These differences of view go to the heart of the divergent views of Professor Sloan and Dr Woolgar on the one hand and Professor Speight on the other as to whether there was malignancy in 1995 and in particular 1996 or not. However in my judgment while there is some force in the point that Professor Speight’s approach on sectioning was to an extent speculative, these are examples of genuine differences of opinion and there is no warrant for the suggestion that Professor Speight’s expressed opinions did not genuinely reflect his professional view. </p>

Just as Professor Sloan was prepared to concede that he had changed his opinion on two matters, so Professor Speight was not only ready to criticise Dr Harrison where he thought it appropriate, but in fact, as appears below, expressed opinions in relation to issues of breach of duty which were unfavourable to Dr Harrison, particularly in relation to the 1995 biopsy. In addition Professor Speight on a number of occasions volunteered possible scenarios which would be contrary to the Defendants’ case on whether there was malignancy in 1995 and/or 1996. </p>

It is also the case that each of them advanced arguments in support of their views in emphatic terms. However I am perfectly satisfied that this represented a genuine difference of opinion between two distinguished pathologists in a very difficult case. I have absolutely no doubt that each of them, while strongly believing in the correctness of their opinions, was genuinely doing his best honestly to assist the court in the difficult exercise of trying to come to the right answer, although, as I have occasion to say below, I found Professor Speight to be less open-minded on occasion than Professor Sloan.

On the contrary, as mentioned above, in relation to both biopsies neither Professor Sloan nor Dr Woolgar would themselves, without the benefit of hindsight, have felt able to make a positive diagnosis of carcinoma or SPCC. In neither biopsy was there evidence of either dysplasia of the epithelium or foci of squamous cell carcinoma. Professor Sloan accepted that, consistent with the literature, in the absence of epithelial dysplasia one would have to find squamous cell carcinoma in order to make a positive diagnosis of SPCC. These two features, epithelial dysplasia and foci of squamous-cell carcinoma, neither of which was visible in either the September 1995 or December 1996 biopsies, came to be referred to in the trial as the two smoking guns of SPCC. Professor Sloan was recalled at one stage to comment on supplemental photographs taken by Professor Speight during the trial of particular fields in the 1996 biopsy. Commenting on abnormal appearances in three of those photographs (photographs 4 to 6) Professor Sloan said that his interpretation was that it was an SPCC and his explanation was that the proliferation was a neoplastic one which, not merely as a matter of probability but definitely, could not be explicable as a reaction to ulceration since it seemed to be away from the area of ulceration. Asked why, in those circumstances, he said that in 1996  (i.e without the benefit of hindsight) it would only be merely highly suspicious and not definitely SPCC, Professor Sloan’s answer was:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">Professor Sloan went further. In his report he said of the September 1995 biopsy that: “Interlacing bands of plump spindle-cells were present in the granulation tissue. Lozenge-shaped cells with prominent nuclei were present within the bands and scattered in the loose connective tissue. The interlacing bands were highly cellular and unusual for a purely reactive feature. I would have been suspicious of recurrent carcinoma and would have requested immunocyto chemical stains for cytokeratins and mesenchymal markers together with deeper levels. I believe that an experienced oral pathologist should have been suspicious of recurrent carcinoma.” However in oral evidence he accepted that although he would have done deeper levels to look for dysplasia or foci of conventional squamous carcinoma because you need one or the other to make a definite diagnosis of SPCC, when asked what he thought those deeper levels would have shown if they had been performed, he accepted that: “We know that deeper levels were looked at because the experts have prepared some and we know that there is no evidence of dysplasia or squamous carcinoma in the sections. So Dr Harrison could not have made a diagnosis of spindle-cell carcinoma on this material because there was no dysplasia and no conventional squamous cell carcinoma….. This is something that the experts agreed on, that there was no unequivocal evidence of malignancy. Q- <span style="font-weight:bold">Therefore you could not have made the diagnosis of spindle-cell carcinoma?</span> A- No. <span style="font-weight:bold">But he should have been suspicious; he should have indicated that suspicion to Professor Langdon</span>. Q- What should he have indicated?...  A- That suspicion, the fact that there was suspicious spindle-cells and levels had been taken, cytokeratins had been taken; nothing had been found… but say that deeper levels and cytokeratins had not revealed conventional squamous cell carcinoma or dysplasia; that the biopsy was suspicious.  Q- What you are saying is that if you look with the microscope and you find the presence of these spindle-cells and the density, that makes you suspicious of spindle-cell carcinoma?  A- Yes </p>

The features suggest that this is an ulcer caused by trauma to tissue with a poor response because of the radiotherapy.

In his view in those circumstances Dr Harrison should have gone on to do immunostaining. Given that he did not do so, Professor Speight’s view was that he should have described the suspicious cells on the H and E in his report to Professor Langdon, and further, and critically, alerted Professor Langdon to the fact that he had a lingering suspicion. There was much debate in cross-examination as to what form such a communication of lingering suspicion should have taken. But in my view, given the evidence that Professor Langdon was at this time himself sure on the basis of clinical observation that Mrs Manning was suffering a recurrence of carcinoma, the precise wording that should have appeared in Dr Harrison’s report is only of secondary importance. The critical point is that Professor Speight accepted that “the essence of it is that you would consider it part of the duty of the pathologist to let the surgeon know explicitly or implicitly that you had got a lingering suspicion”. </p>

Ms Mishcon pointed out that for the purposes of this litigation four different pancytokeratin stains were applied to the 1995 biopsy specimen by Dr Woolgar and/or Professor McDonald (the expert originally instructed by Mr Manning) and there was no keratin positive staining of any suspicious cells. Therefore she submitted immunostaining would have supported Dr Harrison’s diagnosis of a chronic ulcer. Her second point was that the 1995 biopsy was observed to be healing a week after the biopsy had been taken and had completely healed when Mrs Manning was reviewed two and a half weeks later. There would therefore have been no need for a further biopsy. Thus she argued if it is found that Dr Harrison should have carried out immunostaining or added a rider to his report advising careful review, his failure to do so had no causative effect in that (I infer her argument to run), Professor Langdon would not then have carried out a further biopsy. </p>

Doctor Harrison elected not to do immunostaining. In those circumstances Professor Speight’s view was that since it was not possible safely to exclude the possibility of carcinoma on the basis of the H and E slide, any report to Professor Langdon would be misleading if it omitted to alert him to lingering doubts as to whether there was carcinoma present or not. Even if, which for reasons explained below I do not accept, it would have been possible safely to exclude the possibility of carcinoma on the basis of immunostaining had Dr Harrison carried it out, it does not follow that Dr Harrison’s breach of duty in writing a definitive report based on the H and E slide giving a definitively innocent diagnosis without alerting Professor Langdon to lingering suspicions did not lead to Professor Langdon failing to carry out a biopsy which he would have carried out had he been so alerted. In other words, given that Dr Harrison’s breach of duty consisted in writing a misleading report and failing to alert Professor Langdon to lingering doubts which a reasonably competent pathologist who had not done immunostaining  should have had, the causative effect of the breach is to be tested by reference to what would have happened if he had alerted Professor Langdon to the doubts,  not by reference to what would have happened if he had not written the report at all at that stage. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">The second answer is this. The agreed evidence was that, as was known at the time, immunostaining was subject to significant levels of false negative rates. </p>

However as well as recording that only 17 of the 26 SPCCs the subject of the paper showed keratin positivity in the spindle-cell component, in other words a 35% false negative rate, the paper contained a table of 6 studies of keratin expression in spindle-cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract including the Lewis and Olsen study. The other studies in the table were 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989 and 1993, i.e. well before Dr Harrison’s two biopsy reports. The positive rates in those studies were respectively 48%, 62%, 75%, 57% and 50% making, together with the Lewis Olsen series, an average positivity rate of 58%.

Although in the larynx the SPCC has a better clinical outcome than in the mouth, it is in his view the same tumour. The 35% false negative rate in the Lewis Olsen series was therefore in his view significant. The Lewis and Olsen paper “tells us that it is not safe to exclude the diagnosis of spindle-cell carcinoma if the immunohistochemistry for keratin is negative on the suspicious spindle-cells.” The Lewis and Olsen paper referring to positive keratin expression rates of 50% to 75% in the previous studies stated: “ Our finding of 65% is in place for these results and this rate is roughly equivalent to that reported in a recent and larger series of malignant mixed… tumours…”  It concluded that: “  The fact that not all SPCCs show detectable epithelial differentiation is not viewed as a contraindication to the diagnosis of SPCC carcinoma. Possible explanations for the lack of such features include (1) Sampling errors (2) Insufficient sensitivity of detection methods including fixation and processing variables and (3) Progressive loss of identifiable epithelial markers.” Professor Sloan agreed with those possible explanations for the false negative rates. In relation to the latter he pointed out that in SPCC  there is a conversion from a carcinoma that was tied to sarcoma at this time and as the tumour progresses the percentage of cells which express cytokeratin become less and there may be no expression at all. He further said that the sort of false negative rate of 42%  reflected in the average 58% positive figure in the table in the Lewis and Olsen paper was one which he would expect to have been known in the mid 1990s and was one which a reasonably competent pathologist should have known before the 1995 and 1996 biopsies. By 1995 he said that immunohistochemical markers were in routine practice and he would have expected a competent pathologist to have known about these figures. His conclusion was that a reasonably competent pathologist in 1995 and 1996 would have known that negative lack of staining could not safely exclude the diagnosis of SPCC.  </p>

A reasonably competent pathologist in his view should have recognised the suspicious cells and having undertaken cytokeratin staining on further levels, if they were negative (as with the benefit of hindsight and the Woolgar/McDonald immunostaining we know they would have been) should have asked for a further biopsy. In other words the purpose of performing immunostaining would have been to see if malignancy could be confirmed, but not to enable a positive diagnosis of innocence to be made.</p>

The starting point is that, as mentioned above, he accepted that any reasonably competent pathologist looking to exclude carcinoma could not safely do so unless he was sure beyond reasonable doubt that it was not there. His understanding of “beyond reasonable doubt” was: “ It can never be 100%, but as close as we can get…I would like to be 99% if that were possible.” Ninety percent would not be good enough because of the 1 in 10 chance of missing a carcinoma. Applying that conclusion to the September 1995 biopsy Professor Speight confirmed his view that because Dr Harrison did not do an immunostaining he ought to have had a 10% residual doubt and therefore ought to have alerted the surgeon to the continuing existence of that doubt. He also said that a reasonably competent pathologist with a 10% residual doubt must take whatever steps he reasonably can to try and eliminate that residual doubt. Such steps might include asking the surgeon for another biopsy, might be taking further levels, might be doing immunostaining, might be discussing the case with a colleague.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">Initially in evidence in chief Professor Speight said that having had 90% confidence that the September 1995 biopsy was explicable as a chronic ulcer on the basis of his examination of the H and E slide, after he had examined Dr Woolgar’s immunocytochemistry he was 99% sure that it was a chronic ulcer. His residual 10% doubt, on the H and E slides  was based on the atypia of the epithelium adjacent to the ulcer which could either have a sinister explanation in the form of malignant cells invading the connective tissue or an innocent explanation in the form of proliferating epithelium or alternatively be explicable innocently by the cross-cutting effect of a biopsy which can make an innocent retepeg of migrating epithelium appear to be a small isolated and therefore possibly malignant island of epithelium in the connective tissue. Professor Speight’s evidence in chief was that the immunocytochemistry performed by Professor McDonald/Dr Woolgar “confirmed to me” that there were no epithelial cells invading the connective tissue from the epithelium adjacent to the ulcer. Thus he said that although there were highly suspicious features in the September 1995 biopsy such that a pathologist should immediately have been on high alert or have had a very high index of suspicion because in a spindle-cell carcinoma one sees the atypical epithelium or carcinoma overlying the lesion and the spindle-cells tend to proliferate or invade away from that epithelium into the connective tissue, his 90% confidence that the September 1995 biopsy was innocent based on the H and E increased to 99% based on the immunostaining, however elsewhere in his evidence in chief Professor Speight accepted that if he had even one percent doubt that there was a cell on the deep aspect which might be malignant he would alert the surgeon and that any reasonably competent pathologist would have to alert the surgeon if he could not allay his suspicion and was at all uncertain as to whether there was malignancy. </p>

The inconsistency re-emerged in cross-examination when Professor Speight said at one point that the immunostaining allayed his suspicions completely. Elsewhere Professor Speight had referred to what he described as the black swan phenomenon, a metaphor he used to describe the fact that in science it is never possible with 100%  confidence to exclude any possibility. Thus although nobody has ever seen a black swan and all swans ever seen have been white, it is not possible for a scientist definitively to say with 100% certainty all swans are white, it not being possible in the absence of a comprehensive world-wide search to eliminate the theoretical possibility of a black swan. I understood the implication of Professor Speight’s reference to the black swan phenomenon to be that where the only thing that prevents a pathologist from giving a positive diagnosis is the inability to exclude the black swan, it is legitimate for a reasonably competent pathologist to make a positive diagnosis. It would appear therefore that when Professor Speight expressed the view that a reasonably competent pathologist would have to alert the surgeon if he had a 1% doubt, that by a 1% doubt he had in mind something more substantive than the inability to exclude the hypothetical black swan. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">In relation to false negative rates on immunostaining, Professor Speight was critical of the overall 58% cytokeratin positivity (i.e. 42% false negative) which appeared in the table in the Lewis and Olsen paper.  He pointed out that one of the studies quoted in the table as showing a 50% positive rate in fact in the body of the text was recorded as showing an 88% positive rate. In addition the paper did not include the results of  a paper by Leonardi which, albeit on a small sample of 8 tumours,  showed a 100% positive rate which would have made a difference to the average. Accordingly he said that the paper was flawed and he did not trust it. He did however accept that the false negative rate might be as high as 25%. Despite accepting that 25% false negative rate, Professor Speight said (in the context of the December 1996 biopsy, but the point is of equal application to the September 1995 biopsy) that the fact that the immunostaining was cytokeratin negative made the difference between 90% certainty in the H and E slides that the biopsy was innocent and “as absolute certainty as we can be” that the biopsy was innocent based on the immunostaining. Professor Speight said that it would only be if he was at least 60% suspicious that there was malignancy on the H and E slide that his suspicions would not be allayed by a negative cytokeratin on an immunostaining. He cited by was of example that if the 2001 biopsy had been negative for cytokeratin that would not have allayed his fears and would not have prevented him concluding that it was probably a carcinoma. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">It was put to Professor Speight by Mr Grace QC, rightly in my view, that there was a logical flaw in this aspect of his evidence. As Professor Sloan pointed out the reason for performing immunostaining in a case where the pathologist has a 10% residual doubt as to whether there is malignancy is to see whether that doubt can be confirmed. If the immunostaining identifies an epithelial cell in the connective tissue that confirmation would be provided. However the reverse proposition does not follow. Given a 25% false negative rate, in any individual case in which the immunostaining is negative the pathologist has no way of telling whether it is one of the 25% false negatives or one of the 75% true negatives. Where the result is negative the immunostaining therefore logically takes matters no further, bearing in mind the overriding need to exclude carcinoma,  since the pathologist in order to be safe would be bound to assume that it might be one of the 25%. </p>

Prospectively you do not know…. A- No no of course you don’t. Q- …which it is going to be?  A- No but from the cytological features one could deduce whether you expected it to be positive or negative, based on the cytomorphometry. Q- Well if that is the case then there’s not much point in ever doing immunostains?  A- That’s not correct I said “one can deduce, <span style="font-weight:bold">but one would not rely on deduction alone in that case</span>…”  (emphasis added). In that exchange Professor Speight appeared to accept the logic of the point being put to him by Mr Grace QC. The exchange continued: “ All I am suggesting Professor is that you cannot simply say: ‘This is cytokeratin negative, therefore it cannot be malignant’ because you don’t know whether it one of the 25% group or not? A- No, but if it is … Q- You cannot simply say: ‘It increases me from 90% to 97.5%’ could you?  A- Well if it is cytokeratin negative, that is very strong evidence that the cells are not epithelial, so it suggests they are not epithelial. Q- Unless it is one of the 25% false negative categories?  A- Yes, but in conjunction with all the other features, which we have seen through, it makes it very highly unlikely that the cells are epithelial because an epithelial cell in the connective tissue would be malignant and these cells did not show evidence of malignancy. Q- Well this becomes rather circular, does it not, because you are going back there to rely upon your assessment on the H and E stains?  A- Which is vitally important, absolutely. Q- Well really to the exclusion of all else in your mind?  A- Not to the exclusion of all else; in all the features taken together. Knowledge, experience, judgment, the context of the cells, their cytomorphometry, where they find themselves, their relationship to their partners, and the immunocytochemistry.”   </p>

While a cytokeratin negative might indeed be very strong evidence that the cells are not epithelial, it would be over simplistic to suggest that a 90% level of confidence could be increased to a 97.5% level of confidence by virtue of the 75% positive rate on immunostaining. Indeed Professor Speight did not appear to suggest such an approach. Moreover and in any event even if such an approach were legitimate, one would be left with a 2 ½% possibility of carcinoma. Applying the very high test to which I have referred earlier in this judgment and indeed applying Professor Speight’s own approach, a pathologist who was left with a 2 ½% doubt as to malignancy could not safely exclude the possibility of malignancy. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">Taking Professor Speight’s evidence in the round, it did not seem to me that he was expressing the view that a reasonably competent pathologist who had, as he said should have been the case, no more than a 90% level of confidence that the biopsies in  September 1995 and December 1996 were innocent, could safely have excluded the possibility of carcinoma by virtue of the negative cytokeratin on the two immunostainings done by Professor McDonald in September 1995<span style="color:#FF0000"> </span>and by Dr Harrison in  December 1996. Even if my understanding of Professor Speight’s evidence is incorrect in this respect, it does not affect my view that in such circumstances no reasonably competent pathologist could safely have excluded carcinoma in respect of either biopsy. In reaching that conclusion I am of course mindful of the so called <span style="font-style:italic">Bolam</span> test. In his summing up to the jury in that case to which I have referred earlier McNair J said: “ He is not guilty of negligence if he has acted in accordance with the practice accepted as proper by a responsible body of medical men skilled in that particular art… putting it another way round, a man is not negligent if he is acting in accordance with such a practice merely because there is a body of opinion that would take a contrary view.” The <span style="font-style:italic">Bolam</span> test was reformulated by Lord Scarman in <span style="font-style:italic">Sidaway v Governors of Bethlem Royal Hospital </span>[1985] AC 871,881 F: “ A doctor is not negligent if he acts in accordance with a practice accepted at the time as proper by a responsible body of medical opinion even though other doctors adopt a different practice.” </p>

Ms Mishcon’s argument is based on one answer given by Professor Speight where he said that in the absence of immunostaining a reasonably competent pathologist in September 1995 would have added a rider to his report stating that careful review was necessary with a further biopsy being performed if the biopsy did not heal within a reasonable time. Professor Speight expanded on that answer. He said that 14 days is the guide for waiting for a lesion to heal. If it hasn’t healed in 14 days then the surgeon has to use his judgment as to whether or not to take another biopsy. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus where the pathologist recommends a further biopsy if the lesion does not heal, he would expect the surgeon to understand the pathologist to mean if it does not heal within 14 days. Thus the risk of allowing undiagnosed cancer would continue for a maximum of 14 days which he regarded as a negligible and extremely small increased risk in terms of the impact on ultimate prognosis should there turn out in fact to be malignancy. On the chronology in this case the biopsy was performed on 14 September, the pathology report was written on 19 September, on 20 September Mrs Manning was seen by Professor Langdon and Dr Henk at the Marsden Clinic and Professor Langdon’s notes record on examination “healing- painful??” and on 17 or 18 October Mrs Manning was reviewed by Professor Langdon whose notes record: “Tongue healed!...”.  Because Mrs Manning was not seen between 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>  September and 17th or 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October we do not know how soon, if at all, before 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> or 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October her tongue healed and in particular whether it healed within 14 days. That is probably because, Dr Harrison’s actual pathology report having been negative, there was no urgent review of Mrs Manning, Professor Langdon’s notes concluding on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September that they “will keep a very close eye on her in the ensuing months.”  No doubt had a report been written in the terms contemplated by Professor Speight in the answer to which I have just referred, Mrs Manning would have been reviewed within a week or two of the biopsy report to see if the lesion had in fact healed. What such a review would have revealed we cannot know. What we do know is that after one week it was healing but had not yet healed. If the only issue bearing on a decision whether to perform a further biopsy was whether the lesion was healing and how long it was taking to heal I am inclined to believe that even if it had not completely healed within 2 weeks the fact that it was in the process of healing might have been sufficient to persuade Professor Langdon to hold back, with the result that given that it did heal no later than 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> or 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October no biopsy would have been performed.

The first is that the answer of Professor Speight relied on by Ms Mishcon was only one of the ways in which he expressed his views on this topic. Of greater importance in my view was his confirmation that the essential point which a reasonably competent pathologist would have been obliged to communicate to Professor Langdon was the existence of lingering doubts based on the H and E slides. The precise language was he accepted less important than the essential importance of the obligation to communicate the existence of lingering doubts. That is to say doubts as to whether there might be carcinoma present. There was some debate between the three pathology experts as to whether the obligation when communicating the lingering doubts was confined to referring to the existence of suspicious cells or extended to an explicit mention of the suspicion of possible carcinoma. It seemed to me that such differences of view as there were on this point were of marginal relevance. Even if all that was required was reference to the existence of suspicious cells in circumstances where the suspicion could not be allayed, the necessary implication as it seems to me of the reference to suspicious cells or suspicion would be a suspicion on the part of the pathologist that they might be malignant. In what other sense could they be suspicious and of what else could the pathologist be communicating his suspicion other than the possible presence, albeit unidentified and undetected, of malignancy of some kind? </p>

In one area adjacent to the ulcer there are two islands of squamous epithelium in the superficial corium showing some evidence of atypia and with prominent enlarged nuclei. In another area in the centre of the ulcer there are two small islands of epithelium showing cytological atypia and one large prominent abnormal mitotic figure. The features are those of widespread ulceration consistent with radiation damage. <span style="font-weight:bold">In addition there are features suspicious for recurrent squamous cell carcinoma </span>(emphasis added). … The features are consistent with ulceration associated with radiation induced damage. In addition there are scattered <span style="font-weight:bold">suspicious</span> pleomorphic cells within the tissue.” (emphasis added).  In his comment and conclusion section he wrote…these features are characteristic of radiation induced damage and thus far I agree with the interpretation of Dr Harrison in his report. In addition however there are many plump and pleomorphic cells within the connective tissue. In places these form small sheets of spindle cells. These are quite consistent with atypical fibroblasts as a consequence of radiation damage (“radiation fibroblasts”). There are also one or two small suspicious islands of epithelial cells. <span style="font-weight:bold">These are suspicious for recurrent carcinoma</span> but may be proliferative for regenerative epithelium at the margin of the ulcer.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">In this respect Professor Speight changed his position in the course of giving evidence. Early on in his evidence he said that Dr Harrison did not in his view fall below an acceptable standard of practice in not doing immunostaining in September 1995 because it was quite reasonable for him to have reached the diagnosis he did following careful examination of the H and E sections. A majority of pathologists at the time in his view would not have done immunocytochemistry in 1995. He also said that while he would have said that there is some evidence of atypia in the epithelium that was not something that a reasonably competent pathologist in his view was bound to do. It would have been good practice but failure to do it would not have indicated incompetence. Later in cross examination he repeated that although he was critical of Dr Harrison for not having done immunocytochemistry he did not think that his failure to do so indicated incompetence. He also said that although he himself could not go beyond 90% confidence of innocence on the H and E slides alone he could not say that Dr Harrison ought also to have had that level of uncertainty on the H and E slides in 1995 because he might be more confident than Professor Speight. He was known to be a very assiduous pathologist, would have spent time looking at every cell and in his mind might have been 99% sure based on his histological examination. However later in his cross examination in the passages just cited Professor Speight accepted that Dr Harrison should have written a more descriptive report recording the presence of suspicious cells and conveyed suspicion to the surgeon and that in September 1995 Dr Harrison should have taken immunostaining and that if, he failed to do so he should have alerted the surgeon to lingering doubt. That is because he accepted that based on the H and E slide there was a 10% lingering doubt in respect of the September 1995 biopsy and no reasonably competent pathologist could fail to alert the surgeon to such doubt. Professor Speight again explicitly confirmed that in September 1995 because Dr Harrison did not do an immunostaining he ought to have had a 10% residual doubt and therefore ought to have alerted the surgeon to the continuing existence of that doubt explicitly or by implication.  </p>

In its central conclusions that Dr Harrison should have described the suspicious cells in the September 1995 biopsy and alerted Professor Langdon to his lingering doubts Professor Speight was in agreement with Professor Sloan and Dr Woolgar  who reached those conclusions with less equivocation in their minds. To them it was very clear. In the case of Professor Speight, although his view that Dr Harrison should have described the suspicious cells was present in his original report, the view that he should have alerted Professor Langdon to lingering doubts as to the possible existence of malignancy was something which he came to accept as being the logical conclusion of (a) his view that it is the duty of a pathologist to alert the surgeon to lingering doubts unless he has excluded such doubts beyond reasonable doubt and (b) his belief that the nature of the suspicious cells in the H and E slides was such that it was not possible by an intellectual process of observation and analysis to get beyond a 90% level of confidence that there was no malignancy.  </p>

To be specific, would Professor Langdon have performed a further biopsy? In my view the answer to that question is clearly yes. The evidence is overwhelming that at the time he commissioned the September 1995 biopsy report Professor Langdon was sure as a matter of clinical observation that Mrs Manning had suffered a local recurrence of carcinoma. Indeed he had had little doubt that that was the case before the earlier July 1995 biopsy. The evidence of Professor Langdon’s state of mind in the period leading up to the September 1995 biopsy is set out in the narrative chronology earlier in this judgment. A clear picture emerges. Thus in his letter dated 2nd August 1995 to Dr Henk he referred to Mrs Manning having come to see him on the 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> of July as an emergency and referred to the fact that “worryingly there was 10mm exophytic ulcer on the lateral border of her tongue at the site of the original primary….. clinically I had little doubt that this represented local recurrence. …”     </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">The reference to the same site is important because of the evidence to which I refer below in more detail that recurrences of SQC normally occur at the same site as the original carcinoma. More generally Professor Langdon’s concerns that what he was seeing might be manifestations of a recurrence of the original carcinoma reflected the facts that (a) there is a high rate of recurrence of mouth cancer  and (b) statistically the largest number of recurrences of SQC occur in the first two years. As to (a) in evidence in chief Professor Langdon said : “We know that cancers occurring in the mouth have a propensity to recur.  Something like a quarter of all mouth cancers recur after treatment, and they recur in one of two ways.  It is called loco-regional recurrence.  The loco refers to local, in other words, the cancer recurs at the site where the original cancer was, and the regional bit of loco-regional applies to the head and neck region, and that is because the sort of cancer we are talking about, squamous cell carcinoma, has a propensity for invading cells to enter lymphatic channels, and the lymphatic channels drain into what we call the regional lymph nodes, the lymph nodes in the neck.  So whenever you are following up a patient who has a history of mouth cancer above all else the two things you examine is the local site for evidence of local recurrence, and the region for evidence of lymph node metastases.” As to (b<span style="font-size:14pt">) “</span>In cross examination when asked whether  throughout the time of follow up of Mrs. Manning there had to be a high index of suspicion for recurrence he confirmed that to be the case but emphasised that this was particularly so during the first two years because recurrence is at its highest,  in the first two to three years. He also said, speaking generally of his approach while in practice that if a patient with a history of carcinoma which has been treated, whether by surgery or by radiotherapy, then presents with a lesion at the site of the original carcinoma you would need to have a high index of suspicion that this might be a recurrence.  </p>

When  Professor Langdon was asked  why  that made  him sure it was a carcinoma there was the following exchange : “ A  Because recurrence very often – not invariably but very often – presents as ulceration of an area, particularly if the ulcer has features of cancer, thickened margins, underlying induration. Q And were those present in 1995?     A.  Not typically, but it was sufficiently unusual for my first thought to be is this recurrent cancer.  Q   That the ulcer was sufficiently unusual?     A.  Yes.    Q <marker name="tab"/>Can I just ask, so that it’s clear, Mr. Harrison says that<span style="font-weight:bold"> you would say it’s a strange case and you were sure there was a carcinoma, and you said that is what you felt in 1995?

A.  We had a number of scares with Mrs. Manning’s tongue from the moment that she was treated at the Royal Marsden, certainly for the first two years.  She would return, she would have an ulcer, we would do a biopsy, it would be negative, and this was the pattern of events certainly for the first two years. Q That is 1993 to 1995?

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus the background to the commissioning and receipt of the September 1995 biopsy report was that Professor Langdon had been on the lookout for recurrence for some time, had commissioned two biopsy reports in May 1994 and July 1995 each of which cited recurrent squamous cell carcinoma as a differential diagnosis, had little doubt that the exophytic ulcer which he had seen and biopsied in July 1995 was local recurrence, specifically considered that the July 1995 ulcer might be malignant because it was different from the previous biopsy in May 1994 with raised margins which he said can be a classical sign of a cancerous ulcer and because the ulcer was indurated on palpation which he said was one of the clinical indications of cancer and finally noted when he saw her on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 1995 that the July 1995 biopsy site remained unhealed and that the exophytic mass observed on that day was on the same site. In short Mrs Manning was a source of ongoing concern to Professor Langdon and the negative biopsy report of July 1995 had been unexpected by him. In those circumstances it stands to reason in my view as a matter of common sense that if in his September 1995 biopsy report Dr Harrison had recorded the presence of suspicious cells and alerted Professor Langdon in one way or another to the fact that he had lingering doubts as to whether there might be malignancy present, Professor Langdon would not have been prepared to sit back and await events but on the contrary would have performed a further biopsy in order to seek to resolve what at its lowest would have amounted to a very worrying inability on the basis of the September 1995 biopsy to exclude malignancy. Apart from anything else  it was accepted by all the experts that it is possible, albeit unlikely, for a wound to heal over even if cancer cells are present. Indeed Professor Sloan had personal experience of that happening.</p>

When Mr Grace QC challenged this evidence and put to Professor Langdon the passages in Professor Speight’s report referring to evidence of atypia and features suspicious for recurrent spindle-cell carcinoma and suggested that if he had been told that there were those features as described and that they were suspicious for recurrent SCC then given that he was convinced clinically that Mrs Manning was suffering from a recurrence, he would not just have waited and watched, Professor Langdon said: “No. If the pathology report had said suspicious of squamous cell carcinoma of course I would not. I would have repeated the biopsy. But if a pathology report showed mild atypia that is normal in many patients with mouth cancer….”  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">It appeared at one stage that Professor Langdon was drawing a distinction between a report which referred to the existence of suspicious cells and a report which referred to suspicion of carcinoma and explicitly used the word carcinoma: “Q- … if you had been told of those features, suspicious for recurrent squamous cell carcinoma, you would have carried out a further biopsy?  A- Yes indeed, if the pathologist is so concerned that they write in the report, “this is suspicious of recurrent squamous cell carcinoma” or “ I cannot eliminate recurrent squamous cell carcinoma”, then, yes…Q- If the pathologist is so concerned?

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">Professor Langdon returned to this distinction later in his evidence:” I think if the pathologist actually uses the word “carcinoma” in the report, suggesting that there is that possibility, however remote, I would have been prompted to do a further biopsy. It is the use of the word “carcinoma” that outweighs everything else in the report….If a pathologist is willing to add their signature to a report that mentions the possibility of  a carcinoma I think, whatever my clinical instinct, I would have probably been obliged or would have been obliged to do another biopsy, as much in a defensive way as in a clinical way really….  there is a big difference between a pathologist talking about suspicious cells and a pathologist committing themselves and using the word carcinoma or cancer. There are always suspicious looking cells in any biopsy of any tissue that has been heavily irradiated. It is because the radiotherapy causes damage fairly unselectively to normal cells as well as cancerous cells so inevitably there will be suspicious cells in such a biopsy. If a pathologist uses the word carcinoma or cancer then that has gone several steps further in their thought process so that is one part of it.”  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">In the latter case the reference to suspicious cells would surely be intended and understood as a shorthand for cells suspicious of carcinoma. Of what else would they be suspicious and if they were not suspicious of carcinoma what would be the point of referring to them being suspicious? The explanation for this apparent inconsistency was I think that the real distinction Professor Langdon was making was not between a report that explicitly used the word carcinoma and one that did not but rather a report which explicitly or implicitly indicated that although there were suspicious cells the pathologist had allayed his suspicions and a report in which the pathologist had been unable to eliminate his suspicions such that he retained lingering doubts. Given the potentially fatal consequences of not doing a further biopsy in circumstances where the pathologist had been unable to eliminate the possibility of carcinoma, it would be most surprising if the surgeon’s decision as to whether or not to perform a biopsy turned on a point of semantics rather than a point of substance. It would be one thing for the surgeon to decide not to do a further biopsy when faced with a report which indicated that although the pathologist had seen suspicious cells he had allayed his suspicions. It would be quite another for the surgeon to decide not to do a further biopsy in circumstances where he was faced with a report in which the pathologist not only drew attention to the existence of suspicious cells but indicated to the surgeon that he retained lingering doubts as to whether there might in fact be carcinoma present as Professor Speight accepted that Dr Harrison should have done.. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">It is for this reason that in my view the crucial part of Professor Speight’s evidence was his confirmation that in his view a reasonably competent pathologist based on the September 1995 H and E slides would have been bound to alert the surgeon to the fact that he had lingering doubts as to whether there might be carcinoma present and that the precise language was less important than the communication of those lingering doubts. Professor Speight was making it clear that this was a point not of semantics or the precise language used in the report but a point of real substance. Professor Langdon confirmed that this was the correct approach in a passage in his evidence in which he was dealing with what his reaction would have been if in December 1996 he had been told by Dr Harrison that there were cells that were highly suspicious for recurrent carcinoma. Having said that if it had been put in those term he would have re-biopsied, he said this: “ …I wouldn’t have wanted to subject [Mrs Manning] to a delay. Once you have raised the possibility that a biopsy hasn’t ruled out the presence of cancer I would go for the quickest way of getting the information and reassuring her, or if it was positive telling her of the recurrence rather than waiting for a week or ten days to get the [MRI] scan first and then doing a biopsy and then waiting for the report.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">In that passage Professor Langdon was confirming that the trigger for performing a further biopsy would be the raising by the pathologist of the possibility that the biopsy had not ruled out the presence of cancer. There was another passage, this time in the context of September 1995, which gives further support to the conclusion that Professor Langdon’s decision whether to perform a further biopsy would not have been dictated by the semantics of whether the word carcinoma was actually used in the report.: “Q- …Dr Harrison never reported the suspicious cells to you, but what I am asking you about is what you would have done had you had the report of suspicious cells from Dr Harrison, or from whoever the pathologist was. Add to that your own clinical conviction that this was a recurrence, you would not have had any difficulty in getting an MRI scan would you?  A-  I still wouldn’t have ordered an MRI scan, I would have repeated the biopsy…. Q- But you were sure that this was a recurrence as I understood it… you were sure in 1995 that there was a recurrence. If you had received pathological support for that in the form of a report of suspicious cells then surely you would have wanted to do one and you could exclude recurrence couldn’t you?  A- Indeed and that would have been a repeat and wider biopsy.”   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">It is notable that in that passage in which Professor Langdon confirmed he would have done a further biopsy, the hypothesis made no reference to the word carcinoma but merely to suspicious cells. I would add in passing that at one point Professor Langdon confirmed that if a second biopsy had shown positive that would have led to salvage surgery. On this there was no dispute between the parties with the result that it was common ground that if a further biopsy had revealed evidence of malignancy either in September 1995 or December 1996 Professor Langdon would have carried out salvage surgery. As mentioned above by the end of the trial it was also common ground that the result of such salvage surgery would have been that Mrs Manning would have survived. Thus the critical question in the event of a finding that either in September 1995 or December 1996 that Professor Langdon would have carried out a further biopsy is whether or not such a biopsy would have revealed cancer.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">It is also worth pointing out that, as was put to Professor Langdon in cross examination, in 2001 his clinical belief that Mrs Manning was suffering from recurrent cancer was such that neither the fact of a prior negative biopsy nor the adverse aspects of performing yet another biopsy deterred him from performing a further biopsy in June. The significance of this is that there was some suggestion that a further biopsy would or might have involved a partial glossectomy and that a surgeon would not have embarked on such a course lightly. While that consideration was undoubtedly a reason for avoiding an unnecessary further biopsy it would not in my judgment on the evidence have deterred Professor Langdon from carrying out a further biopsy in September 1995 or December 1996 if faced with a report from Dr Harrison which indicated that it had not been possible to eliminate the possibility of carcinoma as to which there remained lingering doubts.  </p>

Furthermore the spindle and kite-shaped cells are more frequent towards the base of the biopsy specimen where some appear to be arranged in small islands and short chords. <span style="font-weight:bold">This cellular arrangement visible on routinely stained sections makes me suspicious that these are epithelial cells- representing a spindle-cell carcinoma</span>…. the immunostained sections provided by Dr Harrison show most of the spindle/kite-shaped cells stained positively with vimentin and on low-power assessment they show no obvious positive staining with CK and CK19. CK has stained the surface epithelium and high-power examination shows weak positive staining of a few cells around the edge of the ulcer. …I requested two immunostains- AE/1 – AE/3 and MNF/116 which I find more reliable markers of oral epithelial cells. Both stains show positive staining for the small islands and scattered individual kite-shaped and spindle-cells within the granulation tissue. The AE/1 – AE/3 staining is strong and. in my opinion, this stain, together with the distribution of the atypical cells, confirms the presence of spindle-cell carcinoma. … <span style="font-weight:bold">given the appearances in the routinely stained sections, I would have expected a competent and experienced pathologist (general and oral) to continue to suspect a spindle-cell carcinoma even though the immunostains were negative.</span> In her summary and opinion Dr Woolgar wrote: “ …the diagnosis is not easy.

When asked what it was that made the 1996 biopsy highly suspicious as distinct from the 1995 biopsy being merely suspicious Dr Woolgar said first that the numbers of spindle-cells were more striking in 1996 and struck you much more easily as soon as you put the slide under the microscope. The degree of suspicion increased because the same features were there but were more obvious than in 1995. In addition the possibility of these features being explicable as a reaction to the previous biopsy which in December 1996 had been some 15 months earlier in September 1995 could be excluded. Similarly a reaction explained by radiotherapy seemed less likely because it was a further 15 months since the original radiotherapy. Finally the biopsy was not something that was obviously infected, ulcerated or painful. It had only been removed at Mrs Manning’s request and not because it looked obviously inflamed or ulcerated which Dr  Woolgar interpreted as implying that the changes could not be explained as due to florid ongoing infection ulceration or irritation. Theoretically the irritation could be the result of a sharp tooth biting the tongue on tender tissues but in her view the picture presented in the December 1996 biopsy of plump cells tending to form bands, pleomorphism, the big nuclei, the busyness of the tissue were not something one is faced with every day when looking at a slide from a non-healing ulcer.</p>

A comparison between the two biopsies, a procedure he described as routine particularly if the pathologist recognises highly suspicious features in the later biopsy, would have led him to think that the December 1996 lesion was a bit more cellular and a bit more worrying than in September 1995. Such a comparison would also have flagged up to the pathologist that there had been a suspicious lesion in September 1995 followed by a second lesion in December 1996 which would automatically lead the pathologist to ask the question: Is this a recurrence of the first lesion, which in itself would increase the degree of suspicion. Professor Sloan said that in his view it was relatively easy to be highly suspicious of the December 1996 biopsy. It was “ not difficult in the sense that some of the spindle-cell tumours that one rarely encounters have a range of bizarre features that makes it really difficult to actually put the diagnosis on. I think in this  case we were looking at the sarcomatoid part of the spindle-cell carcinoma and I think it was relatively easy if you like to be highly suspicious of the 1996 biopsy.

I think a competent experienced pathologist (general and oral) would have undertaken similar action- they should have noticed the atypical cells and their appearance and arrangement and actively sought to characterise them. The immunostained sections provided by Dr Harrison show most of the spindle/kite-shaped cells stained positively with vimentin and on low-power assessment, they show no obvious positive staining with CK and CK19. CK has stained the surface epithelium and high-power examination shows weak positive staining of a few cells around the edge of the ulcer. The reporting pathologist Dr Harrison concluded that the atypical cells within the exuberant granulation tissue were fibroblasts and that there was no evidence of malignancy. I requested two immunostains- AE/1-AE/3 and MNF/116 which I find more reliable markers of oral epithelial cells. Both stains show positive staining for the small islands and scattered individual kite-shaped and spindle-cells within the granulation tissue. The AE/1-AE/3 staining is strong and in my opinion this stain together with the distribution of the atypical cells confirms the presence of spindle-cell carcinoma. The choice of immunostains depends on both the laboratory and the individual pathologist. Most laboratories and individual pathologists tend to try out a range of immunostains and select the ones that seem  most reliable in their hands. The stains may be referred to by different names, by different suppliers and laboratories and I am uncertain of the precise staining profile the CK and CK19. Nevertheless it is likely that CDK and CK19 were the stains that were used by Dr Harrison at that time and that he considered that they were reliable. Nevertheless given the appearances in the routinely stained sections, I would have expected a competent experienced pathologist (general and oral) to continue to suspect a spindle-cell carcinoma even though the immunostains were negative. In such cases the pathologist would normally request a further, deeper biopsy specimen which I believe would have led to the correct diagnosis of spindle-cell carcinoma.” </p>

Nevertheless I believe there were sufficient features in the routinely-stained sections to make the average pathologist consider the possibility of malignancy. The reporting pathologist noticed these features and requested two immunostains CK and Vimentin. I assumed that Dr Harrison routinely relied on these two immunostains and considered them reliable. However in my opinion, an experienced oral pathologist with a declared interest in oral cancer (such as Dr Harrison) should have put more weight on the morphological characteristics including the presence of atypical mitotic figures.

The section labelled CK shows positive staining for the overlying epithelium and occasional small positive cells within the ulcer slough. This is consistent with regenerative epithelium within an ulcer. The suspicious spindle-cells in the superficial corium are negative for cytokeratin. The section labelled Vim (presumed Vimentin) shows that the spindle-cells are positive, consistent with them being fibroblasts. Comment and conclusion; the report issued from King’s Health Care dated 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 1996 signed by Dr J D Harrison describes an ulcer and changes consistent with radiation damage. The report notes the suspicious cells and records immunocytochemical stains for cytokeratin. The report concludes that the lesion is an ulcer caused by trauma associated with radiotherapy. It also notes the presence of candidal infection. This case has been reported and stained appropriately and I agree with the interpretation and diagnosis. These features are consistent with radiation induced damage to the mucosa and the atypical cells being radiation fibroblasts.” In his comment on the pleaded allegations in relation to the December 1996 biopsy, Professor Speight wrote <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia:” </span>Allegation 3… (d) there is evidence in the report that Dr Harrison did consider malignancy and undertook steps to exclude it. There was no reason why his thought processes, rather than his final conclusion, should have been reported to Professor Langdon. (e) There is evidence in the report that Dr Harrison did consider the possibility of malignancy. He carried out immunocytochemical stains to exclude the possibility that the noted atypical cells were epithelial.

In my opinion, having reviewed the whole case, it is extremely unlikely that there was malignancy at the site in 1996. The histology in 1996 is quite consistent with post-radiation change and the scattered spindle-cells although pleomorphic are loosely arranged in an organising granulation tissue. This is quite different from the appearance as seen in 2001 where the spindle-cells are arranged in sheets and more discreet cellular masses towards the deep aspect of the specimens.” </p>

He would thus have had a roughly 10% residual doubt as to the possible existence of carcinoma. Before being asked questions about it in the witness box he said that he had not thought about putting a figure on his level of confidence and his residual doubts, but, asked to do so, having said initially that his confidence would have been perhaps a bit more than 90% he confirmed that he was happy with 90:10, his overall conclusion being that the evidence was consistent with a healing chronic ulcer. When asked if there were any stigmata of malignancy on the H and E section of the December 1996 biopsy, Professor Speight said that there was pleomorphism of the cells which he satisfied himself was due to sectioning through randomly orientated fibroblasts rather than what he called true pleomorphism. In addition there were atypical cells which showed odd shapes with some hyperchromatism which were much fewer in number and which he regarded as being radiation fibroblasts, which he described as true pleomorphism which could not be explained away by a sectioning effect. In his view the plump cells although some were present on the deep aspect were distributed fairly evenly throughout the lesion as one would expect in a healing ulcer.  </p>

Professor Speight had earlier accepted that any reasonably competent pathologist seeking to exclude carcinoma could not safely do so unless he was sure beyond reasonable doubt that it was not there, that if you have a reasonable doubt after doing all your intellectual reiterative processes then a reasonably competent pathologist cannot say a biopsy is not malignant and that if a pathologist has a 10% residual doubt on a biopsy which he thinks is very likely to be innocent and he cannot rule out the lingering doubt he has to alert the surgeon to the existence of the lingering doubt. Although of course in September 1995 the position is much clearer in that Dr Harrison did not carry out immunostaining and thus could not reasonably have reached more than a 90% level of confidence that there was no malignancy, the logic in my view is the same in both cases. </p>

Even though in December 1996 Dr Harrison did in fact perform a degree of immunostaining which showed negative, for precisely the same reasons as would have applied if he had done immunostaining in September 1995, in my view the false negative phenomenon meant that a reasonably competent pathologist in his position could not have sufficiently allayed his lingering doubts and suspicions to the point where he was relieved of the duty to alert Professor Langdon to them. I would add, although my finding is not dependant on this, that in the immunostaining which was done for the purpose of the trial the so called archipelago stained positive. Whatever the correct interpretation of the archipelago is, in my view it is clear that it created a level of doubt which at the lowest would have required Dr Harrison to alert Professor Langdon to lingering doubts if he had performed such an additional immunostaining.</p>

Although the answer is not as clear cut in my view as in the case of September 1995, on the balance of probabilities I believe that he would have done so. It is clear from the evidence both documentary and oral that Professor Langdon’s state of mind in December 1996 was quite different from what it had been in September 1995. In September 1995 he had been sure clinically that Mrs Manning was suffering recurrent carcinoma before he carried out the biopsy and the initiative for carrying out a biopsy was that of Professor Langdon who wanted to see if it would confirm his clinical suspicion. He had been in little doubt clinically that the lesion seen in July 1995 represented local recurrence, both that lesion and the September 1995 lesion had been on the same site as the December 1993 original carcinoma, the July 1995 biopsy site remained unhealed when he reviewed Mrs Manning on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 1995 and clinically the September 1995 lesion had features which he described as characteristic of cancer and September 1995 was well within the expected period for a recurrence.</p>

Before that meeting, according to Dr Harrison’s evidence, Professor Langdon had been saying that Mrs Manning’s was a strange case and the effect of what Dr Harrison said at the meeting was that “I would have allayed everybody suspicions about this case and… the matter would have seemed to have been settled.” Indeed, later in his evidence Dr Harrison confirmed that he was not trying in either the September 1995 or the December 1996 biopsy report to convey the suspicion that there might be malignancy:</p>

On the contrary he understood it as intended to be reassuring. When asked to explain why he saw no need to ask Professor Johnson to review the December 1996 slide in the way that he had asked him to do in 1995, Professor Langdon said:  “… because clinically I wasn’t in the least bit suspicious that she had had a recurrence at this time because we had discussed the biopsy at our clinico pathological interview and because the biopsy site healed entirely uneventfully and the tongue looked quite healthy thereafter.”  </p>

The logic of Professor Speight’s evidence that a reasonably competent pathologist should also have had a 10% residual doubt on the December 1996 H and E slide coupled with his acceptance of the 25% false negative on immuno staining suggests, in my view, that a reasonably competent pathologist should have acted in the same way following the immuno staining in December 1996. It is notable that in the answers just cited, Professor Langdon made it clear that he would have conducted a further biopsy even without the added element of a recommendation from the pathologist to do a repeat biopsy if the surgeon had on-going clinical concern. An indication that the pathologist could not be certain that suspicious cells did not in fact represent carcinoma would have been enough to cause Professor Langdon to carry out a further biopsy. Given the background of Professor Langdon’s certainty in 1995 there was recurrent carcinoma and the fact that December 1996 was also within the time in which recurrence would not be unusual, this is not surprising. The purpose of requesting the 1996 biopsy was after all to check whether carcinoma was present.</p>

On one view it could be taken as meaning that there was on the September 1995 biopsy evidence of malignancy in the sense that as a matter of objective fact there was carcinoma present and that any reasonably competent pathologist should have reported that the suspicious features on the biopsy were evidence of the presence of such carcinoma. If that were intended to be the allegation in my judgment it would fail. As mentioned above, neither Professor Sloan nor Dr Woolgar was of the view that Dr Harrison had any positive obligation to diagnose the existence of malignancy. Nor, as I read their evidence did they consider that a reasonably competent pathologist would positively have <span class="hidden"/>reported that the suspicious features which they identified were evidence of malignancy. Their evidence and that of Professor Speight was not that the suspicious features were evidence of malignancy but rather that they gave rise to a suspicion that malignancy might be present, which suspicion a reasonably competent pathologist could not allay on the basis of the H and E slide.  </p>

It would in effect be the positive flipside of the first half of the allegation in that sub-paragraph, namely negligently failing to advise that it was not possible to exclude carcinoma. It is in that sense that I have assumed the allegation to be intended to be meant and in that sense I find it has been proved. Given the finding which I make that if Dr Harrison in his report had advised as he should have done that it was not possible to exclude carcinoma Professor Langdon would probably have performed a further biopsy, the allegation in the second part of that paragraph does not in my view add anything material to the outcome of the case.

It clearly should have done so, as is inherent in Professor Speight’s [incorrect in my judgment] view in his report that “an element of suspicion is implicit within the report.” and as is the opinion of Dr Woolgar and Professor Sloan. The reason why the report did not convey any sense of suspicion was because Dr Harrison had again by his “intellectual exercise” convinced himself, on the H&amp;E slides alone, that this was no more than an ulcer. His CK staining was merely “ belt and braces” .The CK staining did not … provide him with the sufficient degree of confidence to allow him to exclude recurrent carcinoma”.

Again neither Professor Sloan nor Dr Woolgar went so far as to suggest that a reasonably competent pathologist would have been bound to make a positive diagnosis of malignancy in respect of the December 1996 biopsy. Professor Speight actually considered that Dr Harrison’s interpretation of the biopsy was correct, his ultimate criticism, if that is the right word, of Dr Harrison being confined to his view that a reasonably competent pathologist would have had a lingering doubt of the order of 10% as to whether there might be carcinoma present in the biopsy on the basis of the H and E slides alone, which could not have been removed beyond reasonable doubt by reference to the immunostaining.  </p>

In another area in the centre of the ulcer there are two small islands of epithelium showing cytological atypia and one large prominent abnormal mitotic figure. The features are those of widespread ulceration consistent with radiation damage. In addition there are features suspicious for recurrent squamous cell carcinoma…. throughout the biopsy there are scattered plump pleomorphic spindle-cells.

The granulation tissue includes interlacing bands of plump spindle-cells which largely account for the busyness of the tissue at low magnification. The epithelial proliferation and the cellularity of the granulation tissue are worrisome… In my opinion an increase in cellularity and the busy appearances of the tissues compared to the previous biopsies is not expected given the long delay since the radiation treatment. The increase in cellularity due to reactive benign fibroblast proliferation usually occurs soon after radiotherapy and hence I would be uneasy in explaining this late increased cellularity as an innocent reaction to radiotherapy. I would have issued a report that clearly indicated the presence of worrisome features and my uncertainty in distinguishing reactive post-radiation features from possible neoplastic features and I would have recommended a repeat biopsy if there was ongoing clinical concern or continued suspicion of malignancy. In addition I would have discussed the slides with experienced colleagues. In my opinion a competent experienced pathologist general and oral would have taken a similar course - I would have expected them to notice and be concerned by the worrisome features; to examine multiple sections and express their concerns in the pathology report and also to advise a repeat biopsy if there was ongoing clinical concerns.”  </p>

That of course is a conclusion with which the three experts disagreed. Although Professor Speight did agree that Dr Harrison’s innocent diagnosis was very likely correct, he agreed with Professor Sloan and Dr Woolgar that because of a residual 10% doubt in his mind on the H and E slide it was not possible on the H and E slide alone to allay the initial suspicions created by the cells. Doctor Harrison’s error was not a failure of observation but rather a failure of interpretation, or at any rate, an error in making a more definitive interpretation than in the opinion of the experts was warranted. Thus his failure to describe the suspicious cells resulted not from a negligent failure to observe them but from a negligent failure to appreciate that while there might be, and indeed probably was on the evidence of the H and E slides alone, an innocent explanation for the suspicious cells, it was not safe to exclude the possibility that there might be a malignant explanation for them. </p>

In such circumstances he said it would or might be misleading to the surgeon for the pathologist to refer to such cells in his report. The impression I got from the experts was that this may well be a question of degree so that there may be occasions where even if the pathologist can allay his suspicions on investigation he ought nonetheless if the features in question are particularly suspicious to describe them as well as giving his reasons as to why his suspicions were allayed. Be that as it may, Dr Harrison’s point, as it seems to me, was based on the premise that it is possible for the pathologist to allay his suspicions. In this case, where the expert pathologists are agreed that no reasonably competent pathologist could have allayed his suspicions on the H and E slide, the defence put forward by Dr Harrison does not in my view avail him. </p>

Reference to and description of suspicious cells would, it seems to me, as a matter of necessary logic have carried the implication that they were suspicious of malignancy.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in"> In evidence in chief Professor Sloan said it is the duty of the pathologist to ask for the requisite number of levels that are needed to make a proper diagnosis. In the mid 1990s practice varied between different hospitals. Many laboratories took a single H and E section and then the pathologist requested further levels if he or she thought that they were needed. Other laboratories would have requested multiple levels from the outset in selected cases. Either practice was perfectly acceptable. In a laboratory operating the former practice, he said that in a case of suspected cancer or where the pathologist was being asked to exclude cancer it would be the pathologists’ duty to do extra levels to search for islands of cancer cells if the first H and E section showed no significant abnormality. It would be unsafe just to rely on the first level because one might miss islands of cells. In such circumstances his own practice if he found nothing on the first section would be to sample the whole tissue and take the block through to extinction until there was no tissue left. In the case of the December 1996 biopsy because it showed highly suspicious spindle-cells Professor Sloan would certainly have cut levels to look for foci of conventional squamous cell carcinomas, because the diagnosis could be clinched by finding a small focus of conventional squamous cell carcinoma. If the pathologist finds something highly suspicious in the first section it would absolutely not be safe to rely solely on that first section without going further. If there was real suspicion he could not imagine any competent pathologist considering it safe to rely on the first section. When examining a 7 millimetre long piece of tissue where the pathologist was highly suspicious on the first level Professor Sloan would certainly ask for levels right through the block so that all the tissue was examined. If a pathologist was highly suspicious of cells seen on the first level, if he were to form a view just on that first level and come to a conclusion that the cells were not malignant he would be running the risk of missing a cancer.  </p>

He was then asked whether he had changed his view since the joint report. His first answer was that he had not and that he remained of the view that it would not fall below an acceptable level to report on just one slide. However very shortly thereafter Professor Sloan said that he wished to resile from his first answer and from what he had agreed in the joint experts report and that he was of the view that the fact that Dr Harrison did not carry out further levels on the September 1995 biopsy did fall below an acceptable standard of practice. He repeated what he had said in chief namely that if the pathologist found suspicious spindle-cells and had the diagnosis of spindle-cell carcinoma in mind it would have been mandatory to go on and look for the other two elements that help make the diagnosis i.e. dysplasia or carcinoma. </p>

By contrast in 1995 pathologists according to Professor Speight would look at the first section before deciding whether or not to ask the laboratory technician to cut further levels. He confirmed that all three pathologists at the joint meeting had agreed that the September 1995 biopsy tissue had been sampled in such a way that it was not unreasonable to report on that one slide. The reason, he said, was that it was evident that Dr Harrison had trisected the specimen not bisected it and there were three profiles on the slide each of which was very large. Normally one would bisect it. Professor Speight said you have to give credit to the judgment of the pathologist in sampling the tissue when he saw it, which the experts did not have the opportunity to do. They felt that by trisecting the tissue Dr Harrison’s sampling was representative and therefore that one slide was adequate. He specifically said that he did not agree that a reasonably competent pathologist in 1995 could not have excluded malignancy without cutting further levels and that he regarded Dr Harrison’s sampling as adequate. </p>

Professor Speight’s report stated: “Normally faced with suspicious features in a biopsy, a pathologist would prepare deeper levels so as to examine more tissue. There is no evidence in the report that multiple levels were examined and levels were not included in the materials supplied to me.” When it was put to him that he was there saying that the proper standard in circumstances where there are suspicious features is to prepare deeper levels so as to examine more tissue Professor Speight initially said: “It could be interpreted that way, yes… I’m saying that normally faced with suspicious features in a biopsy a pathologist would prepare deeper levels and I think most pathologists would, but whether or not it falls short of a proper standard, because one can satisfy oneself on the specimen whether or not it is representative. Of course Dr Harrison actually saw the specimen in real life, we didn’t, and he was the person who sampled it…..so his judgment as to whether or not it was representative, to some extent we have to respect that judgment.

Professor Speight then resiled from his comment on allegation 3(a) by saying that it is not normal faced with suspicious features in a biopsy to examine or prepare deeper levels. He said that some pathologists take lots of levels and some take no levels at all. “Some people hardly ever do levels. They say that they have seen the specimen, they have taken the sample, and they believe their sample is representative and based on their experience taking levels makes no difference so it is a costly exercise that makes no difference and to be truthful it very rarely does make a difference. We do levels quite often now and it very rarely makes a difference to the diagnosis.” He accepted that failing to take further levels risks missing other features in the biopsy, either innocent or malignant, that would assist the pathologist in either excluding or confirming a diagnosis of carcinoma but said that he could not quantify the risk. He then said that while taking further levels would be good practice he was not sure it would be normal practice and said that he has two colleagues who virtually never take levels even when suspicious. He confirmed what he said in his report in relation to the allegation in the Particulars of Claim that Dr Harrison had been negligent in failing to take further levels in respect of the February 2001 biopsy where he wrote: “I believe that the histological changes in this biopsy were sufficiently suspicious to warrant the application of immunostains and examination of further sections. This was not done. Therefore the allegation is found to be correct.” His explanation for that was that in the February 2001 biopsy there was a collection of suspicious cells on the deep aspect which he thought were malignant which he looked at carefully and could not allay his suspicions in respect of and formed the opinion that levels would help to determine the extent of the proliferation and help to put it in context. </p>

In the former Dr Harrison he felt fell below the appropriate standard before he failed to take more levels and failed to ask for immunostaining because he should already have realised from the H and E stain itself that there was malignancy. In that situation the reason for doing further levels would have been to appreciate the context of the proliferation. Professor Speight’s view was that that did not apply in September 1995 or December 1996 where the circumstances were quite different. In both those cases the biopsies were in his opinion quite representative of all the tissues one would expect to see with clear evidence of a chronic ulcer. In February 2001 the only reason for taking further levels would be to find out what kind of malignancy there was but not whether there was a malignancy, something which in Professor Speight’s view should have been apparent from the H and E slides. </p>

One suggestion appeared to be that the decisive question is whether the pathologist can reasonably conclude that the existing section is a sufficiently representative sample of the entire biopsy tissue to make it unnecessary to cut further levels. </p>

On the contrary Professor Speight explicitly said that it was, Dr Woolgar’s failure to pursue further levels herself suggests that she took the same view when she was examining the September 1995 biopsy and she confirmed in evidence that that is the logical inference. That is also the obvious inference from the joint report.  </p>

Some support for that as the relevant test is provided by one of the answers given by Professor Speight referred to above. If that is the correct test, again in my view the allegation is not proved because it is accepted by all the pathologists that there were suspicious cells on the section examined by Dr Harrison.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in"> A third candidate for the guiding principle would be that a pathologist should always ask for further levels where there are suspicious cells in the first section so as to seek to eliminate or confirm the presence of malignancy. Some support for this approach is to be found in the evidence of Professor Sloan and Professor Speight. However it is hard if not impossible to reconcile with (a) the fact that all three experts said in their joint report that they would not be unduly critical of Dr Harrison for failing to ask for further levels despite the fact that all three are agreed that there were suspicious indeed highly suspicious cells on the section examined by him, (b) the fact that neither Dr Woolgar nor Professor Speight themselves sought to take further levels when doing their own examination of the September 1995 biopsy and (c) the fact that according to Professor Speight he has colleagues whose practice is not to seek further levels even when confronted with suspicious cells. This latter point is not of itself determinative because, as explained above, the <span style="font-style:italic">Bolam</span> defence is subject to the <span style="font-style:italic">Bolitho</span> requirement of demonstrating that if a defendant relies on a practice adopted by a body of reasonable and responsible practitioners it must withstand the test of logic. </p>

It appeared to be common ground that there are very many biopsies which contain cells that are <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> suspicious but where the suspicion can almost instantly be reasonably allayed on examination of the H and E slide. The matter in this case is complicated by the fact that although Dr Harrison undoubtedly did allay his suspicions on examining the H and E slide, all three experts agreed that it was not reasonable for him to do so to the extent of being able safely to exclude completely the possibility of carcinoma being present. Mr Grace QC submitted (in respect of the December 1996 biopsy, but the point is logically of equal application to the September 1995 biopsy) that since Dr Harrison could not reasonably have allayed his suspicions he was under a duty, applying this criterion to call for further levels.</p>

However one is left, in considering whether this is the appropriate criterion, with the undoubted fact that neither Dr Woolgar nor Professor Speight apparently felt it necessary to request further levels despite the fact that they could not completely eliminate the possibility of carcinoma on the H and E slide. This tends to suggest that the relevant criterion is the first of the three candidates, namely whether the pathologist can reasonably take the view that the section under examination is a sufficiently representative sample of the whole biopsy tissue. On that approach, even in a case such as this where, as I have found, a reasonably competent pathologist could not on examining the H and E slide alone have safely eliminated the possibility of carcinoma, and was thus under a duty to take such reasonable steps as were available to him to seek further to eliminate or confirm the possibility of malignancy and failing that to alert the surgeon to the existence of residual doubt, the solution to the problem would appear to be that whereas performing immunostaining would have been a step that a reasonably competent pathologist should have taken, requesting further samples would not have been. </p>

In reaching the conclusion I do, I draw some comfort from the reflection that if I am wrong it would not seem to me to have any impact on the outcome of this case. That is because there was no evidence to suggest that if further levels had been requested such levels would have confirmed the existence or probability of malignancy such as to have caused Professor Langdon for that reason to perform a second biopsy. Indeed Professor Sloan as mentioned above said in oral evidence: “We know that deeper levels were looked at because the experts have prepared some and we know that there is no evidence of dysplasia and no conventional squamous cell carcinoma.” Further and in any event even if it would have done, I have already found that if, as I have found he had a duty to do, Dr Harrison had alerted Professor Langdon to the fact that it was not possible to allay lingering doubts or to eliminate the possibility of the presence of carcinoma instead of advising him that there was no evidence of malignancy which he should not have done, Professor Langdon would probably have performed a second biopsy. Thus even if Dr Harrison was negligent in this additional respect, it would add nothing to Mr Manning’s ability to prove causation and thus to the establishment of a cause of action in negligence.  </p>

He said that the area viewed in the section was large compared with the whole volume of the specimen. He said that he felt that he had a good representative section that allowed him to see the relationship between the epithelium and the connective tissue and every other structure that he needed to see. He did not believe that cutting any further levels would have given him any better representation than the one he already had. He added that because it was a thin piece of tissue there was a risk that deeper sections would be more tangential because the surface was curved and would be of no benefit. In cross-examination when asked if he agreed with the proposition that if the pathologist is suspicious he should take further levels Dr Harrison’s answer was that taking levels was not the only possibility. A pathologist could show the histology to a colleague before undertaking further levels. It was not in his opinion an automatic reaction that if a pathologist is unsure he takes further levels. </p>

The serious error he thought in hindsight that he had made in 2001 was not showing it to a colleague. Specifically in relation to December 1996 Dr Harrison repeated that in his view there was no need to cut deeper into the block particularly as it was a thin piece “What deeper levels do is to expand the area of the specimen that is being investigated. We still come down to an interpretation of the appearance in the deeper levels. I was, and am, of the opinion that a reasonable area of the specimens was being examined by me in the slides…. there is nothing magical about a deeper level that is going to give an answer in most cases. …we are trying to deal with a representative sample of the specimen.

My assessment confirms that the biopsy specimen is superficial consisting of ulcerated surface epithelium lined by exuberant granulation tissue and supported by scar tissue.  No muscle is included.  I agree that the surface epithelium shows proliferation and mild cytological atypia.  The spindle and kite-shaped cells described as “large fibroblasts” are quite striking and in view of the long delay since radiation treatment, they cannot easily be explained as a benign reactive fibroblast proliferation.  Furthermore the spindle and kite shaped cells are more frequent towards the base of biopsy specimen where some appear to be arranged in small islands and short cords.  This cellular arrangement visible on routinely stained sections makes me suspicious that these are epithelial cells-representing a spindle cell carcinoma.  I would have examined multiple levels through the tissue block and I would have requested a range of cytokeratin markers.

To my mind the factor which tips the scales against a finding of negligence on this issue is the fact that Professor Speight himself when he wrote his own report on his examination of the December 1996 slide did not record the need for further levels in his contemporaneous examination of the specimen, which he said he would have done had he thought that necessary, as he did in his contemporaneous notes of the 2001 specimen.

I would have asked for the slides to be reviewed by a histopathology colleague experienced in tumour diagnosis.  I believe that any experienced oral pathologist should have done so.”  In relation to the December 1996 report Professor Sloan wrote:  “I would have been highly suspicious of spindle cell carcinoma and would have requested cytokeratin markers, multiple levels and <span style="font-weight:bold">sought the opinion of an experienced colleague with expertise in spindle cell tumour diagnosis.</span>  I believe that any other experienced oral pathologist would have been highly suspicious and would have requested cytokeratin markers, studied multiple levels and discussed the case with a specialist diagnostic pathologist.”(emphasis added)  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in">Dr. Harrison accepted that in relation to the February 2001 biopsy, where he accepted that he was wrong not to recognise the suspicious signs of malignancy, with hindsight he should have shown the slides to a pathology colleague.  He described his failure to do so as the serious error he made in 2001.  By contrast he said he could see no reason to show the December 1996 to a colleague to reinforce a diagnosis because the biopsy was already explicable by the diagnosis he had himself reached.  When Professor Speight’s statement in the report referred to above was put to him he accepted that it has always been common practice to discuss difficult cases where the pathologist has a suspicion or ought to have a suspicion.  In relation to both the September 1995 and December 1996 biopsies Dr. Harrison remained “convinced I was not mistaken” .The inference appeared to be that he accepted the principle that where a pathologist ought reasonably to have suspicions which he cannot or ought not reasonably to be able to allay then he is under a duty to discuss the case with a colleague.  Since I have found that, contrary to Dr. Harrison’s view, it was not reasonable for him to have allayed his suspicions in respect of either the September 1995 or December 1996 biopsy, it would seem to follow that, applying Dr. Harrison’s own approach, he ought to have discussed both biopsies with a colleague. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in">In his evidence in chief Professor Sloan said that any pathologist who did not discuss a suspicious case with a colleague was falling below an acceptable standard.  He also said that no reasonably competent pathologist could exclude malignancy without getting a second opinion.  In her evidence in chief Dr. Woolgar said that if the pathologist had allayed his suspicions and was confident of a benign diagnosis, it was not mandatory to discuss the biopsy with a colleague.  However it seems to me that this answer needs to be seen in context.  In my view Dr. Woolgar was referring to a situation in which the pathologist has allayed his suspicions on reasonable grounds and has reasonable grounds to be confident of a benign diagnosis.  Thus Ms Mishcon’s submission in her written closing submissions that given that Dr. Harrison was confident of a diagnosis of a chronic ulcer it was perfectly reasonable not to discuss the 1995 biopsy with a colleague ignores the question whether it was reasonable for him to have such confidence.  I have found, based on the expert evidence, that it was not.  On the afternoon between the second and third days on which Dr. Harrison gave evidence, he reviewed the September 1995 and December 1996 biopsy slides.  His report the next day on what he had seen was remarkable:  “When I looked at the sections I saw cells that were suspicious of malignancy on a superficial glance, but a detailed appraisal convinced me beyond any doubt that the cells are not malignant or suspicious of malignancy – no longer suspicious.”  He added that if the slides had appeared in his laboratory the previous day sent by a surgeon and he had been on call he would not have taken further levels and would not have discussed them with another pathologist.  That is despite the fact that he had said the previous day in evidence that possibly because of a change in approach over the years he and his colleagues now routinely look at each other’s cases. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in">It thus appeared that despite everything that happened in relation to Mrs. Manning and all the expert evidence in this case, Dr. Harrison remained not only entirely convinced in the rightness of his initial view that it was possible to allay his suspicions but also that he would still see no need to take a second opinion.  This episode seemed to me to illustrate graphically precisely why it is important for a pathologist to take a second opinion in a case such as this.  It is a notorious feature of the working life of histopathologists that there is an inherent danger arising from the isolated nature of their function.  It is precisely for that reason that the evidence in the trial showed that in recent years the profession has taken steps to increase cross-fertilisation between pathologists.  Anybody in any profession can make an honest mistake.  But where the consequences of mistakes can be a matter of life and death it is plainly of the utmost importance that all reasonable steps should be taken to guard against them and to minimise any adverse consequences. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in">The fact that Dr. Harrison candidly admitted that he would still not have consulted a colleague seems to me to show why the duty to consult a colleague and seek a second opinion cannot depend on the subjective confidence of a pathologist in the rightness of his diagnosis.  There is no necessary correlation between the degree of a pathologist’s confidence that he has got it right and the objective question whether he has in fact got it right.  It would be surprising and in my view afford inadequate protection to the patient if, in a case where no reasonably competent pathologist could allay his suspicions as to malignancy, a duty to seek a second opinion would only arise if the pathologist had in fact not allayed his suspicions. </p>

In relation to the latter although he said that he discussed Mrs. Manning’s case at one of the clinico-pathological meetings, he said that he was usually the only oral pathologist present and that those meetings were more of a training exercise for the junior surgeons and had no real advantage from the pathology side.  Dr. Harrison said in evidence that he did not remember discussing the 1996 biopsy with Professor Johnson and he was sure that he did not show him the biopsy slides and that he did not go over them with Professor Johnson.  Nor did he remember if he was present at the clinico pathology conference when the 1996 biopsy was discussed.  As he candidly said, in his view “the 1996 case was explicable by the diagnosis I had made and I could see no reason to show this to a colleague to reinforce the diagnosis which I had made.”  This is to be contrasted with his admission in relation to the February 2001 biopsy that if he had been more suspicious he would have shown it to another colleague who was likely to have been Professor Johnson and if he had not been available he would have taken it to histo-pathology. </p>

The relevant question seems to me what would a reasonably competent pathologist who had been consulted by Dr. Harrison have done.  I do not by that comment mean to suggest that Professor Johnson was not generally a reasonably competent pathologist but rather to indicate that in my view if Professor Johnson had made the same mistake on such a consultation in September 1995 or December 1996 as he did in August 2001 that could not avail the defendants.  </p>

He or she, unlike Professor Sloan and the other pathology experts in this case would not have had the benefit of hindsight. I do on the other hand believe and so find that on the balance of probabilities such a reasonably competent pathologist would have advised Dr. Harrison on both occasions that it was not possible safely to exclude the possibility of carcinoma.  That being so in my view Dr. Harrison would have been under a duty to do what I have in any event held he was under a duty to do on each occasion, namely to alert Professor Langdon to the existence of lingering doubts as to the possibility of carcinoma which it had not been possible to allay.  In those circumstances for all the reasons I have given I believe on the balance of probabilities that on both occasions Professor Langdon would for that reason alone have performed a further biopsy.  Indeed the addition of a second opinion added to the weight of Dr. Harrison expressing the view that it was not possible to exclude the possibility of carcinoma would have reinforced the likelihood of such a further biopsy being performed. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in">In evidence in chief when the allegation was put to Dr. Harrison his response was as follows: “I do not see what advantage immunostaining would have been because there is no evidence of malignancy in the section.  We apply immunostaining to answer a question.  I had no question to pose, to be answered by immunostaining.”  He added:  “Immunostaining is very intensive on labour.  We have to choose - there has to be a good reason for asking for immunostaining.  There was no good reason in this case.”  It thus appears that Dr. Harrison’s reason for not doing immunostaining was the same as his reason for not consulting a colleague, namely that he did not have any doubts as to the possible existence of malignancy on the H and E slides after he had considered them.  By contrast, Professor Speight in evidence said that he was left with a 10% residual doubt as to the possible presence of malignancy on the H and E slides alone in September 1995, that he would himself have done an immunostaining and that in his view Dr. Harrison should have done so.  He said that his failure to do immunostaining or alert Professor Langdon to the existence of lingering doubts as to the possible existence of carcinoma fell below a proper standard.  This is consistent with Professor Speight’s conclusion in his report:  “In the sections I have examined there are cells and histological changes suspicious for recurrent carcinoma from September 1995 onwards.  In these circumstances immunocytochemical staining to confirm that atypical cells are indeed “radiation fibroblasts” is indicated.” This was in contrast to his earlier evidence to the effect that the majority of pathologists at the time would not do immunostaining and that papers and textbooks emphasised that it was the histological features and not cytokeratin staining which was important in the diagnosis. </p>

As already mentioned, both Dr. Woolgar and Professor Sloan accepted that even in the light of the immunostaining which was done for the purposes of the trial, no positive diagnosis of malignancy could reasonably have been made at the time.  Thus immunostaining would not have increased the level of suspicion that should have been present in Dr. Harrison’s mind at the conclusion of his examination of the H and E slides.  In my judgment the question whether Professor Langdon would probably have done a further biopsy is unaffected by Dr. Harrison’s failure to do immunostaining.

The AE1 to AE3 staining is strong and in my opinion this stain together with the distribution of the atypical cells confirms the presence of spindle cell carcinoma.  The choice of immunostains depends on both the laboratory and the individual pathologists.  Most laboratories and individual pathologists tend to try out a range of immunostains and select the ones that seem most reliable in their hands.  The stains may be referred to by different names by different suppliers and laboratories and I am uncertain of the precise staining profile of CK and CK19.  Nevertheless it is likely that CK and CK19 were the stains that were used routinely by Dr. Harrison at that time and he considered they were reliable.  Nevertheless given the appearances in the routinely stained sections I would have expected a competent experienced pathologist (general and oral) to continue to suspect a spindle cell carcinoma even though the immunostains were negative.

That is because on the facts of this case in my view, as I have held, Professor Langdon would probably have performed further biopsies if he had been advised that carcinoma could not be excluded and that lingering doubts as to the possibility of carcinoma could not be allayed. That is so even if he had not received a positive recommendation, whether qualified or not, for a further biopsy. On analysis it also adds little in this sense that the only purpose of advising Professor Langdon that carcinoma could not be excluded would be with a view to him performing a further biopsy. </p>

There was much discussion in cross-examination and submissions as to what if any reservation or qualification would or should have been added to that recommendation. All three experts agreed that some form of qualification would be acceptable. In her report Dr Woolgar said she would have recommended a repeat biopsy “if there was ongoing clinical concern or continued suspicion of malignancy” and that in her oinion a competent experienced pathologist(general and oral) would have taken a similar course.She also  said in respect of the Dcember 1996 biopsy that  she would expect an experienced pathologist to clearly point out the uncertainties and the  need for a further biopsy “unless the clinical lesion healed completely and the clinician was confident that the possibility of malignancy had been excluded.” </p>

In the joint report Professor Sloan and Dr Woolgar said that they felt that “the surgeon should have been alerted that a repeat biopsy should  be carried out if there was ongoing clinical concern.” Professor Speight, as already mentioned, accepted that Dr Harrison should on the basis of the H&amp;E slides have alerted Professor Langdon to the existence of lingering doubts which could not be allayed and advised careful review by which he meant recommending a biopsy if the wound did not heal  within 14 days. In the joint report Professor Speight said that it is good practice to advise a repeat biopsy if there is suspicion of malignancy despite a negative pathology report.

I do not accept that submission. In my view too much was made of the differences between the various formulations. Standing back and considering the purpose of a recommendation for a further biopsy, it seems to me that in circumstances where the pathologist believes that carcinoma cannot be excluded because of lingering doubts, and thus has a duty so to advise and alert the surgeon, it is implicit that that message should convey that a further biopsy should be performed unless there is some countervailing reason, perhaps unknown to the pathologist, why it should not be. Thus one of the experts explained that there might be circumstances unknown to the pathologist which intervened between the request for biopsy and the biopsy report which meant that no further biopsy was needed because the risk of carcinoma had for some other reason been excluded or alternatively because the existence had in some other way been confirmed. </p>

So far as the allegations apply to December 1996 they proceed on a false premise. Professor Langdon did not at that time believe that clinically there was evidence of recurrence. His reason for performing the biopsy was to allay Mrs Manning’s concerns. As to (a) Professor Langdon said that his previous experience of biopsies with Mrs Manning was that they healed badly so that he did the minimum possible by removing the nodule so as to avoid a painful non-healing wound. There was no evidence to suggest that that was negligent. The nodule was on the left lateral side of the anterior tongue and there was no evidence that he should have taken a biopsy from the posterior tongue.</p>

In the latter the experts were asked if a consultant oral surgeon in 1996 notwithstanding a negative biopsy report was suspicious of or considered that the clinical  features were indicative of carcinoma or recurrence ought he in order to exclude malignancy to have carried out imaging by MRI scan or otherwise? They agreed that the answer depended on the degree of clinical suspicion among other things and that consideration of a further MRI scan <span style="font-weight:bold">could</span> have been instigated. Mr Brown believed that if there was still suspicion or the clinical features were indicative of carcinoma an MRI scan should have been ordered. They both agreed that a histology report confirming the absence of malignant tissue from the biopsy could in some circumstances not require further active intervention at that time. It seems to me that that latter point is a complete answer to the allegation since both in December 1996 and September 1995 the biopsy reports explicitly excluded malignancy. In addition as I have mentioned in December 1996,unlike in September 1995,Professor Langdon was not suspicious and did not consider that the clinical features were indicative of carcinoma so that the hypothesis addressed by the experts did not in fact apply.</p>

It is there submitted that Professor Langdon demonstrated the same degree of blindness to the obvious as seems also to have characterised Dr Harrison. It is alleged that his failures in 1995 and 1996 are mirrored by similar failures in 2001 when he again refused to believe the clinical evidence. In my judgment these allegations all fail. For most of 2001 up to September Professor Langdon was acutely concerned about Mrs Manning believing that she had a recurrent carcinoma. He performed no fewer than four biopsies in February, June, August and September. It was not his fault that the first three  biopsy reports came back negative when they should have come back positive. </p>

In that letter he was at pains to reassure Mr Bridger that “despite the appearance of her tongue Dr Henk and I are happy that she is in fact tumour-free.” Mr Bridger in his witness statement described this letter as extremely patronizing and said that he was in truth completely astonished by its total arrogance. When he had examined her on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2001 he said that there was no doubt in his mind at that time that this was cancer. In cross-examination Professor Langdon said that he was convinced there was a carcinoma until July 2001 despite the biopsy reports although the Johnson review persuaded him that it was less likely. When I asked Professor Langdon how he reconciled that evidence with his letter to Mr Bridger I found his answer unsatisfactory. He attributed it to a careless use of words both to Mr Bridger and in giving evidence. He relied in part on the innocent MRI report but accepted that that report had initially been positive and had only been retracted by the radiologists after discussions with him. I do not believe that anything material turns on this but I found it surprising. </p>

It was common ground by that stage of the proceedings that if (i) Dr Harrison was negligent in relation to the 1995 and/or 1996 biopsies and (ii) but for such negligence Professor Langdon would have carried out a further biopsy/biopsies, then if cancer had been present and revealed in such biopsy/biopsies, salvage surgery would have been performed and would have been successful so that Mrs Manning would have survived.  I have found that Dr Harrison was negligent both in 1995 and 1996. I have also found that but for his negligence in September 1995, Professor Langdon would have performed a further biopsy and that if I am wrong about either or both of my findings that Dr Harrison was negligent in September 1995 and but for that negligence Professor Langdon would have performed a further biopsy in September 1995, then but for Dr Harrison’s negligence in December 1996, Professor Langdon would have carried out a further biopsy then.  Thus the key question is whether cancer was actually present in Mrs Manning in September 1995 and/or December 1996. If it was, I did not understand it to be an issue that it would have been revealed in a further biopsy. Indeed such was the unchallenged evidence of three of the experts called on behalf of Mr Manning, namely Professor Sloan, Dr Woolgar and Dr Plowman.</p>

In the latter enquiry hindsight is impermissible because the question revolves around what a reasonably competent pathologist in Dr Harrison’s position in 1995 and 1996 would and or ought to have done.  By contrast, the question whether cancer was present in September 1995 and/or December 1996 involves the Court making a finding of fact on the balance of probabilities as to what was in fact the case.  In reaching that decision the Court is both entitled and bound to have regard to all relevant evidence both factual and expert including in particular opinions of the experts informed by the benefit of hindsight.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">I confess to having found this a formidably difficult task for at least four principal reasons.  First and foremost both parties were able to point to unusual aspects of the other side’s case which meant that if true the case would be highly unusual.  Thus it is inescapable that both if there was cancer present and if there was not cancer present certain events or phenomena must have occurred which would not normally be expected.  Second, on a number of technical issues there were differences of opinion between experts, the resolution of which by the Court could not easily be achieved by reference to objectively ascertainable facts or criteria.  This was particularly the case with the expert pathologists, the differences between whom in no small measure was agreed to lie in a difference of interpretation of what they saw in the biopsies. Since such subjective interpretation is based on years of training practice experience and expertise on the part of the pathologists, the Court is not well equipped to resolve such differences.  Third, the underlying issue of whether there was cancer present in 1995 and/or 1996 was approached by both sides by reference to more than one area of medical expertise.  In particular there was expert evidence from pathologists as to what was visible on the two biopsies and what inferences could be drawn therefrom.  In addition, there was evidence from the oncologists as to the inherent probabilities as to whether the 2001 cancer was a new radiogenic primary cancer or a recurrent or persistent cancer and the inherent probabilities of whether there was a recurrent or persistent cancer present in 1995 and/or 1996. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">The matter was further complicated by the fact that there was some degree of overlap between both sets of issues in two senses: first in  varying degrees some of the experts in one discipline, in informing their opinions relied on what they had read and/or heard of the evidence of experts in the other discipline.  Second insofar as within each area of expertise either party was able to point to unusual features of the other side’s case, the task of reaching an overall conclusion on whether on the balance of probabilities cancer was present in 1995 and/or 1996 was rendered even more complicated.  The analogy of playing several games of chess at the same time springs to mind.  Fourth, SPCC of the tongue is a rare form of cancer.  As a result a feature of the literature is that studies and papers tend to be based on comparatively small populations so that caution needs to be exercised in considering whether statistically reliable propositions can be safely extrapolated from them. A further consequence was that none of the experts had a great deal of personal experience of observing and treating SPCC of the tongue.  Added to this is the further complication that BT as a treatment for tongue cancer has apparently fallen largely out of fashion since it was used on Mrs Manning in 1994, with the result again that both literature on and individual experience on the part of the experts with the consequences of BT is necessarily limited.  </p>

Finally, while of course bearing in mind that the burden of proof falls on the claimant, the Court must eschew the temptation to avoid the discipline of seeking to explore the complex strands of argument and evidence and deciding difficult questions of fact by throwing up its hand and deciding that the very difficulties of the case dictate the inevitable conclusion that the Court cannot be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the Claimant’s case has been proved.  Such a conclusion, if justified, should be arrived at only after, rather than instead of, the undoubtedly difficult task of seeking to resolve the various issues with which the Court is confronted. </p>

However, although there were significant differences of view between the pathology experts not only on issues related to negligence but also on whether on the balance of probabilities there actually was cancer present in September 1995 and/or December 1996, on Mr Grace QC’s primary case there is a preliminary issue which is largely independent of an assessment of what the biopsies showed and which, if decided in Mr Manning’s favour, leads to the inevitable conclusion that there was indeed cancer in both September 1995 and December 1996.  </p>

Indeed in some of the answers he gave to the questions in the agenda for the joint meeting between him and Dr Plowman, the oncologist called by Mr Manning, Dr Barley cited the fact that the 2001 carcinoma was not in the same site as the 1993 carcinoma as a reason supporting his view that the 2001 carcinoma was more likely to have been a new primary than a recurrence.  At the trial, initially Dr Barley maintained this assertion.  However in cross-examination, having accepted that it was based in part on an error on his part in interpreting one of the clinical records in 2001, he changed his position.  He was shown Professor Langdon’s note of 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2001 which recorded the nodule as being on the left lateral tongue adjacent to lower left 7 tooth i.e. the site of the original 1993 tumour, and accepted that, on the assumption that what was subsequently excised in February 2001 was as there described, it was in the site of the original.  Having previously agreed that second primary cancers carcinomas tend to occur in the penumbra rather than the same site of the original carcinoma, he accepted that the February 2001 carcinoma was not in the penumbra.  Dr Barley was then shown Professor Langdon’s request for biopsy in February 2001 which referred to a “firm non-ulcerated nodule at the site of the primary” and accepted that Professor Langdon would be not just the best person to know where the February 2001 carcinoma was, but the only person on the basis that he alone was there.  Having thus accepted that Professor Langdon’s view was preferable to his own in this respect, Dr Barley  thus went on to accept that it is likely that Professor Langdon is right and that the 2001 tumour was in the same site as the 1993 tumour and that on the balance of probabilities that is where it was.  He went on to accept that not only the 2001 admitted carcinoma but also the September 1995 and December 1996 ulcers (which he did not accept were carcinomas) were at the same site as the original 1993 carcinoma.  </p>

In evidence in chief he was referred to Mr Brown’s evidence that one of the three factors which he said supported his view that it was a recurrence, was that it was at the same site.  Asked if the fact that it was at the same site only supports recurrent cancer or whether it could also support primary cancer, Mr Watt-Smith answered that it supports both theories.  He said that a new primary after RT will not usually occur at the centre where the lethal dose of radiation was but at the edge of the penumbra.  This answer was not altogether clear in that he did not explicitly state whether by the edge of the penumbra he meant a different site from the original carcinoma or the same site.  The implication of his answer that a second primary in the same site supports both theories was that he regarded the edge of the penumbra as the same site.  However, he did not in terms seek to resile from his agreement, to which I have referred,  in the joint report, that if the new tumour is of similar pathological type and occurring at the same site of the former cancer it is likely to be a recurrence. </p>

When it was put to him in cross-examination that expert evidence for Mr Manning had been that you would not expect to find a new primary on the same site as the original tumour, Mr Watt-Smith answered that if it is radiation induced it would be within the field of the radiation.  He then said that if it was the case that the 2001 carcinoma was found on the same site as the 1993 one, it was his evidence that that could just as well be a new primary as a recurrence of the original.

At trial he expanded on those answers.  In evidence in chief he said that he believed that the 2001 cancer was a recurrence in a less well differentiated form of the original carcinoma because it was in the same place.  Referring to his answer in the joint report he said that recurrences of earlier tumours are located within 2 cm of the originally mapped tumour. They might not be in the epicentre of where the original tumour was but if they occurred slightly away from the centre it would only be insignificantly away.  In the case of Mrs Manning he believed that the 2001 tumour was within 2 cm of the 1993 tumour.  Shown the reference in Professor Langdon’s biopsy request form of 27 February 2001 to “?  a non-ulcerative nodule at site of primary” Dr Plowman said: “If he says that, then it was the site of the primary.”  </p>

In the course of that cross-examination he accepted that, although the absence might be explicable by sampling errors, one would have expected to find some CK positive cells in the 1995 and 1996 biopsies.  However in re-examination he confirmed that this did not change his view that on the balance of probabilities there was cancer present in 1995 and 1996.  The first two reasons he gave were the fact that the 2001 carcinoma was in the same site as the original and the fact that in 2001 it presented as a carcinoma rather than a sarcoma. (I refer to this latter point below.)  He repeated his opinion that second radiogenic primaries occur in the penumbra outside the high dose radiation zone and not within 2 cm of the original primary tumour.  He said he strongly disagreed with the suggestion that there is no difference in terms of anatomical location between recurrent and new radiotherapy induced primary cancer.  Recurrent carcinomas would occur within 2 cm of the irradiated original primary whereas new radiogenic primary carcinomas would occur in the penumbra of the irradiated zone and not within 2 cm.  With Mrs Manning, the carcinoma in 2001 as well as those in 1995 and 1996 (if, as he believed, that is what they were) were consistent with recurrent carcinomas because they were in the same site as the original 1993 primary.  This was the case in his view even though by the latter stages of the 2001 recurrence the tumour subsequently spread more widely.  </p>

However, while it is true to say that the Schwartz formulation did not exclude the possibility of a second primary occurring within 2 cm from the original, there is nothing in the paper to indicate that any of the second primaries in that study did in fact occur within 2 cm from the original.  Further and more fundamentally Dr Plowman emphasised that the Schwartz paper was talking about second spontaneous metachronous head and neck carcinomas, as distinct from radiogenic induced cancers, which it is the defendant’s case that Mrs Manning had in 2001.  A metachronous carcinoma Dr Plowman defined as a similar carcinoma occurring within the same general region but not necessarily at the same site.  Although metachronous second primaries could include radiation induced carcinomas, Dr Plowman said that largely they did not.  They were largely concerned with the phenomenon of older people with poor oral hygiene who smoke and drink a lot and the Indian population which he serves in East London who chew a lot of betel nuts and are pre-disposed to get multiple oral cancers at different places. Dr Plowman was emphatic that the Schwartz paper was irrelevant to the question whether the site of the 2001 carcinoma made it more likely to be a recurrence than a new primary.  </p>

He did not agree that metachronous tumours tend to occur in the same site as the original primary and did not consider that the Schwartz paper proved that they do.  He said that he was sure that the table relied on by Ms Mishcon in the Schwartz paper did not as a matter of inference show that the second primaries referred to therein were occurring in exactly the same site as the original cancer.  As he pointed out, the site of the second cancers in that table were loosely and generally defined as oral cavity, head and neck and oral cavity and oropharynx. </p>

That is your first point:  that he is not talking about radiation induced primaries but secondly, even if it was a spontaneous rather than a radiation induced second primary, it still does not tell you anything because the head and neck category in table 4 is much wider?  A.  Yes, if we take radiation out of it and say this lady would be at risk for getting a second cancer of the head and neck in that site, I am arguing because she doesn’t have the five risk factors it is not really relevant.  Even if she were part of this population, that table 4 as to the site of the second cancer is very vague and I am sure that does not infer that they were occurring in exactly the same site as the original cancer.  If you then take radiation back into the equation, I am making the point that actually radiation induced cancers often occur on the periphery of the high dosed zone, exit and entry corridors because there is an element of overkill ….. rather than in the epicentre of the high dose zone.  Q.  Unlike in Mrs Manning’s case?  A. Unlike, as I understand it, in Mrs Manning’s case, yes.  That is not absolute but in general terms radiation induced cancers often occur on the periphery of the high dose zone rather than in the centre and with a latency of greater than six to seven years.”  </p>

He said that the Schwartz table did not at all show that second metachronous tumours occurred at the same site as the original.  In relation to radiogenic second primaries Dr Plowman said this:  “… when the invasion was irradiated by Dr Henk there would have been a portal coming in from the left side of the face and a portal coming in from the front of the left side of the face.  The portal which is coming in on the left side of the face does not stop when it reaches the tongue; it goes on exiting through the right side of the face; the one at the front exits at the back.  It is not uncommon for the second cancer to arise, if it arises, in the lower dosed zone, say the other cheek or something.  Q.  Are you talking about a recurrence or a new primary?  A.  A new primary.  Q.  You have also got the brachytherapy pins, of course, in the left.  A.  Yes, but that, funnily enough, reduces the chance of getting a second cancer there.  It is more common to get the second cancers in the lower dose surrounding area than in the very high dose.  There is a sort of overkill there.  …..”.  </p>

This was a significant concession, as it seemed to me, because in the light of the overwhelming evidence that the site of the 2001 carcinoma was the same as the September 1995 and December 1996 lesions, by parity of reasoning, the logic of this part of Dr Barley’s evidence is that, based on location, the 2001 carcinoma was more likely to have been a recurrence than a new radiogenic primary.  </p>

The first was evidence given by Professor Speight in cross-examination on what he described as the biological principle of the shifting penumbra Ms Mishcon’s submission was that Professor Speight “explained that RT would create a crater in the tongue and that the cells at the margins of the crater would give rise to new epithelium which would migrate across the whole as part of the healing process.  If the cells at the margin had been damaged by radiation, those damaged cells would end up at the exact site of the original tumour.”  Professor Speight described the principle as follows:</p>

Professor Speight did not suggest that he had any first hand experience of such a phenomenon. Doctor Barley said that he too had never seen such a case.  Nor was it within his area of expertise.  In my judgment, ignoring for the moment all the other factors relating to the issue whether Mrs Manning’s 2001 carcinoma was recurrent or a new primary, Professor Speight’s evidence on the shifting penumbra went little further than establishing that it is not a scientific impossibility for a second primary to appear on the same site as an earlier carcinoma.

As discussed below, another of the principal reasons given by both Mr Brown and Dr Plowman for their conclusion that the 2001 carcinoma was more probably a recurrence than a second primary is the conclusion that in early 2001 Mrs Manning’s epithelium was intact.  If that is right, the shifting penumbra argument would appear to fall away completely as an answer to Mr Brown’s and Dr Plowman’s first reason for concluding that the 2001 carcinoma was not a second radiogenic primary. </p>

The first part of his answer explicitly stated that if the tumour occurs at the same site it is a recurrence (as distinct from a second primary) and it may well be that in the second half of his answer Professor Sloan was not seeking to suggest that it is possible to have a second primary in the same site, in the technical and very specific and limited sense in which Mr Brown, Dr Plowman and Dr Barley were using it.  Indeed he did not in terms say that it is a biological possibility that a second primary tumour could occur in the same site.  In fact Professor Sloan went on to say that he thought that it was more likely that the 2001 carcinoma was a continuum or recurrence than a new primary, having regard to what would otherwise be the two coincidences that in 1995 and 1996 Mrs Manning had two lesions which each had cells which were highly suspicious for spindle cell carcinoma and then went on in 2001 to develop a second primary carcinoma which just happened to be a spindle cell carcinoma.

Dr Plowman said that if the 2001 tumour was a radiogenic second primary then on balance he would have expected it to be a sarcoma rather than a carcinoma.  Radiation induced second cancers he said are more commonly, although not always, sarcomas.  It would be unusual to have a second primary carcinoma induced by radiation.  Mr Watt-Smith in cross-examination volunteered the opinion that the vast majority, 90% odd, of radiation induced primary cancers are sarcomas. Doctor Barley in cross-examination said that he agreed with Mr Watt-Smith and added  that a radiation induced SPCC of the tongue would be a very rare event. Plainly, although by no means determinative, this is a factor pointing strongly against the probability of the 2001 carcinoma having been a new radiogenic primary. </p>

In her written reply submissions her response on this point was to refer to the fact that all 59 of the cases in the Ellis and Corio study, 13 of which had had prior irradiation and all 20 of the cases in the Leventon study, 6 of which had had prior irradiation, were SPCC and not sarcomas.  She submitted that there is no evidence in those papers that they were dealing with recurrences. This raises an issue which is of considerable importance in the context of the important question of the timescale in which recurrences and new primary carcinomas occur.  On that issue, as we shall see, both sides placed great reliance on the statistical findings in the Ellis and Corio paper. For reasons which I shall explain when dealing with that issue I accept Dr Plowman’s interpretation of the statistics in that paper relating to the time lag in the case of post-radiation spindle cell carcinomas between the date of irradiation and the date of diagnosis.  That interpretation is that those cases were in fact cases in which the patient had already suffered a prior carcinoma for which he or she was being treated by radiotherapy.  Thus the carcinomas whose dates of diagnosis were recorded in the Ellis and Corio paper were probably recurrent carcinomas and not new primary carcinomas.  It follows from that finding that in the current context the Ellis and Corio statistics do not assist Ms Mishcon.  I do not consider that the Leventon paper provides a basis upon which to reject the clear evidence of Mr Watt-Smith for the defendants and Mr Brown for Mr Manning who agreed with each other on this topic.  It was in any event not suggested to Mr Brown in cross-examination that his evidence on this point must be wrong by reason of either the Ellis and Corio or the Leventon paper.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">The first main reason given by Mr Brown in his expert report for concluding that the 2001 carcinoma was a true recurrence of the December 1993 carcinoma was the appearance of the mass in the April 2001 MRI scan which he said shows a tumour arising in the depth of the tongue rather than the mucosal surface.  In an agreed report on Mrs Manning’s MRI scans of January 1995, April 2001 and January 2002 Dr Lewis-Jones, an expert consultant radiologist, interpreted the 26 April 2001 MRI scan as showing an intermediate to low signal mass extending up to the mid line involving the anterior and middle of the tongue and concluded that it showed a tumour measuring approximately 2 x 2.8 centimetres in diameter.  In evidence in chief Mr Brown said that the MRI scan led him to interpret the 2001 carcinoma as a recurrent disease because it showed a mass which had arisen deep to the mucosa whereas because all squamous cell and spindle cell carcinomas are mucosa diseases you would generally expect a new disease to arise in the mucosa.  He said that in the 2001 scans there is clearly a mass which most people would interpret as recurrent disease both because the tumour was a mass deep in the tissues and not actually visible and because there was intact mucosa in the mouth.  If it had been a new primary you would see an abnormality in the mucosa, an ulcer, an exophytic growth or cancer.  He would expect there to be a visible ulcer affecting the mucosa.  By contrast a mass measured 2.8 centimetres by Dr Lewis-Jones, which Mr Brown described as quite thick, which you cannot see clinically,  must be deep in the tissue and therefore likely to be a recurrence.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">In evidence in chief  Mr Watt-Smith was asked to comment on the fact that one of the reasons given by Mr Brown as supporting his theory of recurrence rather than  a new radiogenic primary was that there was a 2.8 centimetre mass seen on the MRI scan which must be deep in the tissue and therefore likely to be a recurrence. He first said that he agreed with Mr Brown, adding that the majority of surgeons would say, based on its location, that the tumour probably developed deep as a recurrence. But he then went on to volunteer the suggestion that an alternative explanation for the clinical evidence which would be consistent with it being a new primary rather than recurrent was that it could be budding off epithelium or migration of epithelium.  However it was clear from what he said that he was basing this on evidence he had heard in court from Professor Sloan and when asked if he was in a position to say how likely it is that the large mass which Mr Brown said must be deep in the tissue and therefore likely to be a recurrence was caused by migrating epithelium and whether that fell within his expertise, he answered: “probably not.”  This was, regrettably not the only occasion when Mr Watt-Smith appeared to advance arguments supportive of the Defendants’ case in respect of matters actually or apparently outside his field of expertise.  I do not believe that it was put to Mr Brown that he was wrong to rely on the MRI appearance as a reason for concluding that the 2001 carcinoma was probably a recurrence by reference to Mr Watt-Smith’s suggestion of “budding epithelium” as an explanation for it.  </p>

However Mr Watt-Smith went on to comment that because the tumour was 2.8 centimetres “the other side of this coin, or the other end of the diameter, does put it in the deep aspect, it is nearly 3 centimetres away.”  This referred to a passage in the MRI report which said that the abnormal signal extended to the floor of the mouth.  Mr Watt-Smith also accepted that in January and February there was no ulceration and the mucosa was intact (a point to which I refer below).  Critically after both bits of evidence to which I have referred it was again put to Mr Watt-Smith that it would appear to the majority of surgeons and in particular to Mr Brown that this looks like a deep recurrence on the MRI and Mr Watt-Smith again confirmed that he did not challenge Mr Brown’s view on that and that he agreed with Mr Brown’s interpretation that this looks like a recurrence.  Thus his earlier answer about the tumour being close to the ulcer was plainly taken into account by Mr Watt-Smith and did not affect his agreement with Mr Brown’s interpretation.</p>

The clinical notes of Professor Langdon’s examination on 15 January 2001 record that there was no ulceration and Dr Henk’s letter to Professor Langdon reporting on his examination of Mrs Manning the following day reported that: “the appearance of the tongue is very much as I remember it from last year.”  Neither document refers expressly or by implication to any sign of a breached mucosa.  On the contrary both are inconsistent with any such signs.  Dr Henk’s reference to the appearance of the tongue being very much as he remembered it from the previous year is a reference to his review of Mrs Manning on 16 June 2000 which is recorded in his letter to Dr Harrop-Griffiths on the same day: “She remains well.  There is no sign of recurrent carcinoma of the tongue and she has no cervical lymphadenopathy.”  It was accepted in the course of the trial by Ms Mishcon on behalf of the defendants that the carcinoma was present in January 2001 and she did not seek to argue that the mucosa was not intact at that time.  </p>

And, as I think he remembered it, six months or so before he had last seen her, that is the effect. A. Certainly he has issued a report in January saying that.  Q.

So there has to be some form of breach or polypoid outgrowth expressant, or some sort of abnormality of the epithelium for a carcinoma to arise.</p>

Professor Sloan expressed the opinion that  “the fact that the tumour was growing beneath intact mucosa (‘sub-mucosal’) is against the spindle cell carcinoma being a new primary tumour growing from clinically abnormal surface epithelium.  The features described by Dr Henk are consistent with the view that a slowly growing recurrent carcinoma was present in the deeper tissues.

He said that there were two distinct components, an area of radiation damaged fibrous tissue and a deeper aspect showing very different features with plump spindle and kite-shaped cells as well as atypical mitotic figures and spindle cells forming distinct fascicles.  He confirmed in his evidence that he could see no connection between the tumour cells deeper in the biopsy and the epithelium on the surface.

While he did say that there was a clear association between the carcinoma and the overlying epithelium in the June 2001 biopsy he also accepted that by reason of the February 2001 biopsy there had been by the time of the June 2001 biopsy a clear passage for the tumour to reach the surface if it had been lying deep and that that was a possible explanation for the connection which he found in June.

So there has to be a time when the tumour is present before the epithelium is breached.

It seems to me that there are two significant problems with it.  First it assumes that when what we now know to be the tumour was biopsied at the end of February 2001 it was an early biopsy, whereas it was common ground between the parties that the tumour was present from at least November 2000 when Mrs Manning complained of severe pain in her ear.  Indeed Professor Speight himself did not suggest that in February 2001 the tumour was early and was unable when asked when he thought the tumour started to do more than give a “guesstimate” of somewhere round about September/ October 2000, which would have made the tumour 5-6 months old by the time it was biopsied in February 2001 with the mucosa still intact.  Professor Langdon accepted that pain radiating to the ear is suggestive of a carcinoma invading the lingual nerve which was one of the reasons for him repeating biopsies in 2001. If, as seems not unreasonable on all the evidence, notwithstanding Dr Barley’s suggestion to the contrary, the extreme pain experienced by Mrs Manning in November 2000 was indeed caused by the tumour invading the lingual nerve, that in turn would suggest that it may very well (even on the hypothesis that it was a new primary) have been present growing in the connective tissue for some time before invading the lingual nerve. </p>

Mr Brown in his evidence on the April 2001 MRI scan said that when the tumour presented in 2001 it was T4.  Indeed one of the reasons he gave for concluding that the tumour was recurrent was that a T4 that had developed as a new primary would have almost certainly been ulcerated and he had never seen a T4 of that size in the tongue without an ulcer that was not recurrent.  A T4 in the tongue arising as a new primary cancer would normally have extensive ulcerations.  By contrast where a tumour arises as a primary rather than a recurrent one normally sees more of the tumour than the scan shows.  Tumours that become ulcerated do not necessarily show up very obviously on a scan and a T1 will often be reported as a normal scan because it is very much on the surface. </p>

I have already referred to Dr Plowman’s evidence that, quite apart from the defendant’s concession that the tumour was already present in January 2001 and indeed in November 2000, his reason for concluding that it was present in January 2001 was that the April 2001 MRI scan showed a definite abnormality which was too large to have arisen between January 2001 and April 2001.  Indeed he said given the size of the tumour in April 2001 (2.0 x 2.8 cm) it would have been impossible with a tumour of that size for it not to have been present in January 2001.</p>

Professor Speight’s scenario assumes that for a certain length of time before the carcinoma ulcerates it grows down from the bottom of the epithelium into the underlying connective tissue and that for some time it may have spread laterally underneath the epithelium.  The proposition that as the carcinoma gets bigger the epithelium begins to lift to produce a nodule again presupposes that both at the time that it lifts to produce a nodule and for some time before that it has been present underneath the epithelium, since otherwise it would not be pushing the epithelium up.  Not only was there no evidential support for such a proposition in Mrs Manning’s case, on the contrary it was contradicted by all the evidence to which I have referred, in particular Mr Brown’s evidence based on the MRI scan that the tumour was growing deep in the tissue and the evidence of all the pathologists including Professor Speight that at the time of the biopsy at the end of February 2001, when there was indeed a small nodule there was no connection between the epithelium and the tumour.  When this point was put in terms by Mr Grace QC to Professor Speight he accepted explicitly that there was no connection between the epithelium and the top of the tumour that was evident deep on that biopsy.  </p>

Coupled with the fact that Professor Speight only described the dysplastic epithelium as moderate and the fact that neither Dr Harrison nor Professor Johnson found epithelial dysplasia in 2001 and indeed in August 2001 Professor Johnson expressly stated that there was no epithelial dysplasia, he invited the court on the basis of that evidence to find insofar as it is necessary to make a decision on the point that there was no, or no significant, epithelial dysplasia in February 2001.  His second point was that both Dr Plowman and Mr Brown convincingly refuted any suggestion that the allegedly dysplastic epithelium demonstrated an epithelial origin to the tumour on the basis that dysplasia can be wholly innocent and is not malignancy and was not related or connected to the 2001 tumour, dysplasia being a reversible phenomenon.  </p>

Nor did he accept that the dysplasia [if there was any] was related to the cancer.  Dysplasia he said is not the same as cancer: it is a reversible phenomenon.  As he put it it has not crossed the Rubicon to cancer and may never cross the Rubicon to be cancer.  He said that dysplasia is not uncommon post radiation in a situation where it does not progress to a new primary.  Commenting on the paragraph in Professor Speight’s report referring to moderate dysplasia he said that he believed that there was a disconnect between the dysplasia referred to by Professor Speight and the area in the deep aspect suspicious for spindle cell malignancy.  </p>

I am not particularly impressed by that evidence both because it is common ground between the parties that Dr Harrison and Professor Johnson were negligent in resect of their February, June and August 2001 biopsies and because in relation to what Professor Johnson wrote about the August 2001 biopsy it is pertinent to note that Professor Sloan refers to “partially ulcerated surface epithelium” in his examination of that biopsy and in any event he records in relation to the June 2001 biopsy that one of the slides showed a completely ulcerated surface. By definition the June 2001 biopsy preceded the August one. As to the difference between the reports of Professor Sloan and Dr Woolgar one the one hand and Professor Speight on the other, unlike the minute attention to detail in their respective cross-examinations on the 1995 and 1996 slides, this was not a matter which attracted much if any attention in their cross-examinations. The court has thus little to go on in forming a judgment as to which view is correct. However it does not seem to me that it is necessary for Mr Grace QC’s purpose that there should be a positive finding that there was no epithelial dysplasia in February 2001. </p>

Their opinions on this point were clearly very strongly held and I found their evidence persuasive. By contrast Professor Speight’s evidence on this point was largely theoretical. It was not supported by the evidence in relation to how Mrs Manning presented in January and February 2001 and as an explanation for why there was intact mucosa if this was a second primary it was inconsistent with the evidence of the MRI scan and Mr Brown’s interpretation of that. While, of course, never forgetting that the overall burden of proving that there was cancer present in 1995 and/or 1996 lay on Mr Manning as Claimant, the reality of the position on this particular aspect of Professor Speight’s evidence as it seems to me is that if, as I find below, the presence of intact mucosa is <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie </span>inconsistent with and makes it highly unlikely that there could be a new primary carcinoma, one would need compelling evidence before concluding that such an unlikely event occurred in this case by reference to a theoretical argument. </p>

It is also on its face inconsistent with the fact, accepted by Professor Speight, that in February 2001 there was no connection between the epithelium and the malignancy in the deeper aspect. This “early carcinoma” theory was raised by Professor Speight for the first time in re-examination and was thus not put to Dr Plowman or Mr Brown. It is to be inferred from the emphatic nature of their evidence on the intact mucosa point that it is a theory which they either assumed could have no application in this case or with which they did not agree. </p>

It will be recalled that Professor Speight accepted that in order for it to be possible for there to be a new primary carcinoma on the same site by reason of the shifting epithelium there would have to be a breach in the mucosa because one would have by definition a carcinoma arising from the epithelium. There was no such breach, the mucosa being intact and it would seem to follow that if the “early carcinoma” theory is disregarded Professor Speight’s shifting epithelium explanation for the carcinoma being present on the same site must likewise fall away.  </p>

The third point was accepted by the Defendants own expert surgeon,. Mr Watt-Smith, who also accepted the first point. On the first two points the evidence of Dr Plowman and Mr Brown was very emphatic and very persuasive. Overall both Mr Brown and Dr Plowman were very strongly of the view, taking into account not just these three points but the overall picture including many if not all of the remaining points to which I refer below, that it is more likely that the 2001 carcinoma was a recurrence than that it was a new primary. In this they disagreed with Dr Barley and Mr Watt-Smith (although even Dr Barley agreed that a finding that the 2001 carcinoma was a new radiogenic primary would require building rarity upon rarity. He accepted that it would be very rare to have a new radiogenic primary cancer in the tongue , even rarer for it to be in the same site as the original and yet rarer still for it to be a carcinoma rather than a sarcoma).</p>

I have already referred to the impression that Mr Watt-Smith gave of being ready to volunteer opinions in areas outside his actual or apparent area of expertise. Mr Grace QC suggested that his trawling of the Internet in search of material to support the Defendant’s case both supported that impression and suggested a tendency, no doubt unwitting, to stray into the territory of advocate rather than expert witness. It was certainly noticeable that, unlike Professor Speight for example, Mr Watt-Smith often seemed reluctant to accept propositions which he was ultimately forced to accept of which in my view were correct and/or when accepting such points often to volunteer by way of addition, answers to questions which he had not been asked which appeared to support the Defendants’ case. Doctor Barley was a careful and meticulous witness who I have no doubt was doing his best to assist the court. I was however left with the impression that perhaps because he believed in the Defendants’ case, he was somewhat inflexible in his answers and reluctant to concede points which on their merits were persuasive. </p>

He now sees six to ten cases of oral cancer a year but sits in the multi-disciplinary team meeting which discusses more such cases and sees 100 a year.

They were  (1) the appearance of the mass in the MRI scan (April 2001) which shows a tumour arising in the depth of the tongue rather than the mucosal surface. (2) The comments on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2001 in which the tongue is reported as unchanged from the year before. This confirms that the tumour did not arise in the mucosa essential for a new primary disease. (3) The similarity of the pathology specimens from 1995 until the recurrence was finally resected. (4) The fact that a spindle-cell carcinoma is a variant of squamous cell carcinoma often associated with previous radiotherapy treatment. (5) The literature reported by Professor Sloan giving the incidence of late recurrence of oral cancer following the radiotherapy treatment. As was  pointed out to him in cross-examination, the third reason was based on Mr Manning’s pathology experts Professor Sloan and Dr Woolgar. At the time he wrote the report he had of course not yet read Professor Speight’s reports. In re-examination he confirmed that his first and second reasons did not depend on the opinions of the pathology experts. Even leaving out of account their views, it remained Mr Brown’s view that: “Basically the appearance on the scan, the fact that it did not breach the mucosa, the fact that it is arising deep in the tissues would indicate that it is a recurrence, and the same site would indicate it is a recurrence…  Q – So based on mass in the MRI scan, intact mucosa, and same site alone your view remains that on the balance of probabilities it is more likely to be recurrence than a new primary?  A – Yes I think so.”  </p>

When asked in evidence how it would affect his view of the probabilities as between recurrent and a new primary if it is the case that all three pathology experts are of the view that there were cells highly suspicious of SPCC but Professor Speight stopped short of saying in retrospect that they were, he confirmed: “It does not make it quite as clear cut, but it does not change my overall conclusion.” Like Mr Brown it will be recalled that he was emphatic when expressing the view that it was “most unlikely” that the mucosa would not be breached if it was a new primary and that if the epithelium is intact and you have got cancer going on down below which is what he said it was, it argues very strongly that this was not a new primary. Particularly striking was his evidence that if tumour was present in January 2001 when the epithelium was intact it would be difficult to think of a mechanism as to how it could happen that that was a new primary. </p>

Doctor Plowman in cross examination expressed the view that the 2001 carcinoma was far more likely to be a recurrence than a new radiogenic primary because it was too soon to be the latter. Based on the incidence of radiogenic second primaries in data drawn from Nagasaki, Hiroshima and Chernobyl he said that solid radiogenic tumours start to occur after 6 or 7 years, usually more than 10 years. This was, if anything, more favourable to the Defendants than the evidence of Mr Watt-Smith who said that the generally accepted time for radiation induced sarcomas, which he teaches medical students,  would be closer to 10 years after radiation so that 7 years would be unusually early for a radiogenic sarcoma. Although he suggested that carcinomas and sarcomas behaved differently he did not elaborate on what if any implications he considered that to have on the relevance of his 10 year figure. In her written closing submissions Ms Mishcon submitted that if there were no SPCC between 1994 and 2001 the SPCC which should have diagnosed in February 2001 would almost exactly match the mean interval of 6.9 years from irradiation to diagnosis identified in the Ellis and Corio paper which she submitted makes it more likely that it was a new primary.</p>

The time interval from irradiation to diagnosis of spindle-cell carcinoma ranged from 1.5 to 10 years, with a mean of 6.9 years.” The paper added: “No significant findings as to personal habits, such as smoking, alcohol intake or occupation, of the patients could be gained from the available information.” Although 13 patients is not a very large sample, the mean figure of 6.9 years bears a striking similarity to the 7 years between Mrs Manning’s first carcinoma in December 1993 and the carcinoma that should have been diagnosed in February 2001. On its face, therefore, if the carcinomas suffered by these 13 patients were first time radiogenic carcinomas, the 6.9 year figure would strongly support the inference that Mrs Manning’s February 2001 carcinoma was a new radiogenic primary and not a recurrence. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">However when these figures were put to Dr Plowman, his response was that the Ellis and Corio figures supported his conclusion, namely that the February 2001 carcinoma was a recurrence rather than a primary. His reasoning was that the 1.5 year figure at the bottom of the Ellis and Corio spectrum argued strongly against the carcinomas of the 13 patients referred to in that part of the study being new spindle-cell carcinomas. That is because whereas 1.5 years falls squarely within the 2 year period after an original carcinoma in which the large majority of recurrent carcinomas occur, it is massively below the usual 10 years+ to be expected for radiogenic primaries. Further the inference that these 13 carcinomas were in fact recurrences was strongly supported by the fact that Dr Plowman could think of no other reason why they should have had radiation treatment to their mouth in the first place unless it was to treat an existing cancer.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment Dr Plowman’s reasoning is compelling. The fact that the 1.5 year figure is very unlikely to have been a new radiogenic carcinoma suggests at the very least that some of the 13 carcinomas must have been recurrent. It follows that, again at the very least, the 6.9 year mean figure is very unlikely to represent the mean for new radiogenic primaries. The additional inferred fact that all 13 of the patients are likely to have had a previous carcinoma coupled with the fact that 1.5 years falls within the classic period in which recurrences are to be expected suggests that if any reliable inference is to be drawn from the 13 patients it is that they were all examples of recurrent carcinomas in respect of which the mean period between the first carcinoma (which is likely to have occurred shortly before the irradiation) and the second recurrent carcinoma was 6.9 years. That inference would of course strongly support the argument that Mrs Manning’s February 2001 carcinoma was probably a recurrent rather than a new primary one. </p>

Reference has already been made to the Schwartz study of 851 patients with initial squamous cell carcinoma of various parts of the head and neck. The study found that a 22% incidence of second metachronous cancers in 5 years. However, a univariate analysis of different factors influencing metachronous cancer incidence revealed that in respect of each of the 5 factors analysed Mrs Manning had a considerably lower risk than average. Thus the risk of developing a second cancer measured by site of the first primary ranged from  45.5% for the base of the tongue to as low as 9.5% for the mobile tongue where, where Mrs Manning’s 1993 carcinoma was diagnosed. The risk for females was 15.6% as against 29% for males. The risk for those under 40 was 20.3% and against 26.8% for 40 to 50 year olds, 38.2% for 50 to 60 year olds and 17.8% for over 60s. The figures in respect of non-smokers and non-drinkers are particularly striking. Thus the risk for non-smokers was 2.8% compared to 25.9% for those smoking up to 20 packs a year, 41.8% for those smoking 20 to 40 packs a year and 29.8% for those smoking more than 40 packs a year. The risk for non-drinkers was 4.6% compared to 30% for drinkers. It is of interest that the background to the study was a desire to improve the survival of head and neck cancer patients by devising an effective programme of screening for second malignancies. The authors of the study concluded that “ only the mall sub-set of non-smokers and non-drinkers should be excluded from such trials.”  </p>

In the draft joint oncologists’ report following the meeting between Dr Plowman and Dr Barley, Dr Barley repeated what he had said in his report adding his opinion that, having had one head and neck cancer, Mrs Manning had a significantly increased risk of developing a second primary cancer of the head and neck. Doctor Plowman in their draft statement noted that Mrs Manning was a non-smoking wife of a dentist by which he inferred good oral hygiene and did not think that she had the risk factors for metachronous carcinomas of the head and neck- particularly as she was in her late 30s- that are represented by the population studied in the Schwartz paper.</p>

He pointed out that the patients studied in the Schwartz paper had been the usual type of squamous cell carcinoma head and neck carcinoma patients where there is a preponderance of smoking, drinking, poor oral hygiene and usual advance stage and actually statistically male sex too. Since Mrs Manning had none of those characteristics Dr Plowman said that she was not in as high a risk bracket by a long way as those quoted in the Schwartz paper. When asked to put a figure on it he said it would be at most 1 to 2%. Doctor Barley in re-examination accepted that when you take into account Mrs Manning’s particulars she had a lower percentage risk of developing a second primary than the overall 20% figure for patients who have suffered an initial head and neck cancer revealed in the Schwartz paper.</p>

In fact it does not appear to be materially at odds with the logical implications of Dr Barley’s evidence, since added to the 6% chance of Mrs Manning developing a second primary cancer in the head and neck (which I take to be the implication of his report). He accepted that her particular characteristics meant that she had a lower risk than the 22% average in the Schwartz paper. </p>

I have already referred to the fact that both Mr Brown and Dr Plowman made clear that their opinions that the February 2001 carcinoma was probably a recurrence rather than a new radiogenic primary were not dependant on the views of the expert pathologists on the correct interpretation of the various biopsies.

Neither Professor Sloan nor Dr Woolgar in their reports suggested that it was possible on the basis of the September 1995 or December 1996 biopsy to make a positive diagnosis of carcinoma. In evidence at trial they both accepted that it was not possible to make such a positive diagnosis on the basis of the biopsies taken in isolation. Their very strong <span style="font-style:italic">ex post facto</span> conclusions that carcinoma was present on both occasions was thus dependent in no small measure on the benefit of hindsight and in particular the inferences to be drawn from what was revealed in the 2001 biopsies. Whereas looking at the September 1995 and December 1996 biopsies on their own, they were unable to go further that saying that they were highly suspicious of carcinoma, in their view it was possible to harden mere suspicion, albeit a high level of suspicion, into a positive conclusion that cancer was present by reason of (a) a pattern of increasing busyness cellularity as between the three biopsies and (b) the similarity of certain features in the three biopsies and the unlikelihood of such similarities being merely the result of coincidence, especially given the very rare nature of SPCC. </p>

But to the extent that their opinion on cancer being present in 1995 and 1996 is based on the coincidence factor, it would be over simplistic to cite their conclusion as a free-standing ground for concluding that the 2001 carcinoma was recurrent. That would be to beg the question whether their conclusion that cancer was present in September 1995 and/or December 1996 is correct or whether Professor Speight’s conclusion that it was not is correct. </p>

Taken on its own this factor would go no further than raising a serious question and demanding the closest of scrutiny of the other available evidence. However taken together with all the other factors which quite independently point strongly against the possibility of a new radiogenic primary in 2001 as being inherently highly unlikely if not scientifically impossible, the consideration that if it was indeed a wholly new cancer it would be a remarkable coincidence that a very rare form of carcinoma happened to have similar morphological features to what were in fact wholly innocent cells in 1995 and 1996 is in my judgment a very powerful factor. Just as this coincidence factor seems to me a legitimate factor to weigh in the balance when assessing the conflicting pathology expert opinions in relation to the 1995 and 1996 biopsies, so it seems to me a legitimate factor to weigh in the balance when considering the question whether the 2001 carcinoma was a recurrent or new primary one. </p>

Nor, in my view, does Dr Harrison’s amended report of 3 October 2001 take matters any further, both because he merely reproduces Professor Fisher’s conclusion verbatim and because in his own original report dated 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2001, written before he sent the biopsy to Professor Fisher for a second opinion, Dr Harrison had concluded that: “ The history indicates that there is a post-irradiation malignancy of soft tissue and severely dysplastic mucosa that have become apparent since the last of the previous biopsies in June 2001 (391/01).” I have already indicated that that revealed yet a further flawed interpretation of the earlier 2001 biopsies and in any event suggested a post-irradiation malignancy.

The first, under the heading Volume Doubling Times/Gompertzian Theory, was broadly to the effect that working backwards from April 2001, if one applies the 2 month volume doubling time to be inferred from the quadrupling of the size of the tumour between the MRI scans of 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2001 and 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> January 2002 estimated by Dr Lewis-Jones and then makes allowance for the Gompertzian theory that tumour cells grow more quickly when they are small it is unlikely that any cancer cells were present in 1996. If that is right if follows that the 2001 carcinoma must have been a new primary rather than a recurrence or persistence of a cancer already present in 1996. Ms Mishcon’s related submission was that it would have been very unusual for a carcinoma to recur twice in two years (September 1995 and December 1996) and then to lie dormant and not recur again for a further four years. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">Ms Mishcon’s first submission was based on two assumptions: first that because the inference from Dr Lewis-Jones’ evidence was that the volume doubling time of the tumour was two months in the period between April 2001 and January 2002, the tumour would, subject to the second assumption have been growing at the same volume doubling rate from inception, and second that because of the Gompertzian theory the volume doubling rate would have been shorter and the tumour would have been growing more quickly in its early stages when it was microscopic. For both propositions she relied heavily on the evidence of Dr Barley. That evidence was hotly disputed by Dr Plowman. On the first point both oncologists agreed that an average figure for tumour volume doubling time for head and neck carcinoma is about 45 days. This was based on figures in Professor Steel’s textbook of 1997. According to Dr Barley those figures showed that 90% of head and neck squamous carcinomas are within the range of 33 to 150 days. This was a topic on which Dr Plowman was extensively cross-examined.  Doctor Plowman’s fundamental and strongly held view to which I shall refer shortly was that the Gompertzian model of exponential growth with late retardant slowing in the rate of growth is not an iron law. It does not apply in every case and in particular did not apply in this case. However he had a fallback argument broadly to the effect that if one assumed that the volume doubling time of Mrs Manning’s tumour was roughly 150 days in the period between December 1996 and January 2001, i.e. at the outer end of Professor Steel’s range, it was possible for there to have been cancer cells present in 1996. He did however accept that on the balance of probabilities if one applied a two month doubling time there probably was not cancer present and that if the Gompertzian theory is right and when a tumour is very small it grows at its fastest rate, cancer was even less likely to have been present, albeit only slightly less likely because the retardation is often not great. Thus in order for cancer to be present on the balance of probabilities assuming that the Gompertzian model was applicable in this case it would be necessary for Mrs Manning’s doubling time between 1996 and 2001 to have been outside the 90% range of Professor Steel’s statistics.</p>

So you have got to look for something else.” Doctor Plowman reiterated this point more than once: “The plain fact is that the simple Gompertzian equation won’t explain late relapses in second cancers, so we have to find some other explanation. Gompertzian kinetics modelling in tumour growth does not explain late relapses and so you have to invoke other mechanisms. Gompertzian kinetic equations assume that a cell divides into two, that two divides into four, that four divides into eight over the same periodicity, but the plain fact is that that does not happen.… Q – You were asked a question whether there was an average volume doubling time and you agreed … an average figure about 45 days, confidence interval 33 to 150 days. So 45 is the median isn’t it?  A – Yes I think that is right. I put an important caveat to my argument.  Q – Yes. You point out that the average figure will not account for a minority of late overt relapses in head and neck carcinomas…… Q – You were asked the question “Are head and neck cancer doubling times constant and/or predictable?” and you say no and refer back to your previous answer.  A – I agree the average and I have agreed that the majority undoubtedly recur clinically, overt, within the first three years. But a minority recur late, that is well known. Mrs Manning, in her clinical recurrence of 7 years, was in that minority and              there we are. … Q – But most people accept the Gompertzian?  A – I agree with Steels’ book that that is the way that it is set out, and Dr Barley is absolutely right to argue that. However I hope you will accept that it does not account for the late recurrence, for example those in the Fujitsa paper. So we have to invoke another model. … I don’t think the Gompertzian model necessarily fits this situation. … the simple logarithmic growth curves do not explain late relapses. It is as simple as that. It is derived from mouse models. … the simple logarithmic growths … do not account for the very late relapses such as this. … what  [Ms Mishcon] suggests, that there was a two month doubling time throughout does not square with the fact that there was no evidence of mitotic figures on the high power field [ in the 1996 biopsy] . So there are things which do not square on either side I have to say. The logical conclusion is to reject the Gompertzian and suggest there was instability of cancer cells, and the growth rate altered as time went along.” … Q – But in fact most oncologists support the Gompertzian theory do they not?  A – No. How do you explain melanomas that remain dormant for 20 years and then quite suddenly start growing? … How do you explain a breast cancer that starts up after 25 years?... late relapses recur and therefore you cannot explain them on a doubling time of 2 months. So a cancer can be very capricious in its growth rates. …”   </p>

They were asked a series of  written questions prior to their joint meeting about volume doubling time and what if any inferences could be drawn therefrom. In particular they were asked if they agreed that had the doubling time in this case been constant the tumour volume in December 1996 (calculated by extrapolation) would be about 0.05 cubic millimetres? With the caveat that they are not experts in this area their answer was : “ We know of no accurate data that would enable retrospective calculation of tumour size over a prolonged period.”  It was also the evidence of Dr Woolgar and Professor Sloan that in their experience the rate of growth of  tumour varies within the lifetime of the tumour, probably due to genetic factors. Further the proposition that tumour growth rate inevitably slows down is not supported by the observation by Ellis and Corio (specifically in the context of  SPCC): “ Particularly noted in several cases, however, was a sudden rapid increase in the size of the tumour.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">Doctor Plowman described Gompertzian kinetics as a growth model consisting of exponential logarithmic growth where a single cell becomes two, the two become four and so on. As they get larger and their blood supply is less able to keep up with the growth of the tumour, the growth rate falls away from doubling either due to the inadequate blood supply or cell loss. Doctor Plowman’s evidence was that this model of retarded exponential growth is not a universal or iron law because various genetic malformation mutations of genes that drive tumours forward will affect growth rates. For that reason what he described as “ the rather simple logarithmic growth, Gompertzian kinetics, does not apply to many tumours and particularly ones that recur late. When asked if this latter point was just another way of saying the same thing, Dr Plowman said that it was not. In other words it is not just late recurrent tumours that are affected by genetic malformation mutations of genes which affect growth rates. “It is a way of saying that there are some tumours that do not obey these relatively simple kinetic models. We are beginning to understand why: because genetic mutations within cancer cells which are, after all, an unstable population of cells, can influence different growth rates at different times of their natural history. Q – What can influence different growth rates?  A – Mutations within what is called oncogenes, which are the genes within a cell which can drive a cancer cell into either longer survival to divide many times or accelerate growth rates.  Q – So mutations in oncogenes drive growth rates?  A – Absolutely. The relevance of that my lord is that it is not always possible to quote growth rate for, say, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck or spindle-cell carcinoma. The growth rate may well be more capricious and it could well differ at different times in the natural time.” </p>

Ms Mishcon put to him a paper by Professor Sorensen which suggested that P53 gene mutations are less frequent in squamous carcinomas occurring in non-smoking young patients who do not drink alcohol than in young smokers or in the general population. In re-examination Mr Grace QC referred him to a paper by Popovtzer which referred to the Sorensen paper but reported that: “ In contrast, <span style="font-style:italic">Regezi et al</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Atula et al</span> compared the P53 mutation, P21 rb, in young and older patients and found no significant difference and <span style="font-style:italic">Lingen et al</span> demonstrated high levels of P53 mutations among young, non-smoking patients and stated that the aetiology for the mutation in these patients is different and therefore may lead to a unique disease behaviour.  <span style="font-style:italic">Shantz et al</span> suggested that SCC in young patients is the result of an imbalance between free radical induced chromosomal damage and the inability to repair the mutational event, which is more common in younger patients, but found no definite gene abnormality characteristic in young patients.” Doctor Plowman’s response to these various papers was that this is research in progress. “P53 is by no means the only oncogene, but it is called the gatekeeper of the human genome; it is a tumour suppressant gene that stops cells from growing uncontrolled; it is a very important gene. And it is important in head and neck cancer.” He later added: “It is a controversial subject and I think I said that when I wrote it, but there is no doubt that to account for different behaviours in growth rates of cancers, one nowadays no longer looks at the Gompertzian model but one looks at the oncogenes and their driving forces for the cancer. Q – To account for different growth rates in cancer these days?  A – Yes…. I am not refuting the Gompertzian model, but one has to look at other events that occur during the natural history of a tumour which may drive it forward or alter it’s behaviour. … The simple idea of tumours going two, four, eight, sixteen, thirty two, sixty four etc is probably too facile a concept and one which certainly does not fit with, say, very late behaviour, a very late declaration of recurrences…or why some tumours metastasise and some tumours do not. So the behaviour of tumours which has just been put down to be capricious in the past is now starting to have a more understood basis. Q – As a result of the unravelling of the human gene?  A – Yes.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">Doctor Plowman’s central point was that cancer cells can vary in their growth rate at various times. The Gompertzian idea is  based on simple tumours in mouse models and in some human cancers the growth is more complex than that although the precise genetic mechanism or mechanisms by which those growth rates are affected is only beginning to be understood as a result of research into oncogenes and tumour suppressant genes. There is likely to be some genetic instability which leads to a change in growth rates of tumours at different times. In cross-examination Dr Plowman rejected a suggestion put to him (based on Dr Barley’s evidence) that P53 can only slow down cell growth for a very short time after radiation and certainly not for a few years. Asked what conclusion he drew from the reference in the Ellis and Corio paper to a sudden rapid increase in the size of the tumour noted in several cases of SPCC, Dr Plowman said that his tenet was that SPCCs have some genetic instability and can change their growth rate towards a more rapid pattern. In that respect they are no different from all cancer cells which have genetic instability. Mutations of oncogenes and suppressor genes are instrumental in initiating cancer by allowing cells to be released from normal body controls. After a tumour has been initiated tumour oncogenes and/or suppressor genes in combination by further mutation can alter subsequent growth patterns which may vary as time goes on.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">Doctor Plowman accepted that these subsequent mutations are more recognised for accelerating than decelerating growth rate however he could see no reason why mutations in oncogenes and/or suppressant genes would not slow rates of tumour growth. It is harder to observe and identify the slowing down effect on growth of mutations in oncogenes and suppressant genes because where a tumour is treated the subsequent slowing in the growth rate tends to be attributed causally to the treatment. In principle there is no reason why mutations in oncogenes and/or suppressant genes should not slow down the growth rate of tumours because cancer cells are unstable and there are mutational events occurring in their natural history. It was put to Dr Plowman in cross-examination that breast cancer shows that recurrence tends to occur in lower grade hormone sensitive tumours. Doctor Plowman’s response was that there are some high grade tumours which are not hormone sensitive which also recur late where it is not possible to ascribe the late recurrence to oestrogen. </p>

In his report Professor Sloan, having referred to the Fujita paper which reported that local recurrence is not rare in the period of more than 5 years after treatment [of mobile tongue tumours by RT ] said : “ In lay terms, it appears that radiotherapy can sometimes merely “stun” cancer cells. Most cancer cells die after radiation treatment but some cells appear to survive and undergo genetic ‘evolution’. They are trapped in radiation scar tissue which has a reduced blood supply. Even years later the cancer can recur in the tissues. Sometimes the genetic change results in the cancer having a different appearance to that in the original biopsy…”  Having said that he agreed with Professor Sloan, Dr Plowman was shown by Mr Grace QC an extract from Dr Barley’s report in which he wrote: “ It could be argued that, owing to the very poor blood supply near the site of the tumour following a high dose radiotherapy, residual cancer cells may grow relatively slowly for several years and be detectable under a microscope, long before becoming evident clinically.”  Asked whether he agreed with that Dr Plowman answered: “Yes I think that is a slightly more eloquent way of putting it than stunned, but it is the same thing.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">Dr Plowman elaborated further in cross examination. He cited three reasons why he did not hold with the Gompertzian model as applicable to Mrs Manning between 1996 and 2001: first that the model does not account for late recurrences; second that the late acceleration in 2001 could have been caused by genetic mutations; and third that it ignores the effect of RT. On the latter point he said that one would not expect the tumour to grow between 1996 and 2001  with the same  doubling times as in 1993-1994 or as in 2001-2002. The former preceded the RT treatment of the tumour and by the time of the latter the tumour may have grown outside the high dose region of bad soil created by the RT and would thus be free to take off at the same or a higher rate of growth due to mitosis.</p>

A sub-lethal dose of RT to cells could cause delay in mitotic rate. Thus Mrs Manning may have had more retardation constants early on after RT and then the tumour may have found more fertile soil once it outgrew the irradiated area. It would not necessarily have the same growth rate before and after RT.</p>

By causing fibrosis and scarring in the irradiated tissues it is likely that RT will inhibit the growth of many surviving tumour cells because such tissues will be less well oxygenated. In this context Mr Grace Q.C. relied on the following statement in : “Carcinoma of the Oral Cavity-Management of The Primary Tumour” by Professor Langdon and Dr Henk: “Recurrences after radiotherapy tend to be deeply infiltrating and the extent can be difficult to define; indeed it is quite common for the superficial part of the tumour to disappear completely and mucosa heal over it, yet malignant cells survive in the deeper part of the tumour and continue to spread in the muscle or bone. Furthermore the routes of tumour spread, following radiotherapy are unpredictable and no longer follow the usual patterns.”</p>

But he pointed out that there is nonetheless a significant minority of late recurrences. Further Mr Grace QC in closing pointed out that this statistic does not undermine the force of Dr Plowman’s point in that surgical treatment of cancer could also affect growth rates by cutting off the blood supply and producing scar tissue as infertile ground for any surviving cancer cells to grow in. Doctor Plowman made the further point that since there will always be a spectrum of growth rates as reflected in the Steel spectrum of 45 to 155 days doubling time, it is always possible that cells surviving RT would have grown faster without it.  </p>

He added that even if the alleged tumour presented in 1995/1996 as a polypoid SPCC(as suggested in parts of his evidence by Professor Sloan)the relative absence of mitosis observed in the September 1995 and December 1996 biopsies argued  strongly against  the tumour being aggressive in the sense of a short doubling time and fast growth rate). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">On the hyperbaric oxygen point, all three pathology experts agreed in their joint report that such treatment is inappropriate in the presence of recurrent tumour and that it may promote tumour growth. Doctor Plowman in his report stated that although he did not think that such treatment would have affected the growth greatly, it is theoretically possible that it would give hypoxic tumour cells more viability. Doctor Barley in his report referred to the effect of hyperbaric oxygen treatment obliquely. Referring to the rapid progress in the growth of the tumour from March 2001 onwards he said: “This rate of growth is consistent with a poorly differentiated or sarcomatoid squamous carcinoma which may double in volume within a week or two <span style="font-weight:bold">without the use of hyperbaric oxygen.” </span>(emphasis added). The natural inference from the emphasised words is that Dr Barley recognised that hyperbaric oxygen treatment is liable to accelerate the growth rate of a tumour. In cross-examination, when Mr Grace QC asked Dr Barley to confirm this inference, he did so, albeit not without a considerable degree of reluctance and prevarication, which it was hard to interpret as other than reflecting a reluctance to acknowledge points inconsistent with the defendants’ case which, in my judgment, permeated his evidence. Thus for example on two occasions he denied that hyperbaric oxygen treatment may cause tumours to grow more rapidly, but on two other occasions he accepted that it is possible and he also accepted that if he had had a patient who was receiving hyperbaric oxygen therapy with a view to promoting tissue healing and then discovered that the patient was suffering from cancer he would have stopped the treatment very quickly.   </p>

Ms Mishcon’s primary submission that if one applies Gompertzian theory to the inferred doubling time of the tumour between April 2001 and January 2002 it is unlikely that any cancer cells were present in 1996 was based in large part on Dr Barley’s evidence. That evidence was subjected to close cross-examination, by the end of which it emerged that a number of propositions which, at the outset, had been presented as clear cut and straightforward were in fact more complex, equivocal and/or contentious.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">At the heart of Dr Barley’s evidence was his assertion that it is an inevitable fact of life, or iron rule as it came to be referred to,  that where you know the doubling rate of a tumour at a particular point, the doubling time of the tumour must have been shorter earlier on and thus the tumour must have been growing more quickly earlier on. That is because by the time the tumour is large enough to be detected 90% of the cells being produced are dying immediately through lack of oxygen which inevitably slows down the growth of the tumour as it gets bigger. He also said that it is an iron law of biology that all late recurrences of SQC or SPCC of the head and neck must have a slow doubling rate at the point of detection and that the rate of growth of tumours is faster when they are small and slows down as they get bigger.  </p>

At another point he said that the rule has no exceptions. However elsewhere Dr Barley volunteered that tumours do not “on the whole” change their nature and behaviour, the implication being that there are occasions on which they do just that. He also accepted that sometimes a tumour may be influenced by other factors to grow more quickly. He cited the example of breast cancer which may be influenced by changes in hormone levels and the example of melanomas which it has been suggested is controlled by the body’s immune response such that when the immunity wanes the melanoma has an opportunity to recur. Although he said that there is no evidence that hormones or immune response have a significant effect on  the growth of head and neck cancers, the significant concession was that the so called iron rule is in fact subject to exceptions, the full ambit of which is not known.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">Confusingly at one point Dr Barley accepted that it is possible for a tumour to start growing slowly and then speed up but not to start fast then slow down and then speed up. He accepted that the former proposition can occur because of what Dr Plowman, rightly as he thought, described as genetic abnormalities causing an increase in the rate of cell division. On its face this appears inconsistent with the so-called iron rule. Doctor Barley sought to reconcile the two propositions on the basis that any increase in cell division due to genetic abnormalities would be outbalanced by the normal Gompertzian rule. However this appeared to be based not on evidence or logic but assertion. Moreover Dr Barley then retreated and accepted that there could be a net increase in the tumour growth rate even after taking account of Gompertzian theory, albeit that the acceleration caused by genetic abnormality would have been even greater without Gompertzian theory. In other words put simply he accepted that genetic abnormalities can lead to a tumour growth rate accelerating. When it was put to him in cross-examination that within the life of a tumour there can be differing growth rates he explicitly agreed, albeit saying that they could not slow down. But then he accepted even the latter as a theoretical possibility because of impairment of the blood supply or impairment of oxygenation. Thus he accepted, albeit grudgingly, that RT can impair tumour growth to some extent. However he went on to say that when cancer cells are trapped in fibrous scar tissue as a result of RT it is not possible that they become less able to grow thus reducing the growth rate. When Mr Grace QC drew his attention to a paragraph in his report to suggest that its contents were inconsistent with that piece of evidence, Dr Barley reacted defensively indicating even before any question was put that he was alive to the inconsistency:  </p>

However, it has been my personal experience that local recurrence within the high dose volume is usually detected within a few months of completing treatment. Although cancer cells may be visible in the area where the tumour was a few months after completion of treatment, they may not be viable. However if there is evidence of residual squamous carcinoma more than 6 months (but less than 18 months) after treatment, especially if there is an associated tumour or ulcer, the majority of head and neck teams would treat this as recurrent cancer. Recurrence is very uncommon more than 2 years after radical treatment, and after 3 tears without evidence of recurrence a patient with head and neck cancer is usually considered to be cured.” </p>

However the basis of his disagreement he said was the rate of growth of head and neck cancer in general and that of Mrs Manning in particular, the latter point being in my judgment entirely circular, the very question in issue being whether it is possible to infer by extrapolation what that rate of growth was.

When asked if that intrinsic rate of growth can never be altered Dr Barley’s answer was: “It does not usually, no.”  This was a further answer which by necessary implication accepted that there can be exceptions to the so-called iron rule. Given the weight of evidence as to the existence of a considerable minority of late recurring head and neck SPCCs and SQCs and Dr Plowman’s point that there must be some explanation for them, Dr Barley’s concession, albeit not apparently made with any great enthusiasm, seemed to me telling. So was his response when asked how he would explain the reference in Ellis and Corio to it being particularly noted in several cases that there was a sudden rapid increase in the size of tumour. Doctor Barley’s response was to point to a graph that Dr Plowman added to the joint oncologist’s statement showing how volume doubling can give the impression of rapid growth occurring suddenly when the tumour becomes detectable. What Dr Barley did not explain is why that suggested explanation is any more plausible than, let alone necessarily correct to the exclusion of, the more obvious explanation, namely that in those cases for some reason or other the growth rate of the tumours accelerated.</p>

By parity of reasoning it would seem to follow that if the effect of those biopsies had been inadvertently to excise a part of a tumour present leaving only a few cells behind, particularly if they were deep to the mucosa, that could account for a prolonged period of relatively slow growth thereafter before the comparatively rapid growth rate in between April 2001 and January 2002.</p>

This rather important gloss on the Gompertzian iron law only emerged late on in the cross-examination. In the light of all these concessions it was perhaps not surprising that more fundamentally Dr Barley accepted that it is not possible accurately to extrapolate back on the rate of doubling in Mrs Manning’s case because the cell cycle time for her tumour is not known. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">All three pathology experts agreed in their joint report that it would be very rare but nonetheless possible for SPCCs to lie dormant for five years or more. Specifically in the context of the present case they all agreed that it is possible that the spindle cells in the December 1996 biopsy which they agreed were highly suspicious for SPCC represented dormant malignant cells which may have emerged in 2001.While Professor Speight considered that to be highly unlikely Professor Sloan and Dr. Woolgar were of the view, on the basis of having seen the later specimens and with knowledge of Mrs Manning’s clinical history that they are the same cells as the ones in the 2001 tumour and that they were dormant for some or all of the intervening period. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">This is undoubtedly one of the stronger factors arguing against recurrence in January 2001.  However, it remains the case that this was a factor which was taken into account by both Dr Plowman and Mr Brown and which did not prevent them from reaching the very clear conclusion that in fact the 2001 cancer was probably recurrence rather than a new primary. Equally it was taken into account by Professor Sloan and Dr Woolgar and it did not prevent them from reaching the no less clear conclusion that there was probably cancer present in Mrs Manning in September 1995 and December 1996. As many of the experts on both sides had occasion to comment, there are, in Dr Plowman’s words, things which do not square on either side of the arguments on this case.  It was certainly not suggested by any of the experts that this was a knock out blow on the recurrence versus new primary issue.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">Moreover the  Defendants’ argument rested in part on a premise which was not accepted by Dr Plowman and whose evidential basis was questionable.  The premise was that the tumour grew rapidly between its inception and detection in December 1993, again grew rapidly after the RT treatment in February 1994 leading up to the December 1995 and December 1996 biopsies and thereafter slowed down or lay dormant between December 1996 and the autumn of 2000.  The first part of that premise, namely that the tumour grew rapidly between its inception and its detection in December 1993 rested on the assertion of Dr Barley to that effect.  However it became clear in cross-examination that this assertion was based not on any concrete evidence but on speculation on Dr Barley’s part.  </p>

This assumption turned out to be just that, an assumption.  It was not based on any evidence.  There was no evidence in the factual part of the case as to the size of the tumour in June 1993 or indeed at any date before December 1993.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the first matter, Dr Barley’s recollection of the evidence was incorrect.  What Professor Langdon had recorded in his letter dated 10 December 1993 to Dr Henk was that Mrs Manning “has been aware of an ulcer on the lateral border of her tongue for <span style="font-weight:bold">at least</span> six months.” (Emphasis added).  It is thus unknown when Mrs Manning first became aware of the tumour and Mr Grace QC was right to suggest to Dr Barley that any attempt to assess the growth rate of the tumour prior to December 1993 must be pure speculation since there is no second point of time prior to December 1993 at which it is possible to fix the dimension of the tumour. As to the second matter, Dr Barley’s proposition turned out in cross-examination to be no more than a suggestion made by him without any authority in the literature to support it.  As to the third matter, when it was put to Dr Barley that his assertion was no more than a reference to the median of the Steel figures of a range of 33 to 150 days, Dr Barley accepted that that was correct, adding: “But we have only these statistics to go on I’m afraid”.  In my judgment it is a non sequitur to say that because 45 days per doubling is the median figure in a range representing 90% of tumour growths, it therefore follows that in any particular case the volume doubling rate was on the balance of probabilities 45 days.  If that were the case it would follow that in a population of 100 patients with SPCC on the balance of probabilities each and therefore all of the 100 on the balance of probabilities had a 45 day doubling rate. This seems to me to be a false equation between the concept of the median and the concept of evidence that in a particular case a particular growth rate can be said to be identifiable on the balance of probabilities.  This part of Dr Barley’s evidence prompted the response from Mr Grace QC:  “You grasp at figures do you not if it suits your case because essentially I suggest you are seeking to act as an advocate in this case and not an expert at all.”  While in my view overstated as a criticism it was hard to escape the impression that there was perhaps more than a grain of truth in it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the growth rate between the RT treatment in January and February 1994 and September 1995 and December 1996 Dr Plowman did not accept that the tumour must have grown more quickly in that period and then slowed down between December 1996 and the autumn of 2000.  He pointed out that the claimant’s case is that the cancer present in September 1995 and December 1996 manifested itself microscopically on the biopsy but not clinically.  Dr Plowman’s view was that the tumour, having been knocked back by RT and BT in early 1994 thereafter grew slowly or as he put it grumbled along from early 1994 to late 2000.   He considered that the evidence in 1996 as to the absence of mitoses argues strongly in favour of a growth rate which was slower than a two months doubling time.  Thus on analysis what was presented as a pattern of quick (pre-December 1993), quick (February 1994 to December 1996), slow (December 1996 to autumn 2000), quick (January 2001 to April 2002) may in fact have been a pattern of slow (inception of tumour to autumn 2000) quick (January 2001 to April 2002).

In cross examination he accepted that if (which of course he did not believe) cancer was present in September 1995 and December 1996 the growth rate of the tumour first between treatment in February 1994 and the September 1995 biopsy and then between the latter biopsy and the December 1996 biopsy would have been relatively slow and certainly within the range of head and neck cancer growth rates: as he put it not rapid but not slow.  This further undermines the clear cut suggestion of a quick slow quick pattern of growth of the putative tumour.</p>

That of course begs the question whether in fact there were millions of cancer cells in the September 1995 biopsy.  However a few minutes later, it was pointed out to Dr Plowman that Professor Sloan had said that in the December 1996 biopsy there were no atypical mitotic figures and few mitotic figures in a field.  This prompted Dr Plowman to say that it is a feature of aggressively growing tumours that under a high power microscope you will see five or more mitotic figures in a field.  If there were not that many in the December 1996 biopsy that in Dr Plowman’s view supported the proposition that the tumour was not growing aggressively at that stage, since a highly aggressive tumour would have quite a few mitotic figures visible.  </p>

Thus he did not accept that the presence of spindle cells even if malignant in 1996 necessarily meant that they had a high mitotic rate and thus must have been aggressive and fast growing.  This led Dr Plowman to qualify his earlier answer, which is relied on by Ms Mishcon.  He said that even if there were millions of cancer cells present in 1996 he would not necessarily have expected the cancer to be clinically obvious before 2002 unless the doubling time was short.  He would have expected to have seen a recurrence before 2001, but not necessarily.  It would depend on the growth rate and the absence of mitosis argued against there being a fast doubling time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">Professor Sloan, Mr Brown and Dr Plowman were in broad agreement that the long dormancy period may be explicable in part by the location of a few carcinoma cells deep in the tongue.  As referred to above this may have been compounded by the effects of RT and/or the small number of cells left behind after RT and BT in 1994 and/or the September 1995 and December 1996 biopsies.  Ms Mishcon pointed out in her written closing submissions that Professor Sloan in evidence accepted that if the cancer cells which he believed had been left behind by the RT/BT in early 1994 had mutated to SPCC and produced a lesion and ulcerated by 1995, they were not inactive in that period.  Thus there would still need to be an explanation for how they could have been active between 1994 and 1996 and then become inactive for the next four years.  This of course begs the question whether the September 1995 lesion and ulceration was caused by the cancer if it was still there.  Although it is right that in cross-examination Professor Sloan expressed for the first time the view that the September 1995 biopsy may have been a polyploid spindle cell carcinoma, Mr Grace QC pointed out during cross-examination of another witness that it is not a necessary part of the claimant’s case that the persistent cancer manifested itself clinically in September 1995 or December 1996 but merely that it was microscopically present.  In fact it appeared to be Dr Plowman’s view that although the original cancer had not been completely killed off by the RT and BT and was present in September 1995 and December 1996, the ulceration in September 1995 may well have not been caused by the cancer cells.  In his view it was perfectly possible, indeed probable that the original cancer, to the extent that it survived the RT/BT slowly grumbled away probably deep in the tongue and very possibly stunted in its growth by the effects of the RT/BT until it grew out of the sterile zone and became clinically manifest in January 2001.</p>

Ms Mishcon relied on Professor Speight’s evidence that although it is theoretically possible to have a deep recurrence his guess was that only 20% of such recurrences may be deep and that he had never seen or read about an SPCC arising from the deep tissues, which he felt was very unlikely.  Against that Mr Grace QC pointed out (i)  that SQC can and indeed frequently does recur as SPCC, (ii) that the  pathology experts all agreed that it is possible for a recurrence of a tongue tumour following RT to develop deep to the mucosal surface of the tongue and that they have all seen cases where this has occurred, although none of them had sufficient experience of post radiotherapy tongue recurrences to define whether that is “normal” (iii) that  the oral surgeon experts also agreed that recurrences of tongue tumour following RT can develop deep to the mucosal surface, (iv) that the oncology experts also agreed that in their clinical experience recurrence of squamous carcinoma of the tongue following RT  can be either superficial or deep in muscle or both and (v) that Dr Henk and Professor Langdon in their book state that recurrences after RT tend to be deep and indeed that the mucosa heals: </p>

The first was an extract from Professor Langdon’s book reporting that between 27 and 50% of patients with oral cancer present for treatment with late lesions, one of the explanations for which is that oral cancer is not usually painful until such time as either the ulcer becomes secondarily infected or the tumour invades sensory nerve fibres.  In other words the tumours tend not to be symptomatic and therefore not diagnosed until a late stage and not until tumour invades nerve fibres.  The second bit of evidence was the Ellis and Corio paper which recorded that only a minority of patients with SPCC suffer pain and symptoms.</p>

The original SQC in 1993 she said was moderately to poorly differentiated and the SPCC which emerged in 2001 was poorly differentiated.  She prayed in aid an article co-written by Professor Sloan in 1990 about SPCC which said: “The literature now contains reports of more aggressive behaviour and this has been our experience also.  Few authors emphasise this aggressive clinical behaviour …”.  She thus preyed in aid the assertion that SPCC is regarded as being an aggressive fast growing tumour as a strong indication that it was not present in 1995 or 1996 on the basis that it would be unlikely to have been inactive and slow growing over a period of over five years.</p>

In my opinion it is highly likely that the tumour grew slowly in the bulk of the tongue between 1996 and 2001.  During this time the tumour could progress and infiltrate the tongue until, after a period of more rapid growth during 2001 it reached a large size.”  This is consistent with the evidence of Mr Brown who said that: “If the tumour was more deeply placed clearly that would not become apparent for much longer” and “My own experience is that tumours grow at different rates and speeds”.  Moreover both Dr Woolgar and Professor Sloan said that in their experience the rate of growth of a tumour varies within its lifetime probably due to genetic factors. </p>

It is true that Mr Brown said that it would be very unusual for someone to survive if SPCC had gone untreated for four to five years and that the fact that Mrs Manning had survived without treatment between December 1996 and the autumn of 2000 was an argument against SPCC being present in 1995 and 1996.  However, against that I have already referred to Dr Plowman’s evidence that the low mitotic rate in 1995 and 1996 points against Mrs Manning’s tumour being fast growing and aggressive and Dr Barley’s evidence that if cancer was present in September 1995 and December 1996 the growth rate from February 1994 until those two dates would not have been particularly fast.  In addition Dr Plowman in cross-examination stated that the fact that the morphology of Mrs Manning’s tumour mutated from SQC to SPCC does not imply that it was therefore aggressive.  According to him one gene determines the morphology change from SQC to SPCC, another determines the rate of growth.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">This issue is linked to the general statistics on late recurrence of SQC.  It was generally agreed by the experts that most local recurrences of SQC occur within the first two to three years.  This is consistent with the findings of the Fujitsa study that 66.7% of local recurrences studied occurred within two years after treatment.  However, it was also agreed that there is a significant and established pattern of late recurrences.   Dr Barley estimated recurrences after five years at 10%, Dr Plowman at slightly less than 10%.  It is however of note that the Fujitsa paper reported that in their clinic 25.6% of local recurrences, higher than in previous reports, occurred after five years.  In patients where the tumour was T1 as many as 8 of 14 recurrences occurred after five years and of 15 recurrences in patients treated solely by BT (Mrs Manning was of course treated by both RT and BT) 6 recurred after five years.  Fujitsa added that: “Reports show that local recurrence is not rare in the period of  more than five years after treatment (12.5%, 11.6%, 15.4%), we believe therefore that a periodical follow up should be continued for more than five years, even if the lesion might be T1, which  is a good indication for [BT] alone treatment. Indeed this latter point was highlighted in the overall conclusion of the paper: “… we also recommend longer follow-up periods; more than five years might be necessary for late local recurrences and for secondary cancer”.</p>

This underlines the difficulty in this case, namely that whether, as Mr Manning submitted, the 2001 cancer was a late recurrence or, as the Defendants submitted, it was a new primary, it was a very unusual occurrence.  The fact that it was unusual does not mean that it did not happen.  Indeed the one thing we do know about this case for sure is that whatever was the nature of Mrs Manning’s cancer in 2001 it was very rare and very unusual.</p>

This point is linked with her submission that if the lesions and ulceration in September 1995 and December 1996 were caused by cancer cells, as she submitted was implicit in Professor Sloan’s late suggestion at trial that the clinical evidence pointed to the presence of polypoid SPCCs, there would still need to be an explanation for how they could have been active between 1994 and 1996 and then become inactive for the next four years.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in"> Mr Grace QC in response pointed out that it is the claimant’s case that it was the biopsy, as distinct from the tumour, which was of those dimensions and submitted that the biopsy contained only a small minority of suspicious cells.  More generally there was a consensus that it is to use Dr Plowman’s words “perfectly possible” for the epithelium to heal over even if there is SPCC. That was the evidence of Dr Henk, Mr Brown, Dr Plowman and Dr Woolgar. Indeed Professor Sloan said in evidence that he had actual experience of a case in which that happened, albeit the cancer was discovered relatively shortly after the mucosa healed over so that it is impossible to know how long it would have taken before the cancer would have manifested itself had it not been independently detected.    Moreover Dr Plowman said that it would be perfectly possible for the tumour to remain grumbling for some time after the epithelium healed over.  Ms Mishcon submitted that the experts were generally agreed that it would be virtually impossible for a biopsy wound to heal if there were malignant cells on or close to the surface.  To that Mr Grace QC responded by referring to Dr Woolgar's evidence that after incomplete surgical removal of a tumour, that is to say without clear or any margins, the wound may heal despite the remaining presence of tumour.  It was also the evidence of Dr Plowman, with which Mr Brown and Professor Sloan agreed, that it was perfectly possible, indeed likely that a few cells left behind grew down into the tongue and that in that event it would have been possible for the cancer to grow slowly over a period of years undetected until it invaded the sensory nerves leading to the pain in the autumn of 2000 which Dr Henk said was almost certainly caused by the carcinoma.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">There was undoubtedly a tension between that part of Professor Sloan’s evidence which suggested that at the time of the September 1995 and December 1996 biopsies there were polypoid SPCCS and Dr Plowman’s  evidence that the ulceration in September 1995,may well have not been caused by the cancer cells which he, no less than Professor Sloan, believed were present.  Mr Grace QC was right that it is not a necessary part of the Claimant’s case that the persistent cancer for which he contends manifested itself clinically in September 1995 or December 1996. If Dr Plowman is right and the lesions and ulceration were not caused by cancer cells even though some were present Ms Mishcon’s point loses much of its force. It is also right that the notion of a polypoid SPCC was not a necessary part of Professor Sloan’s diagnosis of SPCC. It did not appear to have been based on his examination of the biopsies and had not formed part of his original report or been mentioned in the joint experts report. He raised it at trial saying that it had occurred to him for the first time listening in court to the evidence of Mrs Manning’s clinical history. Nonetheless it still strikes me as legitimate for Ms  Mishcon to point out that if Professor Sloan was right there would  need to be an explanation for how cancer cells could have been active between 1994 and 1996 and then become inactive for the next four years. That  such an explanation is possible emerged from the evidence which I have summarised in this section and the section of the judgment dealing with dormancy and deep recurrence.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus for example it was put to Mr Brown that: “If the 1996 biopsy was positive it would be unusual not to heal?  A. That is right.  It is certainly an unusual point about the case.  Q. Does it alter your view on the balance of probabilities looking at all the evidence as to what happened? A. No I think that I would still go with the progression from 1995 where there was suspicion of cells and in 1996 they were highly suspicious and then to a tumour which was evident.  It is possible that that progress could have been a slow ongoing process and on the balance of probability to this particular case I would say that is the most likely explanation.  But that largely is based on the site, the size of the cells when it was diagnosed and also the similarity of the cells as I explained.”  In that respect this factor was the same as the fact that it would be unusual for Mrs Manning to have survived an untreated SPCC from 1996 to 2000 and unlikely for an SPCC to lie dormant for that time.  Again both those points were put to Mr Brown and he maintained his position that not withstanding them he believed that on a balance of probabilities the 2001 tumour was a recurrence.</p>

In short I am persuaded that it is highly unlikely if not impossible that the 2001 tumour was a new radiogenic cancer.  Although, as I have pointed out, it could accurately have been said in for example 1996 that it would be  unusual if Mrs Manning were to suffer a recurrence in 2001 with no intervening clinical manifestations and even more unusual with one or two intervening clinical manifestations, so too could it have accurately been said that it would be most unusual if she were to develop a second radiogenic carcinoma (as distinct from a sarcoma) as soon after the RT and BT treatment of February 1994 as 2001.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">However it seems to me that the proposition that the 2001 carcinoma was a new radiogenic primary goes beyond merely the improbable.  The combination of the facts that it presented on the same site as the original carcinoma and that, when it presented, the mucosa was intact, takes this beyond the merely improbable to the realm of the extremely unlikely if not virtually impossible.  The defendants on analysis seem to me to have no convincing answers to these points.  When added to the fact that by common consent 2001 was statistically too early for a new radiogenic primary, that the chances of Mrs Manning developing a new radiogenic primary were exceedingly small, that only one in ten second primaries present as carcinomas and that all three pathology experts agreed that there were morphological similarities between the cells in the September 1995 and December 1996 biopsies and the 2001 acknowledged cancer, these factors were very powerful indeed.   They are supported by the element of coincidence.  Ms Mishcon suggested that the claimant's case was based on little more than the coincidence argument.  For the reasons I have given this does not seem to me correct.  It is, however, a free standing and independently powerful point in favour of the claimant.  Both SQC and SPCC are very rare forms of cancer.  Mrs Manning had SQC in 1993 and SPCC in 2001.  In September 1995, at a time when Professor Langdon was convinced that her cancer had returned, the biopsy revealed cells which were morphologically similar to the very rare SPCC found in 2001.  The same is the case in respect of the December 1996 biopsy with the added factor that Professor Sloan and in particular Dr Woolgar were particularly struck by the progression as between the pre-September 1995 biopsies and the September 1995 biopsy the December 1996 biopsy and the 2001 biopsies.  Indeed it is that progression which, while of course wholly inadmissible in considering whether there was a breach of duty of care, at which point hindsight is inadmissible, played an important part in the strongly held opinions of Professor Sloan and Dr Woolgar that cancer was present in September 1995 and December 1996. </p>

Finally I place very great weight on the opinions of Dr Plowman and Mr Brown in both of whom I had as I have indicated very great confidence. Although ultimately it is for the court to make findings of fact, it is inevitable in so technical an area as this that where there are conflicting opinions and a mass of evidence pointing in opposite directions, the court is bound to be guided by the views and analysis of those of the expert witnesses whom it finds the most persuasive and reliable. </p>

In relation to some of them, as I have endeavoured to explain, I was not persuaded, having heard all the evidence, that they were improbable or as improbable as submitted by the Defendants. In relation to others there is in my judgment undoubtedly force in Ms Mishcon’s arguments. However I was not persuaded that any of them was of such a character as to compel the conclusion that a recurrence in 2001 would be beyond the merely improbable and in the territory of the extremely unlikely if not virtually impossible. In that critical regard they differed in my judgment from at least two of the arguments against there having been a new radiogenic primary. In addition doing my best to weigh all the competing arguments and evidence as to the probabilities and improbabilities I am of the view that the balance of probabilities points clearly in favour of the contention advanced on behalf of Mr Manning.   </p>

I do so on the basis that although I retain an open mind on that dispute in my judgment it would require very strong evidence to justify a conclusion that there was not cancer present in September 1995 or December 1996. That is because such a conclusion would be inconsistent with the conclusion which I have reached that the evidence points strongly to the February 2001 carcinoma having been a recurrence. Were that inconsistency to be resolved in favour of a finding that there was no cancer present in September 1995 or December 1996 that would require a finding that the 2001 carcinoma was a new primary, something which, as I have indicated, was in my judgment highly unlikely if not impossible. Plainly if the pathology evidence justified such a finding it would be the duty of the court as best it could to resolve the conflict between two apparently inconsistent putative findings. </p>

Professor Sloan and Dr Woolgar accepted that without the benefit of hindsight and in particular their examination of the 2001 and 2002 biopsies it would not be possible to make a definitive diagnosis of SPCC.

Indeed it was common ground between in particular Professor Sloan and Professor Speight that the principal areas of difference of opinion between them reflected not any difference in observation but rather differences of interpretation. Professor Speight described the job of the pathologist as being “to distinguish between  different types of cells based on their morphology and appearance. One must be able to tell the difference between types of normal spindle-shaped cells, based on their size, shape, intensity of staining and their context/location.” Professor Sloan described it as a skill learned from training and experience which is “about recognising the pattern, the architecture of the tissue and the cells in the tissue and being able to classify that as a particular diagnostic entity and recognise that in the current world literature.” Elsewhere he described histopathology as “more of a clinical art in its recognition of cells and tissues and patterns of immunostaining.” Although both sides sought to bolster their conclusions by a number of ancillary arguments based on inference, at the heart of the difference of opinion between the experts lay different interpretations of what they saw in the biopsy slides. Self evidently this presents the court with considerable difficulties, not least because the court was circumscribed by being limited to seeing a number of photographs taken respectively by Professor Speight and Professor Sloan of individual fields within the slides. Not only do these photographs represent only a small percentage of the totality of the cells and patterns which were observed by the experts. In addition Professor Sloan emphasised that a large part of the process of interpretation involves spending quite a long time roving over the biopsy under the microscope at different levels of intensity and that patterns, impressions and features which emerge during such a process cannot always be reproduced or demonstrated by a single photograph or series of photographs. Both for that reason and because by definition the court has no training, experience or skill in the clinical art of pathology, inevitably a not inconsiderable part of the process of seeking to resolve these differences of opinion must depend on the view taken by the court of the reliability and persuasiveness of the evidence given by the experts.</p>

In examination in chief she clarified that she had not thereby intended to suggest that there was a possibility however small that the tumour began some time between the two biopsies. Rather it was intended to reflect her view that there was less histological evidence of tumour in 1995 than 1996.

That is correct. In respect of one of them Professor Sloan, accepted that he too had been wrong.

Both agreed that the choice is largely a matter of interpretation. Given that both Professor Sloan and Dr Woolgar had made what she described as such serious errors of interpretation Ms Mishcon submitted that the evidence of Professor Speight who had not been shown to have made any such error should be preferred. Again I do not accept that submission. In relation to the issue of atypical mitotic figures, Professor Sloan in cross-examination explained that when he reviewed the slides before writing his original report he had interpreted some of the cells in the December 1996 biopsy (but not the September 1995 biopsy) as atypical mitotic figures. In particular he saw what he regarded as a striking and conspicuous mitotic figure in the photograph on page 56 of the green trial bundle. His interpretation of the slides on his own had been that there were some normal mitotic figures, some apoptotic cells and more than one atypical mitotic figure scattered throughout the spindle-cell proliferation. At the joint experts meeting Professor Sloan said that the experts looked at these suspicious cells and discussed them at length. He said that he came away unconvinced that he had in fact seen atypical mitotic figures and that Professor Speight had convinced him looking at the slide through a double-headed microscope that the cells which he had thought were atypical mitotic cells were not. </p>

At trial Professor Sloan confirmed that the particular cell in the left hand photograph on page 56 which also appeared in Professor Speight’s photograph at page 320 of the green trial bundle, was one in respect of which he could not be certain whether it was atypical or not. He did however remain of the view that on the balance of probabilities it was a mitotic figure and not an apoptotic figure as Dr Harrison had believed it to be. He thought that most competent pathologists would recognise it as a mitotic figure. He was also certain that a number of cells in that region which Dr Harrison had identified as apoptotic were in fact mitotic. He felt very confident about recognising apoptotic cells because he had spent quite a lot of time with a PhD student looking at such cells on H and E sections so that he was familiar with their morphology. He had examined a PhD on the counting of mitotic and apoptotic figures in SPCC.  </p>

On the contrary it demonstrated an open-minded approach and a willingness to reconsider initial opinions in the light of new material and alternative views. In fact it lent greater force to those of his key conclusions which remained unaffected both by his detailed discussions with Professor Speight, his consideration of the evidence at trial and his cross-examination. He modestly and generously expressed great respect for Professor Speight and said that he reviewed his own opinions in the light of the differences of view which emerged when he read Professor Speight’s report and met him at the joint experts meeting. What was very powerful was Professor Sloan’s account of how his review of the slides shortly before trial and again on the weekend during the trial when he re-examined the 1996 slides left him more convinced than ever that they evidenced SPCC.</p>

The context was that a draft was prepared based on notes typed at the joint experts meeting by Dr Woolgar many of which both she and Professor Sloan said recorded things said by Professor Speight rather than views with which they had all agreed. The intention was that they would serve as a basis for amendment in email discussion. There then followed a series of email exchanges which led to some  changes but did not make all the corrections which Professor Sloan candidly admitted he should have insisted on. He ascribed this partly to the fact that he had never prepared a joint experts report before and partly to the fact that it occurred at a time when he was very busy changing jobs.</p>

However with Dr Woolgar, just as with Professor Sloan, I was very struck by two things. The first was the strength of her initial views that Mrs Manning had SPCC in 1995 and 1996. The second was that despite the concessions made in cross-examination and lengthy exposure to Professor Speight’s contrary views, she remained adamant at the end of her cross-examination that Mrs Manning had cancer in September 1995 and December 1996.  </p>

Professor Sloan said in relation to the September 1995 biopsy that if a further biopsy had been taken it would probably have revealed spindle-cells invading the deeper tissue and/or a focus of conventional squamous carcinoma. That would have led to a firm diagnosis of SPCC and triggered Professor Langdon to do salvage surgery. Similarly, in relation to the December 1996 biopsy he believed that a deeper biopsy, had it been taken, would probably have shown spindle-cells in the muscle or foci of conventional spindle-cell carcinoma. He believed that the 2001 carcinoma arose from cells left behind in 1996 in the deeper tissue which grew slowly in the deeper tissues after the 1996 biopsy healed over. He believed that a small focus of just a few malignant cells were left behind which grew slowly in the tongue and eventually manifested in November 2000 when Mrs Manning developed pain and speech problems which he believed (as did Dr Henk) was almost certainly the carcinoma cells invading the nerves of the tongue.  </p>

In the joint oncologists report the question had been posed: “The biopsy taken by Professor Langdon on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December 1996 was 2 millimetres deep and did not include any muscle. If tumour was then present would a deeper biopsy probably have revealed the tumour?”  Doctor Plowman’s answer was that “ a larger deeper biopsy would have been desirable and may have clarified the diagnosis of persisting carcinoma.” At trial he confirmed that on the balance of probabilities he thought that it would have done so because he believed that there were cancer cells deep to the superficial area which was clinically apparent. Cancer was probably going on in the base, the deeper structures and statistically a bigger bite from that area, a bigger divot would have been more likely to have given it. If there were in fact spindle-cell carcinoma cells deep in the biopsy that made it even more likely that they would have shown up in a further deeper biopsy. Professor Sloan said that if SPCC was in fact present in 1995 and/or 1996 it is highly likely that a further biopsy would have revealed the underlying tumour. A surgeon such as Professor Langdon if presented with the information that the original biopsy was highly suspicious for SPCC would not have taken that lightly and would have removed a substantial amount of tissue in order to prove a diagnosis one way the other. No surgeon would have taken that lightly.  This latter point, which is of course an essential part of the chain of causation which needs to be proved for the claim to succeed, was not challenged by the Defendants.</p>

In their view viewed as a continuum the slides demonstrated an evolution of the original cancer cells whose progression could clearly be seen. They were also struck by the marked difference between the 1994 and July 1995 biopsies on the one hand, and the September 1995 and December 1996 biopsies on the other, the latter showing a progressive busyness which Dr Woolgar said was the first thing that struck her when she viewed the slides. This busyness was the opposite of what would have been expected as the length of time from the BT/RT with its creation of radiation damaged fibroblasts increased. Nor could it plausibly be explained clinically or pathologically as a reaction to local trauma or ulceration. This was particularly so in the case of the December 1996 biopsy where there was no evidence of clinical ulceration as distinct from ulceration visible microscopically.  </p>

Thus in the context of breach of duty he wrote in his report in relation to the December 1996 biopsy: “Normally, faced with suspicious features in a biopsy, a pathologist would prepare deeper levels so as to examine more tissue. There is evidence in the report that Dr Harrison was suspicious and may not have prepared levels.” This appeared to accept the allegation to which it responded that Dr Harrison was negligent in failing to take deeper levels in respect of the December 1996 biopsy. At trial Professor Speight argued that it was not necessary for Dr Harrison to have done so. Mr Grace QC submitted that Professor Speight could not properly reconcile his report with his testimony on this point and that the court could not reconcile it either.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">In my view more striking was the apparent lack of consideration which Professor Speight had given prior to the trial to the effect of the acknowledged false negative rate on immunostaining on the unreliability of a 90% innocent view based on H and E slides alone. When the point was put to him and its implication explored with him he accepted the logic of the Claimant’s argument that the false negative rate rendered a 90% innocent view unreliable and would oblige a reporting pathologist to alert the surgeon to the existence of residual doubt. I found this  somewhat surprising. In relation to Mr Grace QC’s submission that Professor Speight’s attempts to explain away all suspicious features by a “sectioning effect” were altogether too facile and unnecessarily favoured the Defendants’ position since there is no reason why the random effect of sectioning should always favour the innocent explanation rather than malignancy,  I saw a certain amount of force in it. It was common ground between the parties that many of the features relied on by Professor Sloan and Dr Woolgar as pointing to malignancy were also consistent with an innocent explanation. The process of reaching a view as to which was the correct diagnosis thus necessarily involved either a judgment based on experience and recognition or inferences to be drawn from external evidence such as clinical context or comparison with the 2001 and 2002 biopsies or both. When Professor Speight argued that a particular feature was explicable by reference to a sectioning effect, it was not always clear which part if any of that process led him to that conclusion. This was of particular importance in the context of the debate about whether the positive stained cells in the archipelago in the December 1996 biopsy were innocent rete pegs or malignant cells.</p>

However, while I did not for a moment consider that he did not genuinely believe in the correctness of the Defendants’ case, or that he was not doing his best to assist the court, I did sometimes feel that, perhaps because he was convinced in the correctness of their case, he was less open-minded than Professor Sloan. It is also fair to point out that there was a lack of clarity and arguably some inconsistency as between Professor Speight’s report and his oral testimony as to whether the plump and pleomorphic cells within the connective tissue which he described in the H and E sections of the September 1995 biopsy as forming small sheets of spindle-cells were, as he said in the written report, consistent with atypical fibroblasts as a consequence of radiation damage (“radiation fibroblasts”) or as he suggested in oral testimony, were proliferating fibroblasts associated with a healing ulcer.

(2) Hyperchromatism (3) Increased cellularity. Hyper cellularity. (4) The arrangement or pattern of the cells (5) Mitoses and (6) Invasion or infiltration. Mitoses can be either typical or atypical. If atypical that is a strong indicator of malignancy. It is also the case that the more mitotic figures there are the greater the suspicion of malignancy. However it is also the case that in a malignant tumour mitoses may be sparse (see Ellis and Corio). It was also common ground (a) that a diagnosis of malignancy does not require that all these features or stigmata are present and (b) that these stigmata both individually and cumulatively are consistent both with malignancy and with an innocent explanation. It is thus readily apparent to what extent diagnosis depends on interpretation on the one hand and inferences to be drawn from external evidence such as the clinical context (which Professor Speight described as 90% of the diagnostic process), comparison with other biopsies and other matters on the other hand.

While he accepted that the malignant features were more developed and prominent in the latter than the former, he considered that to be entirely to be expected and consistent with a recurring tumour which grew over a period of years. Like Dr Woolgar he was also struck by the hypercellularity or busyness of the biopsy which he did not consider to be reasonably explicable either as the long-term effect of radiation damage or as healing process associated with a chronic ulcer. In this he was also supported by Dr Woolgar. His conclusion relied also on his interpretation of the islands of epithelial cells in the archipelago which stained positive in immunostaining and which he interpreted as evidence of the malignant invasion of the connective tissues. In this he was originally supported by Dr Woolgar but found himself ultimately in a minority, Dr Woolgar having accepted in cross-examination that because the archipelago was not materially further away from the epithelium than were two acknowledged rete pegs the archipelago was more likely to be rete pegs whose true nature was disguised by the sectioning effect.  </p>

Third I was unpersuaded by the Defendants’ submission that it was more probable that the hypercellularity had an innocent explanation (whether the long-term effect of RT or the short-term effect of a chronic ulcer) than a malignant or sinister one, (although of course the burden of proof on this as in all issues was for the Claimant).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">It was accepted by Professor Speight that the December 1996 hypercellularity was more prominent and obvious than in the previous biopsies. Indeed there was a progression from the May 1994 biopsy through the July 1995, September 1995 and December 1996 biopsies which showed a pattern of increasing busyness. I was persuaded by the force of Dr Woolgar’s and Professor Sloan’s evidence that one would ordinarily expect hypercellularity to decrease rather than increase the more time elapsed since RT. Similarly I was persuaded by the force of Mr Grace QC’s submission that if one has regard to the evidence of the clinical context of the four biopsies, it would be surprising if the degree of hypercellularity in December 1996 was the result of a healing process caused by a chronic ulcer. In May 1994 Mrs Manning had an ulcer which had been present for three months. In December 1996 there was no clinical ulcer at all. Professor Langdon described a very small nodule, 5 millimetres maximum in diameter and his clinical notes explicitly record: “Not ulcerated.” Professor Langdon was asked about the difference between a nodule and an ulcer. His answer was: “It was an elevated little lump looking like a pimple in fact, but critically it was covered by normal and healthy healed mucosa epithelium. It was not ulcerated at all…. the surface of it was covered by healed mucosa and there was not any ulceration or any destruction of the epithelium.” Professor Speight pointed out that the December 1996 biopsy revealed non-clinically evident ulceration but he accepted that the fact there was no clinical evidence of ulceration implies that the ulceration visible on the slides was very small. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">In addition because Dr Henk’s clinical notes record that as late as 14 October 1996 on examination there were no signs of recurrence of carcinoma and Mrs Manning’s neck was clear, there is no evidence that there was any non-clinically apparent ulceration present earlier than 19 November 1996 when Mrs Manning first presented at Professor Langdon’s clinic with the fibrous nodule, which was itself not described clinically as ulcerated. Against that background I found Professor Speight’s reluctance to accept that the contrast between the clinical context in May 1994 and December 1996 suggested that the much greater hypercellularity in December 1996 was unlikely to have been caused by a healing reaction to an ulcer unconvincing. His suggestion that it all depends on the nature of the two ulcers, even if theoretically correct, ignores the fact that the May 1994 ulcer was described by Professor Langdon as “indolent non-healing ulcer”. Professor Speight when this was put to him had misremembered that it was a fairly small healing ulcer. However even when it was pointed out to him that it was neither healing nor small (which he then had to accept, it being 10 by 5 millimetres) Professor Speight refused to accept the force of Mr Grace QC’s point. This is despite the fact that he accepted that the fact that the proliferating granulation tissue in May 1994 was not as proliferating as it was in 1995 and 1996 is what made the September 1995 and December 1996 biopsies suspicious and what made him look at them so carefully. I found Professor Speight’s evidence on this even less convincing when he seized on a mention by Mr Grace QC in cross-examination of a reference in Dr Harrison’s biopsy report to the presence of candidosis and suggested for the first time that the increased cellularity in December 1996 could at least in part be explained by the candidosis. When asked why he had not thought of that theory before Professor Speight’s answer was: “Because you have just reminded me of it Mr Grace but I had not regarded it as being particularly important because the cellularity <span style="font-weight:bold">could</span> be explained by the presence of a chronic healing ulcer, but by reminding me of the infection that would give me a reason which I could put to you which may alter the cellularity in this particular biopsy, but I have to be honest and say I had not thought of it as being important until you reminded me.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">I am further fortified in my conclusion on this point by evidence from Professor Sloan that by December 1996 one would not expect hypercellularity due to RT because following RT tissues tend  towards being hypocellular and also by his evidence that if, as was the case in December 1996, it is not possible for the clinician to detect an ulcer clinically the ulcer must have been minimal, and that the amount of healing reaction one is likely to find on histology depends upon the severity of the ulceration. If there is an extensive ulceration you would expect a more extensive healing reaction. Both these points, the latter of which strikes me as common sense, argue against either RT or healing response to an ulcer as being the probable explanation for the hypercellularity in the December 1996 biopsy.</p>

She said it was the first thing she noticed and it was thoroughly unexpected. I found her evidence on this which she maintained throughout and despite close cross-examination very persuasive.

That remains the case notwithstanding the fact that Dr Woolgar changed camps on this issue in cross-examination. The difference of interpretation on this point was fully discussed at the joint experts meeting and Professor Sloan, who has great respect for Professor Speight, took on board his interpretation but remained unpersuaded by it. In his view the islands of suspicious cells in the archipelago shown on photograph 54 right and 55 left in the green trial bundle were individual cytokeratin spindle-cell evidencing the presence of SPCC. Although Dr Woolgar in cross-examination accepted that they were not materially further from the epithelium than the larger figures which all three experts accepted were probably innocent and the result of tangential sectioning, Professor Sloan was adamant that even if  they are not too deep in the tissue to be the result of tangential sectioning. Professor Speight’s interpretation was wrong because the cells are morphologically similar to cells seen in the acknowledged SPCC in the 2001 and 2002 biopsies.<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#FF0000">   </span>In cross-examination Professor Sloan accepted that the archipelago was within the area of the acknowledged rete pegs and therefore not as deep in the connective tissue as he had originally interpreted it to be.

Professor Speight produced 10 photos of contiguous or overlapping parts of the interface between the biopsy and the tissue remaining on Mrs Manning’s tongue. This was referred to as the west coast.

Professor Speight had interpreted the disputed cells as being innocent fibroblasts whereas Professor Sloan interpreted them as suspicious interlacing bands of spindle and kite shaped cells such as are found in SPCC. He supported his interpretation by saying that they were strikingly similar to those in the 2001 SPCC. In relation to the interlacing bands, while he acknowledged that they were less prominent than in the 2001 and 2002 biopsies, he said that this was only to be expected in the evolution of the SQC into the SPCC.</p>

Acknowledging as inevitably one must the court’s complete lack of experience and expertise in this area, I found Professor Sloan’s evidence persuasive and which is more important, I found it more persuasive than that of Professor Speight in relation to these photos. I also take into account the fact that Professor Sloan was again at pains to emphasise the basic limitation of photographs as a diagnostic tool as distinct from looking under the microscope. He said that when pathologists do their external quality assurance they always insist on having original slides circulated so that they can look in their own microscopes rather than just digital images because although they can be used to illustrate points it is difficult to get all the information in a static digital photograph. He said that if ever he is asked for a second opinion by email and is emailed an image he always asks for the original slide and said that he would not pass an opinion on a digital image by email for that reason.</p>

Photograph 56D in the green bundle showed the locations (marked A and B) of two areas of which he had taken photographs on the weekend, respectively 56E (in relation to area A) and 56F and 56G (in relation to area B). Area A and area B overlapped to a small extent. Both A and B were roughly in the middle of the photograph of the biopsy viewed from north west to south east. Area B included the line of the surgical margin. On photo 56E which Professor Sloan agreed was in the more superficial part of the biopsy nearer the epithelium he said that the majority of the cells were suspicious spindle-cells.

Ms Mishcon’s submission on that was that given that on the balance of probabilities the archipelago is innocent and does not contain malignant spindle-cells there can be no such similarity. That submission of course depends upon her submission that the archipelago is on the balance of probabilities innocent, a proposition which relied on her submission that because Professor Sloan was in a minority on this issue it followed that he must be wrong on the balance of probabilities. I have already explained why I reject that submission.

Professor Sloan’s answer which I found convincing was that the photograph had not been taken to show a cord but rather to demonstrate increased density. He said that all the suspicious cells in the bottom left hand of the photograph were in a broad cord which was why he and Dr Woolgar had struggled to draw bands of cord. </p>

Professor Sloan included them to show the striking similarity between some of the cells in the tiny field in December 1996 and the accepted 2002 carcinoma cells. He identified in particular one cell in the left hand photograph which he described as a spindle-cell with a worryingly elongated nucleus and worrying hypochromatism. The fact that the cells in the two fields were strikingly similar rather than identical was the reason for his inclusion of the photographs in that it demonstrated the process of de-differentiation which he observed in the evolution of the cells and patterns as between the successive biopsies. Professor Speight accepted that the cells in these two photographs were similar in some respects while pointing out that there were also differences. </p>

One she said showed interlacing bands typical of SPCC, the other showed four mitotic figures in a small field, for which there was no comparable photo of the 1995 or 1996 biopsies. In fact Professor Sloan was very impressed with the morphological similarity between his supplemental photo 56F taken from field B of the December 1996 biopsy and the 2001 biopsies. He regarded the features including the fascicles in 56F as strikingly similar to those in 56A. The strikingly similar features were large nuclei, prominent nucleoli, spindle-shaped cells and parallel bands adjacent to cross sections.</p>

I have already referred to some of them. One was the absence of both the two SPCC smoking guns, namely epithelial dysplasia or a focus of squamous cell carcinoma. This is of course a powerful point which I have weighed in the balance. It is not however a knockout blow. All of the experts agreed that one would normally expect to find evidence of either epithelial dysplasia or conventional squamous cell carcinoma in a biopsy when SPCC was present. Ellis and Corio state: “As a requirement for inclusion in this study, all cases showed either foci of squamous cell carcinoma or evidence of dysplasia of the mucosal epithelium.” Batsakis and Suarez state: “ Is the fact that not all candidate lesions for a diagnosis of sarcomatoid carcinoma demonstrate a detectable epithelial differentiation in the sarcomatous component a contraindication to the diagnosis? Not if elements of a squamous cell carcinoma are found or the spindle-cell elements exhibit cytomorphological evidence of malignancy, regardless of absent epithelial markers.”</p>

However he said that this was not the case in September 1995 or December 1996 as there was clearly visible epithelium, despite the ulceration. However Lucas states: “Areas showing the usual appearances of SCC [as distinct from epithelial dysplasia] may be …  quite difficult to find” and Barnes states: “ The former component (SQC) is often small and elusive, requiring numerous sections for demonstration.” These latter comments in the literature are consistent with Professor Sloan’s opinion that a further and deeper biopsy would have revealed a focus or foci of squamous cell carcinoma. The bimorphic nature of SPCC means that different areas may have different morphology. </p>

All three pathology experts agreed in the joint report that it is possible that the spindle-cells seen in the December 1996 biopsy represent dormant malignant cells which may have emerged in 2001 although Professor Speight considered that to be highly unlikely and highly improbable.</p>

He did not suggest that even if for that reason there was no SPCC in the September 1995 biopsy there cannot have been SPCC in the December 1996 biopsy because he accepted that the exception to the normal requirement for epithelial dysplasia or foci of squamous cell carcinoma would still apply in December 1996 on the basis that an SPCC could have arisen in 1996 from cells left in the tissue after the RT in 1994. Moreover Professor Speight also accepted even in respect of the September 1995 biopsy that even if the suspicious cells were, as he thought, relatively superficial it was possible that there may also have been other malignant cells at a deeper level left behind after the RT, albeit he thought that very unlikely. The absence of evidence of in the December 1996 biopsy of epithelial dysplasia and foci of SQC does not either on its own or in combination with Ms Mishcon’s other submissions alter my conclusion that on the balance of probabilities SPCC was present in 1996.</p>

This was another powerful argument in the Defendants’ favour. I have referred in the context of the breach of duty allegations to the significant false negative rate when SPCC does not stain positively despite being present. It was 35% in the cases studied by Lewis and Olsen, an average of 42% in the other studies summarised in a table in that paper and, although he criticised the latter, Professor Speight accepted that the false negative rate might be as high as 25%. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">Of course the false negative rate has a different significance in the context of whether on the balance of probabilities SPCC was present in 1996 than in the context of whether it was negligent of Dr Harrison to make a definitive diagnosis of innocence in the face of such a rate. Taken in isolation from all other evidence and all other considerations a 75% true negative rate would point to the absence of SPCC in December 1996 (and for that matter in September 1995 where the suspicious cells did not stain positive for CK). However this is not the only piece of evidence. It is merely one part of a much larger jigsaw. It is possible that Mrs Manning had SPCC in December 1996 and that it happened to be one of the 25% of SPCCs which do not stain CK positive, just as it is theoretically possible that she had a new radiogenic carcinoma in early 2001 and that it was one of the 10% of new radiogenic primaries which present as a carcinoma rather than a sarcoma. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the second, Ms Mishcon submitted that it could not apply because tumours become less differentiated and lose their markers as they grow and in February 2001 between 33 and 40% of the SPCC cells stained positively for CK. Mr Grace QC’s response to that submission was to submit that tumours do not always become more de-differentiated as time goes on. In support of this submission he prayed in aid the evidence of Dr Plowman that tumour cell populations are unstable with variable biology which may change over time and that cells in the same tumour can differentiate or de-differentiate in different ways. This was accepted in principle by Professor Speight. Doctor Plowman also said that a change in morphology from SQC to SPCC does not necessarily imply a change in differentiation and that tumours do not always de-differentiate. He also said that if the morphology of the cells was, as suggested by Professor Sloan and Dr Woolgar, the same in 2001 as in 1995 and 1996 the cells would not have been less differentiated in 2001 than in 1995 and 1996. This latter point did not strike me as a very good one since Professor Sloan’s evidence was more qualified. All three experts agreed that the scattered atypical lozenge or kite-shaped tumour cells in the September 2001 biopsy showed similar morphological features to those in the September 1995 and December 1996 biopsies. Professor Sloan and Dr Woolgar were of the view that they were the same cells. But I do not think that they went so far as to describe them as identical in appearance. In relation to the arrangements and in particular the interlacing bands Professor Sloan, although on one occasion describing the pattern as more prominent in an earlier biopsy than a later biopsy, elsewhere said that they were more pronounced in 2001 and 2002 which was to be expected given a process of de-differentiation. On the other hand both Professor Sloan and Dr Woolgar were of the view that many of the morphological features in the September 1995 and December 1996 biopsies were strikingly similar to those in the 2001 and 2002 biopsies.  </p>

The staining is often confined to sporadic cells within the tumour and the most useful epithelial markers are AE/1 to AE/3, CK/1,CK/18 and EMA. The spindle-cells express vimentin (and often other mesenchymal filaments) – with the result that the tumour is often uniformly strongly positive with vimentin (often thought of as a connective tissue marker) yet negative or only focally and weakly positive with epithelial markers. This can mislead an unwary pathologist.” He also relied on table 2 in the Lewis <span style="font-style:italic">et al</span> paper which showed 100% of the spindle-cells staining positive for vimentin (as did the 1996 biopsy) and the evidence of all three pathology experts that vimentin is not a reliable means of distinguishing fibroblasts from carcinoma in what I regarded as an effective answer to Ms Mishcon’s reliance on the positive vimentin staining in the December 1996 as pointing against SPCC. </p>

I have sought to divide my analysis into two broad areas: the evidence on whether the 2001 primary was probably a recurrence or a new radiogenic primary and the question whether the factual and expert pathology evidence pointed to the presence of SPCC in the December 1996 biopsy. Although it is convenient and indeed essential for the purpose of clarity to analyse these two areas separately it is at some point necessary to draw the strands together. If the clinical and expert pathology evidence showed that there was no SPCC present in December 1996, the 2001 primary cannot have been a recurrence. If the 2001 carcinoma cannot have been a new radiogenic primary, there must have been SPCC present in December 1996. Absent certainty on either of these points, the evidence on both areas needs to be weighed together. In my judgment the factual and expert pathology evidence is far from showing that there was definitely no SPCC present in December 1996. In my view it shows on a balance of probabilities that SPCC was probably present in December 1996. Taken together with my finding that it was very unlikely that the 2001 primary was a new radiogenic primary in my view the factual and expert pathology evidence points on a clear balance of probabilities to the presence of SPCC in December 1996.</p>

I have given the matter a great deal of anxious consideration.  I accept Professor Sloan’s and Dr Woolgar’s conclusion that there was probably SPCC present in December 1996.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in">    As Ms Mishcon rightly pointed out one of the three suspicious features in the September 1995 biopsy on which Dr Woolgar originally  based her conclusion was agreed at trial by all three experts to be innocent. That was the marked proliferation of the surface epithelium at the edge of the ulcer with epithelial processes appearing to be detached from the surface and almost blending with the granulation tissue. Professor Speight interpreted these as innocent epithelial cells migrating as part of the healing process. At trial Professor Sloan agreed in evidence in chief and Dr Woolgar accepted this in cross examination.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in">The two remaining suspicious features relied on by Professor Sloan and Dr Woolgar were the presence and arrangement of the spindle cells and the hypercellularity of the biopsy. All three experts agreed that these were suspicious features of the biopsy. Professor Speight said they were highly suspicious and in one sense even more suspicious than the December 1996 biopsy.</p>

He said there were features suspicious for recurrent squamous cell carcinoma, although he concluded that the immunostaining(which had in fact not been done by Dr Harrison but were done for the trial) showed that the spindle cells were not  epithelial, indicating that there was no evidence of malignancy within the biopsies. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in">Professor Sloan in his report  said that in his opinion : “the first appearance of the SPCC is seen in the September 1995 biopsy, where there are bands of lozenge-shaped spindle cells. The diagnosis would have been difficult. The malignant cells are few in number and are in cords on the deeper aspect of the biopsy. The presence of radiation induced scar tissue tends to distract and contrasts with the typical straightforward diagnosis of carcinoma where the malignant cells tend to form abnormal sheets. It should be recognised that it is easier with hindsight, knowing the morphological features of the spindle-cell carcinoma in later specimens. Nevertheless a competent oral pathologist should be concerned about even small islands or cords of cells in a post radiation ulcer. In this situation the possibility of a recurrent carcinoma should be raised in the pathology report and deeper biopsies requested.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in">Dr Woolgar in her report wrote that “The granulation tissue includes interlacing bands of plump cells which largely account for the "busyness" of the tissue at low magnification.                                                                                              The epithelial proliferation and the cellularity of the granulation tissue are worrisome…The increase in cellularity due to reactive benign fibroblast proliferation usually occurs soon after radiotherapy and hence, I would be uneasy in explaining this late increased cellularity as an innocent reaction to radiotherapy. I would have issued a report that clearly indicated the presence of worrisome features and my uncertainty in distinguishing reactive post-radiation features from possible neoplastic features, and I would have recommended a repeat biopsy if there was ongoing clinical concern or continued suspicion of malignancy…. I am less certain about Specimen 4: Slides <span style="font-style:italic">457/95, </span>parts 1 and 2 (King's College Hospital; received 15 September 1995; reported 19 September 1995).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in">      Ms Mishcon pointed out that whereas Professor Sloan said that with the benefit of hindsight the malignant cells were scattered throughout the biopsy but there were more in cords on the deeper aspect, the evidence of Dr Woolgar and Professor Speight was that the suspicious spindle cells were in the granulation tissue. If there were no malignant cells on the deep aspect of the biopsy Professor Speight said that it would not have been possible for the putative cancer to have been a deep recurrence in which case any SPCC could not have come either from below or(because of the absence of epithelial dysplasia)from above. There seemed to me to be force in that point, although of course it depended for its force on the assumption that Professor Speight was right and Professor Sloan was wrong on whether there were suspicious cells on the deeper aspect. Ms Mishcon further submitted that the hypercellularity could be explicable as a reaction associated with a healing process due to the July 1995 biopsy.</p>

He submitted that Professor Speight’s attempt to explain away the appearance of the suspicious cells as the result of a plane of sectioning effect was facile and unconvincing on the basis that there was no reason why the random sectioning of cells should render them innocent as  opposed to malignant. Ms Mishcon’s response in her reply submissions was that Professor Speight had advanced a very good reason why the random sectioning of cells could make them innocent, namely that it made them appear pleomorphic when in reality they were not. This did not seem to me to address the sting of Mr Grace QC’s point, which was not that the random sectioning <span style="font-weight:bold">could</span> not be the explanation of the pleomorphism but rather that there was no convincing evidence  that it was in fact the explanation rather than the malignant one contended for by Professor Sloan having regard to the bands and the similarity with the 2001 biopsy.               </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.12in">Ultimately there were a number of factors which contributed to my conclusion that there was SPCC present in 1995.I refer to some of them, although inevitably an overall balancing process involves consideration of all the competing arguments and evidence. I was again persuaded by Professor Sloan’s evidence both as to what appears on the photos of  the slides and as to what he saw more generally under the microscope and his interpretation thereof. I was persuaded by the strength of both Professor Sloan’s and Dr Woolgar’s conviction that the hypercellularity was greater than would have been expected even allowing for the July 1995 ulcer. I was persuaded by the same factor which they emphasised in relation to December 1996,namely the increasing pattern of cellularity between the successive biopsies, the unexpected contrast between those of May 1994 and those of September 1995 and December 1996 and the similarity between the features in the September 1995 biopsy with some of those in the later biopsies. I took into account my finding that there was SPCC present in December 1996 which to my mind would have added very considerably to the co-incidence factor were it to be the case that all the suspicious features in September 1995 were in fact innocent despite their similarity to features in what on my finding would be SPCC present in 1996 as well as in 2001-2002. I also took into account the clinical context. Although one aspect of that assisted the Defendants, namely the July 1995 ulcer as a possible innocent explanation for the fibroblasts, the background of Professor Langdon’s certainty that there was a recurrent carcinoma in September 1995 plainly helps the Claimants. I also took into account my finding that the 2001 carcinoma was a recurrent or persistent one and not a new radiogenic primary.</p>

In those circumstances it is not necessary for me to make detailed findings in relation to the allegations of negligence against Professor Johnson and Dr Harrison in respect of 2001 since the effect of the admissions is that the Claimant is entitled to all such damages as flow from the fact of that delay. As mentioned earlier the main head of those damages is in respect of the appalling and avoidable pain and suffering that Mrs Manning suffered as a result of the delay in diagnosis. It does not include the damages flowing from the fact that she ultimately died of the cancer since it was accepted by the Claimant that even with a diagnosis in February 2001 there would have been a less than 50% chance of her having survived.</p>
