	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Just before 9pm on Sunday 14 February 1988, a young woman called Leanne Vilday (LV) walked into the Butetown police station in Cardiff and told the officers present that she was concerned for the safety of her friend Lynette White. She asked the officers to go with her to a flat which she had been renting at 7 James Street which was situated a short distance away.  Two police officers agreed to accompany her to the flat.   Once inside, the two officers went into the bedroom where they discovered the mutilated body of Lynette (as I shall call her in the remainder of this judgment).  It was obvious to the officers that Lynette had been subjected to a brutal and sustained attack with a knife or knives.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">That same night South Wales Police (SWP) launched an extensive investigation.  All the Claimants in these proceedings were then serving police officers of SWP and they all participated to a greater or lesser extent in the investigation as it unfolded.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On 7 December 1988 six men were arrested and detained; they were Stephen Miller (SM), Anthony Miller (AM), Ronald Actie (RA), Yusef Abdullahi (YA), Martin Tucker (MT) and Rashid Omar (RO).  On 9 December two more men, Anthony (Tony) Paris (TP) and John Actie (JA) were arrested and detained. All these men were interviewed under caution at length. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In due course, AM, MT and RO were released without charge.

In the remainder of this judgment, when it is appropriate to do so, these five men are referred to collectively as “the original defendants”.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In October 1989 their trial began at the Swansea Crown Court.  Just before he was due to sum up, the trial judge, McNeill J, died suddenly.  A second trial took place between April 1990 and November 1990; the trial judge was Leonard J.  After a long period of deliberation the jury convicted SM, TP and YA of murder and acquitted JA and RA. The three convicted defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division).  Their convictions were quashed in December 1992.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In 1999 a decision was made by the then Chief Constable of SWP to commission an independent review of the investigation which had led to the prosecution of the original defendants.  The review commenced in June 1999 and was carried out by two experienced retired senior police officers unconnected with SWP, namely William Hacking and John Thornley.  They reported their findings in May 2000.  Traditionally, this investigation has been referred to as LW1 but in this judgment I will refer to the investigation as the “Hacking and Thornley Review” and the report which followed it as the “Hacking and Thornley Report”.  On 23 August 2000, SWP formed an inquiry team to reinvestigate the murder of Lynette.  The reinvestigation was given the name “Operation Mistral”.  Subsequently this investigation also became known as LW2 although I shall refer to it as Operation Mistral.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Very shortly after JG’s plea, Sir Anthony Burden, then Chief Constable of SWP, decided that there should be an investigation into the events which had led to the charging and prosecution of the original defendants.

The Claimant, Mr Hicks, was arrested on suspicion of having committed those offences on 26 June 2007.  For ease of reference, hereinafter, I will refer to the original investigation as LW1.  I hope this will not cause confusion to those who are used to describing the “Hacking and Thornley Review” as LW1.</p>

I accept, of course, that in order to make a judgment about whether the Claimants were the victims of the torts they allege it will be necessary to relate in some detail the evidence adduced before me relating to LW1 and Operation Mistral.  I also accept that to a limited extent it will be necessary for me to reach conclusions about some of the events which are said to have occurred during the course of those investigations. However, I cannot emphasise too strongly that it is not my task to adjudicate upon the guilt or innocence of the Claimants in respect of the offences for which they were all arrested or upon the guilt or innocence of Claimants 1 to 13 in relation to the offences with which they were charged and in respect of which they were prosecuted.  It is the conduct of the police officers who were engaged in investigating the Claimants as part of LW3 which is, primarily, under the microscope in these proceedings.  Stripped to its essentials, I have to make a number of judgments about the thought processes, decisions, acts and omissions of those officers as LW3 ran its course.</p>

Each of the Claimants gave evidence before me (apart from Mrs O’Brien) as did many of the principal decision makers involved in LW3. I also heard evidence from a number of police officers who had discrete roles within LW3.  As I hope will be obvious I have taken full and proper account of the written and oral evidence given by these persons.  However, in my judgment, by far the most important source of evidence available to me upon which to reach a judgment about the acts and/or omissions of the officers who participated in LW3 is the voluminous documentation generated in the successive investigations, LW1, Operation Mistral and LW3.  During the course of this judgment I will, of necessity, refer to a significant amount of documentation. Even so, the documentation referred to by me will be a comparatively small percentage of the documents generated in those investigations.</p>

I do not find that surprising but, of course, I have scrutinised the statements with care so as to ensure that they are not attempts to re-write history.  As it happens, the important aspects of those officers’ evidence related to the arrests of the Claimants and the reasons for the arrests. Upon those issues, there is a large amount of contemporaneous or near contemporaneous documentation which provides a reasonably sure guide as to why particular Claimants were arrested and what happened when they were arrested. </p>

That is simply for ease of reference. Since none of the Claimants are now serving police officers I propose to refer to them as Mr or Mrs as the case may be even when describing their roles and activities in LW1. I will adopt the same practice in relation to the police officers involved in Operation Mistral and LW3; I do that simply to avoid any confusion which might arise about their rank at the time of the investigation compared with their rank at the present time.  One of the important witnesses for the defence during the trial before me was His Honour Judge Dean QC. Throughout the trial (including when he was giving evidence) he was referred to as Mr Dean.

Its relevance will become clear as this judgment unfolds.  Section 2 describes the course of LW1, the prosecution of the original defendants and the appeals of SM, TP and YA.  Section 3 is concerned with the salient features of Operation Mistral.  Section 4 describes the main investigative steps undertaken in LW3 and the main decisions made during the course of the investigation. The time period covered in this section is July 2003 to 2 March 2009.  Section 5 is a description of the main events leading to the trial before Sweeney J, the trial itself and other events which occurred before and after the commencement of these proceedings.  In Section 6, I will set out the law which is applicable in this case.  Section 7 contains my analysis of the claims for misfeasance in public office.  In section 8, I consider each claim for false imprisonment.  In section 9 I consider the remaining claims, namely the claims for malicious prosecution brought by Mr Daniels, Mr Gillard, Mr Page and Mr Hicks and the claims under the Human Rights Act 1998 brought or proposed to be brought by Mrs Coliandris and Mr Morgan.  Section 10 contains my conclusions in summary form.</p>

I have taken account, as I said I would, of all the written material which counsel produced.  I say now, however, that given the extent of the material produced it will not be possible to refer to many of the points made during the course of this judgment. I have attempted to highlight what I regard as the strongest points made by each party in support of their respective cases but to go beyond that would lengthen this judgment beyond acceptable bounds. </p>

He remained a detective for most of the remainder of his career.  By July 1988, Mr Mouncher had become a detective inspector.  He was then assigned to the Serious Crime Squad (East) and, more or less simultaneously, he joined LW1.  He was given the role of an “action allocator”.  As that description suggests Mr Mouncher’s main role was to ensure that decisions made by his superiors were allocated appropriately and carried into effect. Mr Mouncher performed that role in the months leading to the arrest and charge of the original defendants.  After his involvement in LW1 had come to an end, Mr Mouncher engaged in a number of different roles.  He retired from the police force in 2001 with the rank of detective chief inspector.  </p>

Following the discovery of Lynette’s body Mr Powell was the first senior officer to attend the murder scene.  He was assigned to LW1 from the outset.  His main role was to oversee the officers who were responsible for interviewing and obtaining witness statements.

This involved tracking down the clients of prostitutes who were known to work in the Butetown area.  Once a client was tracked down a blood sample would be taken so that it could be compared with blood which had been found at the murder scene.  By November 1988 Mr Greenwood had become involved in the “ground actions” team.  The actions allocated to him varied in nature but they included tracing and interviewing witnesses and suspects.  Mr Greenwood says in his witness statement that throughout LW1 he was partnered with Mr Seaford and there is no reason to doubt what he says.</p>

Such persons would obviously include those who lived in Flats 2 and 3 at 7 James Street and those who regularly frequented clubs and pubs such as the North Star, the Casablanca, the Montmerence, the Dowlais, the Custom House and the Glendower (these being clubs and pubs frequented by Lynette, other prostitutes and men who associated with prostitutes).  There was a need to identify any persons having any connection with 7 James Street, particularly in the days leading to Lynette’s death.  There was a need to examine the murder scene and preserve any relevant evidence for forensic examination and there was a need to obtain pathological evidence.  All these lines of enquiry began within hours of the discovery of Lynette’s body.</p>

Lynette’s body was still in the position in which it had been found.  It was clear to both Dr. Whiteside and Professor Knight that Lynette had been murdered in the bedroom of the flat in which she was discovered although her body had been moved within that room.  A very thorough forensic investigation of the room and the flat was recognised to be vital. That investigation began during 15 February and continued throughout the days that followed.</p>

In all the years since that time, the view has remained that Lynette was murdered in the early hours of Sunday 14 February 1988.

I should also record that MG had apparently provided information to the press which was not necessarily consistent with his denial to the police that he had any relevant information about the murder. On 17 February an article appeared in a local newspaper which related that MG had “heard noises, doors slamming and men’s and women’s voices throughout the night” coming from the flat in which Lynette was found.</p>

However, as the investigation progressed, information was being provided to the police which tended to suggest that LV knew more about the circumstances of the murder than she had divulged.  For example, the police obtained witness statements from Claire and Julia Thomas, young women who were friends/acquaintances of both Lynette and LV.  In those statements they suggested that on the morning after Lynette’s body had been discovered LV had told them that she had seen Lynette’s body lying in the flat at James Street before she had gone to the Butetown Police Station.  Claire and Julia Thomas were former residents of the flat in which the murder took place.  Perhaps more importantly, a woman by the name of Maxine Campbell made a witness statement on 31 May 1988 in which she recounted a conversation with LV in which she (LV) had informed her that she knew who had killed Lynette and she named SM and YA.  Miss Campbell told the police that although LV was drunk at the time of this conversation she appeared serious about what she had said.</p>

While he had been standing outside Flat 1 he had seen two persons whom he named as Barry (a homosexual man from Bristol) and a girl whom he described but did not name (although the description was consistent with it being LV).  The girl told him that she had seen a body and that he should get the police.  When Mr Ludlow challenged PA as to whether he was telling the truth he gave a different account.  In this second account he suggested that MG had killed Lynette after having had sex with her and having robbed her of £45.  When challenged about this account, PA provided further and, to an extent, contradictory details but still maintained that MG had killed Lynette.  At this point in the interview Mr Ludlow involved Mr Powell.  Both men spoke to PA and made it clear to him that they did not believe what he had told them.  At that point PA broke down and gave a third account in which he admitted killing Lynette.  He said that he had gone to her flat, that he had wrestled her to the ground, sat astride her and then “stabbed her repeatedly in the chest, abdomen and both arms”.  PA said that Lynette had put her arms up across the front of her face to defend herself.  He said, too, that when she was dead he had cut both her wrists and then her throat and when the blood started to spurt out he walked out of the flat and downstairs and out onto James Street.  </p>

They put to him questions about what Lynette had been wearing at the time she was killed and what furniture had been in the flat.  PA’s answers were clearly and obviously wrong and when this was pointed out to him he admitted that he had been telling lies all along.  That said, he went on to assert that he had obtained knowledge of the stab wounds sustained by Lynette from speaking to LV which, no doubt, reinforced the view of the police officers in LW1 that LV had not disclosed all that she knew to the police.</p>

Ms Sandrone was one of three partners who owned and/or operated the Dowlais Club which was situated near James Street.  In her statement she recounted a conversation which she said had taken place about three weeks after the murder between Noreen Amiel (one of her business partners) and a man whom she described as a “half caste” and who was known to her by the name “Dulla”.  According to Ms Sandrone this person had told Noreen Amiel that he had killed Lynette and that he had cut his own hands in the process.  On the face of it, this evidence implicated YA in the murder.  However before Ms Sandrone’s account could be checked with Ms Amiel, information emerged which tended to suggest that over the weekend when Lynette was murdered YA had been working on board a ship known as “The Coral Sea” which was berthed at Barry Dock.</p>

Her account was that YA had told her that the police were looking for him in connection with the murder and that as a consequence he was going to leave the Cardiff area by taking a job on a ship.  The statement taken from Mrs Amiel also described a conversation she had with YA on 19 May – the day he had given his witness statement to the police.  In this conversation YA described how he had been “pulled in” by the police and how this had frightened him.  Although Mrs Amiel provided the information which I have summarised above on 27 May and a statement was written out on that date Mrs Amiel would not sign it.  The statement was not signed until 1 February 1989 following a conversation she had with Mr Mouncher.</p>

PA had made suggestions about the murder which the police had rejected as untrue and information had been provided to the police which suggested that LV knew more about the circumstances surrounding the murder than she had been prepared to divulge in her witness statements.  LV, AP, MG and PA had given a number of witness statements to the police.  In due course these four persons became known as the “core four” for reasons which will become obvious.

TP had been interviewed on or about 23 February following the discovery of a knife and an axe at his home after his arrest for stealing.

The Professor’s speciality was the psychological profiling of suspects in criminal cases.  Over the course of the following few months the Professor made an assessment of the profile of the person most likely to be Lynette’s assailant.  A convenient summary of Professor Canter’s views found its way into a report which Mr Mouncher prepared for the Deputy SIO on 25 October 1988.  I need not set out the detail; the Professor’s view was that the killer was likely to have been a lone assailant who was a client or former client of Lynette.</p>

In itself, this was not significant since LV was the tenant of the flat at the material time and PA had disclosed at an early stage that he had been a visitor to the flat when Julia and Claire Thomas had been the tenants in 1987.

Further, there was blood found behind a curtain and on a skirting board in the bedroom of the flat.

The opinion that this blood was that of a man was founded upon the discovery by the forensic scientists that there was a “Y” chromosome within the blood (indicating the blood belonged to a male). The working assumption was that this blood had been deposited by a male attacker who had, himself, been injured during the course of the attack on Lynette.  In due course the “foreign blood” was compared with samples of the blood of the original defendants. The comparison showed that it was not their blood.</p>

It shows that on 17 November AP attended the police station at 10.20am and remained there until 6.55pm and it is common ground that while she was at the police station she was interviewed on two occasions by Messrs Daniels and Gillard.  AP was not interviewed under caution but Mr Daniels and Mr Gillard were instructed to make a contemporaneous record of the questions that they asked and the answers that she gave.  Both Mr Daniels and Mr Gillard told me that they acted in accordance with their instructions when the written record was made and that, so far as possible, the precise words spoken were recorded. The Defendant does not necessarily accept that this is what occurred.  There is no dispute that at some stage after the written records had been made typed versions were produced which accurately re-produced the written versions.

AP also agreed that she was then nervous and she explained this by saying that at about 2.00am SM had called at her flat with “other docks boys” whom she could not identify.  He had come to her flat to look for Lynette.  He had threatened her because he believed that Lynette was staying with her in her flat.   She went on to describe how at about 3.00am she had been looking out of the window of her flat towards 7 James Street.  She had seen a flickering light on the first floor above the betting shop.  She had also seen a car in the street below.  The driver was a white man and he had no passengers.  When asked what kind of car she had seen AP replied “a taxi black and white like a city centre taxi like a Cortina like they’ve got” although she also said the car did not have a taxi sign on the roof.  When AP was asked why she had not mentioned the taxi in her previous statements she said that it was because she was afraid of SM.

It suffices that I say that AP alleged that (a) she had always known the persons who had come to her flat were SM, JA, RA, YA and a man called Tony Brace (b) these men and, in particular, SM, JA and RA were in James Street in the vicinity of No 7 for quite some time during the early hours of the Sunday morning (c) sometime after the men had visited her flat she had heard screams apparently coming from 7 James Street and at the time when she heard screaming SM, JA and RA were in the vicinity (d) approximately 30 minutes after the screaming had ended a taxi had arrived in James Street driven by Jack Ellis (e) at some point RA had entered 7 James Street after being let into the building by a man whom she thought had come from Flat 2 and (f) TP was also present from time to time in James Street in the sense that he was “coming back and forth” as if he was selling drugs to the others.  Just before the interview concluded Mr Gillard asked AP whether LV had been with her when SM arrived at about 2.00am.  AP replied that LV had not been in the flat; according to AP, LV had not been in the flat that night although she had come to the flat at about 9.00am on the Sunday morning. </p>

All the original defendants were in and around James Street in the early hours of 14 February.  At some stage there had been screaming coming from number 7.

Both of us heard the screams as Leanne left the flat to see what had happened.  I watched her from the window of the flat and saw her going towards Babs Bistro.  I didn’t see her again until about ten minutes later when she came back to my flat.  She said “Lynette’s dead”.

PA’s answers were not wholly consistent with accounts he had given in previous statements but they were consistent to the extent that PA denied being in or in the vicinity of 7 James Street at any material time.  There followed a break of almost an hour.  In the next session PA changed his account quite dramatically.  PA said that he had gone to MG’s flat at around midnight on 13/14 February.  There came a point in time when someone rang the doorbell at the front entrance to 7 James Street.  MG left his flat to open the front door and then returned.  Shortly after, PA heard a scream.  He left MG’s flat almost immediately and saw a “girl” coming through the front door from the street.  PA described how “the girl” forced open the door of Flat 1, went inside and then came out to say that someone had been murdered in the flat.  PA returned to MG’s flat and at about the time that dawn was breaking he went to the flat of Julie and Claire Thomas. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Following these revelations there was another break of approximately one hour. In the session which followed Messers Jennings and Stephen challenged PA about why his account before the break had been so different to any previous account he had given.  He claimed that he had been frightened to tell the truth previously.  PA was then pressed as to whether his account before the break was truthful and he was invited to tell the officers yet again what had happened.  Much of what he then said was consistent with his account before the break.  Additionally, however, he said that approximately 1½ hours after arriving at MG’s flat he heard male voices in the street.  It was shortly after this that MG had gone to open the front door.  Upon his return, PA asked MG who had been at the door.  MG refused to say.  Next, PA heard a scream.  PA repeated that he left MG’s flat to see what had happened and then he had seen a girl coming up the stairs.  He maintained that he did not know her name but he described her and where she lived; he was obviously describing LV.  According to PA the girl forced open the door of Flat 1 and both she and PA when into the flat.  They discovered the body.  PA was asked about the lighting in the flat.  He said that the only source of light was from the street lights outside.  However, he added a detail to the effect that “the girl” had asked him to put the light on and he had found a switch. However, when he had turned it on no light was produced.  After leaving the flat PA returned to the flat of MG.  He was so distressed by what he had seen that he was physically sick in the toilet of MG’s flat.</p>

On this occasion the interviewing officers were Messrs Seaford and Pugh and it was Mr Pugh who made a written record of what was said (which was later typed up).  In his oral evidence Mr Pugh told me that between the first and second interview he had a conversation with MG in which MG told him the substance of what he was later to disclose in the second interview.  This conversation was not recorded in interview format.  It had been an “informal conversation” and, according to Mr Pugh, MG had decided to confide in Mr Pugh because the two men had built up some kind of rapport because they both came from the South Wales Valleys. Mr Pugh’s pocket book for 22 November has long since been destroyed. Accordingly, if Mr Pugh made a record of the conversation it no longer exists and there is now no written record which confirms that the conversation took place.  That said, it is possible and, indeed, plausible that such a conversation did take place, not least because Mr Pugh was involved in the interview which then followed. </p>

PA’s interview spanned a very long period but came to an end at 5pm. He accepted being at MG’s flat over a number of hours during the night of 13/14 February.  He was in the flat when there were male voices in the street, when MG had apparently let a person or persons into the building and when he had heard a scream from the flat below. He had left the flat to investigate the screams and he had then seen a girl in the building whom he did not identify by name but whom he described and said that she lived nearby. Both the girl and he had entered Flat 1 and seen Lynette’s dead body.  In an interview during the morning, MG had denied having any knowledge of any of the circumstances described by PA; MG had been alone and asleep in his flat. However, in the interview which began just minutes after the interview with PA had ended, MG confirmed that he had opened the front door as described by PA and that there were three or four men at the door two of whom he knew to be YA and RA and a third, almost certainly, was MT.  Meanwhile between 3.40 and 5.25 AP was at the police station making a statement in which she said that LV was with her in her flat during the night of 13/14 February but that after hearing screams from the vicinity of 7 James Street LV had gone out to investigate and upon her return had said that Lynette had been murdered.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is clear that the information provided to the police by AP on 17 November (to some extent) and by MG on 22 November (to a greater extent) had the potential to implicate YA in Lynette’s murder.  Yet YA had made a statement to the police in May to the effect that he was working on the Coral Sea in the early hours of Sunday morning.  Further, quite early on in the course of LW1 police officers had made contact with at least two persons, Mr Peter McCarthy and Mr Lawrence Mann, who had worked on the Coral Sea in February.  Mr McCarthy had told the police that he had worked on the ship over the night 13/14 February and had also suggested that YA had been on board during that time. In a witness statement dated 8 June Mr Mann had suggested that he had worked on the ship from midday on Sunday and that “Dullah” had been present from that time. The police had also taken statements from Ms Jacqueline Harris who was YA’s partner and the daughter of Peter McCarthy.  She had said nothing to contradict YA’s assertion that he was on the Coral Sea during the night 13/14 February. Indeed in her statement of 6 June she had said that her father had picked him up to work on a ship on the morning of Friday 12 February and that he had returned to their home on the Monday or Tuesday.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Not surprisingly, however, as information about YA’s possible involvement in the murder began to emerge steps were taken to obtain further evidence as to his whereabouts at the material time.  On 29 November Mr Daniels took a witness statement from a man called Sidney Harrop.  Mr Harrop was a welder who resided in Oxton, near Birkenhead.  He had travelled to South Wales in the early hours of Saturday February 13, in the company of his brother-in- law, Ian Moore and a man called John Hulse in order to work on the Coral Sea.  Mr Harrop estimated that the men arrived in Barry Docks at about 11.00am and boarded the ship at that time.  He told Mr Daniels that he worked until about 10.00pm when he went ashore to have a meal and then continued working from about 11.00pm to 3.00am on the Sunday morning when he went ashore again.  After a period of about 5 hours ashore Mr Harrop returned to the ship and then remained on the ship until Friday 19 February during which period the ship sailed to and from La Rochelle in France. In this witness statement Mr Harrop described a number of people who were present on the Coral Sea.  He also mentioned some men by name. The statement did not specify whether Mr Harrop knew YA and, if so, whether YA had been aboard the ship at the same time as Mr. Harrop. </p>

The witness statement was taken by Mr Stephen although it is common ground that Mr Jennings was also present when the statement was made.  PA repeated some of the information about the night of 13/14 February which he had provided on 22 November but with additional details.  First, he disclosed that he had looked out of the window of MG’s flat when he heard the doorbell ring.  When he did so he saw four male persons standing outside 7 James Street although he did not recognise any of them and could not describe them.  Second, he revealed that the girl whom he had seen in 7 James Street was LV.  Third, PA described how, when he was leaving the bedroom of Flat 1, he was confronted by a man.  He could give no detailed description of the man but, according to PA, the man threatened that he (PA) would be killed if he divulged to the police what he had seen.  </p>

The statement was consistent in many respects with the record of interview of 22 November but there were differences of detail.  First, AP described looking out of her flat window after SM’s visit to her flat.  She saw SM, JA, YA, TP and Tony Brace.  They were all in the vicinity of James Street and near No 7.  Second, a short time later, she saw her neighbour Ms Mathews and at about that time she also saw a car pull up outside 7 James Street which was a dark coloured Ford Cortina and “similar to those used by taxi firms”.  Third, at some stage in this sequence of events LV returned to her flat.  While the two women were together in the flat they heard screaming coming from the direction of 7 James Street.  LV went to investigate and AP watched from the window.  She saw RA and YA coming out of the front door of 7 James Street.</p>

In it she asserted that her previous statements were true but that important facts had been omitted from her previous accounts.  She then went on to describe how, at about 1.00am on the Sunday morning, while she was in AP’s flat, she heard three screams which she described as terrifying.  They came from the direction of her flat in James Street and she decided to go the flat to investigate.  The first thing that she noticed was a car which she recognised as belonging to RA parked in the street near No 7.  She entered the front door of No 7 and ran up the stairs to her flat.  She saw MT and then PA.  She entered her flat and saw RA, SM, YA and another black male whom she did not recognise.  She saw Lynette lying on the floor on her back with one foot resting on the bed which was in the room.  She realised that Lynette was dead.  She ran out of the building and returned to AP’s flat.  She did not tell AP what she had seen.  She bathed and then left the flat and walked to the North Star Club.  When she arrived at the Club, RA was there but none of the other men whom she had seen in the flat.</p>

He recognised YA and RA and a person whom he knew as “Tucker” (MT) and he went on to give a description of the fourth male.  MG saw YA enter the building before returning to his own flat.  Some short time later he heard the raised voices of more than one male followed by hysterical screams from a female.  The noise came from Flat 1.  PA went to investigate and MG stood on the landing outside his flat from which point he saw LV standing on the landing outside Flat 1.  When PA returned he told MG that there had been a murder.

That was Jack Ellis, the taxi driver.  According to the B59 he was present at the station between 10.45am and 9.15pm. In a witness statement made to LW3 officers dated 19 May 2004 Mr Ellis gave a vivid description of the events which he said occurred during the course of his “third contact” with the police which, I am invited to conclude, was on 6 December. Be that as it may, what seems clear is that Mr Ellis was at the police station for the purpose of being interviewed. The B59 records the name of the interviewing officer as “B Tooby”. Mr Ellis was at the police station for a period in excess of 10 hours and yet no witness statement was taken from him and, as far as I am aware, no written record of any kind was made about what he said.

He acknowledged looking out of the window of MG’s flat immediately after hearing the doorbell.  He saw four males standing outside 7 James Street; according to him he did not know them and he could not describe them.  PA also acknowledged that the girl he had seen inside 7 James Street was LV.  AP was also looking out onto James Street that night.  She said that after SM, JA, RA, TP and Tony Brace had visited her at about 2.00am she saw them in the street in the vicinity of 7 James Street.  A short time later a car pulled up outside 7 James Street; it was similar to the type of car used by taxi firms.  That, of course, was a different account to the one she had given in her second interview on 22 November when she claimed to have seen a taxi pulling up in James Street which was driven by Jack Ellis and which had arrived after she had heard screams from LV’s flat.  Until 6 December LV had never acknowledged being in James Street on the night of 13/14 February.  Her account of what she saw and heard that night is set out at paragraph 119 above and no purpose would be served by repeating it.  MG’s account was very similar to that which he provided in his second interview on 22 November.  However, in his statement of 6 December MG acknowledged that after hearing the screaming he had gone to stand on the landing outside flat and while he was there he had seen LV on the landing below, near the front door of Flat 1.  </p>

The evidence of AP had the potential to implicate SM, JA, YA, TP and Tony Brace; the evidence of MG implicated YA, RA and MT and a fourth male whom he could not identify and PA had named none of the persons whom he had seen except that he had acknowledged seeing LV. </p>

It is more difficult to understand why AM was arrested.  He had not been named as a person involved in Lynette’s death by any of the core four and he had not been implicated, directly, in Lynette’s murder by any other person.  I can only presume that notwithstanding the fact that Mrs Perriam and AP had said that JA had been in James Street at the relevant time a decision was taken that it was more likely that AM was the unidentified male whom LV had described as being present in the flat upon her arrival.</p>

Those Claimants deny that allegation; they maintain that the B59 accurately records what occurred.  The LW1 policy log is silent on the subject.

She was then being attacked by TP. LV and AP tried to help her but to no avail.  At this point, according to AP, she was punched in the mouth, causing her to bleed.

They wanted advice/direction from a senior officer about whether AP should be treated as a suspect or a witness. Neither Mr Daniels nor Mr Gillard made a written record to this effect. However, having heard oral evidence from a number of sources about this issue, I accept that Mr Gillard sought advice from Mr Morgan who (having taken advice himself) told Mr Gillard that AP should not be treated as a suspect and that Mr Daniels and he should continue to take a witness statement from her.</p>

In due course she made two witness statements that day; one a reasonably lengthy statement; the second was a statement of no more than a few lines.  Each of the statements was written by Mrs Coliandris and it is now agreed that Mr Hicks was also present when the statements were taken although there is nothing on the face of the statements or within the B59 which shows his involvement.  These statements were, respectively, the 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> statements made by LV.  It is also common ground that LV’s statements were taken during the course of the afternoon of 11 December i.e. after AP had left the police station. However, it is not possible to know that or deduce it from the statements themselves.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I need only summarise the contents of the detailed statement.  For the first time, LV asserted that she had gone to 7 James Street with AP and that the two women had gone into LV’s flat together.  When they first arrived JA was outside the flat (although he was within the building) but after they had entered the bedroom he followed them in.  At that point the persons in the bedroom were Lynette, the original defendants, AP and LV.  She did not know whether Lynette was alive or dead. She saw TP stabbing Lynette; however, it was clear to her from what was said that all the men present had participated in an attack upon Lynette. She said that RA, JA and TP forced her to cut Lynette’s wrist with a knife. She was also told by SM to cut Lynette’s throat but she refused to do it.  She described how AP was “chopsing” at the men. In consequence, either JA or TP punched AP to her mouth and caused her to bleed.  LV said, in terms, that MT was not present in the bedroom during these events and she made no mention of AM.  She did not remember seeing either PA or MG outside or inside the flat.</p>

That appears to be correct given a further entry in Mr Morgan’s diary for 9 December.  In any event, the Claimants do not seriously contest the Defendant’s suggestion and I am satisfied on balance on probabilities that LW1 officers had become aware on 9 or, at the latest on 10 December that the blood group of the “foreign blood” matched that of AP. </p>

They were claiming to be eyewitnesses to the murder of Lynette or its immediate aftermath and they were acknowledging that they had engaged in cutting her wrists.  Both of them named the original defendants as being within 7 James Street at or about the time of the murder.  LV had previously mentioned MT being present but he was not mentioned in her statement of 11 December.  AP maintained that JA remained outside the flat although within the building.  She had AM as one of the persons attacking Lynette.  AP’s description of events was consistent with Lynette being alive when LV and AP got to the flat and being subjected to a ferocious attack in their presence.  LV’s account was much more consistent with Lynette having been killed before the two women arrived.  On her account, only one person, TP, engaged in stabbing Lynette while the two persons were present.  Both women said that they had been forced to cut Lynette.  They had each cut a wrist.  Both women said that AP had been struck to the mouth by one of the original defendants causing her to bleed although they described the circumstances in which the assault occurred in very different terms.</p>

In particular, the evidence from Mr Hughes satisfies me that when AP told Mr Daniels and Mr Gillard that she had participated in the attack upon Lynette, Mr Hughes’ advice was sought by Mr Morgan about whether AP should be treated as a witness or a suspect.  I am satisfied, too, that it was upon Mr Hughes’ advice to Mr Morgan (passed on to Mr Daniels and Mr Gillard) that Mr Daniels and Mr Gillard continued to treat her as a witness notwithstanding what she had said.  The precise time when the various conversations took place cannot be identified; nonetheless I am satisfied that they occurred.</p>

On 5 January 1989 Mr Seaford took another witness statement from Ms Prance.  On the same date Mrs Perriam made another witness statement.  It began by reciting that she had made two previous statements to the police relating to her sighting of four men in James Street at about 1.30am on 14 February – which would not be consistent with her having made a statement on 10 December 1988.  She went on to explain that she was not certain that RO was one of the persons she had seen but expressed herself to be “quite satisfied” that she had seen JA. On 5 January, too, yet another statement (written by Mr Murray) was taken from MG. It added nothing of substance to MG’s account of the night of the murder although it confirmed the accuracy of what he had said in interview and in statement form on 22 November 1988 and it confirmed that PA had gone to the murder scene after hearing screams.  Additionally, the statement described discussions which had occurred between MG and YA, RA and others in the period after 22 November.  In particular, he recounted a conversation with YA in which YA had asserted that he knew MG.  That led MG to believe, so he said, that YA was saying that he knew MG because he had let him into 7 James Street on the night of the murder.  On 9 January a witness statement was taken from Teresa Sidoric.  In this statement Ms Sidoric described going to visit SM at Cardiff prison on 17 December 1988.  She was accompanied by Deborah Taylor and SM’s sister, a young girl called Nicole Gordon.  The pertinent passage in Ms Sidoric’s witness statement reads as follows:-</p>

It should be noted that Mr Daniels and Mr Gillard did not travel to Birkenhead despite their earlier involvement in taking statements from those witnesses. Mr Mouncher took the statements from Mr Harrop and Mr Hulse; Mr Moore’s statement was taken by Mr Fish.  Mr Harrop’s statement was taken on 11 January. This witness statement provided much greater detail than the witness statement which he had provided on 29 November 1988.  Further, in this witness statement Mr Harrop accepted that YA had been working on the Coral Sea; however, he said that he had not seen him working on the Coral Sea on Saturday 13 February or Sunday 14 February.  Mr Harrop’s recollection was that he first saw YA working on the Coral Sea on Tuesday 16 February.  Mr Moore’s statement was also made on 11 January.  This statement was in similar terms (albeit in more detail) to the statement he had provided on 30 November 1988.  Mr Mouncher took a further statement from Mr Hulse on 12 January.  This statement contained substantially more detail than Mr Hulse’s statement of 30 November.  He acknowledged that he had seen YA at some point over the weekend when he had been working on the Coral Sea.  His recollection was that he had seen him early on the Saturday evening (i.e. 13 February) when a group of men from the Coral Sea had left the ship to go for something to eat in a nearby restaurant.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On 5 April the Deputy SIO, Mr Davies, made a written report to Mr John Williams, the SIO, which provided an overview of the investigation and the proceedings to that time.  In his report Mr Davies summarised the effect of the witness statements obtained from the core four and, further, he made a detailed assessment of their likely impact as witnesses referring to their personal circumstances, their previous convictions and personality.  He described AP as “volatile and unstable in temperament”.  She was said to have an “in-built animal cunning which has held her in good stead in the profession she carries out”. He noted that AP’s evidence at the committal hearing had been, to an extent, inconsistent with the contents of her witness statement.  LV was said to be in fear of all the accused; she would require careful handling by the officers looking after her to ensure that she came ‘up to scratch’ at the Crown Court.  However, the Deputy SIO concluded that if LV was handled properly and she was in the right frame of mind she would make a good witness.  MG was assessed as being, potentially, a very good witness who would give his evidence “in a strong forceful manner”.  PA, however, was assessed to be a very poor witness who would say whatever was required of him and under cross-examination would capitulate.</p>

Mr Davies described how at first the forensic scientists involved considered that the blood was that of a male because it contained the Y chromosome.  Later the possibility that the blood may have come from a mixture of male and female blood was considered.  That, of course, was consistent with the investigation which was being undertaken in February by Mr Gill – see paragraph 154 above.  By the time he wrote his report Mr Davies felt able to assert that “there is no doubt that the blood on the jeans and sock is Angela Psaila’s”.  Mr Davies did not explain how he had come to this conclusion.  Immediately after expressing it Mr Davies quoted from a statement of Mr Gill which did no more than suggest the possibility that the blood staining on the legs of Lynette’s jeans could have contained a mixture of male and female blood.  </p>

AP remained in this accommodation for about a week; LV, however, was in “safe” accommodation until the second trial of the original defendants had come to an end. The process of protecting AP and LV was known as “Operation Safehouse”; a number of officers were involved and a diary was kept at the accommodation which recorded movements in and out of the accommodation and also the names of the officers who visited as well as those who were charged with the responsibility of keeping LV safe.  It is common ground some of the Claimants and, in particular, Messrs Morgan and Mouncher visited LV from time to time.</p>

All the witness statements to which I have referred in this section of my judgment (apart from the statement of Mr Neil) were either served by the prosecution or formed part of the unused material. The trial ended on 26 February 1990 with the discharge of the jury due to the untimely death of the trial judge. PA did not give evidence; he was considered to be too unreliable to be called on behalf of the prosecution.</p>

I need not describe in any detail what followed.  Many years later, however, as we shall see, LW3 officers suspected and then became convinced that Mr Mouncher had told Mr Massey in some of their meetings that he/SWP would help Mr Massey with his parole application and that this “inducement” was at least one of the reasons why Mr Massey had made his witness statement incriminating TP and thereafter given evidence to the same effect at the trials of the original defendants.</p>

In general terms, at least, the three gave evidence in accordance with the statements they had made to the police in November/December 1988.

He expressed the opinion that Lynette had been the victim of more than 50 stab/slash wounds.  Some, perhaps a good many, of the stabs/slashes had been inflicted after death.  In Professor Knight’s view, the cause of Lynette’s death was a large wound to her throat and multiple stab wounds. The knife which had been used to cut Lynette’s throat had severed the carotid artery. There were other important features of his evidence.  First, the Professor expressed the clear view that a knife which had been in the possession of TP and which had been seized by the police was not the knife which had caused Lynette’s wounds.  Second, it was at least likely that Lynette’s throat had been cut quite early on in the attack upon her and that unconsciousness and death had followed quite quickly – an opinion which was not consistent with the evidence given by LV and AP about what they had seen of Lynette’s state when they had gone into the flat as they said they had.  Third, however, in an important detail the Professor’s evidence supported that given by LV and AP. He told the jury that both of Lynette’s wrists had been cut.  </p>

Dr Whiteside gave opinion evidence to the effect that the “foreign blood” may have been that of AP coupled with some blood or fluid from an unknown male.  That would explain the Y chromosome. The alternative possibility was that the blood was that of a male person but who had the same blood group as AP.  The suggestion was put forcibly on behalf of the defence that the “foreign” blood was that of a male (and, therefore, not that of AP) and that it did not match the blood of any of the original defendants (which was correct) but Dr Whiteside would not be deflected from his view that it was possible that the blood was that of AP but that somehow it had become mixed with the blood or fluid of an unknown male.  Dr Gill also supported the possibility that the blood was that of AP but it had become mixed with blood or fluid of an unknown male.</p>

It is largely for that reason that the case has taken as long as it has – not exclusively, but largely.  You may well come to the conclusion that the police exerted pressure on Vilday and Psaila and on Grommek to give their accounts, and that they continued to do so as those accounts began to emerge and develop. You may think that the police believed that those witnesses had something to tell and were determined to elicit their versions of what they saw.  And you will ask yourselves whether that was simply the proper zeal of professional investigators trying to do their duty by solving a brutal and (for other people) frightening crime.  On the other hand, some defence counsel have suggested that the police went beyond what was proper, that they shut their eyes to the witnesses’ involvement and treated them as witnesses when they should have been treated as suspects.  On the other hand you may think that realistically the police needed witnesses, and had to make a decision whom to use as witnesses and whom to charge amongst those people they believed to have been present at the time of the murder.  It has even been suggested that the police were deliberately putting words and names into the mouths of the witnesses and giving them versions of the events to retail.

He has admitted playing games with counsel at the magistrates’ court when he changed his story about essential matters from time to time; and he said (as I have reminded you) that he had played the fool since the day of the murder.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">  Shortly before the hearing in the Court of Appeal a number of affidavits were submitted to the court in support of the appeal.  They were affidavits from Ms Harris, Ms Amiel, Mr McCarthy, Mr Mann, Mr Harrop, Mr Moore and Mr Hulse.  I do not propose to set out in any detail what those affidavits contained.  It suffices that I say that each of those persons complained about the behaviour of the police towards them in relation to the making of witness statements.  The affidavits were not subject to scrutiny during the hearing before the Court of Appeal; the focus of the appeal was as I have described above.  Nonetheless each of the affidavits contained allegations which, if true, constituted improper conduct on the part of police officers involved with those witnesses.    </p>

In total, 3561 persons completed house to house questionnaires, 2884 witness statements were taken (which number did not include supplementary statements), 1747 sets of fingerprints were taken for comparison purposes and 6426 actions were raised during the course of the investigation.  There was an understandable focus upon persons involved with prostitution and the locations in which prostitutes plied their trade; of the persons from whom statements were taken well in excess of a thousand constituted prostitutes, taxi drivers, curb crawlers and persons having an association with the pubs and clubs known to be frequented by Lynette.  Approximately 20,000 nominal cards were generated during the course of the inquiry.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Despite the views expressed by the Chief Constable following the successful appeals of SM, TP and YA there remained grumblings of discontent about LW1.  No doubt these rumblings were given a degree of focus by a book written by Mr Satish Sekar entitled “Fitted In: The Cardiff 3 and the Lynette White Inquiry 1998”.  This book was published in 1998.  As its title suggests its theme was that the convictions of SM, TP and YA were miscarriages of justice which had been brought about by the conduct of a number of officers who had been serving with SWP during the course of LW1.  In summary, Mr Sekar’s thesis was that a number of officers within LW1 had begun to believe in the guilt of the original defendants.  Driven by that belief, they had moulded and manipulated the evidence gathered during the investigation so as to make it “fit in” with the assumed guilt of the original defendants.  I will have more to say about this book as my judgment unfolds.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Messrs Hacking and Thornley produced their Report in the summer of 2000. They addressed in detail all the issues raised in the Terms of Reference.   The Report ran to 477 pages and it made 107 recommendations.  No purpose would be served by an attempt to summarise the Report’s findings.  It suffices that I make the following observations. First, a number of the Claimants were interviewed.  Second, Messrs Hacking and Thornley were clearly concerned that one or more of the core four may have committed perjury during the course of the committal proceedings and/or the trial(s) in which they gave evidence.  Third, they were also concerned that aspects of the investigation may have lacked integrity – i.e. that some officers may have committed disciplinary offences or even criminal offences.  On receipt of the Report, SWP immediately launched Operation Mistral.</p>

NCF concluded that the most likely scenario was that Lynette had been killed by one person acting alone who was likely to be a white male.  This, of course, was a similar conclusion to that which had been reached by Professor Canter in 1988.</p>

Those investigations produced a DNA profile from the “foreign blood” at the murder scene. Painstaking inquiries by those in Operation Mistral led to the possibility that JG was the person who had deposited the “foreign blood” at the murder scene.  It is unnecessary to describe the evidential trail which led to this conclusion. On 27 February 2003 Mr Clayton met JG at his place of work; JG voluntarily provided a sample of his DNA.  That same day it was confirmed that his DNA matched the DNA profile which had been obtained from the “foreign blood” found at the murder scene.  The next day, 28 February, JG was arrested. The arrest took place at hospital because within hours of giving a sample of his DNA JG had taken an overdose of drugs.</p>

In the first interview AP provided what can loosely be described as information about her circumstances and whereabouts in and about February 1988.  Insofar as AP provided information about the events during the night that Lynette was murdered she said that she had not left her flat. In her second interview AP maintained that she had remained in her flat on the night of the murder although she accepted that LV had gone out. She said that she told LV of the murder on her return. During the third interview it was suggested to AP that she had no first hand knowledge of the events surrounding Lynette’s murder – a suggestion with which she agreed.  There followed an exchange between AP and her solicitor about the conduct of the police officers who had taken her statements during November and December during which AP said this:-</p>

They told me I must sign the statements, that it was the law, I must sign the statements.

According to MG on the night of the murder he heard nothing and saw nothing and, in particular, he did not open the front door to 7 James Street to a group of men which consisted of or included the original defendants.  In his second interview he maintained that PA had not visited him on the night of the murder, although he acknowledged knowing him.

An appropriate adult was present throughout the interview.  The transcript reveals that the officers had considerable difficulty in obtaining a coherent and sequential account of PA’s movements over the weekend when Lynette was murdered.  However, according to PA he was never at James Street over that weekend and his first knowledge of the murder was when he was told about it on the Monday evening by Claire and Julia Thomas who had read about it in the newspaper.  More or less at the beginning of the interview PA was asked to give an account of what he knew about the murder.  In a long answer, which is difficult to follow, PA said first that he had no direct knowledge of the murder. He then sought to explain how he came to tell LW1 officers the names of persons involved in the murder.  He recalled that he had named himself, MG and RA as being responsible for the murder. He said that he had done this because he was pressurised into so doing by police officers. At various points in this answer he suggested that the police were putting words into his mouth. He suggested, further, that they led him to believe that if he did not tell the truth, as they believed it to be, he would be charged with murder.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“My Lord, may I say straightaway that the defendant accepts full responsibility for the killing of Lynette White.  He accepts that he will receive a life sentence and accepts that he will spend many years in prison and, as he said to the police, he knows he deserves it.  He has pleaded guilty to murder, and I ask your Lordship to take that into account.  He also asks me to state, and perhaps I can use his words, that he is very sorry for the killing of Lynette White, taking such a young life.  He is very sorry for the hurt and suffering caused to her family, and he is also very sorry for the five men who were falsely accused of her murder, who stood trial and were incarcerated for a long period of time, some for up to four years in prison.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">I should say a little more about that.  As Mr Harrington said, there is great public concern about this case.  Those men stood trials, he said, on two occasions.  Somehow, after many hours of interview, the police managed to obtain a confession from one of them.  They also obtained evidence from a fellow prisoner to the effect that one had confessed to him, and they also obtained evidence from lay persons, members of the public, who said that they witnessed those five men killing Lynette White.  I say that for this reason: although two of them were acquitted at the end of the trial and three were acquitted by the Court of Appeal some two years later, those men have been stigmatised ever since.  I want to say on Mr Gafoor’s instructions that they had absolutely nothing to do with the killing of Lynette White.”</p>

They agreed to do business, to use the vernacular, and they went back to the flat at 7 James Street.  He handed over to her the money that she asked.  His recollection is that it was £30.  Before they had an opportunity to undress, he changed his mind and he indicated that he did not want to go through with it, he did not want sex and he wanted his money back.  That led to an argument between them.  She refused to give the money back.  He insisted that she should, and the argument progressed.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">My Lord, he had a knife with him.  There were two reasons for that.  Firstly, in general terms, the Docks area of Cardiff was a fairly dangerous place to go at night alone, and so he had it for protection.  Secondly, on a more specific point, he had been robbed some months before by three prostitutes in the Butetown area.  In the course of the argument, which was becoming more volatile and aggressive, he took out the knife and threatened her with it in an attempt to get his money back.  She refused.  In fact, she grabbed hold of the knife.  There was a struggle, during the course of which she was stabbed.  He does not really know why what followed did in fact follow.  He says it was a combination of mixed emotions: shame, panic, because he now realised he was in serious trouble, and there was a frenzied attack with the knife.  He accepts that he stabbed her, as your Lordship sees in the photographs.  Those are the simple facts of this matter.  The motive, as I have indicated, began with a row over money and escalated in the way in which I have described.”</p>

I mention that only because in the written judgment which Royce J provided to justify the term he specified he made it clear that he regarded it as an aggravating factor of considerable significance that JG had been content to “allow innocent men to be arrested, to stand their trial and be convicted of a murder he knew he had committed.”  That expression of view by Royce J encapsulated what was, in effect, an agreed position between prosecution and defence throughout the proceedings against JG namely that JG had acted alone when he killed Lynette and that the original defendants had no involvement in the killing.</p>

That same day the Chief Constable instigated an investigation into what had occurred in 1988 (LW3).  Initially, the terms of reference were to identify and investigate any criminal offences arising from the 1988 investigation but shortly thereafter the terms of reference were widened to include the investigation of any disciplinary offences which may have been committed (later revised again to exclude disciplinary offences which did not constitute a crime).  Assistant Chief Constable Cahill was appointed to oversee the investigation; Mr Christopher Coutts, then a detective superintendent, was appointed to be the Senior Investigating Officer by Mr Cahill.  Mr Coutts’ appointment as the SIO and the precise terms of reference of the investigation were set out in a letter from Mr Cahill to Mr Coutts dated 21 July 2003. </p>

Mr Penhale, then a detective inspector, was appointed to be Mr Coutts’ deputy (the Deputy SIO).  The two men had worked together previously.  Mr Penhale remained the Deputy SIO throughout LW3 although between May 2007 and about July 2011 he was also carrying out wholly separate duties for the Home Office and his participation in LW3 was less “hands on”.  Some of the officers who had participated in Operation Mistral were invited to join LW3.  A number agreed.  However, Mr Coutts told me that he also wished to introduce fresh blood to provide a new perspective on the information then available.  Mr Penhale estimated that about half of the officers originally allocated to LW3 had been involved in Operation Mistral with the other half being unconnected to any previous investigation relating to Lynette’s murder.  Two incident rooms were set up; one was at Rumney police station, near Cardiff; the second was at Taibach police station near Port Talbot. I was not provided with precise numbers of officers who worked at those stations in connection with LW3.  The impression I have from witness statements such as that of Mr Monks is that in the early years of LW3 there were about 20 persons in total (including some civilian staff) working on the investigation.</p>

A person would be designated as “of interest” if his involvement in LW1 suggested that he should no longer be treated as a witness but be the subject of further scrutiny.  A person of interest would become a suspect if there were reasonable grounds to suspect that he had committed a crime. </p>

On 11 September a meeting took place at police headquarters, Bridgend, between Mr Cahill, Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale and two employees of the CPS, one of whom was Mr Ian Thomas who had been an employee of the CPS since 1986 and who was a very experienced prosecutor.  At this time Mr Thomas was a member of the Casework Directorate – the department of the CPS responsible for giving advice about and prosecuting the most sensitive and complex cases throughout England and Wales.  One of the issues discussed at this meeting was the role of the CPS during the course of LW3.

The letter was sent to Sir Anthony Burden; it was a letter of claim on behalf of TP relating to his arrest and prosecution for the murder of Lynette. The letter is long and detailed. Its significance in this case is the assertion in the second paragraph that on 9 December 1988 TP “was visited in his then home address…. at 7.30am” by Messers Greenwood, Seaford, Stephen and Jennings and that TP “voluntarily agreed to accompany the officers to Butetown Police Station.”   The letter went on to assert that upon arrival at the station TP was interviewed by Messers Greenwood and Jennings and that during the course of this interview he was arrested on suspicion of being involved in the murder of Lynette. Mr Greenwood, Mr Jennings and Mr Stephen, in particular, attach considerable significance to this letter; the reason will become clear when I consider their individual cases in Section 8.  </p>

Ms Lewis-Williams contacted a psychologist, Dr Harris, with a view to an assessment being made there and then but Dr Harris decided that he should carry out an assessment upon AP away from the police station.  Accordingly, AP was bailed to return to the police station at a later date which was subsequently fixed for 12 November.  In the event, no interview under caution took place on that date.  By then a psychological assessment had been obtained which concluded that AP was an individual with learning disabilities and a low level of literacy and it was decided that AP would be interviewed under caution early in 2004.  </p>

She claimed that the officers were “pressurising her heavily” – see paragraph 19 of the statement.  That same day, or possibly on 11 December when LV was again at the police station, LV  asked the officers then with her to “bring Angela to see [me]” because she did not believe what they were telling her.   AP was brought into the room and said “we were there Leanne” and was then taken away immediately – see paragraph 20.  In that same paragraph LV explained how immediately afterwards an officer had said to her “Why don’t you just say you went there to help.

I was told that Lynette’s wrists and neck were cut, and I was asked “what were you forced to do?”  I think at that stage I indicated that I had cut one of her wrists, and Angela cut the other one, but at each stage of the questioning a lot of matters were put to me.  In the beginning, no statement was taken, and lots of questions were asked.  There were obviously others involved, but the only names of officers I can remember are Mouncher and O’Brien.

In this interview she recalled the names of three police officers, Mike Cullen, Richard Powell and Rachel O’Brien, with whom she had dealt in 1988 but she did not expressly criticise any of the three.  Following the interview LV was bailed to return to the police station on 12 November 2003.</p>

That day she was interviewed under caution on seven separate occasions by Mr Gavin Lewis and Ms Hill.  Mr Jongman, LV’s solicitor, was present throughout each interview.  At the commencement of the first interview Mr Jongman produced another written statement which had been made by LV.  Its effect was similar to that which he had produced during the course of the interview under caution on 1 October.  Mr Mouncher was accused of “breaking” her and Mrs O’Brien was accused of being with her in a room when Mr Mouncher was shouting at her.  LV maintained that the statements she had made on 6 and 11 December 1988 were untrue insofar as they related to her knowledge of Lynette’s murder.  In the interviews which followed LV maintained that all her statements to the police prior to those made in December were truthful albeit there may have been contradictions and inaccuracies within them.  Although she recalled the names of officers other than Mr Mouncher e.g. Mike Cullen and Mr Powell she did not make direct accusations against them. </p>

She maintained that the statement made on 11 December was untrue insofar as it related to her knowledge of Lynette’s murder.  It was pointed out to her that Mrs Coliandris was the police officer who had written out that statement.   LV’s response was to say that although she had some memory of Mrs Coliandris she had no memory of her taking the statement.  Her description of Mrs Coliandris was imprecise and in large measure inaccurate.  She made no allegation of improper behaviour against Mrs Coliandris.</p>

He was arrested by Mr Stephen Evans who was in company with Mr Rees.  A number of interviews under caution followed which were conducted by Messers Evans and Rees at which MG’s solicitor, Ms Nadia Hughes and an appropriate adult, Mr Martin Shepherd, were also present.  In his first interview MG admitted giving false evidence in court but explained it by saying that he was pressurised by the police at the time he was being interviewed by them and/or when he was making written statements.  He told the interviewing officers that on the night of Lynette’s murder he had not seen or heard anything which was relevant to the murder. Those parts of his witness statements which had suggested that he had witnessed material events were untrue. When asked questions about the identity of the officers who had exerted pressure upon him he named Mr Powell and he mentioned two other officers one of whom, he said, had a beard and a moustache and who was thick set in build.  MG said that this officer and another who was neither named nor identified acted as a team – one officer being tough the other being “the nice guy”. </p>

MG was asked about the statements which he made up to the end of May 1988.  He said that they were all truthful accounts albeit that some of the accounts must have been inaccurate since they differed as to detail.  He was asked whether the name “Murray” meant anything to him; it was pointed out to him that it was a DC Murray who had taken a statement from him on 25 May 1988.

MG accepted, without qualification, that the accounts he had given which suggested that he had relevant information about the murder were untrue.  He said that he had succumbed to police pressure; he maintained that he was told repeatedly that PA and LV had given information which demonstrated that he had been at 7 James Street at the time of the murder and he was told by police officers that he would be imprisoned unless he told the truth.  According to MG police officers were “putting words in his mouth”.  When he was asked to identify or describe the officers involved in this behaviour he named Mr Powell. At one point in this interview MG also named Mr Murray.  He said that it may have been to Mr Murray that he first related the untrue account that he was present in 7 James Street and seen the relevant events.  However MG did not, in terms, suggest that Murray was involved in pressurising him; the only officer about whom he made a direct allegation of improper conduct during this interview was Mr Powell. </p>

They explained this conduct by asserting that accounts which they had given in November and December 1988 had been obtained by improper conduct on the part of police officers and they had felt pressurised into maintaining those false accounts when giving evidence in court.  Neither AP nor PA had been interviewed under caution; in each case this was on account of their mental condition.  </p>

At some point quite early on in LW3 he became “the reviewing lawyer” i.e. the lawyer within the CPS who would be responsible for making the decision as to whether anyone should be prosecuted.  He remained the reviewing lawyer until his retirement in 2007.  Mr Thomas gave evidence before me on behalf of the Defendant.  Just prior to giving his evidence he produced a significant bundle of documentation which, in the main, consisted of contemporaneous or near contemporaneous notes of meetings, briefing notes and records of decisions taken by the CPS. I shall refer to this bundle as “the Thomas Bundle” to distinguish it from another file of documentation produced by another former employee of the CPS, Mr Gaon Hart, who gave evidence before me on behalf of the Claimants.

The document is of some significance because it is clear from its terms that it was then contemplated as a possibility that, in due course, the CPS would be asked to consider whether police officers who had been involved with LW1 should be prosecuted. That said, the note also stated in terms that the information available to the CPS as at this time (late 2003) did not permit of any firm conclusions about whether LW1 officers should be prosecuted.  </p>

In these proceedings this was referred to as “ESDA Evidence”.  A very short explanation of this type of evidence is all that is necessary.  When a person writes on a sheet of paper which is resting on top of other sheets the act of writing will often produce visible impressions on the sheet directly below the sheet being written upon and, depending on a variety of circumstances, it may also produce invisible impressions on sheets further down in the pile.  A process has been developed whereby those invisible impressions can be made visible; use is made of electro-static detection apparatus (ESDA). </p>

I shall adopt the same phrase as a convenient short-hand. The expert first involved in the ESDA investigation was Mr Mathew Richardson who was an experienced forensic document examiner.  He produced a witness statement dated 30 December which was the first of a number of statements made by him during the process of the ESDA investigation.  In the Defendant’s chronology it is said that Dr Richardson produced no less than 62 witness statements in the period 30 December to 8 March 2005.  Be that as it may, all I need do in this judgment is to identify the state of the ESDA evidence at two critical points; first in 2005 at the time when all the Claimants except Mr Hicks were arrested and second in 2010 i.e. some months before the commencement of the trial before Sweeney J. </p>

In answer to these questions she maintained that she had been visited by Mr Ken Davies, Mr Morgan and Mr Mouncher although she denied that any of them had acted improperly in any way during those visits. In an interview which commenced at 4.11pm LV was pressed as to why she had implicated YA and SM in statements she had made in June 1988. Her response was somewhat equivocal about YA but LV was clear that she had implicated SM because she disliked him. She was also asked to explain why she had not reported the pressure exerted upon her by Mr Mouncher to a superior officer e.g. to Mr Morgan.

He gave an account of the circumstances of the murder which was very similar to that which Mr Rees had advanced in mitigation.  When asked, specifically, whether he knew any of the original defendants JG replied that he did not and he also claimed that he had no knowledge of the core four and other witnesses who had given evidence tending to incriminate the original defendants.  </p>

TP was interviewed extensively on 20 and 21 May.  The ground covered in the interviews was wide ranging and no useful purpose would be served by an attempt at a précis.  It suffices to mention two points.  First TP denied that he had admitted involvement in the murder to Mr Massey.  Second, he maintained that on 9 December 1988 he had been arrested at his home; he maintained this allegation notwithstanding being shown the B59 and a statement from Mr Greenwood which suggested that TP had attended Butetown police station voluntarily and that he had been arrested at that police station sometime after his arrival there.  JA was interviewed on 10 June.  The interviewing officers were Mr House and Ms Lewis-Williams.  JA was treated as a vulnerable witness i.e. his interviews were video recorded with a view to the recordings being played as evidence- in-chief in any subsequent trial.  Three video recordings were made.  A summary of what was said is contained in the witness statement of Ms Lewis-Williams (see paragraphs 56 to 65).  Essentially, JA complained that he had been “fitted up” by officers within LW1; he named Messrs Powell, Page and Mouncher as being the officers responsible.  </p>

Following a briefing at the meeting the three agreed to act as independent consultants to LW3.  On 10 May they wrote to Mr Cahill setting out their views on the investigation as it then stood.  I should stress that it was never intended that the independent consultants would become embroiled in the fine detail of the investigation.

Mr Cahill made contact with senior officers in the Dorset, Gloucestershire and Hampshire Constabularies who chose officers with relevant experience.  Officers with appropriate experience of search techniques were recruited from Avon and Somerset.  The officers who were chosen to arrest police officer suspects were Messrs Kerley, Keech, Rawles and Parry from Dorset, Messrs North, Prentice and Stephens from Gloucestershire and Messrs Taylor, Pitchford and Boulton from Wiltshire.  When appropriate, hereafter, I will refer to these officers either by name or as “the arresting officers”.</p>

During the course of the briefing Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale gave presentations aimed at providing the officers with an overview of the investigation.  Although only five police suspects had been earmarked for arrest by this stage it seems clear from the evidence as a whole that the officers were told that other arrests of police suspects would occur as the year unfolded.  Dr Barr and Mr Richardson provided briefings on the ESDA evidence which had been obtained by this time and their presentation was subsequently given to the officers on a disc. At the conclusion of the briefing the officers were provided with a disc onto which “Fitted-In” had been downloaded and a number of other documents including the Hacking and Thornley Report.</p>

The agenda for that meeting demonstrates that the discussion was intended to be wide ranging.  I was not shown any minutes of the meeting but in his witness statement Mr Penhale explains that LW3 officers made a presentation of the main strands of the evidence against the police suspects and gave a detailed description of the planned arrest strategy.  He says that it was stressed to all participants that the purpose of the meeting was to invite challenge about the strength of the evidence and the arrest strategy (see paragraph 159 of his witness statement).  On 19 March the Independent Consultants wrote to Mr Cahill to put on record their views as to some of the matters which had been discussed at the meeting.  A substantial part of the letter was concerned with operational issues relating to the arrests of the suspects, the search of their premises and interviews under caution.  The terms of the letter demonstrate quite clearly, however, that Mr Penhale had given a detailed account of “investigative issues” during the briefing and, further, that there had been a detailed account of the forensic evidence which had been obtained which was described as “most compelling”.  </p>

The officers were divided into pairs and each pair was given the responsibility of arresting a particular suspect.  While the briefing was ongoing four more former police officers were made suspects; they were Mr Greenwood, Mr Pugh, Mrs Coliandris and Ms Cuddihy.  Mr Coutts decided that their arrests would take place in a second phase shortly after the first phase had been carried out.  Each of these persons was allocated to a pair of arresting officers.  It seems clear that the arresting officers were provided with information about why the suspects were being arrested, when they were to be arrested, and the documentation which was to be completed at the time of arrest and, subsequently, when a suspect was presented to the custody officer. It was always intended that the officers responsible for arresting a particular suspect would also conduct the interviews under caution with that suspect.  Accordingly, during the course of the briefing period the arresting officers devised interview plans.</p>

He went on to explain that the burnt paper found in his garden were the remnants of very old diaries and pocket books (from the 1960s and 1970s) which he had decided to destroy because he was moving home.  He maintained that he had destroyed nothing relating to LW1 and that he had burnt the diaries/pocket books 5 or 6 weeks before his arrest.

It also related to his conduct in burning documents shortly prior to his arrest on 13 April.  In interview Mr Page was questioned about these matters.  He denied any wrongdoing of any kind.  He explained that he had known of his arrest because “it was the worst kept secret and they were talking about it down the pub”.  He maintained, steadfastly, that he had not burnt any documents of any evidential value.</p>

In the second of the two prepared statements Mr Seaford described how his recollection of the circumstances in which TP had been arrested on 9 December 1988 was poor and that he wished to rely on the statement which he had made on 9 March 1989 which, by then, had been disclosed to him and which, of course, suggested that TP had gone to the police station voluntarily. </p>

During the course of the three interviews that followed the disclosure briefing Mr Greenwood denied any wrongdoing.  When asked for his recollection about the circumstances of TP’s arrest he suggested that the arrest had taken place at TP’s home.  However, when he was shown his statement of 9 March 1989 he said that he must have been mistaken and he then insisted that TP had attended the police station voluntarily on 9 December 1988. The two final interviews were concerned with ESDA evidence.  In advance of the first of those two interviews Mr Greenwood was provided with a briefing, in particular, about that part of the ESDA evidence which suggested that Mr Seaford had re-written a page of MG’s statement of 22 November.  In the interviews which then followed Mr Greenwood denied being present when Mr Seaford had taken the statement from MG.  He declined to offer an opinion on the ESDA evidence.

When Mr Pugh was asked direct questions about his involvement in the contemporaneous interview with MG which took place during the afternoon of 22 November 1988 he acknowledged that he had made the written record.  He asserted that he had built up a rapport with MG and that was why MG had made disclosures to him which he had not revealed previously.  He said that he had no reason to doubt the information which MG provided that afternoon.  He denied any wrongdoing of any kind. He, too, was shown the ESDA evidence relating to page 3 of MG’s witness statement of 22 November.  He maintained that he had no knowledge of the circumstances in which Mr Seaford had written the witness statement; he said, too, that he had no knowledge of Mr Seaford spilling coffee over one of the pages of the statement. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“With, with regard to the disclosures that have been made to me today, I wish to emphasise that during the Lynette WHITE murder enquiry I did not participate in, or instigate any activity which I believed was unjust, unfair, unlawful or intimidatory.  At no stage, when witnesses were interviewed, did I involve myself in any conduct which was aggressive or inappropriate and I categorically refute any suggestion that I used behaviour which could, in any way, cause any person to fabricate evidence.  With regards to the ESDA findings, I have no recollection of officers appraising me of the difficulties encountered when writing and reading statements over to the persons who sought to change specifics.  Albeit that the witnesses in this case were difficult, contradictory and required a lot of patience.  I would however state that to my knowledge, that whilst it was not common practice to rewrite statements on individual pages when errors or changes in an account occurred, it is evident that some officers preferred to do this rather than add in alterations at the end of a statement following it being read.  At that time the Criminal Investigations and Proceedings Act was not in being, which would have prevented such a practice, or the loss of the appropriate subject matter.  In the case of this enquiry, I do not believe there was anything sinister involved and the evidence was subjected to the neutral scrutiny of a court.  In relation to the recovery of my diary, it is fortuitous that it has been found by the POLSA search team, for I honestly believed that I did not possess any documentation which could assist the enquiry at my home and it now affords me a more accurate synopsis of my actions at the time of the enquiry.”</p>

An exchange of correspondence took place between Mr Penhale and Mr Morgan’s solicitors over the course of the next few weeks but all that Mr Penhale would say was that Mr Morgan would be dealt with in a measured and proportionate manner.

I cannot possibly do justice to this document by attempting a précis.   It suffices that I state its conclusions, baldly, at this stage and leave some of the detail to be dealt with when I consider individual cases.  First, the evidence available did not support the conclusion that LW1 officers had conspired together to “frame” the original defendants i.e. there was no plan “to set them up as defendants in the knowledge or belief that they were innocent”.  Rather it was much more likely that rumour gained a foothold amongst officers which, in turn, became a belief that the original defendants were responsible for Lynette’s murder.  The evidence was then “moulded” to substantiate that belief.  Second, the core four, Mrs Perriam and Mr Massey should be charged.  Counsel advised that all those persons (with the exception of PA) should be charged with perjury; PA should be charged either with providing false witness statements to the police or perverting the course of justice.  Third, a number of the police suspects who had been arrested should not be charged: they were Messrs John Williams, Ken Davies, Ms Carole Evans, Ms Cuddihy, Ms Lott, Mr Morgan Mr Greenwood and Mrs Coliandris.  Fourth, Messrs Mouncher, Powell, Pugh, Jennings, Stephen, Seaford, Daniels, Gillard, Page, Murray and Mrs O’Brien should be charged; counsel recommended that those suspects should be charged with conspiracy to pervert the course of public justice.  Fifth, as had been foreshadowed from the beginning of Mr Dean’s involvement, there should be two trials.  The first trial would involve the core four; the second trial would involve the police suspects named above together with Mrs Perriam and Mr Massey.</p>

His precise role in relation to LW3 was not described in evidence but he was, clearly, a senior lawyer who played an important part in the decision making process leading to the charging of the police suspects.  The LW3 officers who were present included Messrs Coutts and Penhale but there were also in attendance those officers who had been responsible for investigating and interviewing under caution those of the police suspects who had not been recommended for prosecution. No doubt Mr Coutts had arranged for those officers to be present so that they could provide their view as to the strength of the case against those suspects.  It seems clear that Messers Coutts and Penhale and the officers from LW3 who had investigated Mr Morgan, Mr Greenwood Ms Lott and Mrs Coliandris were not content to accept the advice of counsel that those suspects should not be prosecuted.

Three days later further instructions were sent asking Counsel to consider the case as a whole.  In response, Counsel provided two advices, dated 8 and 10 February.  Counsels’ advices were considered at a conference held on 12 February attended by Messrs Coutts, Penhale, Monks, Dean, Bennett, Thomas, Cohen and other employees of the CPS.  On 14 February Mr Thomas wrote a briefing note which was circulated to senior lawyers within the CPS (Ms Carmen Dowd, Mr Askar Husain and Mr Cohen).  Having set out the pros and cons surrounding a prosecution of the core four and how this might impact upon a prosecution of the police suspects Mr Thomas expressed the clear and unequivocal view that the core four should be prosecuted and charged at the first available opportunity.  On 16 February Mr Thomas provided a further briefing note to Ms Dowd (copied to Mr Cohen) and on 19 February he provided a briefing note to the DPP and Mr Newell (copied to Ms Dowd).

Counsel and I believe that we should proceed to charging the four on 27 February, 2007 (Howard believes charging should wait until the SOCPA statements are agreed).

At some stage a major incident room was set up at premises owned by the Ministry of Defence at RAF St Athan.  A number of LW3 officers were located at those premises from that time onwards.  It is common ground that the documents to be considered were voluminous.  In July, Mr James Haskell, a barrister and a colleague of Mr Bennett in Chambers in Bristol, was instructed specifically to assist the police in managing disclosure.  To use Mr Haskell’s words he was instructed “as disclosure Counsel”.  As he describes in his witness statement the process of disclosure was already underway; Mr Thomas was in control of the process and Ms Hill was the lead disclosure officer.  I do not propose to describe the process of disclosure in the proceedings against the core four.  It is sufficient to observe that many of the practices adopted in the proceedings against the core four informed the management and process of disclosure once proceedings were instigated against the prosecuted Claimants – as to which see below.</p>

Contrary to expectations, leading counsel for PA asked that the indictment against him should be put so that there could be directed verdicts of not guilty.  The Judge refused to accede to that course.  As I understand it, he directed that the indictment should be marked “not to be proceeded with without the leave of the court or the Court of Appeal”, an order which is sometimes made in circumstances such as these.</p>

Mr Dean was asked to provide a written advice about the appropriateness of particular charges. When the police officers joined the conference Mr Dean asked Mr Husain to explain why it was that counsels’ advices would not be sent to the police in the future.

Further acrimony was engendered when Mr Hart suggested that the core four should be interviewed yet again with a view to making comprehensive witness statements.

It was clear to me that the CPS wanted an extremely thorough and ‘warts and all’ analysis to inform their charging decision.  I included all matters that I believed capable of undermining their credibility.  I decided to break it down into two parts. Part 1 the credibility of the core four and Part II specific suspect analysis ……..My view was that it was wrong simply to consider weaknesses in the characters of the core four.  An assessment could not be made of their reliability on evidential matters without looking more widely at what independent support and corroboration existed.  I maintain my earlier view that the evidential test was passed for the police and civilian suspects who were later charged and this included Mr Greenwood.  During the process of drafting I called for documents and information from the police relevant to the issues at hand.  I recall in particular needing help to find medical reports.  I first sent a draft version of both Part I and Part II to [Mr Dean].  I recall that he did not invite me to make any changes.  I then sent both documents to the CPS who shared them with the police.  </p>

On 25 February 2009 I convened a meeting for lawyers only, to consider whether there was any middle ground between the view of leading counsel and Mr Hart as to the credibility of the core four and the strength of the evidence identified as supporting their accounts.  I did not invite the police to this meeting because the police annotated response had been circulated to all lawyers in advance so that the police views were well known.  The discussion was to be a purely legal one.  At the conclusion of that meeting there remained a difference of opinion.  I shared Mr Dean’s view as to the strength of the prosecution case on the basis of all the available evidence, including the evidence of the core four.  I considered that there was a realistic prospect of conviction against 15 of the remaining suspects.”</p>

Mr Hart, Mr Cohen, Ms Meader, Mr Dean and Mr Bennett attended.  The minutes demonstrate that the Panel had considered a number of documents in advance of the meeting which included the Hart Review and Mr Dean’s response to it dated 24 February.  The DPP expressed a personal view which was that the suspects identified by counsel should be prosecuted.  However, he also indicated that the decision about whether to charge any of the suspects was to be made by Mr Clements.  Mr Clements indicated, during the course of the meeting, that he supported a prosecution of the suspects identified by counsel.  In due course, Mr Clements produced a document – “the charging decision” - in which he explained why he was authorising a prosecution against the suspects recommended for prosecution by counsel and what charges should be brought against each suspect. He authorised a joint charge of conspiracy to do acts tending and intended to pervert the course of public justice against all the police suspects.  He authorised charges of perjury against Mrs Perriam, Mr Massey and Mr Mouncher (the charges against Mr Mouncher related to the evidence which he gave at the trials of the original defendants about his dealings with Mr Massey).  On 2 March 2009 Mr Coutts appeared before District Judge Wickham at the Westminster Magistrates’ Court to provide information to the District Judge to justify the issuing of summonses against each of the suspects.  </p>

Upon a minute textual analysis of the speeches in <span style="font-style:italic">Three Rivers</span> it may be difficult to avoid the conclusion that there are some subtle differences between their lordships as to the necessary ingredients of the tort.  However, in the context of this case, it is sufficient to identify and apply certain general principles which, without doubt, emerge from their lordships’ speeches. First, there are two alternative bases upon which the tort can be proved.  It is proved if a public official deliberately engages in conduct or deliberately omits to act with the specific intention of injuring or causing loss to an identified or identifiable person.  In the authorities and leading text books this form of the tort is called “targeted malice”.  Alternatively, the tort is proved if a public official deliberately acts or deliberately omits to act in a particular way yet he knows that he has no power to behave in that way or he is reckless as to whether he has such power.   In this alternative form of the tort the official must also know that the act or omission will probably cause injury or loss to a person or be reckless as to whether that will occur.  Second, acts or omissions which are merely negligent or inadvertent cannot found the tort.  Third, the core allegation to be proved, in either manifestation of the tort, is that the alleged tortfeasor has acted in bad faith.  Fourth, it must be proved that the tort caused or substantially contributed to the injury and or loss alleged.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In this case no Claimant now alleges targeted malice; this form of the tort was pleaded on behalf of Mr Murray but abandoned, expressly, during the course of the closing speech of his leading counsel, Mr Cragg QC.  Accordingly, in order to succeed in establishing liability for the tort of misfeasance in public office the Claimants who allege this tort must prove that at least one of the police officers engaged in LW3 deliberately acted or omitted to act in a particular way even though the officer knew at that time that he had no power so to act or he was reckless as to whether he had such power.  Additionally, the Claimants must prove that the police officer knew that his deliberate act or omission would probably cause injury/loss to the Claimants or he was reckless about whether that would occur.</p>

They do not allege in their pleadings that they have a direct cause of action in consequences of those searches.  However, those Claimants who allege misfeasance in public office against the Defendant seek to establish that the obtaining of search warrants was part of the conduct which constituted misfeasance; Mr Morgan and Mrs Coliandris allege that the searches were in breach of their human rights.  Accordingly, I set out at this juncture, the statutory provisions which relate to the obtaining of a search warrant since, of course, all the searches of the Claimants’ homes were made pursuant to warrants issued by a magistrate.

It has two key elements; first, the fact of imprisonment, which in this case means loss of liberty and second, the absence of lawful authority to justify that loss of liberty.  There is no dispute about the fact that all the Claimants were deprived of their liberty for periods of time.  The question for me is whether that deprivation was justified in law.  The Defendant submits that the deprivation of liberty was justified in all case because (a) the arrests of the Claimants were, in all cases, lawful and (b) save in one respect which I shall identify in respect of particular Claimants in due course, the detention of the Claimants which followed their arrests was in accordance with the statutory provisions which governed that detention.  For reasons which will become clear no useful purpose would be served by setting out in this judgment the many provisions of the 1984 Act which relate to detention following arrest. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“Certain general propositions about the powers of constables under a section such as section 12(1) can now be summarised.  (1) In order to have a reasonable suspicion the constable need not have evidence amounting to a prima facie case.  Ex hypothesi one is considering a preliminary stage of the investigation and information from an informer or a tip-off from a member of the public may be enough: <span style="font-style:italic">Hussein v. Chong Fook Kam</span> [1970] AC 942, 949. (2) Hearsay information may therefore afford a constable reasonable grounds to arrest.  Such information may come from other officers: <span style="font-style:italic">Hussein's </span>case, ibid.  (3) The information which causes the constable to be suspicious of the individual must be in existence to the knowledge of the police officer at the time he makes the arrest.  (4) The executive “discretion” to arrest or not, as Lord Diplock described it in <span style="font-style:italic">Mohammed-Holgate v. Duke </span>[1984] AC 437, 446, vests in the constable, who is engaged on the decision to arrest or not, and not in his superior officers.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">Given the independent responsibility and accountability of a constable under a provision such as section 12(1) of the Act of 1984 it seems to follow that the mere fact that an arresting officer has been instructed by a superior officer to effect the arrest is not capable of amounting to reasonable grounds for the necessary suspicion within the meaning of section 12(1).  It is accepted, and rightly accepted, that a mere request to arrest without any further information by an equal ranking officer, or a junior officer, is incapable of amounting to reasonable grounds for the necessary suspicion.  How can the badge of the superior officer, and the fact that he gave an order, make a difference?  In respect of a statute vesting an independent discretion in the particular constable, and requiring him personally to have reasonable grounds for suspicion, it would be surprising if seniority made a difference.  It would be contrary to the principle underlying section 12(1) which makes a constable individually responsible for the arrest and accountable in law.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Reg. v. Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall, Ex parte Central Electricity Generating Board </span> [1982] QB 458, 474 Lawton LJ touched on this point.  He observed:</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">Such an order to arrest cannot without some further information being given to the constable be sufficient to afford the constable reasonable grounds for the necessary suspicion.  That seems to me to be the legal position in respect of a provision such as section 12(1).  For these reasons I regard the submission of counsel for the Chief Constable as unsound in law.  In practice it follows that a constable must be given some basis for a request to arrest somebody under a provision such as section 12(1), e.g. a report from an informer.” </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“My Lords, the test which section 12(1) of the Act of 1984 has laid down is a simple but practical one.  It relates entirely to what is in the mind of the arresting officer when the power is exercised.  In part it is a subjective test, because he must have formed a genuine suspicion in his own mind that the person has been concerned in acts of terrorism.  In part also it is an objective one, because there must also be reasonable grounds for the suspicion which he has formed.  But the application of the objective test does not require the court to look beyond what was in the mind of the arresting officer.  It is the grounds which were in his mind at the time which must be found to be reasonable grounds for the suspicion which he has formed.  All that the objective test requires is that these grounds be examined objectively and that they be judged at the time when the power was exercised.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">This means that the point does not depend on whether the arresting officer himself thought at that time that they were reasonable. The question is whether a reasonable man would be of that opinion, having regard to the information which was in the mind of the arresting officer.  It is the arresting officer’s own account of the information which he had which matters, not what was observed by or known to anyone else.  The information acted on by the arresting officer need not be based on his own observations, as he is entitled to form a suspicion based on what he has been told.  His reasonable suspicion may be based on information which has been given to him anonymously or it may be based on information, perhaps in the course of an emergency, which turns out later to be wrong.  As it is the information which is in his mind alone which is relevant however, it is not necessary to go on to prove what was known to his informant or that any facts on which he based his suspicion were in fact true.  The question whether it provided reasonable grounds for the suspicion depends on the source of his information and its context, seen in the light of the whole surrounding circumstances.” [page 298A to E] </p>

What has been the approach of the courts to the “necessity test” which now must be applied?  Mr Thomas QC, leading counsel for Mr Hicks, has drawn my attention to the decision of Slade J in <span style="font-style:italic">Richardson v The Chief Constable of West Midlands Police</span> [2011] 2 Cr. App. 1.  In that case the claimant was a teacher.  He was involved in an incident which resulted in an allegation that he had assaulted a pupil.  The claimant attended the police station with his solicitor by appointment for a voluntary interview whereupon he was arrested because, as the custody officer was later to allege, he would otherwise have been entitled to leave at will and there was a serious allegation to be investigated.  In due course the claimant brought proceedings in which he claimed damages for false imprisonment; he alleged that his arrest had been unlawful.  The defendant defended the proceedings maintaining that it had been necessary to arrest the claimant “to allow the prompt and effective investigation of the offence or the conduct of the person in question” – see Section 24(5)(e) of the 1984 Act.  At paragraph 60 of her judgment Slade J said:-</p>

In that case a police constable who was investigating an assault made contact with the claimant by telephone and a meeting between them was arranged. At the beginning of the meeting the constable arrested the claimant. He relied upon section 24(5)(e) of PACE i.e. he considered that the arrest was necessary to allow the prompt and effective investigation of the offence or of the conduct of the claimant.  The claimant’s action for false imprisonment was dismissed as was his appeal to the Court of Appeal.

To require of a policeman that he pass through particular thought processes each time he considers an arrest, and in all circumstances no matter what urgency or danger may attend the decision, and to subject that decision to the test of whether he has considered every material matter and excluded every immaterial matter, is to impose an unrealistic and unattainable burden.  Nor is it necessary.  The liberty of the subject is amply safeguarded if the rule is as Mr Beer contends, namely: (1) the policeman must honestly believe that arrest is necessary, for one or more identified section 24(5) reasons; and (2) his decision must be one which, objectively reviewed afterwards according to the information known to him at the time, is held to have been made on reasonable grounds .…</p>

I should add that we have not been concerned in the present case with the position of an arresting officer who, often in a complex inquiry, receives an order to arrest a particular suspect.  Such an officer will often not have access to all the material which the officers directing the inquiry will have.  The decision to arrest, and to do so at a particular time, will often be part of a closely co-ordinated plan for the inquiry.  I pause only to say that it is clear from the <span style="font-style:italic">O’Hara</span> case that this common situation is readily accommodated within the rules as I have set them out to be.  The arresting officer must himself have reasonable grounds for believing that the suspect has committed an offence, and likewise reasonable grounds for believing that it is necessary, for a section 24(5) reason or reasons, to arrest him.  But information given by others, attached to orders issued by them, can be and usually will be part of the information which goes to his grounds for belief of one or both matters, and thus to the reasonableness of the belief.  That that is the law provides another reason why section 24(4) ought to be interpreted in the manner stated, rather than as requiring comprehensive consideration by the officer of all matters capable of being relevant to the decision, which would require him to have access too, and time to digest, a much fuller picture of the overall investigation than is realistic  .…</p>

Whilst of course it may be that it is quite unnecessary to arrest a suspect who will voluntarily attend an interview, as it was with the school teacher in the <span style="font-style:italic">Richardson</span> case … it is not the case that a voluntary attendance is always as effective a  form of investigation as interview after arrest.  Section 29 of the 1984 Act reminds officers of their duty, if inviting voluntary attendance, to tell the suspect that he may leave at any time he chooses.  It would not be honest for an officer to invite a person to attend a voluntary interview if he intended to arrest him the moment he elected to leave.  Nor would it be effective.  It would mean that the suspect could interrupt the questioning the moment he reached a topic he found difficult.  Even if it were possible simply then to arrest him, the interview could not continue until all the important formalities of reception into custody, checks on health, notification of friends or relatives, and so on, had been complied with. …”</p>

At least some, perhaps all, of the Claimants’ lawyers in their written material suggest that an arrest has to be proportionate to be lawful.  None of the leading cases to which I have referred in this judgment suggest that proportionality is a factor to be considered when making an assessment about whether an arrest is lawful if (as is the case in some contexts) proportionality is to be treated as a different and in some way more onerous concept for the arresting officer than the concept of reasonableness in the <span style="font-style:italic">Wednesbury</span> sense. Further, none of the cases in the bundles of authorities provided by the parties suggest that proportionality in addition to reasonableness needs to be considered. I appreciate, of course,  that proportionality has a part to play if the legality of an arrest and/or detention is viewed in the context of the European Convention on Human Rights (“ECHR”) but none of the Claimants seek to impugn the lawfulness of the decision to arrest them (and, thereafter, detain them at the police station) on ECHR grounds.  In his closing written submissions Mr Cragg QC suggested that “it is necessary to consider whether the decision to arrest was a lawful and proportionate exercise of the discretion to arrest, applying the ‘<span style="font-style:italic">Wednesbury</span>’ principle of reasonableness”.  Put in that way there can be no objection to the use of the word proportionate in the context of the lawfulness of any arrest and I propose to adopt that approach.  In my judgment the task for me is to reach a conclusion about whether any Claimant has proved that the decision to arrest him/her was unreasonable applying the principles in <span style="font-style:italic">Wednesbury</span>; if the decision was unreasonable it was also disproportionate.</p>

On the present appeal the argument on behalf of the detained persons is put thus; a public law error that bears directly on the decision to detain will mean that the authority for detention is ultra vires and unlawful, and will sound in false imprisonment.  But breaches which have no direct bearing on the decision to detain do not have that effect.  Since, therefore, for instance, statutory obligations to permit a detainee to consult with his legal advisors <span style="font-style:italic">(Cullen v Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary [2003] 1WLR 1763) </span>or to be provided with food or clothing, or to be held in certain conditions <span style="font-style:italic">(R v Deputy Governor of Parkhurst Prison ex p.

He contends, however, that the infringement was justified in accordance with Article 8.2.  Further, he submits that there is an additional bar to a claim under the Human Rights Act 1988.  The search warrants in question were issued by a magistrate.  Mr Johnson accepts that such a decision is susceptible to a challenge by way of judicial review.  He submits, however, that no civil action can lie against the defendant in respect of the searches because the warrants issued by the magistrate in respect of the homes of Mrs Coliandris and Mr Morgan have never been quashed.  The quashing of the warrant, in the submission of Mr Johnson QC is a necessary pre-requisite to the bringing of a civil action by virtue of Section 6 Constables’ Protection Act 1750.  That Section is in arcane language and I do not propose to set it out in this judgment.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“The Claimant’s case, in summary, is that the Defendant’s officers committed a misfeasance in public office by deliberately or recklessly acting beyond their powers in the LW3 investigation, prosecution and trial.  The Defendant’s officers prejudged the central issues of the investigation, adopting a mindset of guilt in relation to the Claimant from the outset, and pursued the investigation of the Claimant in a wholly disproportionate way, despite the manifest weaknesses of the available evidence, foreseeing the likelihood that their actions would injure the Claimant.  In the course of the said investigation, the Defendant’s officers falsely imprisoned the Claimant.”</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.50in">In the paragraphs which follow (45 to 54) the Claimants provide the detailed allegations which are said to justify a finding of misfeasance.  Paragraphs 45 and 46 provide particulars of bad faith. Paragraph 47 alleges that the Defendant’s officers conducted LW3 with the mindset, from the very outset of the investigation, that the Claimants were guilty of committing criminal offences during LW1.  Paragraphs 48 and 49 allege that there were unwarranted and material differences in the way that the Defendant’s officers treated the Claimants compared with the core four and other civilian suspects. Paragraphs 50 and 51 allege that the Defendant’s officers wilfully disregarded the inherent weaknesses in the case against the Claimants and failed to pursue “adequately, or at all” reasonable lines of enquiry which pointed away from the guilt of the Claimants.  Paragraph 52 alleges that the Defendant’s officers had an improper relationship with key witnesses in the investigation and paragraphs 53 and 54, respectively, allege disclosure failures and deliberate destruction of documents.   I should make it clear that the pleadings of the other Claimants who allege misfeasance also make these allegations.  In some instances they are formulated in somewhat different language but, in my judgment, no injustice will be visited upon any party if I deal with the allegation of misfeasance in public office by reference to the pleading of Claimants 1 to 8 as I have summarised it above.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Before considering the detail of the pleaded allegations it is necessary to identify an issue which may not have received the attention it deserved during the course of the hearing.  Very commonly, both in pleadings and written submissions, the Claimants allege that the tort of misfeasance was committed by “the Defendant’s officers”.  I readily understand that this phrase invariably or at least very often refers to Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale.  However, it is not obvious to me, even now, whether the Claimants are alleging that other officers engaged in LW3 are to be included within this phrase and, if so, which officers.  In reality, there are a number of potential scenarios.  First, it may be that the Claimants are alleging that every single officer who engaged in LW3 was an active participant in the tort i.e. that the tort began in July 2003 and subsisted without interruption until November 2011 and that every officer who played a role in LW3 during that period was an active participant in a continuing tort.  Second the phrase may encompass particular officers who engaged in specific aspects of the investigation e.g. officers with a managerial role or a role in relation to disclosure.  In this scenario there may not have been one tort continuing throughout the period of LW3 but rather a series of torts committed by many different officers.  Third, of course, the phrase would be apt to encompass any officer who is named by a Claimant, expressly or impliedly, in relation to a specific decision or omission. </p>

I have decided, therefore, that I will deal with the complaints of fixed mindset, differences in treatment between police and civilian suspects, failures to takes account of the weaknesses in the cases against the Claimants and failures of investigation together as one topic.  I will deal separately and discretely with the allegations relating to the relationship between LW3 officers and the original defendants and the allegations relating to failures of disclosure and destruction of documents.

I am not considering the mindset of LW3 officers in the abstract or in the context of an assessment about whether every step taken or every decision made was, objectively, fair and reasonable; I am investigating the officers’ mindset in the context of whether it can be proved to the civil standard that officers committed the tort of misfeasance in public office. Accordingly, in making a judgment about the rival contentions as to the mindset of the LW3 team I must keep to the forefront of my mind that the ultimate decision for me is whether the Claimants have proved that any officer engaged in LW3 acted beyond their powers during the course of LW3 knowing that they were so acting or being reckless about whether they were so acting.</p>

In 1988, at the time of the murder, Mr Coutts was a detective constable based in Pontypridd (a town approximately 12 miles from Cardiff).  He knew a number of the persons who had been involved in LW1 but he, personally, played no part in the original investigation.  Over the years that followed Mr Coutts worked with a number of the Claimants and he knew Mr Gillard socially.  He says that he disclosed his contacts with all these persons to Mr Cahill before his appointment was confirmed and there is no reason to doubt what he says.  He, Mr Coutts, felt that he would be able to conduct an investigation impartially and objectively notwithstanding his knowledge of some of the persons involved in LW1 and, evidently, Mr Cahill agreed.  It is also worth noting that when Mr Coutts was appointed to be the Head of Major Crime Review he thought it appropriate to read the Hacking and Thornley Report.  That is hardly surprising; his role was to lead investigations into major crimes which had remained unsolved and there can be no doubt that the Hacking and Thornley Report constituted a comprehensive assessment of a major investigation which had, allegedly, gone wrong with the consequence that the crime was unsolved.  </p>

As I have already indicated it is not entirely straightforward to pinpoint precisely what information he had.  Mr Coutts does not set out in his witness statement a description of the information which he assembled and/or was provided to him in those early weeks after 7 July 2003.   Self-evidently, however, Mr Coutts would have had access to all the documents generated in Operation Mistral itself (since they were of recent origin) and, no doubt, some of the documentation which had been generated in LW1 – particularly that which had been recovered for the purposes of Operation Mistral.  Without doubt, too, Mr Coutts was provided with or obtained Mr Sekar’s book “Fitted In”.</p>

Mr Coutts stoutly denied that he had been influenced, unduly, by the contents of Mr Sekar’s book.  Mr Penhale was equally forceful in maintaining that he was open-minded about its themes and content.  That said, they both defended their use of the book as a source of information.  Looked at in the abstract I see nothing sinister in a SIO and his deputy reading material which might throw some light on a difficult and sensitive investigation.  These were very experienced investigators; in my judgment it is reasonable to infer that they were quite capable of reading material at the outset of an investigation and then affording it appropriate weight as the investigation unfolded.  I do not consider the fact that Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale read Mr Sekar’s book and, in due course, provided it to other officers to read, in itself, demonstrates a fixed mindset.  I will return, in due course, to the issue of whether there is any evidence which suggests that Mr Sekar’s conclusions were unjustifiably and erroneously influencing Mr Coutts, Mr Penhale or any other officer.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On the same date Mr Coutts designated the original defendants together with RO, MT and AM as victims.  Sensibly, that can only mean that, as of that date, Mr Coutts considered that these persons had not been involved in Lynette’s murder.  Was such a conclusion reasonably justified at that time?  In my judgment the answer must be yes.  At that time the following facts/conclusions were incontrovertible.  First, JG had confessed to Lynette’s murder by pleading guilty before Royce J.  Second, he had asserted through his Leading Counsel in open court that he had committed the murder alone and that he had no knowledge of and no link to the original defendants.  Third, three of the core four had admitted in interviews with officers from Operation Mistral that they had made false witness statements and they had given untruthful evidence which had wrongly incriminated the original defendants.  Fourth, no forensic evidence, of any kind, had linked any of the original defendants to the murder scene.  I appreciate, of course, that there was evidence in existence in 2003 dating back to 1988/89 which implicated some of the original defendants in Lynette’s murder independently of the core four e.g. the evidence of Mr Massey as it related to TP, the evidence of Ms Harris as it related to YA, the evidence of Deborah Taylor and others in relation to SM and SM’s admissions in interviews under caution and the evidence of Ms Perriam and Ms Carole Wheeler as it related to a group of men allegedly in the vicinity of 7 James Street on the night when Lynette was murdered. I appreciate, too, that LV, in particular, had spoken to persons of the involvement of some the original defendants in the murder both before and after making statements to the police.  However, I have little doubt that Mr Coutts was entitled to conclude, as he quite clearly did, that such strands of evidence as implicated some of the original defendants but which were independent of the core four did not invalidate the conclusion that the original defendants were entitled to be classed as victims.  In my judgment, as of September 2003 it was perfectly permissible for Mr Coutts to treat the evidence of admissions by YA and SM to girl friends/family members about knowledge of or participation in Lynette’s death with a degree of caution particularly in the case of SM given what was known of his personality and psychiatric state in 1988.  The evidence of Mr Massey was justifiably under scrutiny as was the evidence of Mrs Perriam.  The Court of Appeal had made it clear that it regarded SM’s admissions in interviews under caution as unreliable.  The court had expressed itself in terms which left no room for doubt as to its views. I appreciate that the evidence of Ms Wheeler had been obtained in 1992 and could not, sensibly, have been regarded as tainted by events in November and December 1988.  Nonetheless, weighing everything in the balance, it was much more likely than not that the original defendants and the other persons arrested in December 1988 were “victims” rather than perpetrators of Lynette’s murder. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I appreciate, too, that there was no statutory basis for designating the original defendants as victims on the date when Mr Coutts took that decision.  The statutory basis for categorising a person as a victim is Section 32 of the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 which, of course, was not in force in September 2003.  However, significantly before that enactment, police forces had begun to recognise victims of crime as having a special significance.  I do not consider that the designation of the original defendants, RO, MT and AM as victims is any basis for thinking that Mr Coutts had a fixed mindset to the effect that LW1 officers and, in particular, the Claimants must have been guilty of crimes during the course of LW1.  </p>

In view of the admissions made by AP, MG and MA during the course of their interviews in Operation Mistral and the other factors mentioned in paragraph 478 above such a designation was, in my judgment, inevitable.  No one has suggested otherwise; it has not been suggested that there was no proper basis for treating the core four as suspects and arresting them.  What has been suggested, however, is that even at this early stage Mr Coutts and his team had an unwavering belief not just that the core four had lied when incriminating the original defendants but that those lies had been induced by criminal conduct on the part of a number of officers at the heart of LW1.</p>

I have no doubt, too, that this view was held by many, if not all, of the officers then engaged in LW3.  Further, in my judgment, it is at least probable that by the same stage Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale believed that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that the lies told by the core four were brought about by conduct which was unlawful on the part of LW1 officers albeit that they had not identified the officers involved in such conduct. Was that because their minds were closed to all other reasonable possibilities or were those beliefs justified on a fair and balanced appraisal of the information then available?  I propose to take a little time, now, to answer those questions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, there was ample justification for the belief that the core four had lied about the involvement of the original defendants in Lynette’s murder.  First and foremost, three of the four had admitted that they had told such lies.  Those admissions had taken place in interviews with officers from Operation Mistral some months before JG’s involvement in the crime was discovered.  At the time when AP, MG and PA made their admissions to officers from Operation Mistral they had no obvious reason to suppose that anyone (other than the original defendants) would be implicated in Lynette’s murder.  I have struggled hard and failed to think of a sensible reason why AP, MG and PA would say that they had lied on oath about the involvement of the original defendants if that was not true.  It is difficult to see what possible motive they could have had for exposing themselves to the possibility of perjury charges if they had not committed the crime of perjury.  The interviews with the officers from Operation Mistral were not “informal chats” which might lead to nothing; they were formal interviews at which lawyers and/or appropriate adults were present to represent the interests of AP, MG and PA.  LV refused to be interviewed by officers from Mistral. This refusal to be interviewed would, no doubt, have gone some way to persuading the officers from Mistral and, in due course, LW3 that she, too, had lied during LW1.  In any event, if AP’s account of what she had seen on the night of 13/14 February 1988 was accepted as a lie, LV’s account of events that night, too, was almost bound to be a  tissue of lies.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I am equally satisfied that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that the core four had been induced to lie about the involvement of the original defendants by the conduct of police officers involved in LW1.  Upon the premise that the core four had lied, the options available to explain such lies were comparatively limited.  Option one was that each of the core four had made up the lies he/she had told completely independently.  In my judgment, such an option was properly discounted at a very early stage.  I accept that the accounts given by the core four were not identical.  Indeed, I accept that they contained material differences, some of them quite marked.  On any view, however, there were significant similarities in the accounts which they had given.  In my judgment, it beggars belief that the core four gave untruthful accounts about the involvement of the original defendants but completely independently of each other.  A second option was that police officers had induced the core four to make witness statements which were untruthful and, thereafter, pressurised them into maintaining those untruthful accounts when giving evidence at the trials of the original defendants.  That, of course, is what the core four were alleging.  In my judgment, the way in which the accounts of the core four emerged during November and December 1988, the undoubted similarities in their accounts and, in particular, the way in which the detail provided sometimes “changed” to accommodate and/or fall in with detail provided either by a different person within the core four or another witness entirely provides considerable support for this option.  The third option was that the core four had conspired together to incriminate the original Defendants completely independently of the police.  Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale thought this a remote possibility.  They did not believe that the core four were capable of instigating and implementing such a conspiracy.  I have no means of reaching a definitive judgment about whether the core four were capable of initiating and then implementing such a conspiracy not least because I have never seen them give evidence about why they lied.  I can, however, make a judgment about whether such a scenario was likely.  In my judgment, it was not.  In fact it was most unlikely given how their accounts emerged as I explained above.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Of course it is possible that the core four agreed amongst themselves that each of them would provide untruthful but similar accounts which they would “feed” to the police over a number of separate interviews taking place over an interval of time.  That is not, however, a likely scenario. The core four had no means of knowing when and in what circumstances they would find themselves at the police station.  They never attended by appointment; they never attended at a time or date of their own choosing. There is no evidence which begins to suggest that they even knew that they were to be asked to make statements and then yet further statements until “confronted” by officers who were out on the streets looking for them.  If the core four had been intent upon making false accusations about the original defendants independently of their interaction with the police it is far more likely that the accusations would have emerged quite differently. I find it very difficult to understand how the accounts emerged as they did if no police officer was instrumental in what occurred.</p>

It is at least possible that what occurred was that Mrs Perriam’s account gained credence with a number of the officers engaged with LW1.  Her account was then repeated by officers to other potential witnesses and, in particular, to the core four.  The core four, either independently or together, then decided, for their own reasons, to adopt Mrs Perriam’s account as a starting point and then embellish it. What they then said, individually, was fed by officers to each of them so that there was a kind of rolling ball effect.  The result was the statements which emerged on 22 November, 6 December and 11 December.</p>

In my judgment it was permissible for LW3 officers to suspect that officers who had been part of LW1 (at this point unknown) had engaged in a conspiracy to mould and manipulate evidence much as Mr Dean was later to describe in the Dean Review.  I stress, however, that at this very early stage there is no evidence that LW3 officers had formed suspicions about particular officers who were involved in LW1.</p>

I have referred previously to the meeting which took place on 11 September 2003 when Messrs Cahill, Coutts and Penhale met Mr Thomas and a colleague from the CPS.  The minutes of that meeting demonstrate that the possibility that LW1 officers had committed criminal offences was discussed at that stage.  Indeed the possibility that the local CPS lawyers engaged in LW1 had also committed offences was raised as a matter which would be investigated (as indeed it was in the case of Mr Hywel Hughes).   In his briefing note to the Attorney General in late 2003 Mr Thomas made it clear to the Attorney that SWP would be seeking advice about whether a prosecution should be brought against serving and retired police officers.

PA chose not to answer the questions which were put to him. The answers given in interview by AP and MG were similar to the accounts they had provided to Operation Mistral.  I do not consider that anything emerged as a consequence of these interviews which should have lead Mr Coutts and his team to discount the possibility that LW1 officers had engaged in unlawful behaviour during the course of that investigation.

In truth, according to the Claimants, JG gave hardly any description of the circumstances in which he inflicted the fatal injuries upon Lynette.  Further, JG was hazy, to say the least, about what he was wearing on the night of the killing, what he did with his clothes after the event and what he did with the knife which he used to kill Lynette.  The Claimants submit that in the face of this lack of information Mr Coutts and his team should have been sceptical about JG’s claim that he had acted alone when he killed Lynette.

On 2 March 2003 officers engaged in Operation mistral had taken a witness statement from Ms Brinda Moulani, JG’s sister.  It is clear from its terms that the statement was taken with a view to providing as much information about JG as could be provided by a close family relative.  The information which Ms Moulani provided was that in 1988 JG was living and working in a shop in Malefant Street in Roath (another area of Cardiff about two or three miles north of Butetown).  The shop was owned by Ms Moulani and her husband.  JG was then aged about 22 and, according to his sister, he was a quiet, private person who spent most of his time working or reading.  Neither JG nor any other member of the family had connections with or friends living in the Butetown area.  Not surprisingly, after the length of time which had elapsed, Ms Moulani was unable to provide any account of JG’s whereabouts over the weekend when Lynette was killed.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The information provided by Ms Moulani hardly supported the idea that JG had been with a number of other persons at the time he killed Lynette.  Putting it somewhat crudely, it hardly supported the notion that JG, a quiet, private and rather lonely young man had been in company with the original defendants, or for that matter anyone else, at the time he committed this murder.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The expert evidence most relevant to the issue of whether JG had acted alone or in concert with others was the reconstruction evidence which Mr Coutts commissioned from Virtual Reconstruction Limited.  That company was instructed to provide evidence on 9 March 2004 i.e. within weeks of the interviews with JG.  The work undertaken by the company was very extensive.  Mr Andrew Postlethwaite, its managing director, made a witness statement dated 26 September 2005 to which he exhibited a large number of reconstructions in accordance with the instructions which he had been given in March 2004.  The witness statement and paper copies of the relevant exhibits are contained within the Core Bundles (see Volume 11 pages 7625 to 7727).  Not surprisingly, there was no detailed analysis of this evidence during the course of the hearing.  That said, I accept the submission made on behalf of the Defendant that this evidence casts no doubt upon JG’s account of acting alone at the time of the murder.</p>

She had been instructed during the course of Operation Mistral and she provided a witness statement dated 30 May 2003 in which she had considered, amongst other things, the significance of the blood distribution at the murder scene.  Nothing in Dr Gallop’s statement of 30 May 2003 cast any doubt upon JG’s account of acting alone.  Indeed, Dr Gallop’s opinion that the “foreign blood” which had been distributed within the flat was likely to have come from a hand injury sustained by Lynette’s attacker was consistent with JG’s assertion in the first interview on 19 January 2004 and in his subsequent witness statement that he had cut his wrists and knuckles during the course of the attack upon Lynette. </p>

The report recorded that the Professor had been provided with “enormous number(s) of documents, tapes and CDs” although the report identified only those documents upon which the Professor chose to comment. As the Professor pointed out in the report his main focus was upon the two interviews conducted with AP on 17 November and the interviews with MG and PA on 22 November.  The Professor’s conclusion was that the majority of those interviews were partial records only by which I take him to mean that more had been said between the interviewee and the interviewers than had been reduced to writing.  The Professor also noted that some of the language used was ‘police’ language i.e. words attributed to the witness which were much more likely to have been words in common use by police officers than lay persons.  However, the core conclusion expressed by the Professor was that there was no linguistic evidence to suggest that the interview records had been fabricated or that the police officers involved in the interviews had not believed they were engaged in eliciting relevant facts from witnesses who were unreliable.  </p>

He was asked to consider the record of interviews with AP on 17 November 1988 and MG on 22 November 1988.  In respect of AP’s interview during the morning of 17 November 1988 and MG’s interview on 22 November Dr Hardcastle found no evidence to show that a significant part of the interview had not been recorded.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“9.1 A decision to treat John Actie and Anthony Paris as volunteers would probably have been lawful in principle, even though it may have been a ploy to avoid the consequences of arrest.  However, it would seem that they were not, in fact, treated as volunteers since the evidence suggests that they were both required to attend Butetown police station under compulsion, and that this had been the intention from the outset.  If this is the case, then they were both arrested at the time that they were taken from their homes.  Such arrests would have been unlawful since, on the evidence I have seen, they were not told that they were under arrest and were not told of the grounds for the arrests.  It also seems that they were not cautioned at the time of their <span style="font-style:italic">de facto</span> arrests.  There were then breaches of both PACE and the Codes of Practice since they were treated as if they were volunteers and, in particular, were not taken before a custody officer, were not informed of their right to legal advice and the interviews at Butetown police station were not, apparently, contemporaneously recorded.  On the basis that they were, in fact, arrested at the outset their detention at Butetown police station was unlawful at least until the time that they were properly arrested later in the morning of 9 December 1988.  It is probable that their detention was rendered lawful when they were properly arrested.”</p>

I have received no explanation as to why the letter of 30 October 2003 and the witness statements of Mr Greenwood and the others did not reach Professor Cape before he reported.  It is possible that somewhere hidden in the Full Electronic Bundle there may be documents which throw light upon how this state of affairs came about but I have not located them and they were not shown to me during the course of the hearing or referred to in counsels’ closing submissions.</p>

Second, the documents were withheld because the person instructing the Professor realised that he could not resolve the factual dispute about whether TP had attended the station under compulsion and his opinion was required on the assumption that TP had not attended the police station voluntarily.  Third, the documents were not sent to the Professor through negligence or inadvertence.  Fourth, the person who sent instructions to the Professor was unaware of the documents.  Given the general view which I have formed about the integrity of the officers involved in LW3 I consider the third and fourth options to be far more likely than option one and I doubt whether option two would occur so readily to a police officer as it may have done to a lawyer.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In his witness statement Mr Coutts describes the effect of the ESDA evidence as at early 2005.  First, the evidence established that page 3 of MG’s witness statement of 22 November 1988 had been re-written.  Words used on the re-written page made MG’s identification of RA, YA and MT as the persons he saw at or about the murder scene more convincing.  Impressions of the re-written statement were found on the witness statement made by LV on 6 December 1988.  Second, page 7 of AP’s witness statement of 6 December had been re-written after the statement had been completed.  The re-written version did not include a reference to Mr Ellis being present in James St at about the time of the murder but such a reference had “appeared” to be in the original version of that statement.  Third, page 11 of AP’s statement of 11 December had been re-written.  Fourth, the final page of LV’s statement of 6 December 1988 (mistakenly identified as the statement of 11 December in Mr Coutts’ witness statement) included a re-written final paragraph which purported to show that Mr Miller knew of 7 James Street.  This was contrary to an account Mr Miller had given earlier.  Fifth, Mrs Perriam’s statement dated 11 February 1988 must have been written on a different date.  </p>

Essentially there were two issues which needed elucidation.  First, as of early 2005 was that the state of the evidence? Second, if not, was that ever the true state of the evidence?</p>

In a statement dated 6 August 2010 Dr Barr sought to pull together all the main ESDA points which had emerged by this date.

First, she offered the opinion that page 7 had been re-written. She also identified that this opinion had first been provided to the police in a statement made by Mr Richardson dated 7 December 2004.  Second, she suggested that there was strong, albeit not conclusive, evidence to suggest that the final version of page 7 had been written after the author had completed the statement.  This opinion, too, had been advanced first in Mr Richardson’s statement of 4 December 2004. Third, Dr Barr offered the view that it was possible that there were impressions of the first page 7 on page 8 of the statement and that “the name Jack Ellis could appear in the impressions”.  As I understand it, however, this was first mentioned in statement form, at least, by Dr Barr herself in a statement dated 7 February 2007 (see Core Bundles Volume 11 page 7573).</p>

That was not information which had been provided to Mr Coutts by early 2005.  Further, it seems to me that Mr Coutts was describing the ESDA evidence about this point in rather exaggerated terms.  Dr Barr’s possibility had become rather more certain on a fair reading of Mr Coutts’ witness statement.</p>

After some reflection, I consider it much more likely than not that Mr Coutts’ assertion that this information was available as at early 2005 was a mistake as opposed to an attempt to mislead.  After all, the point was easily checked by reference to the witness statements of Dr Barr and Mr Richardson.  Further, the “Jack Ellis point” does not feature at all in the person of interest package which Mr Penhale prepared in respect of Mr Gillard who was the author of the statement.   In my judgment, that is not just a clear further indicator that the point had not surfaced by 2005 but also a further reason for holding that Mr Coutts made a mistake in his witness statement.  I do not consider it likely that Mr Coutts would have deliberately tried to mislead the court when there were obvious and comparatively easy ways of checking the accuracy of his evidence.</p>

In my judgment, both Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale did, to an extent, overstate Dr Barr’s evidence about this point in their witness statements and oral evidence. That, of course is the real point; it was not for Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale to interpret Dr Barr’s written evidence in a manner they thought appropriate any more than it was for me to make a judgment about whether Dr Barr had been too cautious in her expression of view, especially without hearing from her.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have taken some time to set out the evidence which Mr Coutts regarded as key in early 2005 for two reasons.  First, it throws light upon whether or not Mr Coutts was operating with a closed mind. Second, it provides me with a guide as to the information upon which Mr Coutts acted when he decided that there were reasonable grounds to justify arrests.  This second point is of some importance since, in my judgment, it would be wrong to approach Mr Coutts’s decision-making about the arrests of suspects simply on the basis that all that he did was consider  the  person of interest packages provided to him by Mr Penhale.  As Mr Coutts points out in his witness statement (paragraph 99) Mr Penhale was summarising the evidence against the suspected person.  He was not purporting to describe all the relevant information available to Mr Coutts.</p>

Throughout the trial and particularly in the closing speeches of counsel, the Claimants sought to demonstrate that, from the outset of LW3, Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale ignored evidence or other material which undermined their view that the Claimants had committed criminal offences during the course of LW1.  Accordingly, it is pertinent to explore what exculpatory and/or undermining material/evidence was in existence in 2005 when Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale were making their decisions about arrests. At this stage I simply identify the points which were, on any view, of relevance to all Claimants.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First, without doubt, there were wholly proper and legitimate concerns about the truthfulness, reliability and accuracy of the core four.  They were, potentially, vital witnesses in any prosecution of police suspects yet, self-evidently, they were witnesses whose testimony might not be believed.  There was an abundance of material upon which they could be cross-examined in an attempt to discredit their evidence about the actions of LW1 officers.  The summing-up of Leonard J was a clear remainder about how they might be exposed as witnesses.  Further, although AP, MG and PA had complained about the conduct of police officers (plural) in their interviews with officers from Operation Mistral and although LV, AP and MG had made complaints about officers (plural) in their interviews under caution none of the core four were able to identify the individual officers whom they were impugning with any degree of conviction with a few notable exceptions.  Further, in relation to a number of the Claimants, the core four positively rebuffed the suggestion that they had been engaged in threatening or bullying behaviour towards them.  Second, evidence had emerged during the course of LW1 which had supported the evidence given by LV, AP and MG during the trials of the original defendants.  That was true even if the evidence of such persons as Mr Massey and Mrs Perriam was discounted.  By way of example, there was the evidence of SM’s admissions to his girlfriend when in prison and the evidence that LV, in particular, had made allegations to persons other than the police to the effect that some of the original defendants were involved in the murder of Lynette.  The evidence obtained from Carole Wheeler in 1992 provided potential support for the evidence of Mrs Perriam. Third, the Claimants submit that the account which JG gave to the police when interviewed as a witness in 2004 raised considerable doubt about his assertion that he was the only person involved in the murder of Lynette.  All the Claimants’ counsel point out, quite correctly, that JG’s answers in his interviews and the contents of his witness statement do not explain all aspects of the forensic and pathological evidence.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Claimants’ counsel are correct, too, when they submit that none of these features appear in any of the documents recording the decision – making leading to the first or any subsequent arrests in 2005.  They invite me to conclude that these points were simply ignored and that this is clear evidence that Messrs Coutts and Penhale had closed their minds to any possibility other than that the core four had been the victims of criminal misconduct on the part of LW1 officers and that this was why they had perjured themselves.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have considered this line of argument with considerable care.  However, it seems to me that it ignores the realities of the decision-making process in which Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale were engaged in 2005.  At each stage their task was to decide whether reasonable grounds existed to justify the arrest of persons they suspected of criminal wrongdoing during the course of LW1.  They were not deciding upon their guilt or innocence; they were not making a decision about whether there was evidence in existence which pointed away from guilt.  The reality of the decision making process undertaken in relation to police suspects in 2005 is that unless the exculpatory/undermining evidence negated, completely, what would otherwise be reasonable grounds for suspicion it was not crucial at this stage.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Coutts told me that he genuinely believed that grounds existed which justified the arrests which he authorised.  Mr Penhale said the same in respect of the persons about whom he wrote in the person of interest packages and about those whose arrests he authorised.  On this issue I believe them. Whether reasonable grounds did exist to justify those arrests is, of course, a hotly contested issue upon which I will need to adjudicate. To repeat, however, I accept that Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale believed such grounds existed.  I am far from satisfied that as at 25 January 2005 and thereafter throughout the year Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale had become convinced that the LW1 officers whom they were considering for arrest had committed crimes in 1988 and that nothing was going to deflect them from that belief.  I accept their evidence that they believed that reasonable grounds existed for suspecting that they had committed offences; that was their state of mind.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in"> In my judgment that conclusion is supported by Mr Coutts’ decision to hold an adversarial briefing.  It is supported too by the available evidence about what occurred at the briefing.  The decision that this meeting should be convened was made on 26 January i.e. on the day after Mr Coutts made his decision that the first phase of arrests should take place. There is no reason to doubt that Mr Coutts convened the meeting for the reason recorded in the LW3 policy log.</p>

I do not think, for a moment, that any of the persons at the adversarial briefing other than the LW3 officers had a command of the finer detail of what had emerged during the course of the investigation.  That said, Mr Cahill, the IPCC Commissioner and the Independent Consultants had, between them, a wealth of experience in police investigations.  They all left the adversarial briefing convinced that the arrests about which they were told were justified.  That is what Mr Cahill says in his witness statement in terms. That can be inferred, quite properly, from the written evidence of Mr Davies the IPCC Commissioner and there can be no doubt that the Independent Consultants were so satisfied given the letter which they wrote following the meeting (see 279 above).  Further, and, perhaps, more importantly, if this meeting was not, genuinely, an adversarial briefing Mr Coutts either alone or, much more probably, in concert with Mr Penhale, was knowingly involved in a kind of charade.  He must have been participating in a meeting which was supposed to be challenging his thought processes when, in reality, his mind was made up and no amount of persuasion would alter it no matter what was said.  I do not regard that as a credible scenario.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I am also fortified in my view that the prosecution of officers from LW1 was regarded as no more than a possibility as at January 2005 by reason of the contents of the minutes of meetings held between police officers and Mr Thomas and other members of the CPS during the latter part of 2004.  The minutes of the meeting of 26 November 2004 are particularly instructive.  The CPS (presumably Mr Thomas) is recorded as pointing to a number of potential difficulties relating to the pursuit of police officer suspects.  First, on the state of the information available it was difficult to identify the officers who had engaged in misconduct.  Second, some officers may have been no more than scribes when statements were being taken or interviews being recorded contemporaneously.  These officers might not be the officers who had pressurised the core four and/or other witnesses.  Third, witness statements may have been altered by the witnesses themselves and officers who changed pages may not have spoken to the witnesses.  Mr Coutts is recorded as responding that the ESDA evidence showed clear evidence of alterations and deletions but there were still forensic avenues to explore.  Later Mr Coutts is recorded as saying that there was potential for “allegations” against retired police officers but more people were to be seen before any action was taken.  </p>

Read as a whole the minutes of this meeting demonstrate that the participants were actively contemplating that police suspects might be arrested and that, thereafter, some of those arrested might be prosecuted.  However, it was no more and no less than that. Given the information available at that time such a state of mind is hardly surprising.  </p>

I can see that such remarks might support a conclusion that Mr Penhale had become or was becoming “too close” to the original defendants.  I will consider that issue in due course.  However, I am not prepared to conclude that the expression of such views by Mr Penhale at this meeting demonstrates that his mindset was fixed and that his goal was to ensure the prosecution of police suspects come what may.</p>

As is obvious, the process which had been adopted in relation to the arrests and interviews under caution of the core four and other civilian suspects in 2003 and 2004 was very different to the process which Mr Coutts authorised for the arrests of police suspects in 2005.   The core four and other civilians were arrested by appointment at a police station; the date of arrest  was provided to them many days in advance and they were also provided with substantial documentation which they were encouraged to consider in depth prior to interviews under caution taking place.  The homes of the core four and other civilian suspects were not searched.   Was this difference in treatment justified?</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Let me begin with the “Arrest Strategy” i.e. the document which was prepared for each phase of arrests which considered whether an arrest should take place and, if so, how that was to be carried out.  This document was identical for each suspect included in the first phase of arrests.  It did not consider the personal or family circumstances of any of the suspects in the context of whether or not they should be arrested and, if so, in what circumstances.   The document contained four options.  The first option was that the suspects should be arrested but that the arrests would be phased over a number of days and take place some days (“a minimum of 2 weeks”) after they had been informed about the location of the arrest, the line of questioning to be adopted in interview and appropriate documents had been disclosed to them. The second option was that all the suspects would be arrested by appointment on the same day.  In this option, too, there would be disclosure, in advance, of the line of questioning to be adopted in interview and relevant documentation.  The third option was that all suspects would be arrested on the same day at their homes without notice to them and with no advance disclosure of any kind.   The final option was that there should be no arrest of the suspects at all; rather, this option contemplated that each suspect would be invited to attend a police station on a specified date and, once there, they would be interviewed under caution.  In this option the suspects would be told some days before their attendance at the police station what they were to be questioned about and provided with disclosure of relevant documents.  The “Strengths” and “Weaknesses” of each of those options were also set out in the Arrest Strategy.  Mr Penhale’s recommendation was that all five suspects should be arrested on the same day without warning and without any advance disclosure of the line of questioning to be followed in interviews under caution and with no disclosure of relevant documentation. </p>

From recollection the ‘necessity’ to arrest rules were fairly new.  It transpired I was not alone in my concerns and so, along with other interviewing officers, we had a meeting with D/Supt Coutts.  He discussed his rationale and strategy, explaining by attending with a section 8 PACE warrant we would have the opportunity to secure and preserve evidence even if the subjects were not present when we attended.  With hindsight and speaking as a senior investigating officer myself, I believe this to be absolutely the right decision.  As a result of the briefings we had received, reinforced by my own reading and research, I was completely satisfied the planned arrests were completely justified, necessary and proportionate.”</p>

This paragraph in Mr Taylor’s witness statement is significant, however, in that it demonstrates, quite clearly, that he and other officers felt some misgivings about whether the arrest of police suspects and a search of their homes were justified.  That said, as I read this paragraph, Mr Taylor’s initial disquiet upon this issue was dispelled following a face to face meeting with Mr Coutts in which the arrest and search strategy was explained to him.</p>

The process adopted for the arrests of police suspects and the subsequent searches of their homes was a process which Mr Coutts was entitled to adopt i.e. it was lawful for the arrests to be carried out without warning and for searches of the suspects’ homes to take place pursuant to warrants obtained lawfully.  A reasoned justification for proceeding in that way was provided to Mr Coutts in advance of his decision in January 2005 and a reasoned justification for the arrests was produced for each phase of arrests thereafter.  The decision of 25 January 2005 was endorsed by Mr Coutts’ superior officer and by the Independent Consultants.  Mr Coutts was not knowingly or recklessly exceeding his powers and it is not suggested that by authorising arrests without warning he was deliberately trying to cause harm or loss to the Claimants (i.e. there is no allegation of targeted malice).  There is, of course, the suggestion that arrests carried out very early in the morning which were followed by searches were designed to maximise embarrassment. That is a different point and one I will deal with separately in due course.</p>

No doubt, he should have been told in relation to the particular individual concerned that he had indicated a willingness to attend a police station voluntarily and/or had indicated that he would consent to the search of his home.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is one aspect of the arrests about which I am convinced their concerns were justified.  In my judgment, there was no proper justification for arresting the Claimants and other police suspects at or about 6am in the morning at their homes.  By my reckoning, none of the persons arrested were less than 50 years old at the time of arrest and most were significantly older.  Many, if not all, lived at home with their families.  It would have been straightforward to obtain information about the suspects’ usual lifestyle and plan their arrests accordingly.  In my judgment there was no possibility that any of the suspects would seek to evade arrest.  Their arrests related to events which had occurred 17 years previously and there had been considerable speculation that arrests of police officers would follow the arrests of the core four and other civilian suspects.  As I have described some of the suspects had offered to attend at a police station voluntarily.  In my judgment, the evidence of Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale that the suspects were arrested in the early morning simply because that was the best way of ensuring that they would be at home when the officers arrived was unconvincing. I cannot escape the conclusion that co-ordinated arrests at or about 6am in the morning had more to do with Mr Cahill, Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale demonstrating their determination that police officers should be subject to the same kind of arrest regime as has become common in relation to persons of interest to the media who have been arrested in comparatively recent times on suspicion of serious offences.  I find it difficult to conceive of any justification for arrests at 6.00 a.m. in the morning in relation to any of the Claimants.  I am fortified in that view, of course, because a number of the arresting officers shared my concern.</p>

Despite this lack of detail there is no proper basis for thinking that the evidence of Mr Coutts on this point is wrong. It is very unlikely that no such analysis took place.  In reality, that is what was to be expected particularly since, during the course of 2005, substantial documentation was provided to the CPS (Mr Thomas) and, of course, Mr Bennett had been involved prior to any arrests taking place and Mr Dean was involved from the summer of 2005.  It is also instructive to remember that in between 24 and 26 March 2006 Mr Coutts convened a briefing event with the independent consultants.  At least some of the papers presented are contained within the Core Bundles (Volume 15 page 10802 et seq). It is obvious from the title of the event “Investigative and Evidential Evaluation” that a major reason for holding the event was to take stock and identify any further important investigative paths.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Further, it is clear from what was done subsequently that the information provided in the interviews under caution must have been considered and investigated. Let me provide two examples at this stage to justify that view.  First, both Mr Gillard and Mr Morgan had made reference to the role played by Mr Hywel Hughes, the CPS employee, during the crucial stages of LW1.  At some stage thereafter (and I have not found it easy pinpoint exactly when) officers of LW3 began to investigate his role.  They discovered that Mr Hughes and a colleague Mr Jones had lectured about the LW1 investigation to colleagues in the CPS at training conferences held at the universities of Keele and Loughborough in September 1991.  Mr Hughes’ lecture notes were recovered; they appeared to demonstrate that he had, indeed, been consulted on 11 December 1988 soon after AP had given her account that she had been present at the murder scene and that she had cut Lynette. It may very well be that the length of time taken to obtain this information was too long (it was discovered in late 2006) but, clearly, this is an example of LW3 officers following lines of investigation revealed by what Mr Gillard, in particular, had said in interview under caution. The same is true in relation to Mr Page’s assertion in interview that his police pocket books were stored at Merthyr and then destroyed. That assertion was followed up and investigated; there is a clear document trail to that effect.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As I have said, Mr Williams and Mr Davies were arrested, respectively, in January and April 2006.  Quite shortly after the later arrest Mr Dean and Mr Bennett produced the Dean Review.  In my judgment, that document was extremely influential in the chain of events which led ultimately to the prosecution of police suspects.  I readily accept that once the Dean Review had been produced Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale (and no doubt other LW3 officers) became convinced of the merit of prosecuting police suspects.  Indeed, as I have recounted in Section 4, some of the LW3 officers (including Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale) thought that the Dean Review was insufficiently robust as it related to some of the suspected officers.  I have no doubt that Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale thought that the evidence available as at August 2006 justified the prosecution of Mr Morgan, Mr Greenwood and Mrs Coliandris as well as the other suspects identified in the Review. I am satisfied that as from the date of the Dean Review the mindset of Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale and, probably, other senior officers within LW3 was that the police suspects identified in the Review should be prosecuted.  In that sense Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale did adopt a fixed mindset.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">That does not mean, however, that their mindset became closed to all alternative possibilities and that officers in LW3 called a halt to appropriate investigations.  By way of example, only, on 1 February 2007 a statement was taken from Ms Judith Iddles who was then a sergeant in SWP.  In her statement Ms Iddles recounts how on 11 December 1988,  while on duty at Rumney police station, she was told to go to  Butetown police station to sit with two girls who were helping with enquiries in relation to Lynette’s murder.  The two girls turned out to be AP and LV.  Ms Iddles’ best guess was that she sat with AP for about 2-3 hours.  During that period she did not interview AP and she did not record any of the conversation which passed between them.  Nothing untoward happened.  Ms Iddles also spent time sitting with LV.  She estimated that period at about 2 hours.  She recalled that there came a point in time when Mr Powell entered that room and asked her to leave which, of course, she did.  On Ms Iddles’ account she was at the Butetown police station over a number of hours.  When she was in company with AP and LV nothing out of the ordinary occurred.  The women were not distressed or upset.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">During the course of the cross-examinations of Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale and during closing speeches counsel for the Claimants identified a number of investigative trails which, they alleged, had not been followed up either with vigour or at all following the arrests which took place in 2005.  Again, by way of example only, counsel drew attention to the failure to trace the journalist (Mr Horton) who had interviewed MG within a day or two of Lynette’s murder and written an article which suggested that MG had knowledge of the murder.  They drew attention, too, to the lack of urgency surrounding the interviewing of Mr Hywel Hughes, Ms Smith and officers involved in LW1 who might well have had relevant information to impart.  The suggestion was made, impliedly, if not expressly, that there was a marked reluctance to obtain information from Mr Robert Tooby because by 2005/2006 he had risen in the ranks to be a senior officer with SWP.  I do not propose to analyse, in detail, what should have been done to obtain information from these persons more quickly.  I say that because I am satisfied that delays in obtaining information were not a symptom of a fixed mindset which would brook no alternatives.  In this period, i.e. 2006/07 the focus of investigation shifted to an extent from police suspects to others involved in LW1, namely members of the CPS and the forensic scientists who had given evidence at the trials of the original defendants, and, in particular, Dr Whiteside.  There was, additionally, the debate which I have described above about whether or not the Core Four should be prosecuted and, of course, there was debate which ensued following the Dean Review.</p>

The difficulty which faces the Claimants, however, is that errors are insufficient to found the tort of misfeasance in public office.  As I have indicated in Section 6 inadvertence or negligence on the part of police officers is not a basis upon which the tort of misfeasance can be founded.  I am prepared to accept that there were from time to time investigative errors or omissions.

It is to be noted, however, that Mr Hicks was not arrested at his home and his home was not searched (although a search was undertaken of Mr Hicks’ room at his base police station).  The arrest, in the case of Mr Hicks, was by appointment at a police station and, in advance of the date of the arrest, Mr Hicks was provided with information about the line of questioning to be adopted during the course of interviews under caution and disclosure of relevant documentation.  I should say, now, however, that as with the other Claimants I am satisfied that Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale (who wrote the grounds of arrest) genuinely believed that reasonable grounds existed to justify the arrest of Mr Hicks as did the arresting officer, Mr Kerley.  Whether they addressed their minds to the issue of whether it was necessary to arrest Mr Hicks is a live and contentious issue and one with which I will deal in due course.  However, I am satisfied that none of the persons involved with Mr Hicks’ arrest acted in bad faith and I am satisfied that his arrest did not constitute an act of misfeasance in public office or provide evidence to support a claim of misfeasance.</p>

Until Mr Thomas’ retirement there had been substantial agreement between the police officers, the CPS representatives and leading and junior counsel about the direction of travel of LW3. Essentially it had been agreed following the Dean Review that the core four would be prosecuted and, provided they were convicted a prosecution of the police suspects identified in the Review together with Mrs Perriam and Mr Massey would follow.  When Mr Hart became the reviewing lawyer he did not dissent from the view that a successful prosecution of the core four was a pre-requisite to a successful prosecution of police suspects.  He did, however, at least in his own mind if not publicly, have doubts from the outset about the wisdom of prosecuting police suspects.  Quite understandably, however, given the nature of the investigation, Mr Hart wished to satisfy himself that the steps to be taken while he was the reviewing lawyer were steps with which he was comfortable.  No doubt for that reason he made it clear in November 2007 that he would make no decision about whether police suspects should be prosecuted and, if so, which suspects they would be until after the conclusion of the proceedings against the core four.  </p>

No useful purpose would be served in entering this blind alley. I have no doubt, as I have said, that Mr Coutts believed by late November 2007 that sufficient evidence existed to justify a decision that Claimants 1 to 13 should be prosecuted. Even if he was seeking to exert pressure upon Mr Hart to make a decision to prosecute by altering the statutory basis upon which those Claimants (apart from Mr Greenwood) were on bail and even if that amounted to misfeasance there is no possibility that this caused any of the Claimants any loss of any kind.  Without doubt, throughout the whole period that the Claimants were on bail there was an appropriate statutory basis for it.  If, for a short period of time, the statutory basis identified to the Claimants was wrong it could not have caused any of them any loss.    </p>

I am here referring, in particular, to the period which began with the decision made in relation to PA in July 2008 and which ended with the decision made by Mr Clements that Claimants 1 to 13 should be prosecuted.  On the basis of the evidence which I heard and read (and there was a good deal of both) I accept that relations between Mr Hart on the one hand and Mr Dean and Mr Coutts on the other did not, completely, break down.  I am equally satisfied, however, that there were occasions when these men were at loggerheads.  Further, I have no doubt that the events surrounding the decision that PA was not fit to plead contributed, substantially, to the strain in the relations which was from then onwards apparent at many meetings.</p>

He thought that their credibility had been damaged beyond repair for reasons which were perfectly understandable.  Mr Dean took a different view.  His opinion was that the jury could be persuaded to accept that the only credible explanation for the false testimony given by the core four was unlawful conduct on the part of police officers and that there was sufficient evidence to implicate the suspects which he had identified in such unlawful conduct.

However, it was, in my judgment, equally permissible to conclude that a jury could be led to the view that despite the obvious credibility issues which surrounded the core four their conduct in falsely incriminating the original defendants was explicable only if police officers had behaved as they alleged.  As all those who are familiar with jury trials will know full well it can be extremely difficult to predict the outcome of a certain type of case.

I readily accept the likelihood that the CPS was not supplied with every last document which had been generated during the course of successive investigations, but I am not persuaded that there was any deliberate withholding of any relevant document or information from the CPS.  My view on this aspect of the case is informed in part by the documents which I was shown during the course of the trial.  It is informed, too, by my assessment of the officers involved in LW3 who were responsible for managing and disclosing documents.  I heard from Ms Hill, Mr Allen, Mr May, Mr Rowlands and Mr O’Connor.  They were the lead disclosure officers at all material times.  I do not accept, if it is being suggested, (which I doubt) that any of those persons deliberately suppressed documents which they knew would undermine the case against any of the police suspects or which would support the case of any individual suspect.</p>

Mr Metzer QC, Mr Simblet and Mr Thomas QC sought to demonstrate (and succeeded to an extent) in showing that the Dean Review, the Dean Update and Mr Bennett’s document “Credibility of the Core Four” failed to mention a number of documents and/or strands of evidence which undermined the credibility of the core four and/or the case against a particular police suspect.  From that starting point, however, there is a very long jump to the submission that the relevant document must have been suppressed, deliberately, and that this constituted an act of misfeasance in public office.</p>

Although the general thrust of any defence was foreseeable they had no means of knowing what defence was or might be open to each suspect.  It is inconceivable, in my view, that they personally suppressed important documents.  Perhaps, more importantly, in my judgment there is no sound evidential base for concluding that Mr Coutts, Mr Penhale or any lead disclosure officer directed any officer who was more junior to hide relevant information from the CPS.  I appreciate that it is unlikely that I would have heard direct evidence to that effect during the course of the trial.  However, in my judgment, there is no proper evidential basis from which such a conclusion can properly be inferred.  Further there is no evidence of any kind which begins to support the view that individual police officers within LW3 deliberately suppressed material for reasons of their own.  I accept that it is inherently improbable that every document generated in LW1, Operation Mistral and during the course of LW3 found its way to the CPS before the decision to charge police suspects was made.  I cannot conclude from that, however, that there was a deliberate decision by Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale that unhelpful documentation should be hidden from the CPS.  This scenario becomes all the more unlikely when it is understood that the documents which are said to undermine the credibility of the core four and/or assist the case of a particular police suspect were disclosed in the criminal proceedings.  It seems to me to be most unlikely that Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale directed that documents which undermined the credibility of the core four should be withheld from the CPS yet took no steps to prevent those very same documents being disclosed in the criminal proceedings.  To take but one example, Mr Thomas QC complains that the various accounts of Ms Carole Wheeler are not referred to during the various assessments which were undertaken by prosecuting counsel prior to the decision to charge.  Yet I do not understand him to say that Ms Wheeler’s statements/interviews were not disclosed during the course of the criminal proceedings.</p>

In his witness statements Mr Coutts says that there was a Core Bundle which comprised 28 lever arch files (running to 9,008 pages) and 32 individual suspect files consisting of 73 lever arch files (containing in excess of 22,000 pages).  Mr Coutts also asserts that in the event that the CPS and counsel sought clarification of any issue or required further information this was provided to them.  The consequence was that as from 2006 onwards further documentation was supplied by the police to the CPS as and when it became clear that the documentation was relevant.  I will describe shortly the scale of the task facing the lead disclosure officers.  In short, however, they faced a huge task.  In these circumstances it would not be right to infer that the failures to ensure that the CPS had been provided with every last document which existed were brought about by a deliberate policy to suppress exculpatory material.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">With the benefit of hindsight it is easy to see how the methodology adopted for the supply of documents by the police to the CPS gave rise to a risk that individual important documents might be missed.  As Mr Coutts acknowledged information is often provided by the police to the CPS at the end of an investigation and at a time when a team of dedicated officers can ensure that all relevant documents find their way from the police to the CPS.  It is possible that if that system had been adopted in LW3 an even greater number of documents would have found their way from the police to the CPS prior to the decision to charge and, certainly, it is possible that there would have been a sharper focus upon documents which undermined the case for the prosecution or assisted the case of an individual suspect.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Reduced to its essentials I have a stark decision to make about the fact that certain documents in existence did not find their way from LW3 officers to the CPS prior to the decision being made to charge Claimants 1 to 13. The Claimants allege that I should draw an inference that documents were deliberately withheld by LW3 officers from the CPS either because Mr Coutts and/or Mr Penhale directed more junior officers to behave in that way or because, for their own reasons, some junior officers adopted that course of action.  I am not prepared to reach any such conclusion on the basis of the evidence put before me.  I have already commented upon the view I formed of the lead disclosure officers.  Shortly, in the context of my conclusions on the issue of bad faith, I will set out my view on the integrity of Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale.  I say now, however, that having heard them give evidence over the better part of two court weeks I am not persuaded that they engaged in a campaign prior to 2009 to ensure that important exculpatory material in the hands of the police did not reach the CPS.</p>

Counsel had been instructed over some years by the time the charging decision was made.  Their recall of some of the details of the case against the police suspects when they gave evidence before me was impressive coming, as it did, some years after their last involvement in the case.  I have no doubt that in the relevant period i.e. 2005 – 2011, their command of the case was formidable.  From all that I have heard or read I do not accept that it was SWP (and Mr Coutts, in particular) which was the driver of the criminal proceedings brought against Claimants 1 to 13 and that, in some way, Mr Dean and Mr Bennett had become seduced by the “Coutts view” of the case.  The Dean Review, the Dean Update and Mr Bennett’s “Credibility of the Core Four” were serious analyses of a very difficult case.  They set out independent judgments formulated over a significant time period.  I have no doubt that both Mr Dean and Mr Bennett had their own strongly held views that a prosecution against Claimants 1 – 13 was justified.</p>

He was entitled to conclude that there were reasonable prospects that the Claimants to be prosecuted would be convicted and that it was in the public interest that they should be prosecuted.   I have no doubt, too, that it was Mr Clements who made the decision to charge the suspects.  His evidence about this was unequivocal.  For reasons which I will elaborate, in summary form, in Section 9, I do not consider that there is any proper basis for concluding that any individual senior officer within SWP was, in reality, the person who made the decision to charge the police suspects nor do I consider that SWP, as an organisation, can properly be regarded as the prosecutor in this case.</p>

The process by which a police officer “lays an information” in order to seek the issue of a summons is comparatively informal.  No relevant note of the proceedings has been produced in evidence.  In any event the threshold to be crossed in order to satisfy a Magistrate that a summons should be issued is a low one.  That is not surprising.  As I detail in Section 9 a procedure exists whereby a person against whom a summons has been issued may apply to have the proceedings dismissed if no proper grounds exist to justify them.  I note in passing that Mr Greenwood invoked that procedure but his application to have the proceedings brought against him dismissed was refused by Sweeney J (as was his abuse of process application).  I am not prepared to accept that Mr Coutts deliberately chose to mislead a Magistrate if that is the allegation which has been made.  He was entitled to be selective in what he said in the sense that he was entitled to explain the case against Mr Greenwood in such a way as to justify the issue of the summons.     </p>

I have reached the conclusion that the allegations which are said to justify a finding of misfeasance in public office against Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale or any other officer which I have considered thus far are not well founded or have not been proved.  Inevitably, however, in order to reach this conclusion I have had to make my own assessment of the integrity of Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale.  I had the opportunity of observing them being cross-examined and re-examined over very many days.  Without doubt, there were instances when their evidence was properly called into question and I have detailed some parts of their evidence which was wrong.  However, I am not persuaded that any of the core allegations made against them are proved.  I do not consider that they controlled and directed an investigation which was partial; I do not believe they operated with a closed or fixed mind set which prevented them from undertaking reasonable avenues of investigation.  Essentially, in my judgment, they sought to get to the truth of what had occurred during the course of LW1 and, perhaps not surprisingly, they encountered very many difficulties in pursuing that aim.  I will return to my assessment of Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale when I consider the core allegation of bad faith.</p>

The LW3 policy log shows that as early as 10 July 2003 Mr Coutts decided that a document should be prepared entitled “Victim Liaison Strategy” and that Mr Penhale was to perform the role of Victim Liaison Officer.  At this stage no one had been designated, formally, as a victim although, quite clearly, it was anticipated that a number of persons would be so designated in due course.  On the same day, Mr Coutts determined that a Family Liaison Strategy should be prepared and that the role of Family Liaison Officer would be undertaken by the person who had been responsible for that role during Operation Mistral (DC Taylor).  </p>

He informed them that there would be regular meetings during the course of the investigation but at no stage would he discuss evidence.   He explained that the purpose of the meetings was to provide updates and information about the progress of the investigation.  I was not shown minutes or contact logs of those early meetings.  It suffices that I say, at this stage, that there is no dispute about the fact that the rules of engagement laid down by Mr Coutts were appropriate.

Accordingly, in November 2003 Mr Coutts instigated a Victim Interview Strategy.  Further, on 19 November, Mr Coutts, Mr Penhale and Mr Marlow (the officer advising Mr Coutts on interview strategy) held a meeting with a number of solicitors who were representing victims.  I am not sure whether the meeting was confined to solicitors acting on behalf of the original defendants and it is not clear to me whether SM’s solicitor was present.  It matters not; the aim of the meeting was to provide information to those present about the steps which would be taken to ensure that evidence obtained from the original defendants (and others categorised as victims) accorded with best practice.  Following this meeting there was an exchange of correspondence between Mr Coutts and the solicitors acting for JA and RA since there was disagreement, to an extent, about the process for obtaining evidence suggested by Mr Coutts.  </p>

On the basis of the evidence provided to me I have no reason to doubt what she told me about what occurred in terms of recording contact with the original defendants during the period November 2004 to January 2007.  Without doubt, however, her evidence demonstrates that (a) there was regular contact between the original defendants and her (b) that it was intended that all the contact should be documented and (c) Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale intended that this should be the case since they had put in place the practice to be followed. It follows, of course, that there should not have been any undue difficulty about disclosing these documents. That such difficulties did arise, however, is beyond question.

Mr Jones does not say so expressly but it seems reasonable to infer from his witness statement that the intention was that these officers’ reports should also be filed with the copies of the log entries.  </p>

Certainly none of the questions asked of them in cross-examination challenged the evidence which they gave about what the system was and how it was intended to operate. Of course, the proper operation of this system should have ensured the retention of all relevant documentation.   As I have already observed, however, (paragraph 616 above) a contentious issue arose in the criminal trial about the efficacy of the system which, as is obvious, was as efficient only as the persons who operated it.</p>

It does not seem to me that this one reference (albeit apparently written with emphasis) is a safe foundation upon which I should conclude on balance of probabilities that Mr Coutts disclosed significant aspects of the forensic evidence to one or more of the legal representatives of the original Defendant especially since the same minutes record Mr Thomas, at the commencement of the meeting, making it clear that it would not be permissible for there to be a discussion of any specific evidential matters. </p>

When Mr Coutts was cross-examined about this part of the minute, he suggested that what he had said had been taken out of context.  His recollection was that the discussion at this point in the meeting was focusing upon the psychological assessment which had been undertaken upon SM. Mr Coutts was not seeking to protect SM from an attack from his credibility; he was seeking to ensure that SM’s suggestibility was not exploited.  According to Mr Coutts he gave much the same evidence on this point when he was questioned about it during the criminal trial involving the majority of the Claimants.  </p>

Equally, Mr Coutts’ explanation of the minute is not inherently implausible.  Even if Mr Coutts did express himself in the way which Ms Meader has captured in the minutes it would not be right to conclude that this remark was a real indicator that Mr Coutts had an improper relationship with the original defendant and/or their lawyers.</p>

At that meeting a discussion occurred about how best to secure a witness statement from a potential witness Helen Nying, formally Helen Prance.  She had provided a witness statement on 10 December 1988 in which she had given details about her relationship with TP.  In 2008 it was proving difficult for LW3 officers to make contact with Ms Nying in order to obtain evidence from her.

It is within my own professional experience over decades that police officers and/or solicitors who wish to obtain witness statements from potential witnesses sometimes ask persons closely connected to the witness to act as a point of contact.  Perhaps, and I stress perhaps, Mr Coutts should have realised that in an investigation of the sensitivity of LW3 it would have been better to avoid that type of conduct.

I have considered the terms of the Victims Code (albeit not the one which was in existence in 2010).  No part of the Code suggests that a police officer should discuss potential lines of defence with a victim who is also a witness.  That said, it is a very long jump from a finding that Mr Coutts spoke inappropriately to TP to a finding that he committed the tort of misfeasance in public office.  For reasons which I have begun to explain and which I will explain further at the end of this section I simply do not accept that Mr Coutts was acting in bad faith. Mr Coutts’ remarks were made in the presence of the CPS; it is inconceivable in my judgment that Mr Coutts would contemplate doing something which he knew or even suspected to be unlawful in the presence of a CPS representative.  Even if I am wrong in this view it seems to me to be inconceivable that Mr Paris would not have been alerted by his own lawyer that a potential line of cross-examination was that JG did not murder Lynette on his own and TP was involved with him.  If that is correct Mr Coutts’ revelation to the same effect could not possibly have caused any loss to the Claimants.  </p>

It was obviously necessary to undertake inquiries about how it might have got there.  An obvious possibility was that it had come from SM.  Mr Matthew Jones gave evidence to the effect that Mr Coutts told him to contact SM and his solicitor, Matthew Gold, to enquire of them whether SM was aspermic.  Mr Jones acknowledged that he spoke directly to SM and asked him if he was aspermic.  He did not, so he said, provide any significant detail to SM as to why he was making the enquiry.</p>

It is hard to believe, however, that Mr Jones’ question to SM, even if accompanied by some explanation of why the question was being asked, demonstrates an improper relationship between Mr Jones and SM let alone constituted an act of misfeasance either on the part of Mr Coutts or Mr Jones.  At worst, in my judgment, this episode was an example of the officers taking something of a shortcut.  The prospect of this shortcut impacting upon the fairness of the proceedings which, by this time, had been instituted against Claimants 1 – 13 seems to me to be remote.  Mr O’Connor made a note of the contact with SM.  The note was disclosed in the criminal proceedings.  No doubt, that is why Mr Metzer QC was able to develop this point in these proceedings.  To repeat, I do not see how the integrity of the prosecution against Claimants 1 – 13 could be undermined by this episode; to be fair to Mr Metzer QC, his written closing submissions do not suggest the contrary.   </p>

In the main, if not exclusively, they occurred later in time than the Dean Review which was completed in August 2006.   As I have said, the Dean Review was an important staging post in the evolution of LW3.  It seems to me to be very likely that once that Review had been produced Mr Coutts and, for that matter, many other officers involved in LW3 accepted the essential tenets of the Review – reinforced, as they were, by Mr Thomas’ commentary upon it.  I have no doubt that from this time forward Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale considered it very likely, at the very least, that JG had acted alone when killing Lynette, that the core four had committed perjury when giving evidence and that they had been pressurised into so doing by the actions of a number of LW1 officers.  I accept without reservation that as from late 2006 Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale considered that sufficient evidence had been obtained to justify prosecuting a number of LW1 officers and all that remained to be resolved was which officers were to be prosecuted.  </p>

Strictly, no doubt, Mr Coutts was walking on thin ice in making such remarks.  However, the reality is that as from late 2006, or thereabouts, Mr Coutts had formed the view that many police suspects should be prosecuted.  He had formed that view because he had by then come to believe that they had committed serious criminal offences during the course of LW1.  As I have concluded, already, there was a proper basis for Mr Coutts’ belief.  In making remarks such as those just described Mr Coutts was doing no more than articulating what was by then a firmly and genuinely held belief that a number of police suspects had committed the offences for which they had been arrested.</p>

Those remarks were made significantly before the Dean Review.  In fact, of course, they preceded the arrest of any police suspects.  I have no doubt that arrests of police officers or former officers (especially those who were senior officers in LW1) would have pleased the original defendants.  That is hardly surprising.  By this time the original defendants had been designated as victims, justifiably as I have found.  Perhaps more significant was Mr Penhale’s observation that he had a good relationship with JA and that he had helped him in relation to other matters.  That might, indeed, suggest that Mr Penhale’s relationship with JA was too close.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The relationship between a person designated as a victim of crime and senior police officers engaged in investigating that crime can be a difficult one to manage in practice.  I accept that viewed in hindsight and through a very critical lens there may have been instances in which Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale did not observe the clear line or “rules of engagement” which Mr Coutts, himself, had set with the original defendants and their solicitors above.  It may be, too, that the relationship between Mr Coutts, Mr Penhale and the original defendants and their solicitors strayed from the strictly professional on occasions, although I note that this was denied by at least two of the original defendants’ solicitors when this became an issue during the course of the criminal proceedings.  Whatever the precise position I do not consider that the Claimants have proved that Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale behaved in such a way towards the original defendants that this had any kind of impact on the fairness of the proceedings brought against the police suspects.  I am satisfied, too, that there is no basis upon which I could properly conclude that Mr Coutts, Mr Penhale or any other LW3 officer so conducted himself towards the original defendants or their solicitors that their conduct constituted the tort of misfeasance in public office.</p>

The wording of the Act has been amended over the years and the provisions which currently govern disclosure in criminal prosecutions are somewhat different to the provisions which were applicable in the proceedings brought against Claimants 1 to 13.  It is common ground that in those proceedings the Act imposed two disclosure duties upon the prosecutor.  First, the prosecutor was under a duty to disclose to the accused material which “in the prosecutor’s opinion might undermine the case for the prosecution against the accused”.  This obligation arose in every case and was known as “primary disclosure”.  As is readily apparent the prosecutor was required to form an opinion about whether the material in question “might undermine the case for the prosecution”.  Inevitably, there was scope for differing opinions.   Second, once primary disclosure had been provided and following the service of a “defence statement” (which set out the nature of the accused’s defence to the charge or charges against him) the prosecutor was obliged to disclose material which “might be reasonably expected to assist the accused’s defence” (secondary disclosure).  This obligation required the person considering the unused material to form a judgment by applying objective standards of reasonableness but, nonetheless, it is not difficult to imagine that on occasions there would be scope for a difference of view between different decision makers.</p>

In very large investigations which lead to prosecutions and when there is a large number of documents to be considered there are often teams of “disclosure officers” who undertake the task and for some time it has been common for those officers to work alongside lawyers and be subject to their guidance. </p>

The first major task was to locate and secure all the material of potential relevance which had been generated since Lynette’s murder.  The second task was to index this material on the HOLMES computer system. This process began shortly after the inception of LW3.  The locating, securing and indexing of the material which had been generated during LW1 and Operation Mistral was undertaken, at least in large part, before the decision was taken to charge the core four i.e. by the end of 2006. </p>

By then, he had been appointed a national trainer within the CPS in respect of disclosure of unused material.  In April and May 2006 he, and a fellow national trainer, Mr Welsh, provided disclosure training to six officers from LW3; they were Mr Monks, Mr Lane, Mr Rowlands, Mr Morris, Ms Hill and Ms Hearne.  In the months that followed he devised procedures to be followed with a view to ensuring that all the unused material was properly assessed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in"> In 2006, as now, unused material was recorded on standard forms known as MG6C, MG6D and MG6E.  MG6C was used to record material which was potentially relevant but non-sensitive i.e. material which the reviewing police officer thought was relevant to the case and which could be read, usually unedited, by the accused and his lawyers.  MG6D was used for sensitive material i.e. material that would not be disclosed to the accused and his legal team because it was not in the public interest so to do. MG6E was used for recording material that would undermine the prosecution case or assist the defence case.  This Schedule was crucial in a prosecution in which there was a large amount of unused material.</p>

The procedure adopted came to be known as “the E catalogue procedure”.  Any officer engaged in reviewing a document who considered that it should be included on schedule MG6E was also required to complete a separate form and provide a hard copy of the relevant document which were then considered by Mr Thomas.  Ms Hill says that it was she who devised the separate form to be completed.  This procedure was approved by Mr Dean and Mr Thomas at a meeting which was attended by Mr Monks and Ms Hill on 12 March 2007 at the Cardiff Crown Court.</p>

In any event, notwithstanding that these documents were produced the processes for managing disclosure remained, essentially, those which had been deployed during the course of the prosecution of the core four.  In particular, the E Catalogue Procedure remained the process which was used to determine whether a document should be recorded in schedule MG6E as being a document which might undermine the prosecution case or might support the case for the defence.  </p>

Mr Howard Cohen signed off each phase of disclosure on behalf of the CPS and the Lead Disclosure Officers also signed the schedules.  In that period they were, successively, Mr Allen, Mr May and Mr Rowlands.  Defence statements were served in September 2010 and many if not all of the statements contained requests for specific disclosure.  Further, a number of the prosecuted Claimants made applications to dismiss the proceedings.  Accordingly there was a need to deal with secondary disclosure as promptly as possible. The specific disclosure requests were answered in two phases – on 25 October 2010 and 21 January 2011.  Formal schedules were not produced but copies of the documents were sent to the solicitor acting for the accused person to whom the documents related.</p>

It is common ground that the obligations upon a prosecutor to disclose material which might undermine the prosecution case or which might assist the case for an accused are imposed for the purpose of ensuring that the accused receives a fair trial.  Accordingly, in cases in which there is likely to be a large volume of unused material it is crucially important to have in place procedures which ensure that material which might undermine the prosecution case or which might assist the case for the accused is properly assessed and accurately and clearly recorded in the appropriate schedule, namely MG6E.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The procedure followed in LW3 in order to achieve these aims was the E Catalogue Procedure.  I have no doubt that it was devised because Mr Thomas, in particular, and those officers most concerned with disclosure in the proceedings brought against the core four considered it a proper means of ensuring that all the documents by the police/CPS which might undermine the prosecution case or which might assist the case for an accused would be disclosed.  No one has suggested that this procedure did not work reasonably well in the proceedings against the core four.  No one in these proceedings has suggested in terms that this procedure should not have adopted in the proceedings against Claimants 1 to 13; certainly it has not been suggested that a different obviously superior methodology should have been adopted. However, as with all processes of this type, its success depended upon the efficiency and judgment of a number of different people.  Crucially, it depended upon the individual officer reading a particular document forming the correct view of its relevance; unless a document found its way into the E Catalogue system there was a distinct possibility that it would not find its way to the accused. Each of the officers who conducted the initial review of a document had to have sufficient experience and training to be able to discern when a document might undermine the prosecution case or assist the case for an accused.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">During the course of September, October and November witness statements were obtained from Mr Coutts, Mr May, Mr O’Connor and Mr Mathew Jones which, in effect, sought to provide answers to the various aspects of the complaints made about disclosure.  As I have said already, there were complaints about a failure to disclose contacts between LW3 officers.  There were complaints about the failure to disclose material from LW1.  The details of all the complaints are analysed in those witness statements.  No useful purpose would be served by setting out the detail in this judgment.  Witness statements were obtained, too, from Mr Clements and Mr Haskell.  A comprehensive document was prepared by Mr Dean and Mr Bennett to deal with alleged disclosure errors.  It was given the title “Analysis of Errors”.  The document began its life in early June 2011 but it seems to have been a living document in the sense that additions were made to it in the ensuing months as and when complaints about disclosure were made.  All the statements and the Analysis of Errors were produced in order to ward off the anticipated suggestion on behalf of the accused that they could not receive a fair trial.</p>

During the course of submissions on that day the judge resolved that he would set an exercise to be undertaken by the prosecution team; the aim of the exercise was to check the validity of assurances which had been given to the judge by Mr Dean, on behalf of the prosecution, that all disclosure problems had been solved.  The judge directed that all the material which had been brought to the attention of Mr Haskell by police officers (the E Catalogue material) should be identified; that Mr Haskell’s consideration of that material should be disclosed if in written form; that the prosecution should specify whether such documents had already been disclosed and it should also indicate whether any documents remained undisclosed.  My understanding is that Mr Clements and all prosecuting counsel were at court on this day so that the task set by the judge was to be supervised by the full legal team. A number of police officers were also present at court including Mr May and Mr O’Connor.</p>

They began to ring very loudly when Mr May indicated that he recalled a telephone conversation with Mr Allen in or about 2010 in which Mr Allen had suggested that the documents had been destroyed upon the instruction of Mr Coutts.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">How does this chain of events sit with the claim of misfeasance in public office made against the officers of LW3?  First, as a matter of fact, the documents in question were not destroyed.  There was no unlawful destruction of those documents and, so far as I am aware, of any other documents which came into the possession of the police.  Insofar as the Claimants found an allegation of misfeasance on the factual assertion that documents were destroyed that allegation must fail.  Second, it is possible to argue that Mr Coutts did issue an order to Mr Allen to destroy the documents but Mr Allen did not comply with that order.  Depending on the circumstances in which the order was given such an order might constitute misfeasance in public office.  In my judgment, however, it is very unlikely that Mr Coutts issued any such order.  Why would Mr Coutts direct the destruction of copies of documents when the originals were held safely by third parties?  Third, there is no obvious explanation for the difference in recollection between Mr May and Mr Allen about the conversation said to have taken place between them in 2010.  However, no one has suggested that Mr May has made up the conversation for any malicious purpose.  Of course, if Mr May did make up the conversation, presumably on the spur of the moment when Mr Kingsbury was unable to find the documents, his only conceivable motivation, so far as I can see, would have been to assist those on trial.  Given the impression that I have formed of Mr May that is a possibility to be discounted.  Fourth, I suppose it is conceivable that an officer based at St Athan deliberately hid the documents knowing the effect this would likely have on the proceedings against those on trial.  If any officer did act in that way it was probably misfeasance in public office but, without doubt, no loss was caused to the prosecuted Claimants.  The only effect of such an act by the unknown officer was to facilitate the ending of the proceedings against them.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The probability is that the documents were misplaced through human error.  Quite how they came to be found, apparently so easily, some weeks after the trial came to an end is a mystery which I cannot resolve and about which I decline to speculate.  To repeat, however, the Claimants have failed to establish that Mr Coutts (or any other officer) deliberately destroyed documents in the possession of the police and, that being so, that pleaded allegation of misfeasance must fail.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the light of that conclusion I do not propose to dwell upon the evidence which Mr Penhale gave about this aspect of the case.  He was cross-examined at length about parts of a statement which he made during the course of the IPCC investigation into the collapse of the trial.  In summary, Mr Penhale was very defensive about what had occurred and, it seemed to me that he was seeking to shift the blame for what occurred from the police officers involved to the lawyers.  Some of his answers were difficult to accept in the light of other evidence in this case, particularly that given by the team of prosecuting counsel.  To repeat, however, no useful purpose would be served in recounting in detail Mr Penhale’s evidence on the destruction issue since it was never suggested that he, personally, was involved in any way in how the documents came to be lost but then found.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Having reflected upon those submissions, I have decided that I must and will determine whether officers deliberately and/or recklessly ignored their disclosure obligations.  The reasons will become apparent shortly.  However, I cannot possibly decide whether the system was fit for purpose or whether there were systemic failures. In order to decide those two issues I would have to consider disclosure in such detail that this judgment would be very considerably longer than is already the case.  Further, and more importantly the judgment would lose sight of its true focus which is to consider whether individual officers committed the tort of misfeasance in public office by virtue of their conduct during the disclosure process.  There have been two investigations already into the collapse of the trial and the part played in that collapse by disclosure failures (see paragraph 712 below).  I do not propose to turn this judgment into a third such investigation.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Of course, if a detailed analysis of whether the disclosure process was fit for purpose and/or whether there were systemic failures was strictly necessary in order to determine whether the Claimants had been the victims of the tort of misfeasance, no doubt, the lengthening of the judgment would not, of itself, be a reason to baulk at descending to the detail.  However, even if the disclosure process was not fit for purpose and/or even if there were systemic failures these of themselves would not sustain a finding of misfeasance in the absence of a finding that the officers engaged in disclosure either knowingly or recklessly exceeded their powers and/or otherwise acted in bad faith.  In the context of disclosure it would be necessary to demonstrate that the officers involved in the process either deliberately or recklessly ignored their statutory obligations thereby causing significant failures in the disclosure process.  Reduced to essentials before misfeasance could be proved in the context of disclosure failings Claimants 1 to 13 would have to prove that LW3 officers deliberately or recklessly suppressed documents which they knew should have been disclosed.  There is simply no evidence that the lead disclosure officers or their subordinates acted in this way.   This conclusion is justified by a number of pieces of the evidential jig-saw. First, I gained a favourable impression of all the officers who gave evidence before me on the disclosure issues.  Second, without doubt, there was close supervision of the disclosure process by the team of prosecuting lawyers.  Mr Haskell was relatively inexperienced but I have no doubt that he had a very sound grasp of the issues and that he was astute to apply the statutory provisions about disclosure in an appropriate manner.  However, the evidence which most convinced me that there was no deliberate or reckless withholding of documents which undermined the prosecution case or assisted the defence was that part of the evidence which I heard about a number of documents which came to light shortly before the trial began.  A consideration of three such documents will suffice.</p>

The attendance note was hand written.  It comprised seven sheets.  It began by describing, in summary, events in the week leading to Lynette’s murder.  There followed a description of SM’s movements on the Saturday night and his discovery that Lynette was staying at 7 James Street.  SM described how he spent some time at the Casablanca Club and then decided to go to 7 James Street to see if Lynette was there.  His account continues:-</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“The flat at 7 James Street is only about 100 – 150 yards from the club.  I think there might have been a Cortina outside the flat, it was dark coloured or appeared to be in the streetlight.  The front door was ajar, Lynette always closes doors so it seemed a bit funny.  I pushed the door and the door opened onto some stairs.  On the stairs were two white men.  I had never seen them before.  One of these men had longish hair, shoulder length, the other had shortish hair, like the policeman who was with you last time.  One was taller, the one with the long hair, they were standing on different stairs so this is difficult really.  Both men were looking up to another room and I remember that one of them had like bum fluff moustache and beard.  I squeezed past them on the stairs about got to the top of the stairs and heard noises.  It sounded like people talking quietly.  I turned the corner, and walked down the landing to a room on my right, the door of which was open.  Ronnie Actie was standing on the area between the door frames, I think this door opens from left to right.  (He indicated that facing the door the opening part with the handle would be to the left of the door frame).  As I entered the room I said nothing to Ronnie, I walked straight in and then saw a bed or something like a bed to my left.  Lynette was standing next to this and Tony Paris was standing close to Lynette.  Della was standing in about the middle of the room and John Actie was standing to the left of the room door.  There were two windows in the room, they faced the door.  I walked straight up to Lynette and said “why didn’t you phone or contact me?”  I then punched her in the mouth because she smiled at me stupidly.  It was a right hand punch, she fell to the floor, she got back up, I walked away from her and Tony Paris, passed where Della was standing.  I then heard Tony Paris say who are you talking to you bitch or something like that.  He then slapped her face left handed, she fell down to the floor again, got up and started to have a go at him, like thumping him with both fists and kicking him.  He held her by the jumper, by her throat, top of her chest at arms length with his left hand, and then I saw him take a knife with his right hand from somewhere on his right side.  He then stabbed Lynette in her left side just under the ribs, she fell to the floor and then when she was on the floor she screamed twice.  I walked to Tony Paris and Della had walked towards him as well.  As I got to Paris he threatened me with the knife and said “do you want some?”  I backed off again and said “no I don’t want no trouble, I’m not looking for trouble.”  I am aware that Paris is evil and I didn’t want any part of him.  Both the Actie’s are mad as well.  I had about got back to where I was when Tony Paris stabbed Lynette when Leanne Vilday came into the room.  She shouted “what have you lot fucking done” or something like that.  She had only just got into the room, I panicked and ran out.  I went down the stairs which were now empty, slipped on the bottom stair, ran and ran and eventually got back outside the Casablanca.  I got in my car and went home.  I really couldn’t believe what had happened.  I just couldn’t accept it.  It seemed to have been done for no reason.”</p>

That is hardly surprising.  At some stage, however, SM’s solicitors must have relented and provided the attendance note to which I have just referred to the CPS.

However, that has been explained in the evidence.  In summary the taxing officer responsible for determining the fees of Mr Rees QC sent it to the taxing officer who was responsible for assessing the fees of leading counsel for the prosecution.  No doubt, quite legitimately, the two officers were comparing notes so as to determine the appropriate fees.  The result was, however, that the assessment prepared by Mr Rees QC found its way into a file within the CPS.</p>

For reasons which do not matter in this context this action was not pursued for some years – see paragraph 10 of the witness statement of Ms Louise Frazier.  In 2010 she took steps to recover files from the CPS and, eventually, on or about 22 June 2010 Ms Frazier received two large boxes of documents from a representative of the CPS.  The documents contained within the boxes were the files held by the CPS in relation to JG.  Ms Frasier transported the boxes to the MIR at St Athan.

It was in one of the boxes of material which had been provided by the CPS – see paragraphs 6 – 9 of Mr Rowlands’ second statement.

There is no evidence which suggests that the file in which the assessment was located was provided to the police earlier than June/July 2010.

All three documents came from sources which were beyond the control of the police officers.  The attendance note came from those acting for SM; the taxation note came from the CPS and the medical report came from LV, herself, in the sense that it would not have surfaced but for her consent.  It is very unlikely that those documents would have been disclosed if, as the Claimants allege, there was an orchestrated campaign, driven by Mr Coutts and/or Mr Penhale and/or by the Lead Disclosure Officers, to suppress exculpatory material.  </p>

The IPCC also conducted a review albeit on a more limited basis.  That report was published on 4 July 2013.

I make it clear that I have not ignored the reports but my primary focus has been upon the evidence provided to me from all the officers who had significant responsibility for the disclosure process during the criminal trial.  I stress that this includes both their witness statements in this trial and the statements which they produced during the criminal trial and subsequent investigations.  I have also paid close attention to the evidence provided by Mr Dean, Mr Bennett and Mr Haskell.  In my judgment it is this evidence which provides the most reliable basis upon which to reach a conclusion about whether any LW3 officer committed the tort of misfeasance in public office by virtue of his conduct in relation to disclosure in the criminal trial.  On the basis of this evidence the tort is not proved.</p>

However, it is usually comparatively easy to recognise when it exists.  As I have said on more than one occasion Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale were subjected to comprehensive cross-examinations. Those examinations were also skilful and persistent.  The aim of the cross-examinations was to undermine their credibility and to seek to demonstrate that, in truth, they were guilty of acting in bad faith throughout LW3.  I had a very good opportunity to assess them over many days.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I would exaggerate if I said that they escaped their examinations unscathed.  There were aspects of their evidence which I found difficult to accept without qualification.  I have referred to Mr Coutts’ evidence as it related to contact with the original defendants and his exaggeration of a particular aspect of the ESDA evidence.   I formed the impression, too, that Mr Coutts was reluctant to accept that relations between Mr Hart and he had soured to the extent that I have found.  He never succeeded in explaining to me why Mr Sekar enjoyed the status he was afforded during the course of LW3.  For all intents and purposes Mr Sekar was treated as if he was a victim.  His book was supplied to all the investigators engaged in LW3.  For my part I can see no justification for the special status which was afforded to Mr Sekar and only marginal benefits to be derived from the investigators reading his book.  Mr Penhale was defensive when dealing with disclosure failures and, as I have said, I was not impressed with some of the answers which he gave about the events immediately surrounding the collapse of the trial.  He was seeking to shift the blame from police officers to the lawyers in a manner which was not particularly attractive. The cross-examinations of Mr Penhale also demonstrated that his suspicions about wrongdoing were very easily aroused.  That may be an occupational hazard; on balance, my view is that Mr Penhale was overly suspicious of the conduct of many of the persons who had been involved in LW1.</p>

My judgment is they went about their tasking of leading the investigation with two clear objectives.  First, they were determined to prove that they were prepared to investigate current and former colleagues without fear or favour. Second, they were determined to undertake a thorough and rigorous investigation of police and civilian suspects who were alleged to have committed very serious criminal offences.  For reasons which I have sought to explain, however, they did not either knowingly or recklessly exceed their powers.  Very importantly, they did not close off lines of investigation which were likely to be advantageous to the police suspects and they did not hide or suppress exculpatory material either in their dealings with the CPS or, to the limited extent that they were involved personally, in the disclosure process once the prosecution had begun.  They had a very close working relationship with Mr Thomas and prosecuting counsel but that was because each of those persons, quite independently, considered that the evidence available justified arresting all the Claimants and prosecuting Claimants 1 – 13.</p>

Ultimately, however, my judgment is that the officers involved in LW3 did not act in bad faith whether their decisions acts or omissions are viewed in isolation or cumulatively.  Those seeking to prove the tort of misfeasance in public office have to surmount a number hurdles which are set at a considerable height.  It is a tort which is usually very difficult to prove.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Let me deal first with the most likely explanation for this state of affairs.  In my judgment, the most obvious explanation for this stark difference is error on the part of the person or persons who drafted the witness statements.  I say that for a number of reasons.  First, quite clearly, paragraph 31 of Mr Boulton’s statement and paragraph 25 of Mr Stephens’ statement were either drafted by the same person or drafted by the two of them together. As I have said, the words of the paragraphs are very similar and they are identical insofar as they relate to the ESDA evidence.  Second, the draftsman could not have drafted the paragraphs by reference to the grounds for  arrest written by Mr Penhale.  Third, the paragraphs bear no relation, either, to the witness statements of Mr Coutts or Mr Penhale or any of the witness statements I have seen which were written by Dr Barr or Mr Richardson.  Accordingly, I am left to conclude that a significant error has crept into these witness statements. That view is reinforced by the fact that the allegation made against Mr Daniels in the witness statements would not, necessarily, be inaccurate if it had been made against Mr Gillard.  The suggestion that a page had been inserted in the middle of a statement made by AP would not sit uncomfortably with the allegation that Mr Gillard re-wrote a page of AP’s statement of 6 December – as to which see paragraph 740 below.  At all material times Mr Daniels and Mr Gillard dealt with AP together.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I am satisfied, however, that the error lies in the witness statements.

In my judgment they did not arrest him on a completely false basis. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The grounds for arrest prepared by Mr Penhale identified other aspects of Mr Daniels’ conduct upon which it was reasonable to suspect that he had participated in the crimes for which he was to be arrested.  First, he had a “prominent role” in the evidence gathering process.  Second, he had been one of the police officers who had brought AP to the police station on 10 December and it was reasonable to suspect that he had been instrumental in keeping her there for a period in excess of 12 hours given that he was the officer who had written her statement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">One of the curiosities of the document prepared by Mr Penhale is that it makes no reference to the fact that AP’s statement of 11 December 1988 was markedly different to any other account which she gave.  It seems to me this was, inevitably, an important point to be considered given that Mr Daniels had been present on every occasion when AP had given her accounts in November and earlier in December.  Mr Penhale did draw attention to the fact that the statement was made during a time that AP alleged she was the subject of threats and intimidation from “the interviewing officers” but, to repeat, he made no mention of the fact the statement contained a markedly different account from anything which AP had said previously.  I am satisfied, however, that this point would have been well known to Mr Coutts when he made the decision that Mr Daniels was to be arrested.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On behalf of Mr Daniels, Mr Simblet submits that there were a number of features in play at the time of the arrest which, properly assessed, would have negated any reasonable suspicion that Mr Daniels was involved in any of the offences for which he was arrested.  First, there was the inherent improbability of a police officer of many years unblemished service acting in such a criminal fashion.  Second, Mr Daniels was a comparative stranger to the other officers involved in the investigation.  Third, there was no motive identified for Mr Daniels to commit the crimes of which he was suspected.  Fourth, AP never, directly, implicated Mr Daniels in any wrongdoing.  In this respect, Mr Penhale was wrong to write that AP had alleged that she was the subject of threats and intimation by “interviewing officers”.  Fifth, in any event, her complaint of the treatment handed out to her by the police was not worthy of belief.  Sixth, Mr Daniels had interviewed a number of witnesses during the course of LW1 and none of those witnesses had made any specific allegation against him – indeed some had spoken in positive terms about him.  In particular Mr Daniels had been one of the officers who had taken the statements in late November 1988 from persons working on the Coral Sea.  Their statements had supported YA’s alibi.  Mr Simblet submits that it makes no sense that an officer engaged in a conspiracy to manipulate evidence to incriminate the original defendants would be content to take statements from witnesses which supported YA’s alibi.  As Mr Simblett puts it, it is difficult to conceive of a police officer “popping in and out” of the alleged conspiracy.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Simblet also seeks to argue that the state of the ESDA evidence as of early 2005 was not as represented by Mr Coutts or Mr Penhale.  In the main this point relates to whether there had been an attempt to write out “Jack Ellis” from the statement made by AP on 6 December.  However, as I have already pointed out, this point did not feature in the grounds for arrest which Mr Penhale prepared in relation to Mr Daniels.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have given some considerable attention to Mr Simblet’s submission that Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale misrepresented the state of the ESDA evidence.  There are, in reality, two distinct issues.  First, was it misrepresented to the arresting officers in 2005?  Second was it being misrepresented in the evidence before me?  It is the first of those two issues with which I am now concerned.  I have dealt with the second issue at paragraphs 526 – 532 above.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The task of determining whether the ESDA evidence was misrepresented to the arresting officers in 2005 is best looked at by reference to two distinct strands of evidence.  The first strand is the evidence given by most of the arresting officers.  Many of the witness statements of those officers relied upon by the Defendant attest to the fact that the ESDA presentation at the briefings at the Hilton Hotel in Swindon was provided by Dr Barr and Mr Richardson.  No arresting officer was cross-examined on the basis that those persons had not made a presentation at the briefings.  That is hardly surprising since there is no reason to doubt that they were in attendance.  If it is accepted, however, that the ESDA evidence was presented at the briefings by Dr Barr and Mr Richardson it is very unlikely that the arresting officers were provided with misinformation about the state of that evidence.  In reality there is simply not a shred of evidence which supports the conclusion that those scientists were misrepresenting the state of the ESDA evidence at the briefings to the arresting officers. It seems to me to be wholly implausible that two distinguished experts would misrepresent the true state of the evidence.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second strand of evidence which bears upon whether there was any misrepresentation of the ESDA evidence to the arresting officers is Dr Barr’s witness statement of August 2010.  As I have indicated already that statement identifies when each ESDA point of significance emerged.  I have reached the clear conclusion that there is no evidence upon which it would be safe to conclude that Mr Penhale and Mr Coutts misrepresented the state of the ESDA evidence to the arresting officers thereby calling into question the reasonableness of any belief they might hold as to the justification for Mr Daniels’ arrest.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">What of the other points made by Mr Simblett?  I fully understand that many of them could be deployed, some with considerable force, during the course of adversarial criminal proceedings.  I accept, too, that the suggestion that AP was threatened and intimidated by “interviewing officers” does not accord with what she asserted in interview under caution.  Nonetheless, I have reached the clear conclusion that notwithstanding these legitimate arguments there were reasonable grounds to suspect that Mr Daniels had been involved in the offences for which he was arrested.  I reach that conclusion notwithstanding the evidence advanced in the witness statements of Mr Boulton and Mr Stephens.  The fact that their evidence to me is wrong in relation to the ESDA evidence as it related to Mr Daniels cannot, in itself, be a proper basis for saying that no reasonable grounds existed to suspect Mr Daniels of involvement in the conspiracy.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, the error made in the witness statements of Mr Boulton and Mr Stephens has caused me to re-visit their assertions that they believed that reasonable grounds existed to justify Mr Daniels arrest.  Can that be correct given their clear error? In my judgment, the answer to that question is yes.  I consider it far more likely than not that notwithstanding the error in the witness statement Mr Boulton had a clear and accurate understanding of the grounds for suspecting Mr Daniels at the time when he was considering the justification for his arrest.  I am satisfied that he had been provided with Mr Penhale’s grounds for arrest in respect of Mr Daniels. I am satisfied, too, that Dr Barr and Mr Richardson presented the ESDA evidence to the arresting officers during the course of the briefings in advance of the arrest. It is very unlikely, in my judgment, that the evidence was correctly represented to Mr Boulton and Mr Stephens by the scientists but that they misunderstood it.  The witness statement is erroneous but, in my judgment, it does not represent Mr Boulton’s true understanding in April 2005. </p>

Let me deal first with his arrest on 13 April.  Mr Prentice was the arresting officer.  In his witness statement Mr Prentice says that that he took account of three strands of evidence when deciding that reasonable grounds existed to justify Mr Page’s arrest.  First, he relied upon a complaint made about Mr Page by Mr Peter McCarthy.  Mr Page had, allegedly, told Mr McCarthy that YA had admitted the murder which, if said, was an untruth. Second, it was alleged that Mr Page had tried to intimidate Mr Orton over a proposed change to Mr Orton’s evidence which would have assisted the alibi defence of YA.  Third, he relied upon the ESDA evidence presented to him by Dr Barr and Mr Richardson.  In his witness statement Mr Prentice does not explain the nature of this evidence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Penhale prepared detailed grounds for arrest in respect of Mr Page.  It began by acknowledging that Mr Page was “not officially attached to the enquiry” but then went on to assert that Mr Page “had a prominent role”.   Mr Penhale identified a number of specific grounds upon which he considered Mr Page’s arrest was justified.  First, Mr Page was one of the officers involved in conveying JA from his home to Butetown police station on 9 December 1988.  It was suspected that this was a “sham arrest” – for all practical purposes identical to the allegation made in respect of the arrest of TP (see paragraph 134 above).  Second, Mr Page was named in the B59 as one of the officers who interviewed LV on 11 December.  Accordingly, it was reasonable to suspect that Mr Page had been a party to detaining her against her will and that he was party to the threats and intimidation to which she claimed to have been subjected.  Third, Mr Page was the author of the witness statement of Mrs Perriam which was dated 11 February 1988.  As at the date of Mr Page’s arrest Mr Penhale considered that there were a number of suspicious factors relating to this statement.  I quote:-</p>

This statement had been dated incorrectly, and concerns the identification of Rashid Omar, who she previously identified in Statement 2626A as being outside the murder scene in the early hours of 14 February 1988.  Statement 2626B states that she cannot be 100% sure that she can identify Omar as one of the four persons outside James Street between 01.30 and 01.45 on 14 February 1988.  This statement effectively puts Omar out of the picture.  This combined with the alibi he provides weakened any case against him and he was released, NFA.</p>

This is the action that instructs DC James to take a statement from Violet Perriam.  It would appear that this action was finalised and written whilst resting on the first page of Perriam’s statement dated 5 January 1989.  This sequence of events is reflected in Perriam’s nominal card and strengthens the hypothesis that this chain of events is accurate.  This indicates that the statement Page claimed to have taken from Perriam on 11 December 1988 did not enter the Incident room document flow until some date after 5 January 1989.  </p>

It has also been the subject of handwriting analysis with regard to the authenticity of the signatures held within the pages.  No opinion can be expressed as to whether any of the signatures of Perriam were written by Page.  This is mainly because her signature is of a fairly simple design containing few distinctive features, although a visual examination by a lay person would show that the signature on the statement are clearly different from that of her other statements.  This statement was also that which caused her concern when shown to her during her interviews by the Phase III team.”</p>

He submits, too, that there was nothing suspicious, in reality, about Mr Page’s involvement with Mrs Perriam.  The statement taken by Mr Page was, on any view, wrongly dated and, by far, the most likely explanation was a simple mistake.  Mrs Perriam had denied any wrongdoing of any kind albeit she had decided to decline to answer some of the questions put to her in interview under caution and it was at least possible (to put it at its lowest) that Mrs Perriam’s evidence as to what she had seen on 14 February 1988 was supported by the account which had been given both in interview and statement form by Ms Carole Wheeler.  Further, and importantly, it was always acknowledged that Mr Page was not, officially, involved in the investigation.  In those circumstances, submits Mr Thomas QC, it was improbable that he would involve himself in criminal conduct.</p>

In my judgment, Mr Penhale produced a reasoned and detailed analysis of why it was reasonable to suspect that Mr Page had committed the offences for which he was arrested.  I acknowledge that Mr Prentice, seemingly, attached importance to the complaints by Mr McCarthy and Mr Orton in addition to the points which had been made by Mr Penhale.  No doubt he was entitled to take these additional points into account when making the decision that Mr Page’s arrest was justified.

In his grounds for arrest Mr Penhale concentrates very much on the effect of the ESDA evidence.  At the date of Mr Seaford’s arrest the ESDA evidence available demonstrated that Mr Seaford had rewritten page 3 of MG’s statement of 22 November 1988.  It also suggested that the rewritten page used words which had the effect of making MG’s identification of RA and YA more convincing compared with the words used in the original page 3.  In summary, the words used in the original page 3 had suggested that MG had learned of the identity of YA and RA after the night of 13/14 February 1988 whereas the final version suggested that he knew them as of that date.</p>

This Appendix was in the form of a chart which set out in diagrammatic form the nature of the evidence as a whole.  In my judgment, the fact that the ESDA findings were not restricted to one suspect or a statement or statements from one witness inevitably increased the suspicion that a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice was in operation and that persons implicated in wrongdoing by ESDA evidence were participants in that conspiracy.</p>

All those who participated in the adversarial briefing considered it was reasonable that the police suspects should be arrested.   Essentially, they all accepted the reasoning advanced by Mr Penhale in his “Arrest Strategy”.  In these circumstances it would be very difficult for me to conclude that the decisions to arrest the suspects were unreasonable.  I appreciate that it is for me to determine whether the decisions were unreasonable notwithstanding the consensus which had emerged about the arrests.  Obviously, however, the views of very senior police officers, the IAG, the CPS, the independent consultants and the IPCC carry very significant weight. I cannot possibly conclude that no reasonable senior police officer presented with the information provided to Mr Coutts would have authorised the arrests or that no reasonable arresting officer provided with the same information would have carried out the arrests. I have reached the clear conclusion that the decisions to arrest Mr Daniels and all other officers in the first phase of arrests were not unreasonable.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the grounds for arrest Mr Penhale identified the following as justifying Mr Greenwood’s arrest.  First, Mr Greenwood had “performed a prominent role in the evidence gathering process”.  Second, Mr Greenwood was a member of the Serious Crime Squad at the material time – a position he shared with many of the other police suspects.  Third, Mr Greenwood was involved with MG on 22 November 1988.  He was named in the B59 as an interviewing officer.  He had interviewed MG with Mr Seaford during the course of the morning.  Later that day MG had given a markedly different account to Mr Seaford and Mr Pugh in a question and answer session and Mr Seaford had taken a witness statement from him confirming that markedly different account.  While Mr Penhale acknowledged that Mr Greenwood was not the author of the statement and had not been engaged in interviewing MG when he first gave his different account he considered that Mr Greenwood was “clearly closely connected to the events that led to the statement being taken”.  He considered, too, that there were grounds for concluding that Mr Greenwood was complicit in keeping MG at the police station on 22 November against his will.  Fourth, Mr Penhale considered that there were grounds to suspect that Mr Greenwood had been involved in interviewing LV on 6 December 1988.  He was named as one of the two interviewing officers in the B59.  Mr Penhale knew that Mr Greenwood was not the author of the statement which LV made on that date but he considered that he was “closely connected” to the events that led to the statement being taken.  Further and allied to this point Mr Penhale suspected that Mr Greenwood had been complicit in keeping LV at the police station for many hours against her will.  Fifth, Mr Penhale drew attention to the ESDA evidence as it related to MG’s statement of 22 November and LV’s statement of 6 December.  The inference to be drawn from what he wrote was that Mr Penhale suspected that Mr Greenwood was in some way linked to wrongdoing in respect of the writing of those statements.  Finally, Mr Penhale relied upon the fact that Mr Greenwood was one of the four officers who conveyed TP to the police station on the morning of 9 December 1988 engaging in what has been called “the sham arrest”.</p>

He disputes that it was reasonable to conclude that Mr Greenwood had a prominent role in evidence gathering.  He disputes that the time spent at the police station by MG on 22 November 1988 and LV on 6 December 1988 was, in itself, suspicious.  He points out, correctly, that there was nothing suspicious about Mr Greenwood’s involvement with MG during the question and answer session in which he participated with Mr Seaford during the morning of 22 November.  Further there is no direct evidence that Mr Greenwood had any involvement with MG at any time thereafter on that day.  It is simply wrong, submits Mr Metzer QC, to assert that Mr Greenwood was closely connected to MG making his witness statement on 22 November just as it was wrong to suggest that he was closely connected to LV making her statement on 6 December.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Despite Mr Metzer’s powerful submissions I cannot conclude that there were no reasonable grounds to suspect that Mr Greenwood was involved in the offences for which he was arrested.  As of April 2005 it was known that Mr Greenwood was an officer who had been involved in LW1 more or less throughout its duration and he was a member of the Serious Crime Squad.  He was, in my judgment, accurately described as a person who had a prominent role in the evidence gathering process.  He was named in the B59 as being one of the interviewing officers of MG on 22 November and of LV on 6 December and the ESDA evidence demonstrated serious concerns about parts of the statements which were written on those dates.  The fact that it was known that Mr Greenwood was not the author of those statements did not, automatically, negate the reasonable suspicion that he was a party to what had occurred.  Even if I am wrong on this latter point, I am firm in my view that it was reasonable to infer that Mr Greenwood had been involved in keeping MG and LV at the police station against their will.  There was a justified suspicion that Mr Greenwood and others had behaved improperly towards TP on 9 December (even if their conduct did not amount to a crime) and, in my judgment, that episode was not irrelevant in an assessment of whether reasonable grounds existed to justify the arrest of Mr Greenwood. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">If the sole focus of attention is or should be 6 December 1988 the following picture emerges.  The B59 records Mr Greenwood as being one of the persons who interviewed LV on that day.  LV was at the police station for a very long time – on any view.  As of April 2005 there was no sensible explanation for the length of time which she spent at the police station.  In my judgment, it was reasonable to suspect that she was at the police station for that length of time because she was prevented from leaving.  Further, as the evidence stood in 2005, it was reasonable to suspect that the persons named as interviewing officers in an official record (the B59) were involved in detaining her.  </p>

In simple terms, there is a much higher threshold for prosecution than there is for arrest.</p>

That said, I acknowledge that Mr Taylor’s assertion that MG had complained of threats and intimidation from interviewing officers was, probably, wrong and, of course, MG made no complaint about his treatment during the interview which took place on 22 November 1988 in which Mr Pugh was involved.</p>

According to Mr Keech, Mr Kerley contacted a senior member of LW3 by telephone (whom he believes was Mr Coutts).  Mr Keech says that Mr Kerley suggested to Mr Coutts that the home of Mrs Coliandris should be searched but that she should be bailed to attend at a police station at a later date for interview under caution as opposed to being taken to the police station that day.  This suggestion was rejected according to Mr Keech – a decision which disappointed him.  Mr Kerley makes no mention of this discussion in his witness statement.

First, he submits that Mr Penhale was wrong to assert that Mrs Coliandris interviewed LV together with Mrs O’Brien and Ms Cuddihy.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As a matter of fact, it now appears that Mr Penhale was wrong in his assertion that Mrs Coliandris had interviewed LV together with Mrs O’Brien and Ms Cuddihy if by using the word “interview” he was intending to suggest that it was those persons who had been present at the time LV’s witness statements were taken.  It is now agreed that the person who was present when Mrs Coliandris took LV’s statements was Mr Hicks.   It seems very unlikely, too, in the light of all the information now available that Mrs Coliandris had been present for any length of time at the Butetown police station before she took those statements so that it is most unlikely that she was involved with Mrs O’Brien and Ms Cuddihy in any interviews prior to taking the statements.  However, what needs to be considered is not what is now known but what Mr Kerley, Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale knew as of 21 April 2005.  The B59 named Mr Page, Mrs O’Brien and Ms Cuddihy as the interviewing officers.  It did not mention Mrs Coliandris. The statements taken from LV showed on their face that they had been written by Mrs Coliandris.  The report written by Mr Davies on 5 April 1989 contained the following assertion namely that LV “was re-interviewed by Detective Constables O’Brien, Cuddihy, Coliandris and Inspector Page on the 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 1988 at the Docks Police Station which culminated in a further statement being obtained….”.  As far as I am aware, no other written material was considered by Mr Coutts, Mr Penhale and the arresting officer which related to Mrs Coliandris’ involvement in interviewing and/or taking statements from LV.  LV’s interviews under caution threw no further light on the subject and, as I have found, Mr Coutts and Mr Penhale were not aware of the witness statements of 25 October 1989 made by Mrs Coliandris and Mr Hicks.</p>

In my judgment it was not.  Mr Davies’ report on this point contained no reasoning to support his conclusion that Mrs Coliandris had been one of the interviewing officers.  In my judgment, the overwhelming likelihood is that Mr Davies simply assumed that Mrs Coliandris was part of an interviewing team because her name appeared on LV’s statement.  In passing, he also appears to have assumed that Mrs Coliandris was a detective which, of course, was erroneous.  I am prepared to accept that these assumptions in a report of the type written by Mr Davies may have been understandable.  The details relating to those who had interviewed LV and/or taken statements from her were not important at that stage of the LW1 investigation.  In my judgment, however, it was necessary for Mr Penhale and Mr Coutts, in particular, to assess the reliability of the assumptions made by Mr Davies before accepting them as forming a reasonable basis for suspecting Mrs Coliandris’ involvement in serious criminality.</p>

He was fully aware that at the material time she was a constable in uniform based at the Cardiff Central police station.  In my judgment, on the basis of those facts and given that she was not named in the B59 as an interviewing officer it was not reasonable to suspect that Mrs Coliandris had been involved with Mrs O’Brien and Miss Cuddihy in interviewing LV.  It must commonly be the case that a police officer or officers will have detailed discussions with a potential witness about his evidence but then another officer is tasked to take a witness statement.  Mr Penhale seems to have discounted the possibility that Mr Page was one of the officers who interviewed LV (at least in the grounds for arrest he prepared in respect of Mrs Coliandris).  What basis was there for discounting that possibility but suspecting that Mrs Coliandris was involved in the interview process?  In my judgment just as Mr Davies assumed that Mrs Coliandris was with Mrs O’Brien, Miss Cuddihy and Mr Page when LV was interviewed so Mr Penhale assumed that she had been with Mrs O’Brien and Miss Cuddihy at that time.  I do not consider that this assumption was reasonably based.  In truth it must have been based solely upon the fact that Mrs Coliandris’ name appeared on LV’s statements of 11 December 1988 from which it was reasonable to infer that Mrs Coliandris had written the statements but no more.  In my judgment Mr Cragg QC is correct to categorise as an error the suggestion in the grounds for arrest that LV was interviewed by Mrs Coliandris, Mrs O’Brien and Miss Cuddihy.  There was no reasonable basis for that assertion.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Cragg QC is also correct when he submits that Mr Penhale fell into error when he suggested that LV had complained of threats and intimidation from “the interviewing officers”.  I set aside the fact that there was no proper evidence or information available upon which to suspect that Mrs Coliandris was an interviewing officer as opposed to the officer who had written the two statements.  When LV was interviewed under caution she did not suggest that she had been intimidated, threatened or bullied by Mrs Coliandris.  To the contrary, she could hardly remember her.  That, of course, in itself may be a reasonable pointer to the fact that Mrs Coliandris was no more than a scribe.  After all, she would have been in her police uniform on 11 December 1988 yet Mrs Coliandris appears to have made no impression on LV or, at least, none worth mentioning.  I have scrutinised LV’s prepared statements and interviews under caution with care.  In my judgment there is no basis for the assertion that it was the officer or officers taking her statements on 11 December who were subjecting her to intimidation and threats and there is certainly no basis for suspecting that Mrs Coliandris had behaved in this way.</p>

That said there can be no disputing the fact that the statements made by LV on 11 December 1988 were written by Mrs Coliandris and, as Mr Penhale pointed out, those statements provided incriminating evidence against the original defendants which was completely false.  Was it reasonable to suspect that Mrs Coliandris had committed one of the crimes for which she was arrested simply on the basis that she was the author of those statements?</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have found this a difficult issue.  Ultimately, however, I have reached the conclusion that it was not reasonable to suspect that Mrs Coliandris had committed the offences for which she was arrested simply because she had written out LV’s statements.  In reaching that conclusion I have paid particular regard to a number of factors.  First, Mrs Coliandris was a police constable in uniform at the material time.  She would have stood out like a sore thumb and very likely be recognised and remembered if she, personally, had resorted to intimidation and threats.  Second, there was no reason to suppose that she had any connection with LW1 save for the taking of LV’s statements on 11 December 1988.  Third, there was nothing to suggest that she had any professional or social connection with any of the detectives involved with LW1 who were on duty on 11 December 1998.  Fourth, there was nothing to suggest that she knew, or knew of, LV.  Fifth, so far as anyone could judge Mrs Coliandris’ involvement in the investigation had come about by chance.  In truth it was inexplicable (as it was, still, when Mr Dean and Mr Bennett wrote the Dean Review).  Sixth, there was no realistic basis to suspect that, somehow, Mrs Coliandris had been enlisted by fellow officers to engage in a conspiracy to mould or manipulate evidence.  That appears to me to be a very implausible scenario.  Seventh there was no reasonable basis to suspect that Mrs Coliandris knew, believed or suspected that LV was telling untruths when her statements were taken.  In reality, that could only have come about if Mrs Coliandris had been enlisted into the conspiracy and briefed about what it was that LV was expected to say.</p>

In my judgment, however, it was not reasonable to suspect that she had been at the station for any length of time which was longer than the time needed to write out LV’s statements.  Certainly, it was not reasonable, in my judgment, to suspect that she had been at the police station for very many hours longer than that.  However, as it seems to me, it is only if it was reasonable to suspect that Mrs Coliandris was at the police station for many hours that day would it become reasonable to suspect that she had, in some way, been involved in a conspiracy and/or had been involved in detaining LV against her will and/or she had engaged in misconduct in public office.</p>

I accept that submission as is obvious from what I have said previously.  He further submits that there were strong grounds to suspect that the statement had been procured by unlawful means.  That too, in my judgment is uncontroversial given the findings I have made previously.  He submits that it was reasonable to suspect, at the very least, that she must have been present when another officer or officers were “putting words into Vilday’s mouth”.  That is a submission which has some force but I cannot help but think that it is fashioned from the now undisputed fact that Mr Hicks was present with Mrs Coliandris at the time the statement was taken. Mr Johnson QC stresses that at the time of the arrest of Mrs Coliandris it was not known that she had only arrived at the police station that afternoon.  That of course is true but, as I have said, that does not mean in her case that there was a reasonable basis to suspect that she was present for longer than was necessary to write out the statements.</p>

Mr Johnson QC counters that by submitting that the interviewing officers, by then, had been provided with information from Mrs Coliandris’ pocket books (seized during the course of the search of her home) which showed that she had gone to the Butetown police station at about 2.00 p.m. on 11 December 1988.</p>

It is probable that the officers had been told during the course of the day that Mrs Coliandris had been with LV for a comparatively short period of time on 11 December.  On any view, they had been reluctant to arrest Mrs Coliandris in the first place and, no doubt, they were still well aware that a funeral of a family member was in progress and/or had taken place.</p>

At the time when Mr Coutts made his decision that they should arrested the first phase of arrests had not taken place.  Accordingly, it seems clear that Mr Coutts made the decision to arrest on precisely the same basis as his decision was made for the first phase.  In all the circumstances, that approach was reasonable – certainly I could not say that no reasonable senior police officer would have made the same decision as was made by Mr Coutts.  By the time the arresting officers exercised their power to arrest it was known that evidential material had been seized during the course of the searches of the homes of Mr Gillard and Mr Page.  In my judgment that was an additional factor which the arresting officers were entitled to take into account, if they so chose, when deciding whether the arrests of Mr Greenwood, Mr Pugh and Mrs Coliandris were reasonable.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The decision to arrest Mrs Coliandris must be considered in a somewhat different light.  The officers who had been arrested in the first phase (except Mr Page) were all officers who had been substantially involved in LW1 more or less from the start.  The same was true of Mr Greenwood and Mr Pugh.  Although Mr Page was not, officially, a member of LW1 save for short designated periods of time he was the most senior officer in uniform at Butetown police station throughout 1988 and, therefore, was reasonably suspected of having a substantial knowledge of the investigation.  Mrs Coliandris, on any view, was engaged in the investigation for no more than some hours on one day.  It is easy to see why Mr Cragg QC argues that no account was taken of the circumstances which were relevant to Mrs Coliandris alone.  He points out that the arrest strategy written for her was, essentially, identical to the arrest strategy written for all the suspects in phase one and identical to the other suspects in phase two.  He submits that it was not reasonable to conclude that Mrs Colinadris would not have co-operated voluntarily by engaging in interviews under caution and permitting a search of her home in appropriate circumstances.  Mr Coutts and/or Mr Penhale knew that Mrs Coliandris had retired as disabled from the police force, that her husband had been diagnosed with cancer and that she had two children.  They appeared to ignore the very substantial impact which an arrest without warning would have upon Mrs Coliandris and her family.  On the very day of the arrest, Mr Kerley sought permission to permit Mrs Coliandris to attend a funeral. That request was refused.  As a matter of timing Mrs Coliandris may have been arrested by the time that this request was made and refused but had the request been granted Mrs Coliandris would not have been taken into custody.</p>

However, I doubt whether this episode, of itself, can render unlawful what would otherwise be a lawful arrest.  If, as I have found, the decision to arrest at a very early hour of the morning cannot be a reason why an otherwise lawful decision to arrest becomes unlawful it does not seem to me that a decision to go ahead with an otherwise lawful arrest renders the arrest unlawful because it involves denying that person the possibility of attending a funeral of a family member. </p>

Second, Mr Jennings, together with Mr Stephen, interviewed PA on 22 November during which interview PA provided evidence of the circumstances of Lynette’s murder which was untrue.  Mr Jennings is recorded in the B59 as the interviewing officer on that day.  Third, it was suspected that Mr Jennings was present on 6 January 1989 when a further statement was taken from PA by Mr Stephen which incriminated RA and YA. Fourth, although PA had never made a direct accusation of improper behaviour against Mr Jennings proper grounds existed to suspect that Mr Jennings had been very much involved in the evidence gathering process in relation to PA and, on that basis, there were reasonable grounds to suspect that Mr Jennings was party to the threats and intimidation of which PA complained.</p>

Mr Metzer QC makes a number of powerful points in support of that central proposition.  First at the trial of the original defendants presided over by McNeil J the prosecution decided against calling PA as a witness because he could not be relied upon.  Second, the value of PA’s testimony was described in scathing terms by Leonard J during the course of his summing up in the second trial.  Third, PA had never admitted committing perjury in an interview under caution.  It is true that he had made admissions in his interviews with officers from Operation Mistral but his accounts in those interviews were very difficult to understand and were often contradictory.  Reduced to its essentials PA was the most unreliable of unreliable witnesses and the information provided by him could not justify arresting anyone.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On any view these are very powerful points.  However, as I see it there are two substantial difficulties which Mr Metzer QC cannot overcome.  First, the allegations made by PA of police impropriety cannot be viewed in isolation.  The allegations made by PA to the officers of Operation Mistral, although garbled, were similar to allegations made by the core four and other persons who were either arrested by or gave statements to LW1 officers.  For the purposes of deciding whether there were reasonable grounds to suspect that PA’s allegations of police misconduct were true it was permissible for Mr Penhale and Mr Coutts to take account of the fact that his allegations were similar to those made by others.  While that is not mentioned in Mr Penhale’s grounds for arrest the point was so obvious that it need not be spelt out.  The second difficulty which faces Mr Metzer QC is the similarity between aspects of the false account given by PA and MG, in particular.  In his closing submissions Mr Metzer QC sought to demonstrate that no such similarity exists.  I am afraid I do not accept that.  In my judgment there were significant similarities between the accounts given by MG and PA.  It is also to be observed that MG’s account on 22 November 1988 emerged very shortly after a similar account was provided by PA.  </p>

While I acknowledge that PA’s credibility and reliability was always open to very serious question, the co-incidence in time between the disclosures of PA and the disclosures of the other members of the core four and, in particular MG, cannot be other than suspicious.  In the context of the case as a whole it was reasonable to suspect that the persons who interviewed PA on 22 November and thereafter were party to the threats and intimidation which PA described and it was certainly permissible to suspect that they had a guiding hand in the false account which PA gave about his knowledge of the circumstances of the murder. </p>

He further stated that Stephen was quite friendly towards him.  This would appear to be further evidence of the ‘good cop bad cop’ strategy, which appears to have been adopted with a number of witnesses during this investigation.</p>

It was correct of Mr Penhale to draw attention to the fact that PA had positively exonerated Mr Stephen from improper behaviour.  Of course, Mr Penhale chose to view this as an example of what he called the ‘good cop bad cop’ strategy but, nonetheless, it would have been open to Mr Coutts to take a different view had he thought it appropriate.  What is clear is that Mr Penhale did not seek to hide an aspect of PA’s evidence which might assist Mr Stephen in his contention that he had behaved properly in his dealings with PA.</p>

They can be summarised as follows.  First, Mr Murray had performed a prominent role in the evidence gathering process.  Second, he was the author of two statements taken from MG dated 25 May 1988 and 5 January 1989.  MG had alleged that one of those statements was true (the statement of 25 May) but he had admitted that the statement of 5 January 1989 contained lies in that it incriminated RA and YA in Lynette’s murder and suggested that PA had gone to the murder scene after hearing screams.  Third, MG had identified Mr Murray as being one of the officers who had pressurised him.  He was the officer with a beard and moustache and he had been one of the first officers to whom MG had related his changed account so it was said.  Fourth, Mr Murray was said to be “clearly closely connected” to the events giving rise to MG making a witness statement on 22 November 1988 which contained untruths and which ESDA testing had shown had been re-written to an extent.  Fifth, Mr Murray had been named in a document (not the B59) as one of the officers who had interviewed MG on 6 December.  MG had alleged that on that day he had been held against his will and “subjected to threats and intimidation”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have given long and anxious consideration to whether reasonable grounds existed to connect Mr Murray with MG on 22 November 1988.  Obviously that day was an important one given that this was when MG first changed his account to suggest that he had important information about the events surrounding Lynette’s murder.  I have taken account of all the points made by Mr Cragg QC which seek to demonstrate the various accounts given by MG of Mr Murray’s involvement on 22 November were simply unreliable and should not have been relied upon as any basis for justifying his arrest.  With some hesitation I have concluded that that is not correct.  Upon a fair reading of MG’s interviews prior to his arrest i.e. during Mistral and in his interviews under caution he was suggesting that Mr Murray was present on that date and there were grounds for believing that MG was asserting that Mr Murray was one of the first officers to whom he provided his changed account.  I appreciate that, later, evidence emerged which cast considerable doubt upon whether this could be accurate.  However, on the basis of MG’s assertions in interview it was reasonable to suspect that Mr Murray had been present at Butetown police station on 22 November 1988 and that he had participated in the process by which MG gave his changed account.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">If that analysis is correct then I am satisfied that reasonable grounds existed to justify his arrest.  In addition to the suspected involvement on 22 November there were proper grounds to suspect that MG had been interviewed by Mr Murray on 6 December 1988.  In my judgment it was reasonable to conclude that if, as he alleged, MG had been kept at the police station against his will on that date the officers engaged in interviewing him were complicit in that detention.  Mr Cragg QC complains that Mr Boulton mis-states the position in his witness statement when he suggests that MG alleged that Mr Murray and Mr Pugh subjected him to threats and intimidation on 6 December 1988.  That is, I accept, a possible reading of the witness statement.  It is also possible that Mr Bolton was intending to convey that while Mr Murray and Mr Pugh had been complicit in detaining MG other, unknown, officers had threatened and intimidated him.  I say that, of course, because in his grounds for arrest Mr Penhale does not suggest that MG alleged that either Mr Murray or Mr Pugh threatened or intimidated MG.  Mr Penhale simply recorded that MG had complained of being detained against his will, threatened and intimidated.</p>

As I have said, the decisions to arrest were closely connected to the perceived need for the suspects’ homes to be searched.  The searches had produced evidential material during the first two phases of arrest and, in my judgment it was still realistic to suppose that evidential material would be recovered in the third phase.  Notwithstanding the submissions by leading counsel to the contrary, I have reached the conclusion that the decisions to arrest Mr Jennings, Mr Stephen and Mr Murray were not unreasonable.</p>

As a result of these alleged threats and intimidation Mr Grommek changed his evidence providing incriminating evidence against Ronald Actie, Yusef Abdullahi and Martin Tucker.  Mark Grommek was interviewed twice and provided a subsequent witness statement which later ESDA examination indicated that page 3 had been re-written to negate the need for identification procedures because the named individuals are ‘known’ to Mark Grommek and not simply named by him.  Although Mr Mouncher is not the author of this statement it was alleged by Mark Grommek that he was clearly closely connected to the event that led to the statement being taken.  Leanne Vilday alleged that she was held against her will at Butetown police station where Mr Mouncher had threatened and intimidated her which resulted in her changing her account in statements dated 6 and 11 December 1988 providing incriminating evidence against Steven Miller, Ronald Actie, John Actie, Toby Paris and Yusef Abdullahi.  When subsequently interviewed Leanne Vilday alleged that it was Mr Mouncher who ‘broke her’ into telling the police what they wanted to know.

In summary the grounds relied on by Mr Lewis as justifying the arrest of Mr Mouncher were as follows.  First, the allegation made by MG that Mr Mouncher had pressurised him while MG was at the Butetown police station on 22 November 1988.  Second, the allegation by LV that Mr Mouncher had pressurised her when she was at the police station on 6 December 1988.  Third, the length of time spent by both MG and LV at the police station on the dates to which I have referred.  MG was at the police station on 22 November for a period of at least 8 hours; LV was at the police station for upwards of 10 hours on 6 December.  Fourth, the witness statement made by MG on 22 November had been subjected to ESDA analysis.  Although the ESDA findings in respect of this statement were relevant, primarily, to the person who had written it (Mr Seaford), Mr Lewis considered that Mr Mouncher’s involvement with MG meant that he was “closely connected to the events that led to the statement being taken”.  Fifth, ESDA analysis had been undertaken of the statement made by LV on 6 December 1988 and this had provided grounds for suspecting that its author (Mrs O’Brien) had engaged in criminal conduct.  Again, it was Mr Lewis’ view that Mr Mouncher “was closely connected” to the events which gave rise to the making of that statement.</p>

In respect of the first two phases, at the very least, the arrest strategy (which was identical to the arrest strategy adopted in respect of Mr Mouncher) was subject to independent scrutiny at the adversarial briefing.  No person present at that meeting thought that it was unreasonable to arrest the suspects then under consideration.  It is, of course, true that the adversarial briefing took place before some of the suspects offered to attend a police station voluntarily.

According to MG, too, Mr Powell was involved in this conduct on 22 November 1988 and 6 December 1988 when he was held against his will at the police station for lengthy periods. In the grounds for arrest which he prepared Mr Lewis suggested that the length of time during which MG was at the police station on 22 November and 6 December 1988 was a factor to be taken into account when making a decision about Mr Powell’s arrest.

Of all the complaints made by the core four MG’s complaints about Mr Powell rank with LV’s complaints about Mr Mouncher as being the most coherent and consistent. I have reached the conclusion, not without some hesitation, that it was objectively justified to arrest Mr Powell on the basis of those complaints.</p>

During the original investigation Mr Morgan was a senior supervisory officer involved when a number of statements were taken, which provided incriminating evidence against a number of the original suspects.  It is alleged that witnesses who provided those statements were held in police stations during which time they were subjected to threats and intimidation during a critical phase of the enquiry i.e. from the 6 - 12 December 1988 when Mr Morgan was chairing conferences or was in such a position of authority that officers briefed him in relation to the ongoing investigation and that the direction and control of the enquiry was his responsibility.  In his diary entry dated 9 December 1988 … Mr Morgan commenced duty at 06.45 hours and updates his diary ‘on duty Docks incident room confer Inspector Page and teams to arrest John Actie and Anthony Paris’.  He makes a further entry at 09.30 hours that day contradicting the previous entry stating ‘confer D/CA/Supt Williams.  Actie and Paris after initially being brought to station as potential witnesses and interviewed were arrested and conveyed to designated stations for further interview’. …”</p>

First, during a critical period of the investigation Mr Davies the Deputy SIO was on leave “leaving Mr Morgan as one of the senior officers in charge of the investigation”. Second, the available documentary evidence provided grounds to suspect that Mr Morgan was implicated in the sham arrests of TP and JA.  Third, Mr Morgan was responsible for decision making in the period 6 - 12 December 1988.  That was apparent from diaries recovered from Mr Murray and Mr Mouncher.  Extracts from those diaries indicated that Mr Morgan was involved with briefings and conferences with Mr Mouncher; the extracts indicate that Mr Morgan was “chairing the conferences or was in such a position of authority that officers briefed him in relation to the ongoing investigation, therefore concluding that direction and control of the enquiry was the responsibility of him”.  Fourth, Mr Powell had suggested in his interviews under caution that Mr Morgan had a supervisory role.  Fifth, Mr Morgan had been appointed to the Serious Crime Squad (East) on 17 October 1988.  That coincided with his appointment as Office Manager.  Sixth, on 14 March 1989 Mr Davies had written an appraisal of Mr Morgan which included the following:-</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In powerful detailed submissions Mr Bowen QC seeks to demonstrate that the grounds for arrest identified by Mr Gavin Lewis and the grounds relied upon by Mr Pitchford were misconceived.  In particular, he argues that there were never reasonable grounds to suspect that Mr Morgan was one of the senior officers in charge of the investigation or one of the officers at the centre of decision making during the period identified, namely between 6 – 12 December 1988.  Essentially Mr Bowen’s submissions can be drilled down into two strands. First Mr Morgan was the office manager of the MIR; it was inevitable that he would be involved with the officers working in the MIR and that he would provide direction and control in respect of their work.  That was no more and no less than doing his job.  Second, while Mr Davies may have been on leave, Mr Williams, the SIO, certainly was not.  LW3 officers had access to Mr Williams’ diary (reference is made to it in Mr Morgan’s grounds for arrest) and it was obvious from the entries made therein that the SIO was heavily involved in what was going on in this crucial period.</p>

Mr Mouncher’s diary entry for 6 December shows that quite soon after commencing his shift he “conferred with Mr Morgan”.  Similar entries were made for 7 December and 9 December.  There are other entries for 6 and 7 December which might show that the two men were conferring.  Mr Murray’s diary entry for 6 December begins with a reference to a conference with Mr Morgan.  There is a similar reference in the entry for 7 December and there is a reference to a briefing with Mr Morgan having taken place early in the morning of 8 December.  The entry for Saturday 10 December begins with a record of a briefing taking place with Mr Morgan.  The entry for 12 December has a similar entry given that it is reasonable to infer that the words “confer D/C/I” referred to Mr Morgan.</p>

I note that there was a clear connection between Mr Mouncher and Mr Morgan on some of these crucial days and, in particular, there was a connection between them on 6 December.  Immediately after the diary entry which speaks of a conference between Mr Mouncher and Mr Morgan Mr Mouncher “conferred” with all the officers who were to interview/take statements from the core four and Jack Ellis.  I have already concluded that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that Mr Mouncher was engaged in criminal conduct towards LV on 6 December and, in my judgment, it was reasonable to suspect that Mr Morgan was complicit in what was occurring.</p>

He submits that Mr Powell’s answers were much more consistent with an acceptance that Mr Morgan was the Office Manager of the major incident room i.e. responsible for managing the activities within that room.  Put in its proper context, submits Mr Bowen QC, Mr Powell was not suggesting that Mr Morgan was responsible for directing the activities of those officers who were taking statements from crucial witnesses.  He submits, too, that Mr Lewis was wrong to rely upon Mr Davies’ appraisal of Mr Morgan which referred to him as being “to the forefront” when LW1 was brought to a successful conclusion.  He reminds me, too, that Mr Penhale conceded that the sham arrest standing alone could not justify an arrest of anyone.  There can be no doubt that the answers of Mr Powell in interview and the report of Mr Davies taken in isolation would hardly justify Mr Morgan’s arrest.  I agree with the submission of Mr Bowen QC to that extent.  The allegation of involvement in the sham arrest can provide support for the decision to arrest but cannot justify the arrest standing alone. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The first feature relied upon by Mr Bowen QC is the contact between Mr Morgan and Mr Hywel Hughes following AP’s disclosures on 10/11 December 1988.  Mr Bowen QC makes two points about this episode.  First, Mr Hughes’ potential importance as a witness was obvious, at the latest, once Mr Gillard had produced his prepared statement in interview under caution in May 2005.  Second, LW3 officers did nothing to investigate Mr Gillard’s assertion at any time prior to Mr Morgan’s arrest.  As Mr Bowen QC points out it is difficult to pin point when it was that LW3 officers first made contact with Mr Hughes but there is no suggestion that this occurred before Mr Morgan was arrested.  The Defendant has not explained why that is the case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second point relied upon by Mr Bowen QC relates to diary entries which were, by then, available to LW3 officers other than the diaries of Mr Murray and Mr Mouncher.  They included a print out of Mr Williams’ diary.  In his written closing submissions Mr Bowen QC devotes a good deal of time to analysing Mr Williams’ diary for the period mid November 1988 to 11 December 1988.  His submission, based upon this analysis, is that it is clear that Mr Williams was in control of events during the whole of this critical period.  His diary entries admit of no other interpretation.  Mr Bowen QC accepts that there were times, during this period, when Mr Davies was absent from the enquiry, but, to repeat, his submits that it is clear throughout this critical period Mr Williams was firmly in charge.  That he submits wholly invalidates the suggestion made in Mr Lewis grounds for arrest that Mr Morgan was involved in controlling the investigation.</p>

However, it does not follow, either as a matter of logic or common sense that Mr Morgan did not have a role in the investigation which was considerably wider than the role of Office Manager of the MIR.  Further it is noteworthy that Mr Mouncher’s diary contains no reference to Mr Williams’ involvement during the period 6 to 12 December until the morning of 11 December.  In my judgment, the fact that Mr Williams was demonstrably in overall charge of the investigation between 6 December and 12 December does not negate the suspicion that Mr Morgan, too, was involved in directing and controlling what was occurring in these crucial days. </p>

Mr Bowen QC submits that Mr Penhale’s focus on 6 December 1988, in the witness box, was a cynical manoeuvre on his part designed to divert attention from the fact that the main thrust of Mr Lewis’ grounds for arrest had been shown to be without foundation. </p>

I am conscious, however, that the events of 6 December 1988 were crucial in the evolution of LW1 on any view.  Having given Mr Bowen’s submission due weight I am not prepared to conclude that Mr Penhale engaged in a cynical manoeuvre.  In any event, that is not what I have to decide.  I have already concluded that Mr Penhale genuinely believed that grounds existed to justify Mr Morgan’s arrest.  Nothing in his oral evidence led me to doubt the genuineness of that belief.  Accordingly my task now is to evaluate whether the grounds which Mr Penhale relied upon were justified, objectively.  On any view of the evidence Mr Morgan’s involvement in the events of 6 December 1988 was a factor which Mr Penhale relied upon to justify his decision.  I have reached the conclusion that the suspected events of 6 December and Mr Morgan’s suspected involvement in those events did justify his arrest.  I have said it more than once but it is worth repeating.  The threshold for a justified arrest is comparatively low and, on that basis, I am not persuaded that no reasonable grounds existed to justify Mr Morgan’s arrest.</p>

As it happens, the search of his home would not have discovered that material.  It was open to a reasonable and responsible senior officer, however, to consider that an arrest without notice followed by a search provided the best chance to obtaining evidential material and, therefore, the decision in his case was not unreasonable.</p>

Mr Penhale set out three options for consideration by Mr Coutts.  The first option was “arrest by appointment”, the second option was “arrest without pre-disclosure or warning” and the third option was not to arrest Mr Hicks but rather invite him to attend at a police station for interview under caution voluntarily after first providing him with relevant disclosure.  Having set out the options Mr Penhale made no recommendation as to which should be adopted.  </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“On 23 April 2007 I was asked to consider the POI package in respect of Stephen Hicks.  In asking himself the question whether reasonable grounds existed to believe that relevant material would be present at the scene, DCI Penhale was unable to make a firm recommendation to me.  On the aforementioned date, I raised Stephen Hicks to a suspect status and I made the decision that he should be arrested.  In asking myself the question did reasonable grounds exist to consider that material might be present at the suspect’s home address, I considered that due to the lapse of time and that no material had been since January 2006, a period of 14 months, it would not be reasonable nor proportionate to arrest and conduct a search without pre-disclosure or warning.  I therefore made the decision that arrest by appointment would be the method of approach to be adopted.  Whilst this was at variance with previous approach, I was content at this time and stage in the process that this method was appropriate, reasonable, fair and proportionate.”</p>

Self evidently, however, the witness statement does not deal with the issue of whether it was necessary for Mr Hicks to be arrested for a reason within section 24(5) of PACE.  I am not satisfied that the Defendant has proved that Mr Coutts considered whether ‘the necessity test’ was satisfied before he made his decision to arrest Mr Hicks.  I accept that the person of interest package contained the typed sheets to which I have just referred but there is not a shred of direct evidence which begins to prove that Mr Coutts considered them and made a conscious decision that an arrest was necessary.

However, I have reached the conclusion that it was not open to Mr Kerley to conclude that there were reasonable grounds to believe that an arrest was necessary by virtue of one or more of the criteria set out in section 24(5) of PACE.  The only conceivable basis was section 24(5)(e) whereby an arrest may be necessary “to allow the prompt and effective investigation of the offence, or of the conduct of the person in question”.  I simply do not understand how there were reasonable grounds to suspect that an arrest was necessary for those purposes.  The offences for which Mr Hicks was to be arrested had occurred approximately 18 ½ years before the decision was taken to arrest him.  There was a delay of two months or thereabouts between the decision to arrest Mr Hicks and his actual arrest.  No evidence has been adduced to show that an arrest was necessary to allow the prompt and effective investigation of the offences.  Whatever the proper interpretation to be given to the words “the conduct of the person in question” there was no basis to conclude that an arrest was necessary on account of any actual or predicted conduct on the part of Mr Hicks.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Apparently, Mr Kerley considered Mr Hicks’ arrest was necessary because Mr Hicks could have left at any time during the course of his interview under caution if he was not under arrest “thereby frustrating the inquiry”.  In my judgment two points need to be made about that suggestion.  First, there is no evidence that anyone addressed the likelihood of Mr Hicks attempting to walk out of the police station during the course of his interview under caution or how the progress of the inquiry would be hampered or frustrated if Mr Hicks was arrested at that point as opposed to upon his arrival at the police station.  Second, the statutory provisions relating to the ‘necessity test’ would be nullified if it was open to a police officer to say that arrest in advance of an interview under caution was always necessary to prevent the person being interviewed attempting to leave.  Stripped to its essentials, in the context of this case there must have been reasonable grounds to believe that an arrest was necessary to allow the prompt and effective investigation of the offences allegedly committed by Mr Hicks.  In my judgment no such grounds existed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Were there reasonable grounds for his arrest albeit, in my judgment, the arrest was unnecessary?  Mr Kerley describes the reasons why he arrested Mr Hicks in the same paragraph of his witness statement to which I have referred.  Reasonable grounds existed, in particular, because LV had been subject to threats and intimidation by police officers “whilst giving witness statements to Mrs Coliandris in the presence of Mr Hicks”.  The grounds for arrest prepared by Mr Penhale were comparatively long and detailed.  Mr Penhale began by drawing upon information from the Hacking and Thornley Review about Mr Hicks’ involvement in LW1. Next he set out Mrs Coliandris’ involvement with LV on 11 December 1988 together with a substantial extract from the Dean Review which demonstrated Mr Dean’s suspicion that another officer must have been present at the time LV’s statements were taken.  Mr Penhale then described how the witness statements made by Mrs Coliandris and Mr Hicks on 25 October 1989 came to be discovered (as to which see paragraph 578 above).   Next, Mr Penhale summarised the statements and expressed his view of Mr Hicks’ involvement on 11 December 1988:-</p>

He suggested that Mr Hicks had been involved in interviewing Anthony Brace on 7, 8 and 9 December and TP on 10 December.  All these references were wrong.  Mr Brace had died by this time and Mr Hicks did not interview TP on 10 December.  It probably matters not, however, since Mr Hicks acknowledges that he was involved in interviewing suspects on those days albeit the suspect in question was MT and, in any event, it is quite clear that the focus of the grounds for arrest prepared by Mr Penhale was Mr Hicks’ involvement in the taking of LV’s statements on 11 December 1988.  </p>

Mr Hicks’ involvement was quite different from Mrs Coliandris.  He was an officer who was familiar with the course of the investigation.  It was reasonable to suspect that he was one of those officers who was a party to LV being pressurised and/or intimidated into giving the account which she provided on 11 December.  Alternatively or additionally, it was reasonable to suspect that Mr Hicks had sufficient knowledge of LV’s account on 6 December 1988 to make it plausible that he was engaged in feeding her lines which was one of her primary complaints. I appreciate that Mr Hicks was involved with LV on 11 December only.  If, however, it was reasonable to suspect that her statement of 11 December was untruthful, as it clearly was, it was also reasonable to suspect that Mr Hicks was unlawfully involved in procuring the making of that statement.</p>

I appreciate this point was not considered in detail at the oral hearing but it seems to me to be an inescapable conclusion. Mrs Coliandris’ position is different in the sense that I have determined that her arrest was unlawful. In Mr Morgan’s case his claim was issued inside the limitation period but he did not plead a cause of action based upon a failure to comply with the statutory provisions of PACE.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment and in summary the relevant sequence of events was as follows.  From the outset, Mr Coutts sought guidance from the CPS.  At the meeting on 11 September 2003 he made it clear that LW3 officers would be seeking guidance from the CPS throughout the investigation and a comprehensive review following its completion.  Following the arrests of civilian and police suspects (if not before) it became clear that the reviewing lawyer at the CPS would be the person who would have a crucial role in deciding whether any suspect was to be charged.  That was abundantly clear from the evidence given by Mr Thomas which was not disputed.  The decision to prosecute the core four was made by senior lawyers at the CPS.  When Mr Hart became the reviewing lawyer, one of the first decisions he made was that he would not make the charging decision in respect of police suspects until the proceedings against the core four were concluded.  The decision that the CPS should accept that PA was not fit to plead was made by Mr Hart and his view was endorsed by very senior lawyers at the CPS at a Director’s Case Management Panel.  Following the conviction of LV, AP and MG Mr Dean and Mr Bennett produced the Dean Update, Mr Bennett produced his assessment of the credibility of the core four, Mr Hart produced his Review as to Charge and, thereafter, a number of discussions took place between very senior members of the CPS and counsel.  At the Director’s Case Management Panel which met on 27 February 2009 it was decided that Mr Clements should make the decision about whether charges should be brought against the police suspects.  He had expressed the view at the meeting that prosecutions were justified.  Subsequently he provided a charging decision in writing.  I find it impossible to conclude, in the light of this history, that Mr Coutts was the prosecutor.  Both in form and substance the prosecutor was the CPS.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For reasons which I have explained in Section 7 there is no proper evidential basis to conclude that any officer from LW3 withheld evidence or potential evidence from the CPS before the decision to prosecute was made.  There is certainly no evidence upon which to conclude that Mr Coutts orchestrated the withholding of evidence and/or withheld it himself.  In my judgment what occurred in this case was no different to many other cases where there is a huge volume of documents.  The vast majority of relevant documents were supplied by the police to the CPS in order that the CPS, in conjunction with counsel, could consider whether it was appropriate to bring a prosecution.  A very small number of documents (comparatively) may not have found their way from the police to the CPS by the time the decision to prosecute was made but, in my judgment, that was not by reason of any bad faith or malice on the part of the police but rather this was the product of human error.  In a very small number of instances the errors may have amounted to negligence as opposed to inadvertence, although no useful purpose would be served by trying to decide which it was.  I am satisfied that there was no withholding of documents or evidence which was motivated by malice which was the product of bad faith.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It follows from these findings and those set out in Section 7 that there can be no question that the prosecution was brought maliciously.  On that ground, too, the claims for malicious prosecution must fail.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I can deal with the issue of reasonable and probable cause quite shortly.  Once malice or bad faith is removed from the equation and once it is accepted, as I accept, that the vast majority of relevant documents were considered by leading and junior counsel before they advised it seems to me that one need look no further than the documents which counsel produced for establishing  reasonable and probable cause.  It is enough for me to list these documents without attempting to describe them in detail.  The documents which establish reasonable and probable cause are the Dean Review, the Dean Update, the Credibility Assessment of the Core Four and the various advices written by counsel.  Once the prosecution was launched, counsel produced a case summary and, in due course, a written opening statement.  In my judgment the content of all these documents clearly justified the conclusion that there was reasonable and probable cause to prosecute Mr Daniels, Mr Gillard, Mr Page and Mr Hicks.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is not without significance, too, that a number of officers made applications to Sweeney J to dismiss the charges brought against them pursuant to the provisions of Schedule 3 Crime and Disorder Act 1998.  In summary a judge is empowered to dismiss charges brought against a person “if it appears to him that the evidence against the [person] would not be sufficient for him to be properly convicted”.  One of the Claimants who brought such an application was Mr Hicks.  Sweeney J rejected the application; the submissions made to him and his decision can be found at Core Bundle Volume 15 pages 10942 – 10945.  I am probably not bound by the ruling of Sweeney J as a matter of law but it provides very significant support for my conclusion that there were proper grounds upon which to prosecute Mr Hicks.  </p>

She was interviewed under caution on 21 April 2005 and then released on bail to return to Swansea police station on 9 June 2005.  On that date further interviews under caution took place and, at their conclusion, Mrs Coliandris was bailed to appear at the Swansea police station on 29 November 2005.  Mrs Coliandris appeared on that date and further interviews took place.  At the conclusion of the interviews she was bailed to re-appear at Swansea police station on 16 February 2006.  She remained on bail until 27 February 2007.  As I have said Mrs Coliandris’ bail was unconditional.  </p>

The conclusion reached was that Mrs Coliandris should not be prosecuted.  It is of some note, however, that Mr Dean was sceptical about the accounts which Mrs Coliandris had given in her interviews under caution about the manner in which she had obtained statements upon LV on 11 December 1998.  Put shortly Professor Coulthard had doubted whether Mrs Coliandris had been alone (as she maintained) when she had taken LV’s statement and Mr Dean shared that scepticism.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Given the nature and extent of LW3 as a whole I do not consider that the period which Mrs Coliandris spent on bail constituted a breach of her Article 8 Rights.  As I have said, already, I doubt whether a remand on unconditional bail even for a very significant period of time can attain a sufficient level of seriousness so as to constitute an infringement of Article 8 Rights.  However, I am prepared to acknowledge that this may be to underestimate the impact of having to attend a police station albeit very infrequently and the stress and concern necessarily attendant upon the initial arrest and the extended period of bail.  Accordingly, I have thought it prudent to consider whether any infringement of Mrs Coliandris’ rights was justified. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have no doubt that any such infringement was justified in this case.  Although, as I have found, Mrs Coliandris’ arrest was not justified that does not mean that her interviews under caution were not justified and the decisions to remand her on bail were not justified.  It has not been suggested that there was no power to remand Mrs Coliandris on bail.  As I have said the challenge relates to the time spent on bail.  This was a very complicated and extensive enquiry and, as it happens, the case against Mrs Coliandris became more difficult to assess following her interviews under caution.  As the Dean Review demonstrates Mrs Coliandris’ accounts of how she had taken LV’s statement on 11 December 1988 were open to some question.  Notwithstanding the fact that the Dean Review concluded that Mrs Coliandris should not be prosecuted and, further, that Mr Thomas shared that view I do not consider that Mr Coutts and the LW3 officers who had investigated Mrs Coliandris were unreasonable to ask the lawyers to reconsider her case.  That occurred and, shortly thereafter, Mrs Coliandris’ bail came to an end.  In my judgment her claim that her rights under Article 8 ECHR were unjustifiably infringed has not been made out.</p>
