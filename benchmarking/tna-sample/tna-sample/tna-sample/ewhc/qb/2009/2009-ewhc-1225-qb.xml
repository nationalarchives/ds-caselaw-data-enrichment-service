It is a matter to which it will be necessary to return, but it should be noted that a good deal that has been asserted by Counsel at this stage of the case has not been tested by reference to a full analysis of the evidence.  A number of matters that may appear to have been put forward as “facts” have yet to be considered fully and properly in the way that a full trial of the issues demands.  It should also be understood clearly that my task in these proceedings at this stage necessarily and inevitably involves making a number of assumptions about what may be established at a future trial.  Whether those assumptions prove to have been valid or correct will depend upon a full evaluation of the evidence at trial.   </p>

Those considerations may play a part in the analysis of the issues.   However, the essential starting point is that there is no unique law that applies to this case: the law is that which Parliament and the higher courts have laid down in relation to limitation issues in all personal injuries claims.   </p>

The purpose is not to make any kind of statement or judgment about that historical context or the political, moral or ethical implications of what occurred: that is not the province of the Court.  The purpose is merely to try to provide some kind of canvas upon which the more detailed picture is to be painted. </p>

The Ministry of Defence says that the purpose of Operation MOSAIC was to obtain information for the first thermonuclear test by the UK (“Operation GRAPPLE”) proposed for the Christmas Island area in 1957 and 1958.  More particularly, the tests were an experiment to measure whether conditions in which thermonuclear reactions occur could be generated.  Both tests were nuclear and were not thermonuclear or “hydrogen” tests.  However, they did contain some quantities of thermonuclear material, sometimes referred to as “light elements.”   </p>

Air sampling was carried out by Varsity aircraft and Whirlwind helicopters. On 4 October 1956 Operation BUFFALO 2 took place at Marcoo on the Maralinga Range. This tested the ‘Blue Danube’ 4 kiloton warhead with a low yield (1.5 kilotons) Mark 1 enriched Uranium core. The device was placed in a shallow pit and exploded. The Indoctrinee Force was present at this detonation.  Operation BUFFALO 3 took place on 11 October and was an airburst bomb dropped by the RAF over the Kite range at Maralinga. It exploded at about 500 feet above ground. The yield was approximately 3 kilotons. Operation BUFFALO 4 was a tower burst detonated at the Breakaway site on the Maralinga Range. The yield was approximately 10 kilotons.  The Ministry of Defence says that Operation BUFFALO was designed primarily to advance research and development and to carry out “proof tests” of atomic weapons. The first two tests were required to test prototype service warheads. The third test was fired partly to obtain scientific data and partly to obtain data on weapon effects.  It also provided the RAF with the opportunity to drop a nuclear bomb. The fourth test was the test of a service weapon.    </p>

That statistic of itself will give some appreciation of the scale of the undertakings involved.  However, the following paragraph in Mr Crossley’s Generic Witness Statement is agreed as conveying fairly the scale of the operations involved: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0.00in">“The scale of the tests was huge. There were 21 detonations over 6 years or so. Well over 20,000 individuals attended the tests overall. The tests were planned as military operations and they represented the largest military undertaking since the Second World War and the entire venture was unprecedented. The development of nuclear weapons was in its infancy, and this meant that those who planned and implemented the tests were working in a wholly new area of operations, setting their own rules and standards and not simply following custom and practice or regulatory guidelines as would normally be the case.  This was as true for the earlier tests as it was for the later ones, when thermonuclear devices were tested for the first time.  It would not be an overstatement to say that a “Task Force” was necessary to carry out this undertaking; at GRAPPLE for example, a fleet of Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships, a fleet of many different types of aircraft, (bombers, reconnaissance, rescue, transport), hundreds of thousands of tons of supplies and equipment, and of course, thousands of military and civilian personnel from several nations. Much had to be transported 7,500 miles to Christmas Island, although some supplies were sourced from Australia, (Perth in Northern Australia was about 1,500 miles away). The engineering undertaking at each of the test sites was enormous too: the preparation work alone took more than 2 years. A wharf and port had to be built together with roads, two 6,000 foot runways, recording stations, a water processing plant and accommodation, sanitation and recreational facilities for four thousand men (at the peak); and all had to be built from nothing.” </p>

It is said by the Defendant, without challenge on behalf of the Claimants, that the overwhelming majority of the Claimants (something like 70% of attendances) were at the GRAPPLE series of tests.  However, it should be noted that the word “attendances” does not necessarily reflect accurately the number of men involved: one man may have attended several tests, thus contributing to several “attendances” and there is indeed evidence that this occurred. </p>

This was “considered to be of the greatest importance in view of the fact that there are at present practically no British Army officers who have any conception of what an atomic explosion is like, whereas the Americans have already made use of atomic tests to indoctrinate whole formations of troops. We must at least make a start in battle indoctrination with some of our future regimental and formation commanders”: see ‘The Outline Army Requirements for Operation BUFFALO, 1955’. </p>

This is a contentious issue and, as will be anticipated, a contrary position is taken by the Ministry of Defence.  It is not a relevant issue for the purposes of the present stage of these proceedings and it is not part of my task to resolve it.

He submits that the case on causation, both general and in relation to each individual, is not pleaded with appropriate particularity and says that in none of the cases has there been served the substantiating medical reports that are required in any normal personal injury action.  Mr Crossley asserts in his Generic Witness Statement that “the Claimants in the group currently have no medical evidence in support of their claims and it follows that in no single case can it be said that the Claimant has reasonable prospects of success.” It is also suggested that there has been a relatively recent fundamental change to the pleaded case, namely, from what is characterised as “a high dose conventional causation case” to what is characterised as “a low dose material increase in risk case.”  </p>

Whilst it might have been appropriate to apply to the court for formal dispensation from this requirement, I should be surprised if such an application would not have been granted.  At all events, it is clear from the pleading as it stands that the mechanics by which at least some of the injuries were alleged to have been caused by ionising radiation was “the destruction or derangement of the molecular integrity of human chromosomes”.  In one sense, that averment goes further than a traditional pleading and spells out a mechanism of injury that ordinarily would simply be left to expert evidence.

The report sets out in relatively non-scientific language the broad mechanism by virtue of which ionising radiation can cause damage to the “genetic material at a cell’s nucleus” (i.e. DNA), the amount of “DNA disruption” being directly related “to the dose and type of radiation received.”  Included amongst the effects that this can have is the “serial accumulation of mutations that can disrupt the intricate growth control processes within the cell.”  One consequences is the “ability to grow out of control” leading to malignant lumps or tumours within an organ.   </p>

I think Mr Browne is entitled to say that about the way the case is pleaded.  Plainly, something above ordinary background level (see paragraphs 148-149) is relied upon and, equally plainly, a level at which the various illnesses or conditions may be caused or contributed to by ionising radiation is relied upon.  But no “safe level” is pleaded above which it is said that it was unsafe for there to be exposure and no precise levels of exposure are pleaded.   </p>

At all events, whether that is a valid conclusion or not, I do not think that the Defendant is or has been exposed to any prejudice as a result of the way the cases have been advanced.  That conclusion does not preclude the argument that the claims are doomed to failure on the issue of causation (see paragraphs 188-241) nor does it, in my judgment, impede the proper analysis of what constitutes a “significant injury” for the purposes of the limitation arguments (see paragraphs 485-512) which is the primary focus of the current proceedings. </p>

The details of the illnesses relied upon were taken largely from people of advanced years who did not have available their medical records at the time (and neither did the solicitors’ representatives) and who were, therefore, trying to recall a medical history stretching over many years. To that extent, it is suggested on behalf of the Claimants that it was not surprising that errors were made. The Part 18 Schedule did not incorporate a Statement of Truth and was updated every 3 months as further information (in the form of information over the telephone and/or, in some cases, the medical records) became available. </p>

Equally, as I shall indicate later (paragraph 246), I think it was sensible of Mr Gibson effectively to abandon certain contentions as to what constituted a “significant injury” in relation to certain individual Claimants and, so far as “constructive knowledge” is concerned, to focus on matters occurring in the early 1980s onwards rather than, as foreshadowed in Mr Crossley’s principal Generic Witness Statement, much earlier periods.  All this seems to me to be nothing more than a legitimate refinement of the issues as a large group action (not without its complexities) progresses.  So far as individual Claimants are concerned, that certain injuries may have been put forward at various times is, as Mr Browne accepted, there on the record and might go to the credibility of what is maintained in evidence.  However, given the uncertainties in the picture that each Claimant will have had concerning exposure or non-exposure to radiation and whether certain injuries, conditions or disabilities could theoretically be caused by any such exposure, it is not surprising that their individual subjective views as to what was “significant” in that context was uncertain and probably still remains uncertain in some cases. </p>

I will deal with the relevance of this case later (paragraph 498), but the reality in this case (certainly once Dr Regan and Dr Lilley reached the same conclusion: see paragraph 129) is that there is no basis for any claim based upon exposure to “prompt radiation” whatever those individuals who were present at the time may have thought and have continued to believe subsequently.  I do not see this as a tactical decision – it is one rooted in the evidence now available to the Claimants.

I would enumerate them as follows: (a) a general statement of those aspects of the law on breach of duty and causation that may be relevant; (b) the approach to be adopted to the individual Lead Cases; (c) the general scientific considerations that need to be understood in order to understand the issues that arise; (d) the effect that ionising radiation may have upon health. </p>

It is worth recording, if only in passing, that the nature and extent of that duty of care and the question of how it should have been discharged is to be judged by reference to the standards applicable at the time.  The issue of whether, if established, a breach of duty caused or contributed to any injury or disability proved to have occurred in respect of someone who could claim to have been the victim of such a breach of duty is to be assessed by reference to up-to-date and contemporary scientific knowledge.  The fact that scientific knowledge about causation of damage may have moved on since the time of the “damaging incident” may, of course, itself have a bearing on the duty and standard of care to be expected at that earlier time. </p>

When a court is satisfied on an issue of fact to that standard the relevant fact is taken as established, including the “fact” that something such as an illness or disease has been caused by something else.  It is well understood that proof of factual causation (see <span style="font-style:italic">Clerk &amp; Lindsell</span>, 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> edn., Chapter 2) to the level of scientific certainty (although there is no “generally accepted standard of scientific proof”: <span style="font-style:italic">per</span> Stuart-Smith LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Loveday v Renton &amp; another</span> [1990] 1 Med LR 117,124) is not required by a court (see, eg, <span style="font-style:italic">Temple v South Manchester HA </span>[2002] EWCA Civ 1406; <span style="font-style:italic">Shortell v Bical Construction Ltd</span>, 16 May 2008, Mackay J) even when, as part of its fact-finding responsibility, the court has to evaluate scientific and medical research material that does address issues on that basis.  Such material often refers to the “95% confidence level” which is the level of statistical significance often used in the scientific world to exclude the possibility that when something occurs in a cohort of cases studied it does so by chance rather than by reference to the issue under investigation within that cohort.  (See also <span style="font-style:italic">Reay v British Nuclear Fuels </span>[1994] 5 Med LR 1.)

This is not something that ordinarily takes place spontaneously.  What is usually required is the bombardment of the nuclei of the fissile material by free neutrons.  The nucleus of the fissile material “captures” a neutron which renders the nucleus unstable causing it to split.  The best known example is the bombardment of Uranium-235 (i.e. Uranium with an atomic mass of 235) with neutrons with the result that it is converted (by neutron capture) into Uranium-236 which then splits spontaneously into two smaller nuclei and the emission of free neutrons.  Those free neutrons then go on to cause further fissions by the same process thus generating the well-known nuclear “chain reaction”.  The whole process is associated with the release of significant energy.  <span style="font-style:italic">Nuclear fusion</span>, as its name suggests, involves the process whereby two or more light nuclei combine together to form a heavier nucleus with associated energy release.  Fusion is the process that occurs naturally in stars.  Light nuclei will fuse only when exposed to significant temperatures (in excess of 10 million degrees centigrade).  Temperatures of this level can be generated during a nuclear fission explosion.   </p>

Dr Lilley’s estimate is that only about 10% of the fissile material fissions before the amount of energy released is sufficient to reduce the density of the fissile material to a sub-critical state and the nuclear reaction stops.  The logic of this, according to Dr Regan, is that 90% of the initial Uranium and Plutonium would make up a significant proportion of the ensuing fall-out.

If that is what is being spoken of, there does not appear to be any direct connection made between the process of translocation and the development of any known illness or injury.  Indeed it is said that “major structural changes of the chromosomes do not as a rule bring about other kinds of abnormality [i.e. other than partial sterility or abortion in their carriers] in individuals bearing them.”  There was, of course, by this time evidence of the effects of exposure to ionising radiation upon those who had survived the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs (suggesting an increase in a number of conditions, including leukaemia and cataract), but any precise mechanism relating to chromosome aberrations does not seem to have been postulated.   </p>

This was the first consistent chromosomal change seen in a human cancer, and provided strong evidence that chromosome abnormalities have an important causative role in the initiation of carcinogenesis.  With the introduction of improved chromosome imaging techniques, such as FISH, specific chromosome aberrations have been detected in very many tumour types, as tabulated in the now gigantic Mitelman database of all published cancer-associated chromosome aberrations.  The database now contains more than 55,000 cases.  These findings, together with the elucidation of many of the molecular-genetic consequences of the chromosome aberrations, have resulted in [the] original concept [put forward in 1914] now being very widely accepted. </p>

Cancer stem cells are considered to be the initiators of many or most tumours, through the stem cell processes of self renewal and differentiation into multiple cell types.  The widespread acceptance that mutated stem cells represent an initial event in carcinogenesis in general, and radiation carcinogenesis in particular, parallel the growing acceptance of the relevance of cancer stem cells.  An influential experiment, for example, was the demonstration in 2001 that normal human adult breast stem cells could be blocked from differentiation, and then could be oncogenically transformed by a combination of ionising radiation and an oncogene.” </p>

A great deal is known about this issue, largely from the detailed follow-up studies of the Japanese atomic bomb survivors, whose cancer risk have been carefully monitored for more than half a century (Preston <span style="font-style:italic">et al.</span> 2003, 2007).  What is well established from these studies is that, for solid tumours (as opposed to haematological cancers), the latency period is long, ranging from about 10 to at least 50 years.  More precisely, the increased relative risk of cancer produced by radiation exposure is generally maintained throughout the lifetime of the exposed individual.  Whilst a complete mechanistic understanding of radiation-induced cancer is not yet established, the reasons for this prolonged period of increased radiation-associated risk are qualitatively understood: radiation-induced cancers originate with radiation-induced damage to stem cells, which can be passed on to progeny stem cells when they divide.  Thus the radiation-induced damage can remain latent in stem cells for many years until the damaged stem cell or one of its progeny starts to divide inappropriately as a result of the damage.” </p>

Cancer can also occur by activation of smaller numbers of specific oncogenes. In both the cases of tumour suppressor genes and oncogenes, the critical alteration is malfunction in the cellular signal transduction processes that results in uncontrolled cellular proliferation. Single site mutations with alteration of a single residue is one cause of a specific rare transformation of a normal cell to a malignant cell. Alternatively, this can occur by chain breaks in DNA with perturbations or rearrangements locally of the DNA sequence. This is triggered by chain breaks in DNA….  Because ionising radiation can generate a track of reactive hydroxyl radicals, such radiation can damage DNA locally at multiple sites, including damage to both strands of DNA with a short region, and this may well result in a double strand break.” </p>

Genomic instability is turned on by extremely low doses of radiation and can be triggered in bystander cells as well.  Bystander cells received signals from irradiated cells but do not experience the ionising tract.  A further important fact is that genomic instability is a delayed effect of radiation which may not be immediately apparent.  The LNT [Linear Non Threshold] model which is used by all radiation protection authorities predicts that any dose no matter how small has a finite probability of causing a cancer due to the ability of radiation to cause DNA damage.  The finding of excess chromosome translocation frequencies in the veterans is consistent with this and also with the presence of genomic instability in these individuals.  What genomic instability theory does is that it widens the spectrum of diseases inducible by radiation and the time over which these might appear.” </p>

On this particular feature of the causation issue, I would merely hold that the lack <span style="text-decoration:underline">at this</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">stage</span> of individual medical reports in each individual case supporting a causation approach is not fatal to success on the limitation issue.  There is, in my view, sufficient material available at this stage to support the (adequately) pleaded case.  I need go no further than that for present purposes.  Again, this does not answer the more fundamental point made about the test to be applied for causation purposes, to which I will turn in section 14 of the judgment where I deal with the whole question of whether the claims should be struck out now because they are “doomed to fail” on the issue of causation. </p>

It was suggested to me that the case management powers under CPR 3.4(2) are those that I am being invited to exercise although there is a well-recognised overlap between those powers and the jurisdiction under CPR 24.2 (see paragraph 3.4.6, Civil Procedure – The White Book 2009, Vol. 1).

However, the question of whether some (or all or any) of the Lead Cases should be assessed as “bound to fail” on the issue of causation if otherwise surviving the limitation arguments is, in my judgment, very much less straightforward in this case than is suggested in those submissions.   In one sense, a limitation issue can be said to arise even before a true interlocutory stage has been reached within proceedings seeking damages for personal injuries.  However, irrespective of that, it must be borne in mind that any finding of fact that I may make at this stage of these proceedings is simply whether “the injury in question” in a particular case was “significant” and “attributable in whole or in part” to the Defendant’s acts or omissions in the sense that those expressions require (see section 16 of the judgment) at a time relevant to the institution of the present proceedings.  Any such finding is relevant solely to the limitation argument.  It would not in the event of a trial bind the trial judge on any material issue since the responsibility at that stage would be to consider, on the basis of all the evidence deployed, whether any breach of duty found to exist caused (by whatever legal test is appropriate) the injury, illness or condition in question. The process at this stage does not involve deciding whether, as a matter of law or fact, causation is or will be established (cf. the observations of Lord Hoffmann in <span style="font-style:italic">Adams v Bracknell Forest BC</span> [2005] 1 AC 76, at para. 24). If, of course, it is plain beyond any doubt that, whatever legal test is applied, the necessary causal link could never be established on the facts, it may be appropriate to exercise the jurisdiction to strike out.  But if it is arguable, on the law as it stands, that causation can be established in any particular Lead case then there would be no basis for invoking that jurisdiction. </p>

The consistent approach of the House of Lords would appear to be that so far as the latter is concerned, the preference is to consider real issues based upon established facts rather than upon the assumed basis necessary for the purposes of a strike out application.  As will appear below, authoritative statements of this general proposition appear in <span style="font-style:italic">Barrett v Enfield London Borough Council</span> [2001] 2 AC 550.   That case involved a claim for damages for personal injury arising out of the alleged negligence of the defendant local authority brought by a claimant who had been placed in care pursuant to a care order when he was 10 months old and remained there until the age of 17.  The alleged breaches of duty included a failure to arrange for his adoption or provide him with appropriate and properly monitored placements, a failure to obtain appropriate psychiatric treatment for him and mismanagement of the reintroduction to his mother, as a result of which he claimed he suffered from deep-seated psychological and psychiatric problems.    The Court of Appeal (Lord Woolf MR, Evans and Schiemann LJJ) had upheld a decision to strike out the claim.  In broad terms, Lord Woolf MR considered that there was no reasonable prospect of the claimant establishing the existence of a duty of care, the breach of such a duty if it existed and any causal connection between any breach established (“operational acts done carelessly”) and the kind of injury alleged.

It is a group action in which the claimants allege that their mothers, who lived close to land acquired by the Council from the British Steel Corporation, were exposed during the embryonic stage of their pregnancies to toxic materials in the course of the Council’s reclamation and decontamination programme in respect of the land and that this exposure caused the deformities seen in the claimants.   In response to an order to serve additional points of claim setting out their allegations of breach of duty and how the breaches were alleged to have caused the injuries the claimants, inter alia, sought to add a claim based on public nuisance.    The Council applied to strike out that claim on the basis that, as a matter of law, damages for personal injury cannot be recovered for public nuisance.  The argument shortly was that the longstanding assumption in previous cases that damages for personal injury are recoverable in public nuisance was wrong and inconsistent with the decisions of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Hunter v Canary Wharf Limited</span> [1997] AC 655 and <span style="font-style:italic">Transco plc v Stockport MBC</span> [2003] UKHL 61, [2004] 2 AC 1. </p>

Dyson LJ (with whom Ward and Smith LJJ agreed) said that “[the] fact that the law may be developed by the House of Lords … is not a reason for this court not to apply the law as it now stands.”  He also said that even if precedent had not prevented the court from deciding the question of whether damages for personal injuries can be recovered in public nuisance, he would not have refused the application for permission to amend the particulars of claim to add a claim in public nuisance.

Unless closely confined in its application this principle could become a source of injustice to defendants.  There must be good reason for departing from the normal threshold "but for" test.  The reason must be sufficiently weighty to justify depriving the defendant of the protection this test normally and rightly affords him, and it must be plain and obvious that this is so.

That is precisely the rule your Lordships are being invited to apply in this case.  The Californian Supreme Court stated the principle specifically in relation to asbestos-related cancer cases.

Whether for forensic reasons or based upon a true conviction that it is a case that assists him is not for me to determine, but Mr Browne placed <span style="font-style:italic">Bailey</span> somewhat near the top of the list of cases upon which he seeks to place reliance.  Equally flatteringly, Mr Gibson submitted that it assisted his argument.  It is a case that has occasioned academic comment.  Mr Gibson drew my attention to an article by Sarah Green in (2009) 125 LQR 44 entitled “Contributing to the Risk of Confusion? Causation in the Court of Appeal.”  Whilst preparing this judgment I have noted and read with interest articles by Gemma Turton in ‘Medical Law Review’ 2009, 17(1), 140-147 and by James Lee in ‘Professional Negligence’ 2008, 24(3), 194-198.  It would, I think, be invidious of me to make any observations other than to say that plainly the decision of the Court of Appeal (Waller, Sedley and Smith LJJ) must represent the authoritative enunciation of the legal principle to be derived from the case.  For my part, I would not have seen the case as involving an extension of the <span style="font-style:italic">Fairchild</span> exception and I am not convinced that, properly analysed, the decision of the Court of Appeal was intended to, or did, create any such extension.  As Mr Lee said in his article, it was a case where there was an indivisible injury (brain damage) arising from a general state of weakness caused by the material contribution of two separate cumulative causes, one of which was induced by negligence, the other of which was not.  If that is the correct analysis, then all that is to be deduced from the case for present purposes is that the dividing line between a divisible and indivisible injury cannot always be that easy to determine (as was said in <span style="font-style:italic">Barker v Corus</span>:  see paragraph 227 above) and, accordingly, that it is unwise to consider striking out a case raising these potentially difficult issues until the facts have been found.  At all events, if I am wrong about this and the decision should be seen as some widening of the causation boundaries, then it reinforces the perception to which I referred above.  (<span style="font-style:italic">Dickins v O2 Plc</span> was a case in which a different division of the Court of Appeal, albeit one of which Sedley and Smith LJJ were members, considered the consequences of <span style="font-style:italic">Bailey</span> in the particular context of that case.)</p>

Mr Gibson submits that this case has been chosen by the Claimants because it “appears to the Claimants to be strong on limitation”, but is, Mr Gibson contends, on the Claimants’ own evidence plainly “not provable” on causation.  He asserts that it is plain that non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma cannot be proved to have been caused by ionising radiation, either at a general or an individual level. </p>

It was reporting the result of an inquiry carried out by the Medical Research Council entitled “The hazards to man of nuclear and allied radiation” (Cmnd. 9780) said in the article to have been commissioned the previous year by Sir Winston Churchill because of “public unrest about the genetic effects of the nuclear explosions carried out by the Americans in the Pacific.”  This plainly referred to the Bikini Atoll test referred to in paragraphs 26 and 27 above.

In fact, as a report, it gives the appearance of being thorough and, so far as possible, well-informed.  It certainly gives some clues as to the effect upon health that exposure to ionising radiation may have.  I doubt, however, that it gained a wide circulation in its own right.  For those who read it, some of its conclusions were tentative.  I would merely highlight what was said in relation to fall-out from test explosions of nuclear weapons in paragraph 4 of the recommendations: </p>

Nevertheless, recognising all the inadequacy of our present knowledge, we cannot ignore the possibility that, if the rate of firing increases and particularly if greater numbers of thermonuclear weapons are used, we could within the lifetime of some now living, be approaching levels at which ill-effects might be produced in a small number of the population.” </p>

On its face the article would not necessarily take the knowledge of someone who was present at the British tests very much further.  It apparently dealt with concerns arising from fall-out from the American tests in the Pacific and, as the headline from <span style="font-style:italic">The Guardian</span> article indicated, referred specifically to the danger of Strontium-90.  There was no reference to Plutonium, Polonium or Uranium.  At all events, I do not think that one part of one paragraph in the middle of a fairly dense article can really be said to be evidence that demonstrates a general public awareness of the long-term effects of fall-out such that someone who was at or involved in the British tests should have attached significance to it.  Equally, though it does not, strictly speaking, arise as a consequence of the evidence concerning the article, as I have already indicated, I do not think that anyone who read the report itself would have been given a significantly greater appreciation.

This could hardly be said to have been the level of coverage of an issue that would have resonated with a reasonable person who had been present at the tests, particularly since most, if not all, of those present would reasonably have thought that the arrangements at the time of the tests protected them from exposure to radiation. </p>

He says that Mr McGinley was the moving force of the BNTVA for its first 17 years, was a tireless campaigner for the cause and has devoted much of his life to pursuing that cause.

To that extent it cannot be said (nor has it ever been claimed, so far as I understand it) that the BNTVA represents the interests of all 20,000 or so who attended, or had some dealings with the aftermath of, the tests.  Indeed there is evidence of two other organisations that were formed with similar objectives in mind, the BAVA (British Atomic Veterans’ Association) being one (see paragraph 305). </p>

The precise sequence of events is not wholly clear to me, but it appears that Mr McGinley became aware in the early 80s that others who lived in the area where he lived who had also been to Christmas Island had suffered a number of medical problems.  One problem suffered by some was, like Mr McGinley himself, infertility.  He had also learned of someone who then had moved to Canada, but who was present at the tests, who had suffered a similar series of problems to those suffered by him.  This led him to write a letter to <span style="font-style:italic">The</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Daily Record</span>, published in Glasgow, in which he asked the question whether “any readers had suffered medical problems after they had returned from Christmas Island.”  The newspaper ran an article about Mr McGinley on 24 November 1982 and he was also interviewed on BBC Radio Scotland.  </p>

Lord Jenkins of Putney asked the Government whether it was “aware that it is claimed that servicemen involved in British H-Bomb tests at Christmas Island in 1957 have suffered ill effects and whether [it] will investigate this.”  The Minister of State for Defence Procurement, Viscount Trenchard, said that whilst the Government was “aware of a few claims, the radiation records for personnel involved … indicate that none suffered exposure in excess of the internationally recognised limits at the time and none should therefore face significant health risks as a result of these tests".   That answer reflected the general position of various Governments over the years (see paragraphs 388-391). </p>

The Nationwide team had asked her to look at some of the cases that had come their way and in due course Mr McGinley and his colleagues were put in touch with Dr Stewart by those responsible for the Nationwide programme.  Mr McGinley, plus the Nationwide team and at least one other newspaper, supplied Dr Stewart with details of a number of servicemen who had been present at the tests.  Dr Stewart and two of her colleagues from Birmingham (Professor Knox and Dr Sorahan, later Professor Sorahan) wrote to <span style="font-style:italic">The Lancet</span> on 9 April 1983 indicating, on the information put to them which was “far from complete”,  that there was already “evidence of an abnormally high incidence of leukaemia and other reticuloendothelial system (RES) neoplasms.”   (Neoplasm is another word for tumour – which may, of course, be benign or malignant.) </p>

From then onwards, those who were members of the BNTVA would have received three or four newsletters a year keeping them abreast of developments.  It is, perhaps, to be borne in mind that the formation of the BNTVA was, of course, well before the Internet became a familiar part of everyone’s lives – indeed some years before even fax machines were first regularly part of a professional person’s life.  (I note from the Minutes of a meeting of the BNTVA on 27 April 1990 that it was felt that fax machines were too expensive to acquire at the time.)    It follows that there was no website to which access could be gained at this time and communications were generally in the sporadic form of contact largely by post - probably well into the 1990s and possibly a little beyond. </p>

It should be noted, and it may be of significance, that Mr Mildred had told the Committee of the Association at a meeting in November 1985 that unless the Association co-operated with the NRPB they did not “have much of a chance of getting anywhere.”  He said that “scientifically there wasn’t enough radiation to affect anyone” and that on the basis of the UK figures “the average dose was ⅓ of a rem so [that the] chances of cancer were so low they would be zero.”  (Since 1 rem is 10 mSv, ⅓ of a rem would be 3.33 mSv.)  Mr Mildred emphasised the need to “get over the hurdle of the NRPB first as he didn’t know how else to go about things.”  This advice was accepted.

He was recorded as having been very critical of the NRPB study published in the January of that year (which I deal with in paragraphs 352-354), but was also recorded as being of the view that there was a “good chance of a case of leukaemia or multiple myeloma winning in the courts” (a view which, incidentally, appears to be shared at the present time by Professor Kaldor <span style="text-decoration:underline">if the Claimant could be</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">shown to have been exposed to 200 mSv or more of ionising radiation</span>).

Mr McGinley received a letter from Mr Neil Kinnock MP, then leader of the Labour Party, dated 22 May 1986 in the following terms: “The next Labour Government, as a matter of urgency and priority, will set up a full judicial inquiry on the lines set out in your letter and we will also consult with your Association on the terms of reference of the inquiry.”   Mr David Steel MP gave the assurance he sought in a letter dated 1 May 1986.

Whilst I have not seen much of the early material that the Association sent out, there is no doubt that by no later than 1989 it was actively telling its members to apply for a pension in appropriate circumstances.  The advice about this probably came from Mr Mildred (who is recorded as giving advice about this at the meeting in May 1988 to which I referred above).  The first newsletter in 1989 (see paragraph 268 above) encouraged anyone who was, or believed they were, suffering from leukaemia or multiple myeloma to apply for a War Service pension because they were then “the only officially recognised radiation linked diseases”.  It was, however, suggested that in respect of anyone who believed they were suffering from “<span style="text-decoration:underline">some other disability you</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">or your GP believe may be linked to service during the tests</span> and especially if you are suffering from” diabetes, a heart complaint following an amputation or “eye trouble” it might be worth claiming a pension “even if you are turned down (which will probably happen) because if things change in the future … the pension will be backdated to the date of your first claim.”  (My emphasis.)

It is effectively a “no fault” scheme to provide a pension where a veteran with an illness can raise a “reasonable doubt” as to its attributability to his service. The veteran must show that he was present at a UK nuclear test and produce evidence that raises a “reasonable doubt” of<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>radiation exposure during his service and then demonstrate a “recognized causal link” between the illness and the exposure.  Very few applications were successful even given the apparently low threshold of proof, a typical rejection being exemplified by the rejection in the late Mr Clark’s case (see paragraph 733). </p>

Although earlier letters and questionnaires from the Association to potential members do not survive, an example of what was being sent out in 1991 does.  Mr McGinley accepted that the Association had been seeking details about people’s illnesses before that, but the information sought by now was probably more detailed than before.  The 1991 version (which is the version filled in by the late Mr Clark:  see paragraph 733 below) asked for details of the tests witnessed, how far the individual was from the blast(s), whether he was involved in any clean up operations and details of protective clothing and so on.  In relation to health issues each person was asked whether, when he returned from service, he developed “any illnesses which [he] had not suffered before” and if so identifying them.  The recipient of the questionnaire was asked to indicate with a tick against a list of conditions and illnesses whether they had been experienced since returning from the tests.  It was an extensive list detailing skin complaints, blood conditions (including leukaemia) and “effects on tissue” which included malignant tumours of bones, lungs or other tissues.  The list also included a series of other matters including sterility, deafness, cataracts and persistent diarrhoea.  The questionnaire at this stage also asked whether there had been any miscarriages or stillbirths experienced and also for details of any health issues with children and grandchildren.   </p>

He is reported as saying that this would be difficult because at the time of the tests, according to documents released to him, negligence did not occur.  He had, apparently, spoken with Professor Ted Radford, who was a retired US health physicist, who had stated that the tests met with the requirements of the day.  However, he was reported as saying that once the next NRPB report was released the following year, the Association would be in a better position to know how it stood.

PhelpsBrown, Consultant Opthalmologist, and Dr Darroudi were involved) looking at whether elevated levels of chromosome translocations could be responsible for cataracts in UK Veterans.  I deal with the study in paragraphs 304-305 and 371, but it is convenient to record here the exchange of correspondence between the NRPB and the BNTVA in late 1996 and early 1997 because the Defendant places some reliance upon it (see paragraph 306).  </p>

Whilst, as I say, the Defendant has drawn attention to this article (along with others), it would be difficult to see how, having read it, a veteran who knew little of what the European Court case was about would have been encouraged to pursue a case himself.  The article contained a paragraph saying that “around 3,000 veterans of British nuclear tests in the Pacific yesterday had their hopes of compensation dashed” and Mr Egan was quoted as saying that he was “bitterly disappointed” by the ruling and that it was “not only the end of the road for me, but for thousands of others who were hoping this would create a precedent.”  A Government minister was quoted as saying that the documents provided both before and during the proceedings demonstrated that “the great majority of servicemen present at the tests were in a safe position, too far from the nuclear detonations to receive any measurable radiation dose.”  He also referred to the NRPB studies that had found no proof that veterans “suffered worse health than the general population.”   This, of course, reflects the consistent position taken by successive Governments over the years: see paragraphs 388-390.</p>

Indeed she had apparently been dismissed from her role as Secretary of the BNTVA at some stage during 1999.  To the extent that it matters (which I do not think that it does), it appears from a letter written by Mr McGinley on 1 March 2000 that it was her involvement with Dundee University that had led to the differences.

He also said that he ate locally-grown fruit and produce and that he swam in the sea around Christmas Island. Later in life he developed lymphoma.  From the judgment of Ralph Gibson LJ in the Court of Appeal (at p. 771), the following is to be deduced concerning his health problems as they were alleged to have been: </p>

By 1978 the plaintiff was suffering from a soft tissue tumour and lymphoma. By 1981, as a result of treatment of the plaintiff's condition, his thyroid gland had been rendered inoperative.”  </p>

The lymphatic system is part of the body’s immune system and carries lymph (a fluid full of white blood cells known as lymphocytes which fight infection) around the body.  In lymphoma, lymphocytes begin reproducing in an abnormal manner and begin to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system such as the lymphatic nodes.  The affected lymphocytes begin to lose their infection-fighting properties making the body more vulnerable to infection.  Traditionally, two classifications of lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, are referred to although this has ceased to be a universally used distinction. </p>

This argument is addressed in the context of suggesting that any Claimant who had suffered a significant injury to his health by the mid-80s or early 90s should have had “constructive knowledge” of its attributability to ionising radiation to which he was exposed during the tests.  Although the word “fall-out” is not used in the allegations of negligence quoted, it is implicit that at least some of the “contamination” alleged must have been as a result of fall-out.  The Defendant submits that it is clear that the general case based on fall-out in the present proceedings is not new – and indeed was made many years ago - and reveals nothing new that might have been capable of justifying the delay in this case.

I am bound to say that I am not impressed by that argument.  The Ministry of Defence had long made it clear that it would take the (as it turned out, misconceived) section 10 point in any proceedings launched.  It seems to me perfectly reasonable, in the light of that, that any Claimant who was anxious about that issue should await a decision that resolved it.

Since the view of the Ministry of Defence at the time was that a fair trial of the issues would have been impossible, it is surprising that the point was not taken.  The Ministry’s position at the time was articulated by Mr Robin Auld QC in his closing submissions to the McClelland Commission (see paragraph 392) when he said this: </p>

This is what this Commission has attempted to do throughout most of its sittings in Australia. Many of those involved in the tests who could be found were now elderly or in late middle age. Some key witnesses could not be found at all or were too infirm or too far away from the proceedings to be able to give evidence. Without the assistance of records to refresh their memories, many could not remember the events of so long ago with accuracy or detail. There were those who did claim to remember matters of importance, sometimes at second or third hand and often well publicized in the newspaper, radio and television reports of the proceedings. Where the evidence of these witnesses could be checked they were often shown to be wrong in their recollection on later and less well-publicized days, when the relevant documents had been found.” </p>

As will appear, when it has been possible to check them against records of the time or through the evidence of others, these allegations have, in the main, been shown to be unfounded. But, in general, it is impossible to investigate and produce evidence so as to refute or confirm, as appropriate, each of these allegations.

However, the fact that no limitation point was taken in 1985 is, it may be thought, some support for Mr Browne’s comment that until these proceedings had been brought it had never been said before on behalf of the Government that any claim, if launched, was too late.  Mr McGinley, who has been directly interested in all these matters at least since 1982, said in his supplementary witness statement that “[we] were never told that our claims would fail because they were too late. The reason we were given was that the evidence did not show any connection between our exposures to radiation and our illnesses.”  He suggests the Government is “relying on a new tactic.” </p>

There was then a hiatus in the proceedings until Messrs Rosenblatt, the solicitors who now conduct this litigation, assumed conduct of the case.  That hiatus was at least in some part as a result of agreement between Mr Harris and the Treasury Solicitor and based upon the need to put in place alternative funding and to await “scientific literature” which could only mean at that time the Rowland Report.  The essential findings of the Rowland Report emerged by no later than early May 2006 (see paragraph 401) and I assume that that may well have had a considerable influence on the funding issue.

However, I should say now that generally I do not find this submission persuasive.  Restricting myself for the moment purely to the funding issue, it is obvious to anyone who has had dealings with personal injury litigation over the last 10 years or so that public funding for personal injury litigation has become more and more restricted and that CFAs have effectively taken over in this branch of litigation save in very limited areas.  If there is anything pejorative intended in the Defendant’s submission, then I reject it:  as indicated below, the chances are that the only way that claimants such as the Claimants in this litigation could pursue a case would be on the basis of a CFA.</p>

He says that from 1994 to mid-1997 alone, the Legal Aid Board entered into thirteen group action contracts for litigation relating to Gulf War syndrome, the MMR vaccine, Radiotherapy breast cancer treatment, Vibration White Finger and others.  He included in that list the smoking litigation, but noted that Legal Aid was withdrawn in 1996.  It is said on behalf of the Defendant that the position with regard to the availability of funding was more generous to claimants in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s when Legal Aid was in principle available both for unitary and group personal injury actions.   </p>

Wright J, who was nominated to be the trial judge if the limitation issues were overcome by the claimants, was obliged to consider (as I will be in this case if section 33 becomes engaged) the “broad merits” of the claims.  All of the claimants in that litigation chose to smoke and did so against the background of knowledge of the potential damage to their health of doing so.  As Wright J observed, even if primary liability could be established against the tobacco companies on the basis alleged (namely, of not reducing the tar levels in cigarettes and/or warning about the dangers of certain tar levels), there would be major issues of causation, <span style="font-style:italic">volenti non fit injuria</span> and/or contributory negligence.  In the present case, the majority of the claims are made by or on behalf of men who at the time of the material events were largely young conscripts who had no choice about attending the tests and who, to the extent that they gave any consideration to the matter, were reassured that they would not be exposed to any danger.  Further, as Mr Browne has observed, in this case all Governments have consistently denied material exposure to ionising radiation and any provable link between any exposure, if it occurred, and most, if not all, of the illnesses or conditions of which the veterans complain.</p>

The third was conducted by some members of the original teams plus others.  The studies are said by the Defendant to have been independent large scale epidemiological studies of 85% of UK test participants, the conclusions from which are consistent with other studies carried out in New Zealand, Australia and the USA.  The effect, it is said, on the basis of Professor Kaldor’s analysis, is to demonstrate that the vast majority of participants were exposed to very low levels of<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>radiation based on the available means of determining exposure (see further at paragraphs 376-387 below) and that there is no substantial difference between the incidence of the diseases complained of by the veterans (and alleged to be due to<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>radiation) and that of those in the control group save possibly for a small increase in the incidence of leukaemia.

The authors of the report, who acknowledged the difficulties of identifying all the participants because no “comprehensive list of participants had been compiled at the time”, estimated that 83% of all participants were included.  The study was “a study of the health of the participants, investigating whether it showed any correlation with radiation exposure.”  The information in relation to the health of the participants was determined by reference to the death registration documents where they existed and the incidence of cancer through the NHS Central Register.

There was a significantly higher level of deaths from leukaemia and multiple myeloma (22 and 6 respectively, compared with 6 and 0).  In the Abstract at the beginning of the study it was said that this difference was “largely due to the extraordinarily low rates [of death from these diseases] in the controls … while the mortality in the participants was only slightly greater than expected from the national rates … and much of these differences seems likely to have been due to chance.”  This led to the conclusion that “small hazards of multiple myeloma and leukaemia may well have been associated with participation in the nuclear weapons programme”.

In my review of the history of the BNTVA I mentioned the involvement of Dr Sue Rabbitt Roff from about 1995 onwards (see paragraph 300 <span style="font-style:italic">et seq</span>).  I deal with the general effect of her studies in that part of the judgment.  She considered the death notifications received by the BNTVA over a 14-year period from 1983 to 1997.  The Report became available during 1999.  It is difficult to do justice to it in a sentence, but her conclusion following this study can be deduced from the following extract of the Abstract: </p>

There was no evidence of an increased risk of multiple myeloma among test participants in recent years.  The suggestion in the first analysis of this study of a raised risk of myeloma has not been confirmed in longer periods of followup and is likely to have been a chance finding.  Analysis of sub- groups with greater potential for exposure provided little evidence of increased risks, although the numbers of men involved were smaller and the statistical power was therefore less.  In common with earlier analysis, there is some evidence of a raised risk of leukaemia among test participants relative to controls, particularly when focusing on leukaemia other than [chronic lymphatic leukaemia].  This could be a chance finding, in view of low leukaemia rates among the controls and the generally small radiation doses recorded for test participants.  However, the possibility that test participation caused a small absolute risk of leukaemia other than [chronic lymphatic leukaemia] among men cannot be ruled out; the evidence for any increase risk appears to have been greatest in the early years after the tests, but a small risk may have persisted in more recent years.” </p>

Thus, as a general rule, monitoring for external radiation would indicate whether an internal hazard existed. Based, it is said, upon the expert evidence of Dr Lilley, the assertion is made that in order to receive a significant internal dose an individual would have to enter an area with high levels of re-suspendable fall-out which would also have been a source of (external) photon (which I understand to be another expression for gamma) and beta radiation.  (I understand re-suspendable fall-out to be fall-out that becomes suspended in the air again by the action of the wind or other disturbance such as the action of vehicles.)  In fact it is not clear to me that Dr Lilley has actually said this in the reports I have seen, although I imagine he must be the source of the proposition.  It is said, therefore, to have been most unlikely that an individual could have received a significant <span style="text-decoration:underline">internal</span> dose of radiation without at the same time receiving a significant <span style="text-decoration:underline">external</span> dose, something which would have been indicated on the film badge or detected by the use of hand-held monitoring equipment. </p>

The extent of the beta contribution to the film badge could, however, be assessed by the difference between the film densities under the shielded and unshielded areas of the film-badges.

Second, I note that Dr Regan challenges Dr Lilley’s view that an internal dose would not be expected in the absence of a detectable external dose, citing the inhalation of Plutonium-239 (described as an alpha-emitter) as an example of an event that would not be reflected in an external dose measurement.  Indeed I do not, as presently advised, see how wearing an <span style="text-decoration:underline">external</span> badge for a limited period would necessarily monitor <span style="text-decoration:underline">internal</span> radiation exposure from ingested or inhaled radioactive material affected by elements with long half-lives.

Fourth, it appears at first sight to conflict with some internal documentation disclosed emanating from the Health Physics Group at Aldermaston in early 1953 dealing with “the relative importance of doses from beta particles and gamma rays from ground contaminated with fission products.”  (The paper does not appear to deal with alpha particles, but one of the fission products considered is Plutonium-239.)

Professor Rowland, whose field was genetics, had met a group of veterans in 2000 who apparently raised with him the question of whether they had sustained any chromosomal damage as a result of their involvement in the tests in the 1950s.  According to his (unsigned) witness statement, Professor Rowland had experience of what is said in the statement to be “a technique known as FCE”.  I am inclined to think that this is a misprint for SCE – or certainly the expression is intended to relate to SCE.  SCE stands for “sister chromatid exchange”.  As its name suggests, this process includes the exchange of genetic material between chromatids (a chromatid being one half of a normal chromosome: see paragraph 154) and is, as Dr Firouz Darroudi says in his main report, “a form of chromosome aberration”.  At all events, it was Professor Rowland’s interest and experience in this area that led to the putting together of the research project that, in due course, yielded what, in this case, has been called “The Rowland Report”. </p>

Professor Rowland says that a crucial part of the project was the selection of the members of the control group and that it proved to be an expensive part of the exercise.  In the peer-reviewed article the authors gave a detailed account of the reasons for excluding certain potential members of the control group.  Professor Rowland also says that the choice of the veterans proved difficult so as to ensure that those with what are known as “confounding factors” (e.g. exposure to X-rays) were excluded.  He says that, even had additional funds been available, it would not have been possible to find more than 50 veterans who met the necessary criteria.

He emphasises that the type of study undertaken by his team “would simply not have been feasible at an earlier stage in the absence of the more sophisticated tools at our disposal for the purpose of testing and in light of our developing knowledge in this area of science.”  He said that once the M-FISH technique became available “any organisation wanting to carry out a similar survey would have needed access to a considerable amount of funding and the expertise of a University research department.”  There does not appear to be any realistic basis for contesting that assessment. However, in his Generic Witness Statement, Mr Crossley suggested that “[with] proper diligence … cytogenetic testing results could have been obtained by the Claimants much earlier” than the Rowland study.   Mr Crossley notes “that the Rowland<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>study was funded by the New Zealand Nuclear Test Veterans Association (NZNTVA).”<span style="font-family:'Century Gothic'">  </span>This theme was repeated in the Defendant’s Opening Submissions where it was suggested that “the essential science underlying the study was approximately 20 years old and could have been implemented earlier with proper diligence”, the further suggestion being made that “the BNTVA knew of this </p>

Indeed this seems to be confirmed by an article in the ‘European Journal of Human Genetics’ (1999) by Tanke and others which begins its concluding discussion with this sentence: “Despite its only recent introduction, multicolour FISH karyotyping has changed cytogenetics significantly.”  However, whatever the precise time-scale, I am quite unable to accept that any test results carrying any weight could reasonably have been obtained by the Claimants “much earlier”, if ever.  “Proper diligence” for this purpose would have involved access to significant funds, the right academic and research personnel and facilities and ready access to an appropriate cohort of veterans and an appropriate cohort of controls.

The BNTVA came close to securing the kind of assistance needed when the late Dame Catherine Cookson (see paragraph 300) provided the means for Dr Rabbitt Roff’s research, but the M-FISH technique was not available then and, judged by reference to the money needed some years later for the New Zealand research, would probably not have been sufficient to support the more extended research required.  Indeed in 1999 Dr Rabbitt Roff said that £250,000 was needed to fund a programme of more sophisticated research (see paragraph 311).  Her original research was, of course, of a statistical nature rather than involving any scientific analysis as such.

The following is a quotation from a letter from him to Dr David James at the Medical Research Council in London dated 24 January 1984, the first paragraph in that letter referring to a telephone conversation he (Professor Evans) had had with a colleague in the MRC (Diana Dunstan) “just about a year ago” about “some blood samples that we have received … that had come from individuals who believe they had been exposed to radiation during the atom bomb tests on Christmas Island and were concerned over their health”: </p>

However, it is at least conceivable, given the one specific result to which Professor Evans referred to in the final paragraph of his letter (see paragraph 411), that it might have opened up other lines of inquiry in relation to those who had been present at the tests.  However, to put Professor Evans’ views into perspective I should refer to a letter he wrote just over 5 years later (on 19 May 1989) to Mr Jack Ashley MP, as he then was, who had raised the question of a particular technique designed to detect mutations in red blood cells, which contained the following passage: </p>

As it stands, therefore, the red cell mutation assay can detect increased mutation frequencies in people exposed to very high doses of radiation up to many years after their exposure, but I am afraid is not sensitive enough to pick up mutations in people exposed at much lower dose levels.  The most sensitive assay that we have at the moment is the chromosome aberration assay in human white cells and this can only detect levels of exposure of 10-20 rads if blood samples are taken shortly after exposure.  In the case of nuclear test veterans, since exposures were usually well below the level of 10 rads, and samples can only be taken many years after exposure, there is no chance that one can detect any increased aberration frequencies in these individuals which could be directly related to any previous radiation exposure of that sort.” </p>

However, what can be said for present purposes is simply that (a) it is not really appropriate for the veterans to be criticised for not pursuing chromosome analyses at an earlier stage when it would apparently have been feasible for the Defendant, through the wider Government machinery, to have done so itself rather than relying solely upon the epidemiological studies carried out by the NRPB or, on the other hand, (b) if the second letter from Professor Evans is an indication that he did not then think that “the chromosome aberration assay in human white cells” was worth pursuing for the reasons he gave, it would equally be difficult to understand why the veterans should themselves have been expected to embark on such a process at that stage.   </p>

Dr Lindahl (who Professor Brenner describes as “a highly respected expert in DNA repair”) has raised issues in relation to the M-FISH technique and has concluded “[on] balance … that most of the increased … translocation frequency … in many of the … veterans might have been caused by the exposure to some form of ionising radiation, or alternatively by exposure on ships to organic solvents or related chemicals that are able to cause chromosome damage”, but that it “is not possible to conclude on the balance of probabilities that a 51% or higher chance of increases in translocations were due to direct exposure to ionising radiation rather than something else, although [it] remains a possibility.”  </p>

However, it is to be noted that HMNZS Pukaki, which participated on each occasion, was never closer to the point of detonation than 20 nautical miles and in most cases considerably further away.  HMNZS Rotoiti was never closer than 50 nautical miles on the four occasions it participated.  Whilst the distances assumed by Dr Lilley in his report of 12 November 2008 do not appear to be exactly as indicated in the table (although broadly in the same region), he is certainly of the view that no-one on either ship would have received any dose from prompt radiation, a conclusion with which, had he addressed it, I am sure Dr Regan would have agreed.  The suggestion must be, therefore, that if the translocations were caused by exposure to ionising radiation at or about the time of the tests, it must have been as a result of exposure to fall-out or its longer-term consequences. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Many of the veterans present at the GRAPPLE tests whose cases arise for consideration in this group action were closer to ground zero than the New Zealand veterans were and, it will be argued, were more susceptible as a result to the effects of early fall-out – certainly no less susceptible.  (Dr Regan says that the radiation dose rate from fall-out “depends crucially on how close the individual is to the detonation.”)  Equally, it may be that a good number of the British (and maybe Fijian) veterans remained in the general area for considerably longer than their New Zealand colleagues and played a more direct role in operations (including clean-up operations) that may have exposed them to the effects of fall-out, not merely to the relatively immediate effects, but also those associated with the inhalation and ingestion of radioactive materials on a longer term basis.  Whilst Mr Gibson’s written Opening Submissions contained the proposition that “[it] has not been alleged that similar levels of translocations to those seen in the New Zealand group are present in the Claimant group”, it is difficult to see (a) how that allegation of itself could be made <span style="text-decoration:underline">on scientific grounds</span> without some kind of comparable survey of “the Claimant group” (which, of course, has not been undertaken), but (b) it is equally difficult to see what other inference is to be invited <span style="text-decoration:underline">on the balance of probabilities</span> on the basis of the matters set out above.  Indeed in Response 20(a) to the Request for Further Information about the Rowland Report it is asserted on behalf of the Claimants that “it shows (on the balance of probabilities) that, despite the frequent and repeated denials of the Defendant, the New Zealand veterans (and, by extension the British, Australian and Fijian veterans) were exposed to significant ionising radiation during the tests because of the higher frequencies of chromosomal translocations compared with a non-exposed but otherwise matched group.”   Whether that conclusion is drawn if any of these cases proceed to trial will be a matter for the trial judge on the basis of the evidence and argument received, but the general nature of the case that will be advanced is not that difficult to identify.  </p>

Whilst as a matter of fact that must be so, I am not persuaded that a comment such as this really takes matters any further.  In the first place, if it be the case (considered in paragraphs 514-521) that <span style="text-decoration:underline">no-one</span> could have had the relevant knowledge within the Limitation Act before the paper was first published, then no claim is statute-barred and it does not matter that the knowledge was acquired after the issue of proceedings.  Second, if it be the case (considered at paragraph 517) that, until the receipt of the report, the essential case on exposure to ionising radiation was weak, then the fact that the report arguably strengthens that case considerably would be a relevant factor under section 33.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The true impact of the Rowland Report on the decisions made in relation to this litigation is, in my judgment, revealed by what Mr David Harris, in an unchallenged witness statement, has said.  Mr Harris was one of the founding partners of Messrs Alexander Harris, the well-known firm of solicitors that merged with Messrs Irwin Mitchell in April 2006.  Mr Harris had experience of multi-party or group litigation work and, as a result of some work he was conducting jointly with Mr Mervyn Fudge of Messrs Clarke Willmott, he and Mr Fudge started investigating this case.  Mr Harris said that those investigations started in about April 2002, although it would seem (see paragraph 320 above) that a Mr Peter Bright of Messrs Clarke Willmott had already taken some initial steps in the process.  At this stage it appears that some limited Legal Aid had been obtained to investigate the viability of bringing claims against the Defendant. As part of that overall investigatory process, Mr Harris went to Fiji and New Zealand in November/December 2002 at his own expense.  He met Professor Rowland who told him that, based on preliminary findings, his eventual conclusions “may well be favourable to the veterans in challenging the existing scientific view.”  Mr Harris says that Professor Rowland was not able to give him a definite view, but led him to feel confident in the eventual outcome of his investigations. </p>

It was not, as I understand it, until 2006 that further positive indications emerged from Professor Rowland’s team.  The part of the Master Particulars of Claim set out in paragraph 67 above, though not referring explicitly to Professor Rowland’s report, appears to have been drafted with some knowledge of the likely findings.  The <span style="font-style:italic">Mail on Sunday</span> article, to which I referred in paragraph 401 above, referred to findings said to have been related to damaged white blood cells on the part of veterans.  It would seem, therefore, that at about this time the general thrust of what was likely to emerge from the New Zealand study was becoming clearer and the <span style="font-style:italic">Mail on Sunday</span> article conveyed that message.

Until this process is complete, it will not be possible to take an informed view on whether the study has implications for the claims by nuclear test veterans for additional compensation.  Indeed, the authors are at pains to stress that their study, which is about chromosomal changes, makes no claims on the health status of the veterans. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">The general problem with which each of those Acts sought to deal was that of the position of a victim of negligence or breach of statutory duty who did not know, and would have had no reason to know, that he or she had suffered injury within the limitation period.  The case of <span style="font-style:italic">Cartledge v E. Jopling and Sons Limited</span> [1963] AC 758 demonstrated the injustice that this caused.  At the time with which that case was concerned, the limitation period for a personal injuries claim was six years from the accrual of the cause of action, the law being that the cause of action accrued when more than minimal injury or damage was suffered by the plaintiff.  (The need for “more than minimal damage” remains the criterion for the accrual of the cause of action and I will return to it at paragraphs 473-480 below.)  Mr Cartledge died in England on 15 June 1957 (incidentally, four days before the GRAPPLE 3 test took place many miles away near Malden Island).  The cause of his death was pneumoconiosis contracted from the inhalation <span style="text-decoration:underline">prior to October 1950</span> of minute particles of fragmented silica dust to which he had been exposed by his employers in breach of sections 4 and 47 of the Factories Act 1937.  He, and others in a similar position, did not discover that they had pneumoconiosis until after October 1950.  A writ was issued on his behalf on 1 October 1956 and his employers took the point that the claim was statute-barred.  Mr Cartledge had died before the trial and his widow continued the case on his behalf.  The trial judge, the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords, each with regret, held that the claim was statute-barred.   </p>

It would appear that when the symptoms did emerge, there was little difficulty in attributing the disease to the failure of his employers to take appropriate care for him.  In other words, identifying the circumstances in which there was a breach of duty and how that breach of duty led to the commencement of a physical process that resulted in the emergence of pneumoconiosis in due course was an uncomplicated exercise.  </p>

This test was rejected by the majority in the House of Lords (Lords Pearson, Simon and Salmon) largely on the basis that it depended significantly on the nature and quality of legal advice received by the injured person.  However, the position taken by the House of Lords left the law in a state of yet further uncertainty and consequently the Law Reform Committee was invited to revisit the area.  It was on the basis of that Committee’s report that the 1975 Act (consolidated in the 1980 Act) was founded. </p>

In the first place, whilst the ultimate decision of the Committee was a retention of the actual/constructive knowledge principle (albeit recast in different statutory language) in relation to the commencement of the limitation period in personal injury cases where the injury emerged after the accrual of the cause of action, the Committee did revisit the question of whether there should be a limitation period at all in such cases.  The Committee saw the argument in favour of that position as being “formidable”, but also perceived the arguments on the other side also to be “formidable”.

We are satisfied that this is a date capable of precise definition and not presenting any particular difficulties of proof; we are further satisfied that, in the great majority of personal injury cases (which are apt to be overlooked in the publicity inevitably attaching to exceptional cases), its selection would not involve hardship to prospective plaintiffs; but we recognise that there is likely to be a small number of cases, potentially involving very serious injuries, in which it could do so.  The question then arises whether, although we have rejected discretion as a general solution to the problem of limitation in personal injury cases, there should not be vested in the courts a residual discretion, which would cover all such cases, to extend the time where, on a consideration of all the circumstances, including the respective hardships actually involved to the plaintiff if time is not extended, and to the defendant if it is, it is considered equitable to do so.  The virtue of such provision is that it would enable the courts to do what the existing law does not permit, namely to investigate the actual hardships arising on each side, in the circumstances of each particular case, and to try to strike a fair balance between them.  By contrast, the major defect, as we see it, of excluding any field of discretion would be that the court could not take into account the existence, or absence, of the actual hardship.  For example, the defendant’s only witness as to the relevant facts may have died before the first, or may have survived until after the last, of the possible selected dates and it is therefore as likely as not that a court which has no discretion will either have to give the defendant protection against a possible event which has not happened, or to deny him protection against one that has.  Equally, where the plaintiff has allowed time to run out because he has received defective advice, the court would be unable to take into account the fact that any hardship he might otherwise have suffered would be mitigated (or even eliminated) by his right to claim damages for negligence from his advisers.” </p>

However, as it seems to me, a number of matters may fairly be deduced from the material revealed by the exercise.  In the first place, as I observed in paragraph 447 above, the whole process of reform started with the need to rectify the injustice caused when a latent injury or disease did not become manifest until after the limitation period expired, but against the background of the circumstance that when such an injury or disease did become manifest the act or omission leading to it and its attributability to that act or omission was readily identifiable.  The complication of establishing a causal link between the disease or injury and the relevant act or omission did not appear to exist.  The cases with which each Committee was concerned so far as actual/constructive knowledge was concerned (and the cases that led to the appointment of each Committee) were generally straightforward industrial injury claims, the only complication being the late emergence of the disease or injury.  The only additional complicating matter was that of the potential claimant being given wrong medical or legal advice about the attributability of the disease or injury to the acts or omissions of the potential defendant.  Section 7(5)(c) 1963 Act gave effect to the recommendation of the Edmund-Davies Committee in this regard and the philosophy of that approach was carried forward into the 1975 Act. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">One point that it may be necessary to consider in relation to the issue of “knowledge” is the extent to which any of those present in the vicinity of any of the tests would have appreciated that any illness they subsequently developed arose from exposure to radiation arising from inhaled or ingested fall-out.  In other words, how, for example, would a serviceman who developed a “significant injury” (see paragraphs 485-512) many years after his time at or near the tests have thought to himself that it might have been the consequence of eating an irradiated fish or drinking, swimming or washing in irradiated water?  The obvious thought would have been that, if anything had occurred, it would have been as a result of some direct exposure from the initial blasts – a view doubtless still retained by many of those who believe they have suffered in consequence – or as a result of being on duty within the radioactive clouds formed as part of the explosions.   (In a letter dated 2 September 1987 Mr McGinley wrote to the then President of the United States of America and described the BNTVA as “a group of nuclear veterans trying to obtain recognition and recompense for our illnesses and in many cases death, caused <span style="text-decoration:underline">through witnessing nuclear explosions</span>” (my emphasis).

Unlike the 1963 Act the 1975 Act provided for a residual discretion on the part of the court to disapply the limitation period in any case where it was “equitable” to do so.  That provision is now to be found in section 33 of the 1980 Act.   Again, whilst the Law Reform Committee and Parliament may well have had insidious (or “long maturing”: <span style="font-style:italic">per</span> Lord Diplock in <span style="font-style:italic">Thompson v Brown </span>[1981] 1 WLR 744, 747) diseases in mind when formulating the discretion, it is hard to believe that a case precisely such as the present was in contemplation.  It is much more likely that attention was on far simpler personal injuries claims, the defendants to which were generally backed by insurers whose voices in the legislative process will not have been ignored.  Insurers, for understandable reasons, need to know when files can be closed, make actuarial assessments of risk factors in given situations, devise investment strategies that ensure the wherewithal to meet legitimate claims when made and advise their insured on when paperwork relating to events may be destroyed.  The same considerations do not arise, at least in an identical fashion, in relation to Government departments.  It is, perhaps, worth recording that no Government department is mentioned as a body responding to the consultation exercise carried out by the Law Reform Committee in advance of the 1974 report (see Appendix C to the report).

Given the mechanism relied upon for the injuries to health suffered by the Claimants in this case, particularly the various cancerous conditions (see paragraphs 74 and 169170), it is worth noting how the causal mechanism of mesothelioma (itself a form of cancer of the mesothelial cells of the <a href="http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=4393#pleura">lungs </a>or the <a href="http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=4393#perit">abdomen)</a>, which was the subject of the <span style="font-style:italic">Bolton</span> case, was seen by the Court of Appeal in relation to the issue of when damage or injury occurs. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0.00in">“The division of cells in human tissue is important for understanding how mesothelioma occurs.  Each cell in the body contains all the genetic information necessary for the construction and functioning of the entire body.  This information is contained in the form of DNA, a molecule consisting of two intertwining strands.  The different structure and function of the various types of cell in the body occurs because in each cell only some of the genes contained in the DNA are active and in different cells different genes are active.  The coded information in a DNA molecule is in the form of about 3,000,000,000 “base pairs”.  Each pair consists of two collections of atoms called nucleotides.  There is one half of each pair in each of the two intertwining strands.  When cell division occurs the strands unravel and two “daughter” double helices are created.  Normally the daughters are identical with each other but sometimes they are not.  … the word “mutation” [is used] for an imperfect copy.  This word “mutation” thus means a thing – a cell – and not a process, and is not a synonym of “change”; for change … the term “generic alteration” [is used].  I shall adopt this usage.  The word “mutation” does not have any derogatory connotations.  A mutation is different from, but not necessarily worse than, the cell from which it is derived or otherwise undesirable.  The body contains what can be described as a “repair mechanism” which sometimes corrects the discrepancy between a daughter and its parent.  This repair mechanism is vital to normal health, and people whose repair system lacks some components (a very rare condition) will die early, often of cancer.  Sometimes, however, a perfectly normal repair and correction mechanism fails to correct a mutation.  Such failure can lead to any of three possibilities.  First, the mutation may be unable to survive and die.  Secondly it may be better fitted for its purpose than the cell from which it is derived, and this is the cause of evolution …. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0.00in">It is the third possibility with which this case is concerned.  A mutation which does not die, which is not repaired and which does not perform its purpose better than the cell from which it was derived may itself divide, and the “daughter” cells or (to continue the parental analogy) the grand-daughter or more distant descendants may in turn die, be repaired or be mutations from the cell from which they are derived.  Eventually there may be a mutation which is malignant, i.e. a cell which divides in an uncontrolled manner, as opposed to maintaining the normal balance between cells dying and cells dividing.  It normally takes a “heredity” of six or seven genetic alterations before a malignant cell occurs.  The body has Natural Killer cells which, as their name indicates, can target and destroy mutations, possibly even after they have become malignant.  A tumour is a growth consisting of a number of cells dividing in that uncontrolled manner.  Mesothelioma is a tumour in the pleura …. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0.00in">Asbestos fibres in the pleura increase the likelihood of genetic mutation.  It is now thought likely that, if there is a series of genetic alterations which ends with a malignant cell in the pleura, fibres will have acted in causing several of those genetic alterations, rather than just one genetic alteration.  However the final genetic alteration which results in a malignant cell is not necessarily caused by fibres directly.  Fibres may also inhibit the activity of Natural Killer cells.  Pre-cancerous genetic alterations in cells do not give rise to any symptoms or signs.  They cannot be detected by any routine clinical or radiological examination.  It would be possible to detect them by examining in a laboratory tissue taken from a part of the body containing cells which have become genetically modified, but the exercise would be pointless because pre-cancerous genetic alterations do not necessarily or even usually lead to mesothelioma. </p>

The precise details of that argument are not relevant for present purposes.  However, one argument advanced was that an “accidental injury” had befallen the deceased “either on inhalation of asbestos fibres or, perhaps, on the first bodily reaction to such inhalation, not at the unascertainable moment when a malignant tumour first appeared, still less when [the deceased] first felt symptoms of breathlessness and chest pain and less still when mesothelioma was itself diagnosed.”  Reliance was placed “on the minuscule changes which … preceded the genetic changes which gave rise, at a later date, to the existence of cancerous cells….”  In other words, it was argued that accidental injury occurred “at the point when the body’s natural defence mechanisms were operating to destroy or neutralise the fibres as soon as they were inhaled.” </p>

This contention is based on <span style="font-style:italic">KR and others v Bryn Alyn Community Holdings Ltd</span> [2003] 1 QB 1441 which, it is said, was not overruled by the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">A v Hoare</span> on this point.

However, in the case of the kind of injury inflicted in cases of that kind, it is tolerably easy to see that ordinarily the victim would have known that he or she had been the subject of a sexual assault from the moment it happened or from the period over which a pattern of systematic abuse was perpetrated.  To that extent, from the moment of his or her initial injury (which would have been significant), the limitation clock would start ticking even in respect of other significant injuries (in that case, psychological) of which he or she could not have been aware at that time.  In <span style="font-style:italic">A v Hoare</span> the House of Lords has held how the later-acquired appreciation of those psychological consequences can be accommodated within the framework of the law of limitation.  </p>

He does within 3 years of the skin complaint arising (or it would be reasonable to expect him to) attribute it to presence at or near the tests and, whilst it does represent a significant problem, he simply treats it as “one of those things” and does not issue proceedings in respect of it even though he believes (reasonably) that he could do so.  At some later stage in his period on the island, he eats some locally caught fish irradiated by the fall-out from the same or another test.  As a result he ingests some radioactive material with a relatively long half-life and many years later alpha or beta particles are emitted from the ingested material that have lodged within the body that trigger a process that leads to the development of a malignant tumour.  With the benefit of expert help he then learns to attribute the tumour to the ingestion of radioactive materials during his presence at the tests and issues proceedings within 3 years of acquiring this knowledge. </p>

One can see that various, potentially complex, questions might theoretically arise about whether there were separate causes of action in relation to the two types of injury caused in two different ways (albeit in each case by ionising radiation) – potentially by two different types of breach of duty – and a major problem would have arisen if, for example, the particular veteran <span style="text-decoration:underline">had</span> brought a claim in respect of the skin complaint which was then settled or the proceedings in respect of it brought to a conclusion by a judgment.  None of these complications arise for consideration here.  The issue, more simply, is whether such a veteran would be entitled to say that “the injury in question” in respect of which he now seeks to claim is the later (and thus second) emerging injury rather than the first and that the first might only be made the subject of proceedings by virtue of a favourable exercise of the discretion under section 33.   </p>

Whilst it must be recognised that when the shutters are brought down in some cases by the law of limitation seemingly unjust results can arise, to hold otherwise in this case in particular would offend most people’s notion of justice.  I recognise that the problem could be overcome by following the route to and through section 33, but it does seem to me to require a somewhat artificial departure point for the journey.  The essential scenario in the kind of situation I have identified is that the second injury is not statute-barred, but the first is.  Why should the section 33 route not be the route to enable the Claimant to pursue the earlier (and first) injury if he wishes to do so many years after the event rather than, as the Defendant contends, the other way around?  Unless constrained by authority to take a different view (and I do not think that <span style="font-style:italic">Bryn Alyn </span>does so constrain me) and since what is relied upon as “the injury in question” in any case is a question of fact (cf. <span style="font-style:italic">Sniezek v Bundy (Letchworth) Limited</span> [2000] PIQR P213, per Judge LJ, as he then was), I would hold that the Court is entitled to examine what is claimed by the individual Claimant to be that injury.

In that event, a different timescale may apply to the limitation issues.  That, as it seems to me, is what the words in the Limitation Act require, rather than a rigid adherence to the proposition that the “first” injury is that which governs the issue in all circumstances.  Whilst it is, with respect, relatively easy to see why that approach was considered appropriate in a case such as <span style="font-style:italic">Bryn Alyn</span>, I do not see that it amounts to a universal proposition of law or that it could have been intended to govern the position in an unusual case such as this. </p>

At all events, that is the approach I intend to adopt because, as it seems to me, it is consistent with the structure of the Act.

If it appears that a claimant, while believing that his injury is attributable to the act or omission of the defendant, realises that his belief requires expert confirmation before he acquires such a degree of certainty of belief as amounts to knowledge, then he will not have knowledge until that confirmation is obtained. Frequently, as it seems to us, it will be safe for the court to proceed upon the basis that a claimant did realise that he required confirmation if he acted in a manner consistent with that state of mind even if he is, as he may frequently be, unable to recall with any degree of precision what his state of mind was. Conclusions as to a claimant's state of mind will, we think, usually be more securely based upon inference from conduct in the known circumstances than from a claimant's later assertion as to how he now recalls his then state of mind as between, for example, belief or knowledge. We add that we have difficulty in perceiving how in any case where a claimant has sought advice and taken proceedings, it can rightly be held that the claimant had not then had relevant knowledge.” </p>

In other cases the state of the plaintiff's belief would make it reasonable for him to make the further inquiries envisaged in section 14(3).

The primary reason for saying this is that this is the first occasion when it can be said that (at least as things stand) there is credible scientific evidence of exposure to radiation to levels (a) above background levels and (b) which cause the kind of chromosomal aberrations that evidence the mechanism for at least some of the injuries or conditions of which complaint is made.  Prior to the Rowland Report all the evidence raised nothing more than a suspicion of exposure to excess ionising radiation with no clear link to the conditions of which complaint is made.  Indeed, of course, the NRPB reports (see paragraphs 349-375) and other studies (the New Zealand study by <span style="font-style:italic">Pearce</span> et al 1990, 1997, the Australian studies by <span style="font-style:italic">Donovan</span> et al, 1983, <span style="font-style:italic">Carter</span> et al, 2006 and <span style="font-style:italic">Gun</span> et al 2006 and the US studies by <span style="font-style:italic">Watanabe</span> et al 1995, <span style="font-style:italic">Johnson</span> et al, 1996 and <span style="font-style:italic">Thaul</span> et al 2000) suggested that majority of veterans were exposed to very low levels of<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>radiation and that there was no proof that veterans “suffered worse health than the general population” (see paragraph 308).

Whether or not it will be possible for defendants to investigate these sufficiently for there to be a reasonable prospect of a fair trial will depend upon a number of factors, not least when the complaint was first made and with what effect. If a complaint has been made and recorded, and more obviously still if the accused has been convicted of the abuse complained of, that will be one thing; if, however, a complaint comes out of the blue with no apparent support for it (other perhaps than that the alleged abuser has been accused or even convicted of similar abuse in the past), that would be quite another thing. By no means everyone who brings a late claim for damages for sexual abuse, however genuine his complaint may in fact be, can reasonably expect the court to exercise the section 33 discretion in his favour. On the contrary, a fair trial (which must surely include a fair opportunity for the defendant to investigate the allegations - see section 33(3)(b)) is in many cases likely to be found quite simply impossible after a long delay. </p>

To what extent has the defendant been disadvantaged in his investigation of the claim and/or the assembly of evidence, in respect of the issues of both liability and quantum? But it will also be important to consider the reasons for the delay. Thus, there may be some unfairness to the defendant due to the delay in issue but the delay may have arisen for so excusable a reason, that, looking at the matter in the round, on balance, it is fair and just that the action should proceed.   On the other hand, the balance may go in the opposite direction, partly because the delay has caused procedural disadvantage and unfairness to the defendant and partly because the reasons for the delay (or its length) are not good ones.    </p>

It is the first of those two routes that, on the evidence before me, some have attempted to follow.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">There is in the evidence presented in these proceedings a statement from a Mr Paul Draper who undertakes research for clients.  He was commissioned initially in about 1984 on behalf of the BNTVA to assist in looking at the nuclear test files at the PRO (now the National Archives) at Kew.  It is, of course, there that Government documents, once they cease to be classified or otherwise protected from public disclosure, are deposited.  Mr Draper’s arrangement with the BNTVA was somewhat <span style="font-style:italic">ad hoc</span> and, since he made his living out of research of this kind, he required to be paid.  He did do research for the BNTVA on and off for about 13 years up to about 1997.  He, of course, had experience of using the facilities at Kew and describes them at some length in his statement.  I need not set out what he says in detail, but he does say that a lay person without “specialist knowledge of the Public Records Office would find it virtually impossible to fully research as extensive a subject such as </p>

That was Mr Draper’s assessment based on his experience.  Additionally, in the material before me, is a statement from Ms Marie-Eve von Allmen who works for Messrs Rosenblatts.  She describes the present facilities for searching and retrieving documents at Kew, both online and by more traditional methods.  Her statement has not been the subject of any rebuttal and I have no reason to doubt it.  It merely reinforces, in my view, Mr Draper’s general assertions.   </p>

What can be said, and this seems to me to be a fully justified conclusion, is that the collation by an individual, or even a group of individuals, of all potentially relevant documentation concerning the tests from public sources would be an impossible task.  In one sense, and this is merely a reflection of the view that I express elsewhere in this judgment (see paragraph 345), the only realistic way in which litigation raising the issues about conduct of the tests can be pursued is by virtue of a collective action such as this action. </p>

In a case where the defendant has suffered some forensic or procedural prejudice, which will diminish his ability to defend himself, it will be relevant to consider that the claimant has another remedy.   But the fact that the claimant has a claim over will not necessarily mean that the direction [to disapply the time limit] should be refused.

Mr Gibson argued that “no case of this factual complexity with such serious allegations should or could be” tried substantially on the documents and argued that making “safe and fair” findings of fact would be “impossibly difficult”.

It would be unthinkable that the tests and all the arrangements surrounding them, both before and after each and indeed more generally, were not documented fully and meticulously: given that the tests did involve experimentation, they are likely to have been as well, if not better, documented than almost any other significant event in UK history.  Indeed it is plain from such documentation as is enclosed in some of the bundles before the Court that this is so.  I will summarise some of that documentation below (see paragraphs 585-602), but it is agreed by Mr Crossley that the documents </p>

As I understand it, about 12,000 documents have been disclosed (comprising about 225,000 pages), those documents, in the Ministry’s estimation on the basis of legal advice, relating to, or being potentially relevant to, the limitation issues.  It appears from an answer that Mr Crossley gave to a written question put to him by the Claimants’ legal team during the proceedings that there are “over 190,000 documents in the AWE files alone” which may be potentially relevant to the claim overall, though not necessarily relevant to the limitation issue.  That there is a distinction between documents relevant to the substantive claim and to the issue of limitation is evidenced by a very lengthy letter from the Treasury Solicitor to Messrs Rosenblatt dated 17 December 2008 in response to applications for specific disclosure made on behalf of the Claimants made on 5 and 8 December.  It would seem, therefore, that more documents relevant to issues of breach of duty exist but have not (perfectly properly) been disclosed at the present stage of the proceedings. </p>

Indeed Mr Crossley’s principal Generic Witness Statement gives clear details of the demanding process of disclosure undertaken by the Defendant.  No suggestion has been made that any significant quantity of potentially relevant documentation has been destroyed or lost since the days of the tests.  Again, it would be inconceivable that there should have been any wholesale loss or destruction of documentation in relation to events such as these.  If any loss of documentation has occurred, it could not be alleged to be as a result of any specific delay on the part of any veteran seeking compensation. </p>

Although described as the Draft Report, it is plain from the introductory page that the report had been “completely edited, coordinated, and revised as to subject matter but not quite so completely as to form.”  It is plain that it represented the product of several months of collation and analysis of information.  Given that the primary task of the Radiological Hazard Division was, it was said, “to ensure the radiological safety of all personnel taking part in the operation”, the report reflected in very considerable detail what those responsible for the safety measures did or did not do, achieved or failed to achieve and so on in what was acknowledged to be the first “burst of [its] type” ever attempted. </p>

Its principal author was Lieutenant Colonel Alec Walkling, who was the Radiation Hazards Group Leader for Operation HURRICANE.  He died in February 1988, but had given evidence to the Australian Royal Commission and a transcript of his evidence is available.   Another contributor to the report was Captain William Saxby who died in November 1991.  Captain Saxby was a member of the Radiation Safety and Measurement Group (RH Division) and was Lieutenant Colonel Walkling’s assistant. He gave evidence to the Australian Royal Commission on the question of measures taken to guard against radiation exposure and the Commission recorded that he “gave detailed evidence … about dosimetry and the records made”. A record of the evidence is available.  (It would, perhaps, be convenient to add at this point that Captain Saxby was actively involved in the BUFFALO, ANTLER and GRAPPLE Z tests in a variety of capacities and was author of the Radiological Safety Regulations for Maralinga, 1955 and 1957. After his military career he worked at AWRE Aldermaston as Superintendent, Trials Planning Branch.  One of his responsibilities was to respond to inquiries on dose records made in the course of applications to the Department of Social Security for War Disablement Pensions.   An example can be seen in relation to the application made by the late Mr Clark: see paragraph 733). </p>

The views and positions of the institution that the Defendant now represents will be clear from the voluminous documentation available for consideration and the systems put in place are clearly and fully recorded.  Indeed the views and positions of many of the significant individuals within that institution will also be clear from the same sources.

As a matter of fairness to a number amongst the Claimants, it should be noted that not all of them subscribe to the allegation in any event.  Furthermore, it seems to me quite possible for the claims to be presented without having to put the case as high as suggesting a wholesale deliberate Governmental policy to expose thousands of young conscripts to unknown levels of radiation just to see what happened.  As will be apparent from the earlier parts of this judgment, the case being advanced is more subtle than that and, in effect, amounts to an allegation that insufficient steps were taken to prevent exposure to ionising radiation from the effects of ingesting or inhaling materials affected by fall-out.  That could, one supposes, be made part of the “guinea pig” allegation, but it does not appear to have the hallmarks of such a suggestion and Mr Browne did not seek to put it in that way in the current proceedings. </p>

If the scientific evidence establishes that the participants were probably exposed to ionising radiation at a level above background level then, as Mr Browne has submitted, it is difficult to see why accurate and precise reconstruction of any participant’s involvement or location will be necessary.  The essential allegation is that the material exposure, if it occurred, arose from the effects of fall-out over the period that the men were in the areas affected by fall-out from the tests.

It is no part of my task to try to see a way through all of this if it has occurred, merely for the moment to draw attention to how public perceptions could be distorted by these matters if a full and balanced picture is not available. </p>

In my view, the answer would be that, all things being equal, a veteran who believes that he had an illness, injury or disability attributable to his presence at the tests whose case is supported by apparently reputable scientific and medical evidence, should be entitled to his “day in court”.  That is plainly not the sole test I must apply in making any decision under section 33 nor can it possibly be an overriding factor.  However, it is a factor that, in the exercise of the overall discretion within section 33, cannot be ignored completely in, as this is, a case where young servicemen, with no choice in the matter and who were in any event assured of safety, now claim to have suffered in consequence of serving in a cause designed to protect the security of their country.  The same consideration must surely apply to others who played their part too and to whom a duty of care on the part of those organising the tests existed.   Indeed, on one view, what they all did served a world interest, not merely a national one.  </p>

Indeed it is arguable that the broad nature of “the fall-out case” had existed well before that.  However, this consideration does have to be viewed against the background of the consistent stance of the Defendant that there was no general exposure to excess ionising radiation and its reliance on the epidemiological evidence of the NRPB reports that no adverse health effects could be determined amongst the veterans.  Epidemiological evidence can, of course, form an important backdrop in a case such as this because it is capable of demonstrating a “general trend”:  see per Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in <span style="font-style:italic">Gregg v Scott </span>[2005] 2 AC 176, paragraph 28. </p>

If this report withstands the scrutiny to which it will doubtless be exposed in any trial, it will demonstrate the viability of “the fall-out case” in a way that could never have been advanced before (see, eg, paragraphs 428 and 517).  If the advance in scientific techniques many years after material events is an insufficient factor to contribute to the exercise of a favourable discretion under section 33, then the Defendant’s argument might be sound.  But I am unable to accept that this must be so.  DNA profiling is now used routinely to enable long unresolved criminal cases to be brought before the courts.   In many respects what has happened in this case is analogous. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">I am certainly of the view that I must have regard to the fact that “the fall-out case” in its most general sense is one that has been available for consideration for a good while, but it cuts both ways: it could theoretically have been deployed on the Claimants’ behalf at an earlier stage, but equally the Defendant and its advisers have been well aware of it for many years and ought to have been in a position to anticipate that it would be advanced one day (as indeed it was in <span style="font-style:italic">Pearce</span>).  However, the fall-out case to which I refer is the case “in its most general sense” – it would have been unspecific and largely incapable of proof until the Rowland Report emerged.

This was included in the Part 18 Schedule along with other matters mentioned below although Mr Ayres said he did not understand why it was included.  (Its causation by ionising radiation is supported by Professor Mothersill and its abandonment for the purposes of this litigation, the Defendant suggests, reflects either a lack of faith in the expert opinion of Professor Mothersill or a strategic choice to drop this early condition for the purposes of limitation.  The former is not a relevant consideration at this stage and I have dealt generally with the second assertion in paragraphs 81-85).    He had suffered from osteoarthritis in the left knee from 1977 and received a diagnosis about it in 1984, cataracts starting in about 1996, haematuria (blood in the urine) in the late 1990s, prostate cancer diagnosed on 2 December 2003 and bone cancer diagnosed in February 2004 (this cancer being a secondary malignant growth arising from and parasitic upon the prostate cancer). </p>

At the end of the day, the issue in Mr Ayres’ case is when he first had actual and/or constructive knowledge that his <span style="text-decoration:underline">prostate cancer</span> was attributable in whole or in part to exposure to radiation at Christmas Island, the Defendant accepting that he did not have actual and/or constructive knowledge in respect of his <span style="text-decoration:underline">osteoarthritis</span> until after the diagnosis of prostate cancer.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The primary focus, therefore, is on the question of whether he acquired the relevant knowledge on 2 December 2003 or shortly after. The Defendant contends he knew as soon as the diagnosis of prostate cancer was made that it was attributable to radiation – in other words, the suggestion is that the limitation period started on or about 2 December 2003, almost exactly 2 months before the 3-year period ending on 1 February 2007 began.  The submission on behalf of Mr Ayres is that his date of knowledge occurred at some point between about mid-2004 (when he had spent time reflecting on the implications of the diagnoses of prostate and bone cancer) and 7 May 2006 when he read the <span style="font-style:italic">Mail on Sunday</span> article referred to in paragraph 401.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The highpoint of the Defendant’s case in relation to “knowledge” is the acceptance in cross-examination by Mr Ayres of the proposition that when the diagnosis of prostate cancer was given to him he “knew” that “there was a real possibility” that it was caused by radiation to which, by then, he thought he may have been exposed when at Christmas Island.  I will examine the consequences of those words shortly, but it is right to say that prior to that time he (and, perhaps more particularly, his wife) had had some concerns about whether some of his medical problems might be associated with his time at Christmas Island.  He had, understandably, been concerned about the haematuria and he accepted that, having read some newspaper articles about the BNTVA campaign, there was a possibility (though he put it no higher than that) that it was linked to his time at Christmas Island.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Because of Mr Ayres’ general state of mind, I think it was sensible for Mr Gibson not to submit that any medical issue that Mr Ayres experienced before the diagnosis of prostate cancer constituted a “significant injury”.  Whatever words may have been put to him in cross-examination which he accepted, I think that his general state of mind before the diagnosis of prostate cancer can only be described fairly as a generalised suspicion that, for example, his haematuria might have been linked to radiation exposure.  Although Mr Gibson secured the acceptance in cross-examination that he “firmly believed that [the haematuria] was capable of being blamed on the radiation” (the proposition being that he realised this when he read a particular newspaper article in December 1998), I do not think that the objective evidence from the surrounding circumstances at the time really justifies that conclusion.  For example, by then he and his wife were aware of the BNTVA and yet there is no evidence that he (or she) contacted the BNTVA specifically about the haematuria.  Equally, when he saw his General Practitioner on 31 December 1998 (only a few weeks after the article in the <span style="font-style:italic">Mail on Sunday</span>) there is no record of him having asked his GP whether his problems might be related to his time at Christmas Island.  In those circumstances, analysed fairly, I do not think that it can be said that he had anything more than a generalised suspicion about that matter at that time.  Giving to his subjective state of knowledge at the time, and anything he ought reasonably to have done to seek advice about it, the objective analysis required by <span style="font-style:italic">A v Hoare</span> (see paragraph 486), I do not consider that it can be said that he acquired “knowledge” within the Limitation Act of the attributability of his haematuria to the tests.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">I am unable to accept that, as a matter of fact, that is so or that the law demands so clear cut a conclusion.  In the first place, why should Mr Ayres at that moment (assuming that he wished immediately upon diagnosis to consider the cause of the cancer) necessarily combine his past suspicions with an immediate recall of the article read some five years before linking presence at the tests with multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow?  Given that he was 71 on diagnosis, the most natural immediate assumption would have been that he was just one of those unfortunate men, of whom there are many, who develop prostate cancer during their later years.  With a clear mind, it might well have taken anyone some time to start piecing the personal jigsaw together with the eventual attribution of the condition to what happened at the tests.  However, Mr Ayres, when confronted with the diagnosis, was also confronted with some very difficult and sensitive treatment choices upon which I will not dwell in this public judgment.  Suffice it to say, that I cannot believe that he, or anyone in his position would have been troubling to think about the cause of what he was facing at that time when the whole focus was on how to deal with it.  I should say that, having reviewed his medical records for that period, there is no record of him having raised with his General Practitioner or the Consultant who was seeing him at the time the question of any causal connection between the cancer and the Christmas Island tests.  I cannot believe that any analysis involving the concept of the “reasonable person” possessed of the information at, and reasonably at, his disposal at the moment of diagnosis would result in a different conclusion.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In my view, it would have been perfectly reasonable for anyone in Mr Ayres’ position to take time to digest the consequences of the diagnosis that was first made in December 2003 and then supplemented in February 2004.  In fact he did nothing about it until after he had seen the <span style="font-style:italic">Mail on Sunday</span> article referred to in paragraph 401 above and then contacted Messrs Rosenblatts.  That article effectively indicated what the Rowland study would conclude although it made no direct reference to prostate cancer.  If my preferred view on how the question of knowledge should be approached (see paragraphs 514-521) applied, the limitation period would not have started at least until he had seen that article and, I would add, had made contact with the solicitors to ask for further information.  However, since I do not feel able to go that far on the authorities, I would agree that Mr Browne is justified in saying that Mr Ayres’ knowledge should be taken as having been acquired at some time between the middle of 2004 and when he read that article.  I conclude this because, given his previous suspicions, it would have been reasonable for him to seek expert confirmation of the potential linkage between his prostate and bone cancer and exposure to ionising radiation.  On the basis that he ought reasonably to have done that at some stage during this period, I think it must be said that he acquired constructive knowledge during it.  However, it does not matter very much for practical purposes.  My conclusion is that he did not possess relevant knowledge until <span style="text-decoration:underline">after</span> 1 February 2004 and, accordingly, his claim is not statute-barred.</p>

It is said that the only support comes from Professor Mothersill and all she has said is that “exposure to ionising radiation materially increased the risk of Mr. Ayres developing prostate cancer …”.  I do not think it is quite right to say that the only support comes from Professor Mothersill.  Professor Parker has said that the evidence as reported in UNSCEAR (United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation) 2006 is equivocal since there are some studies which suggest there may be a relation between prostate cancer and exposure to ionising radiation, but the evidence is not conclusive and UNSCEAR concludes that overall there is little evidence supportive of an association. The Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF), she says, suggests that the association between radiation and prostate cancer is weak.  Professor Kaldor has said that “[based] on the best available scientific information, ionising radiation has not been consistently found to be a cause of prostate cancer.”  It is not suggested by either Professor Parker or Professor Kaldor that the link is non-existent, though it has to be acknowledged, on the basis of the present evidence, it is weak. </p>

In addition to the difficulties of demonstrating an association between radiation and prostate cancer he may face the difficulty of establishing that it was not more likely to have arisen spontaneously given his age rather than as a result of exposure to ionising radiation. </p>

If that is the Defendant’s response to this claim, it seems that the material is there to respond to it. </p>

The records show that he enlisted on 2 October 1951, almost exactly a year before Operation HURRICANE.  He was not involved in that operation, but he was involved in Operation MOSAIC starting on 16 May 1956, Operation BUFFALO, Operation GRAPPLE and then Operation ANTLER in September and October 1957.  He also took part in what are known as the Tims trials (which I understand to have been minor trials) on four occasions, the last of which ended on 1 October 1957.  It is not, as I understand it, being said that his participation in those trials necessarily extends the scope or ambit of the claim made on his behalf, but there is a suggestion that figures given by the Ministry of Defence for his exposure to radiation may not have taken his presence at those tests into account.  That having been said, the Defendant admits that he was exposed to ionising radiation in a total amount of 108.8 mSv.  His “Blue book” entry shows a total dose of 106.7 mSv, but AWE have assessed the dose at a slightly higher level of 108.8 mSv because of his attendance at the Tims trials. </p>

The evidence of his exposure came from the badges he wore.

First of all she contacted Mrs Spatcher who then suggested that she contacted a Mrs Shirley Denson, who was personally active within the BNTVA and whose late husband had also flown through nuclear clouds following detonations.  Mrs Denson recommended that she wrote to the NRPB to obtain her late husband’s dosage chart which indeed she did do.  When the results were received (see paragraph 657 above) she wrote to Dr Ransom who had been responsible for her late husband before he died.  Indeed she wrote on the same day to a Dr Harper of the Radiation Oncology Department who, along with Dr Ransom, was based at the Royal Perth Hospital.

We also know that smoking is strongly associated with the development of malignancy in the lung and upper aerodigestive tract such as the oesophagus.

On whatever view of the authorities that might otherwise apply (see paragraph 521), I have no doubt that by sometime after April 2002 (but, subject to the next paragraph, not before) Mrs Brothers had crossed the threshold into the arena of “knowledge” within the Limitation Act.  Pursuing the medical avenue and then seeking legal advice seems to me, on the authorities, to be sufficient to have crossed that threshold.

However, as it seems to me, her husband’s adamant view that it was nothing to do with that would have to be conclusive on the issue unless there was clear evidence that she did not accept it and had been looking into the matter with vigour prior to his death.  As in Mr Ayres’ case, I have absolutely no doubt that, entirely reasonably, the whole focus of her life and that of her husband after the diagnosis in 1997 was to address the treatment he needed rather than to spend time questioning how it all came about.  She said in her witness statement that the hospital was 250 miles away and this added to the difficulties of coping with everything else that had to be dealt with.  There is nothing in the contemporaneous medical records to suggest that either she or Mr Brothers raised the question of the tests with any of the doctors.  The only basis upon which it could be suggested that Mrs Brothers was herself convinced of a connection between his presence at the tests and the cancer was the sentence in her letter (see paragraph 665) commencing with the words “I have always believed”.  Those words were, of course, used nearly two years after her husband had died and at a time when she had taken some preliminary steps to start investigating.  She says that she was over-emphasising the strength of her feeling to ensure that the recipients of the letters took notice.  I am inclined to accept that.  There is really no material prior to that letter that suggests that she had formed any such clear and unambiguous belief before his death.  It may be that the </p>

I will return to this in the context of what I can and cannot accept about the issue of knowledge in his case.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Gibson argues that much of what Mr McGinley said in those earlier days demonstrates that he had crossed the threshold from ignorance or mere suspicion to “knowledge” for the purposes of the Limitation Act.  I will deal with that issue shortly, but there is, to my mind, little doubt that he became convinced that the physical problems he faced from time to time were attributable to his time on Christmas Island.  As a result of that and his letter to <span style="font-style:italic">The Daily Record</span> he became something of a figurehead for those of a like mind.   Mr Gibson paid him the compliment of being the “admirable [and] tireless driving force” for the campaign over many years.  Whether Mr McGinley sought that position or whether events conspired to thrust it upon him probably matters little.  If his legacy is that he helped highlight a genuine concern for a large number of people he will, I believe, have felt that his efforts will not have been in vain whether or not those concerns prove ultimately to have been well-founded.  </p>

I do not propose to extend this part of the judgment by repeating events that are recorded in the section of the judgment that deals with the BNTVA (see paragraphs 255-325 above).  I am sure Mr McGinley would not contest the proposition that he was probably better placed than anyone in the UK between 1982 and 2000 (when he ceased to play an active role within the BNTVA) to have an appreciation of the current state of the learning available in relation to the issues that the veterans were raising.  However, he would, I am sure, also be the first to accept that he started life as a Sapper with the Royal Engineers and that his appreciation of the nuances of scientific thought and legal reasoning were no greater than anyone else from such a background.  He was obviously good at articulating things in a speech and in an interview and had a presence that commanded people’s attention.  But in terms of his own true understanding of the issues he was heavily reliant on the advice and guidance of others. </p>

I say this because the Defendant’s case, as presented in written form, is that the “evidence that the Claimant had actual knowledge of attributability from 1982 at the latest is overwhelming”, the attributability presumably relating to all illnesses and conditions of which he had by then complained and of which he had entertained the suspicion that they might have been caused by his time on Christmas Island.

The truth, it seems to me, is that, as with others, at that time and for a while thereafter he did think that there may have been a connection between his problems and the tests, but at that stage it could be no more than an unsupported suspicion.  Mr McGinley would have been aware of what experts who were supportive of the Government’s position were saying.  Dr Hugh Evans, a radiation protection officer from Imperial College, London (not Professor H John Evans), who was also interviewed in the Nationwide programme, said the radiation levels at the tests “were extremely low” and “[so] much less than they receive in everyday life from actual sources that I don’t think you could consider it.”  He went on to say even if he was “working very hard for [the veterans he] would find it very difficult to justify radiation as any cause for their illnesses.” </p>

The difficulty with suggesting that this is new scientific evidence, as I see it, is that if this was regarded as “significant” by Mr McGinley (which, it is plain, he did as would any reasonable man) the attribution to the tests was plainly made earlier and indeed it has long been established that exposure to radiation can cause sterility or infertility: see, eg, Mr Edson’s paper referred to in paragraphs 163-164 above.  In the Nationwide programme in which Mr McGinley himself participated in December 1982 the following was said by Richard Kershaw:  “If radioactive fall-out is suffered in very strong doses it can cause death; exposure to small amounts can still cause dreadful effects, <span style="text-decoration:underline">sterility</span>, leukaemia, lymphatic cancers, and certain genetic disorders.”  (My emphasis). </p>

He was not asked about this, but it seems a reasonable inference to draw.  But if I have to ask myself whether at some stage prior to December 2001 he either had actual knowledge or, on the basis of advice he might reasonably have obtained, constructive knowledge that his infertility could be attributed to exposure to radiation exposure as a result of being at the tests, the answer has to be ‘yes’.   </p>

By then a “head of steam” had been created in relation to the general attributability of health problems for veterans to their presence at the tests. (I should say that I do not attach any significance to the War Pension application he made on 30 November 1984 for this purpose for reasons given elsewhere: see paragraph 525)  Because of the lack of evidence of exposure during the tests to ionising radiation above background levels, it would never have been possible to prove the case, but that is not the conventional test for knowledge within the Limitation Act (see section 16 of this judgment). </p>

I say this because, although the mechanism by which infertility is caused by ionising radiation has not been articulated clearly in the evidence before me, Professor Parker appears to support the link on the basis of it being one of a number of “bystander effects” of low level ionising radiation. Credible evidence that those present at Christmas Island may have been so exposed did not become available until the Rowland Report. </p>

He was, of course, in his early 20s when he was there.  His seminal analysis was performed in 1976 when he was 38 and it may be difficult for him to prove that what was demonstrated was anything more than a consequence of being older.  Whether that was a reason for him not being picked as a test case for the BNTVA I do not know, but it is an issue he may have to face. </p>

In this case (as in Mrs Brother’s case) the Claimants’ legal team have adopted a realistic or pragmatic view of the authorities to the effect that going to a solicitor is sufficient evidence of “knowledge”.   It does, however, have to be observed that Judge LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Sniezek</span> (see paragraphs 505-508) noted that “significantly” Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR had <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> said in <span style="font-style:italic">Halford v Brookes</span> [1991] 1 WLR 428 that “seeking advice from a solicitor was conclusive, nor that, on its own, it should be treated as representing a sufficient preliminary to the issue of a writ so as to lead to the inescapable inference of the requisite degree of knowledge.”  That view does have to be contrasted with the view of Simon Brown LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Sniezek </span>when he said that he found it “difficult indeed to imagine a case where, having consulted a solicitor with a view to making a claim for compensation, a claimant could still then be held lacking in the requisite knowledge.” </p>

There is a short note in the medical records on the day of the diagnosis indicating that he told the doctors that he had been on Christmas Island in 1957/58 and was “unprotected” during the testing.  A few weeks later, on 7 March 1991, he dictated his recollections to his daughter which she typed up and he then signed.  Making the statement coincided with Mr Clark becoming interested (for the first time) in the activities of the BNTVA and in what that Association had been doing and in the information it could give.  Mr McGinley (whose book “No Risk Involved” had been published only a matter of a month or so before this) had written a letter to him dated 6 March 1991.  It is not clear whether it was Mr McGinley’s letter that prompted the making of the statement, but it matters little.  The purpose of making a statement, Mrs Clark told me, was so that everything could be put down “for future reference, in case it was needed for a case like this.” </p>

He said that whilst he was told by an officer that the detonations would be “at least 15 miles away”, it was “more like 1½ miles away.”  (Whilst, as I have said repeatedly, it is not for me to arrive at any conclusion on the factual issues that would fall to be considered at a full trial, in fairness to the Defendant I think I should say clearly that, as I understand it, there is no serious suggestion made on behalf of the Claimants that any ground-based veterans were that close to any of the points of detonation:  see paragraphs 129-130.) </p>

However, it seems to me that Mr Clark had reached a state of mind fairly soon after the diagnosis of his cancer that the cancer was “capable of being attributed to” ionising radiation to which he was exposed at Christmas Island.  He would have been “barking up the wrong tree” if he believed that this was attributable to prompt radiation, but I am not persuaded that I am able to adopt an approach that discriminates between the two sources of ionising radiation for the purposes of the “knowledge” issue (see paragraph 521).  Accordingly, whilst Mr Clark (perfectly understandably, given the serious terminal illness from which he was suffering) did nothing to advance any claim for compensation prior to his death, if he had done so he would have been affected by a limitation period having commenced from about April 1991.  The limitation period had not expired by the date of his death, but the conclusion I have been forced to come to is that he did possess relevant knowledge by about the date I have indicated.  His state of mind was, perhaps, not quite as strongly positive as that of Mr Sniezek in his claim (see paragraph 506), but sufficiently close for it not to make any difference to the conclusion to which I must come. </p>

It is <span style="text-decoration:underline">her</span> state of mind that now becomes relevant.  She was doubtless very preoccupied with her husband’s illness and, whilst aware of his contacts with the BNTVA, was almost certainly less concerned about that than about him.  She does remember being told by the BNTVA representative who came to see them that the BNTVA did not think that there was enough evidence to take proceedings for compensation at the time.  They were encouraged, consistent with the BNTVA policy at the time, to apply for a pension.  I think that her state of mind at the time, bearing in mind the circumstances in which she found herself having to think of these matters, was one of uncertainty, whatever strength of conviction her husband may have had about the matter.  Her uncertainty would have been confirmed by the response from the AWE to her husband’s application for a pension.

The recent (1988) Report by the National Radiological Protection Board, “Mortality and Cancer Incidence in UK Participants in the UK Atmospheric Nuclear Tests and Experimental Programmes” (NRPB – R214), shows that for participants, each of total mortality, total cancer mortality and incidence, solid controls, is less than the National average for a comparable set of adult males in England and Wales, and that for other cancers does not sensibly differ from that National average; there is no shortening of life expectancy.  It showed that there was no correlation between radiation exposure and cancer mortality and incidence, nor indeed other causes of death. </p>

Accordingly, one would need to look for subsequent events that translated her from that state of mind to that of someone who had crossed the threshold into the arena of “knowledge” for the purposes of the Limitation Act.  Although she continued some loose contact with the BNTVA after her husband’s death (and indeed, on their advice, made an unsuccessful application for a widow’s pension, the application being rejected in November 1992), nothing very material occurred thereafter to change her state of mind. </p>

Mr Clark was at GRAPPLE Y and Z.  He did apply for a War Pension in 1991 and it was rejected (see paragraph 733).  In other words, the opportunity was taken by someone who knew the position from the Defendant’s point of view very well (Mr Saxby) and the view on the issue of exposure was articulated clearly.  In one sense, all the material needed to defend Mr Clark’s claim in relation to exposure exists already, has been committed to writing and can be deployed in this action.  To the extent that wider issues are, or may be, relied upon at trial, the very substantial contemporaneous documentation about the tests in which Mr Clark played a part are available.  For reasons I have given already, since the burden of proof would be on Mrs Clark in her late husband’s case and bearing in mind the existence of that documentation, I cannot see why the Defendant is so significantly prejudiced in meeting the claim notwithstanding a delay on this basis of some 13 years.   </p>

The most serious condition (which is the condition from which he died and which had not, of course emerged by the time of his representations in the 80s and 90s) is not in fact supported by Professor Mothersill as something that can be linked to exposure to ionising radiation, although Professor Parker’s report contains the makings of a case in this regard.

Whilst I have hesitated before deciding to reject that conclusion because I am mindful of the apparent belief that Mr Dickson had in the cause of his problems, I do not think I can accept that, applying an eventual objective test to the issue of knowledge, he can be said to have acquired knowledge of the attributability of those earlier problems to exposure to ionising radiation at Christmas Island.</p>

He sought advice from solicitors in 1991 concerning his expulsion from the BNTVA, from other solicitors in the same year to investigate a potential claim arising from the use of benzodiazepines, from other solicitors in 2002 in relation to his War Pension application and from yet another firm of solicitors in 2003 about a possible claim arising from exposure to asbestos. The Claimants’ team submit that he was probably not able to find a solicitor willing to take on his case for radiation exposure, rather than that his simply failing to make any effort to obtain such advice.  That is one possibility, though Mrs Dickson was not asked about any attempts he may have made to engage solicitors on this matter.  The other is that he knew, whatever he may have been saying in his letters and publicly, that there was no reasonable prospect of attributing his various conditions to ionising radiation.  He may, of course, have been keeping an eye on what the BNTVA was doing even though he was no longer a member. </p>

His evidence was to the effect that he accepted this, but when he started reading in the press about questions arising in connection with the effect on health of the tests he started wondering whether there may be some connection between lipomas and the tests.

I have to say that, if there are difficulties in responding to Mr Hart’s case (which I doubt), those difficulties were probably in existence in the early 1990s in any event.  It is true that some of the witnesses would then have been available, but a trial would have been taking place 40 years or so after the material events.  Everyone would have been looking to the contemporaneous documentation which, as I have indicated, is voluminous.  I cannot see that it is any less easy to consider Mr Hart’s allegations now than it would have been then.  The MOSAIC operation was considered by the Australian Royal Commission and two of the most senior people involved in its planning gave evidence (see paragraph 596).  If what Mr Robin Auld QC, who was acting as the advocate for the Ministry of Defence, said then (see paragraph 334) represented the reality, the prejudice had already occurred.  On the other hand, the assertion was not, of course, tested in the way that it could have been had the limitation point been taken in <span style="font-style:italic">Pearce</span> (see paragraph 335) and so it does remain simply an assertion on behalf of the Defendant. </p>

I make no comment about whether his memory is unclear on the matters of importance, but if it is it is something that may operate in the Defendant’s favour by making his claim difficult to prove (in contradistinction to being difficult to try).

I do not understand why someone could not ingest or inhale radioactive material during a limited period of 7 days.  I make no conclusion about that, of course, and Mr Noone may face other difficulties in establishing his case (see paragraph 810), but this particular point made by the Defendant does not seem an obviously strong one. </p>

(I propose to focus on the skin complaint even though I do not think he abandoned his other health problems for the purposes of these proceedings.)  Whilst the true position may have been that he did not have a total conviction based upon solid grounds that this was so, there came a time relatively early on when he thought there was a real possibility of a connection.  Unlike Mr Dickson’s case, notwithstanding what he (Mr Noone) was being told by the doctors he consulted, there <span style="text-decoration:underline">was</span> a known connection between skin complaints and exposure to radiation.

I make no comment, of course, on the rights and wrongs of that viewpoint, but it makes for difficulty in separating out from expressions used those that reflected a genuine belief in an issue concerning his health and those that represented something of a polemical nature.  At all events, on 21 February 1986 he told a GP that he has suffered from “multiple sebaceous cysts ? from radiation damage” and on 5 March that year he told his new GP that he suffered “radiation blisters after return from Christmas Island”.  If I give some benefit of doubt about the extent prior to then of his true conviction about the attributability of his skin complaints to his presence at the tests, it seems to me that by then at the latest he must be treated as having acquired “knowledge” within the <span style="font-style:italic">Sniezek</span> approach (see paragraphs 505-508) to the issue. </p>

He was also diagnosed with colon cancer in 1994 and the Defendant submits that he had the requisite knowledge in respect of his colon cancer (as well as his meningioma) in or before April 2001 which was over three years before his death in August 2004.  It is submitted on his estate’s behalf that he did not have relevant knowledge at the date of death, but if he moved from suspicion to knowledge when he dictated the written statement in 2003 to which I will refer below, then that itself would be within three years of the death. </p>

He contacted Mr Ian Greenhalgh, a solicitor who was helping the BNTVA with the pension applications.  It appears that Mr Greenhalgh helped with the preparation of the application for the pension and then the preparation of the appeal following the rejection of the application.

The real issue seems to me to be reduced to the question of whether there is a reasonable prospect of a fair trial of the factual issues underlying the GRAPPLE Z tests.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">There is an additional factor in Mr Ogden’s case that needs to be taken into account.  He applied for a War Pension in 1986 (see paragraph 817) which had the effect of drawing his case to the attention of the Defendant.  There is a letter from the DHSS to AWRE dated 5 August 1986 in which AWRE’s attention is drawn to the fact that he was claiming that his problems at the time were due to exposure to radiation on Christmas Island between July and October 1958.  There was no difficulty in responding to his application then, nor to a subsequent application for a review in 2001.  A point made by the Defendant, however, is that it would not now be possible, given Mr Ogden’s death, for him to give the particulars said to be necessary for an understanding of how close he was to “contaminated aircraft”.  I have no way at this stage of being able to judge whether nearness to “contaminated aircraft” is central to the claim to be advanced on Mr Ogden’s behalf other than to say that, whilst its relevance can readily be identified, it is not the sole means by which it will be argued that he may have been exposed to ionising radiation.  However, my observation is that, if the point is an important one, it merely reinforces the proposition that the Defendant’s position in this litigation is not prejudiced given where the burden of proof lies. </p>

He says, and I have no reason to doubt it, that the first time it crossed his mind that his various health problems might have been related to his time on Christmas Island was when Losena Salabula, a lawyer associated with the PCRC and Ian Anderson (the lawyer who helped Mr McGinley with his application to the European Commission of Human Rights:  see paragraph 694) contacted him although he never actually met Mr. Anderson.

The diagnosis of one of those who has seen him in the past has been recognised to have been erroneous and some of the more diffuse symptoms of which he has complained (including tiredness and lethargy), whilst capable of being attributed to the effects of ionising radiation, could readily be attributed to other causes.  Whilst, as with all cases, I have not been disposed to characterise his causation case as “doomed to fail”, as thing stands it may present some difficulties.  However, as I observed in other cases, that may present a difficulty to Mr Rokoratu – it may not operate as a prejudicial factor so far as the Defendant is concerned.  I would not conclude that this factor outweighs the more “generic” factors referred to in paragraphs 572-625 above and, on balance, I would have been in favour of exercising the section 33 discretion to permit the claim to proceed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">The precise date is unclear, but it appears that Mr Sinfield was diagnosed with anaemia in 1973.  This came to light because he was rejected as a blood donor on several occasions because of low levels of haemoglobin.  Although Mr Gibson sought valiantly to suggest to Mrs Sinfield that she and her late husband had attributed the anaemia to his presence at the tests, there really was no true foundation for the suggestion.  She said, and there is no reason to doubt it, that her husband was generally very well.  It would seem that the anaemia was not something he regarded as significant and, I might add, I am not at all sure that a reasonable person who had attributed it to the tests would have seen it as worth pursuing in litigation against a compliant defendant.  The only occasion prior to 2004 when there was a reference to Christmas Island and his anaemia was in a GP’s note in 1992 when Mr Sinfield went to the first “well-man clinic” with a new GP.  The note read “anaemia in the past – unable to get any blood.  Rev[iew] if symptoms occur…1958 – 59 worked on Christmas Island for a year”.  I do not think that any reasonable construction of that note connotes a connection being made by Mr Sinfield or by his GP between his past anaemia and his presence at the tests.  It was merely a narrative history. </p>

However, in terms of apparent strength of this claim, on the evidence as it stands, it seems to me to be arguable, but not overwhelmingly so. Professor Mothersill says that “exposure to ionising radiation materially increased the risk that Mr Sinfield would develop … non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma” and Professor Parker, by reference to UNSCEAR 2006, says that whilst the relation between “lung cancer and ionising radiation is established … that with non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma is more equivocal.”  It does need to be recalled that one of the conditions at the forefront of the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Hope &amp; Reay v British Nuclear Fuels Limited</span> (see paragraph 295 above) was non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma.  That case was, of course, decided on the basis of scientific and medical evidence that must now be at least 15 years out of date. </p>

If it does, and the cases proceed to trial, I am anxious that this judgment is not portrayed in a way that creates a false dawn.  I have merely decided, in effect, that the Limitation Act should not operate as an obstacle to the case proceeding.  As I said at the outset of this judgment (see paragraph 6), my task has necessarily involved making some assumptions that may, in due course, prove to have been unfounded when all the material is analysed at a full trial.  Equally, there are some areas where it has been necessary to express a tentative view on the merits of certain arguments.  I have concluded, for example, on the basis of the material before me that the Defendant faces a case to answer on the issue of monitoring and the validity of the records of exposure to ionising radiation upon which reliance has been, and is being, placed.  Even if those records are shown ultimately to have been less accurate than claimed, everything that happened at the time of the tests will have to be judged by the standards of the day for the purpose of deciding whether, in the context of the law of negligence, there was a breach of duty.  Furthermore, whilst I have not considered it appropriate to strike out any of the causation claims on the basis that they are “doomed to fail”, I have had to express some reservations about the strength of certain of the claims.  In the very broadest sense, on the basis of the material as it stands, those conditions or illnesses (particularly those of an identifiable cancerous nature) that can be attributed to chromosomal translocations or other chromosomal changes will probably have a better prospect of succeeding on the issue of causation than claims based upon a collection of diffuse symptoms with no such association. </p>

However, having “lived with” the issues in this case for a number of months, and having some personal experience as a mediator before my appointment as a judge, I hope I may be permitted to offer this comment.  Plainly, as a pure piece of personal injury litigation, there are strengths and weaknesses on each side and areas where there are significant risks and areas where the risks are less.  With the experienced teams on each side, I am quite sure that that litigation landscape has already been identified.  Against that background, thoughts will (or certainly ought to) turn to settlement.  Bearing in mind that most living Claimants are in their 70s, the sooner that the issue is addressed, the better – consistent, of course, with the parties being properly in a position to discuss matters. </p>

Some “thinking outside the box” may be required with a flexibility of approach that is not always available when addressing a case purely on the basis of deciding how much an individual Claimant is entitled to or ought sensibly to accept in settlement.  Mediation may be the way forward and I commend it to the parties.  The Government is, of course, pledged to settle legal cases by alternative dispute resolution in all suitable cases whenever the other party agrees to it.  In my view, this is such a case. </p>

I am pleased to report that the BNTVA have agreed to help identify a representative sample of veterans and their descendents with a view to conducting an assessment of their health needs. I therefore announce today an intention that the Ministry of Defence will work with veterans and experts to finalise the details of research to investigate the particular health needs of nuclear test veterans and their offspring with a view to identifying priorities and taking action to improve health. I also intend some follow–up to last year’s New Zealand chromosome study. The aim will be for projects to be of practical relevance to veterans with results delivered to a reasonable time scale. The work will be tendered in the normal manner and should be underway before the end of this year. A working group including representatives from the BNTVA will be established to take these projects forward. </p>

Formal and well-documented procedures were in place to ensure the health and safety of those participating in the tests.  Personnel Safety Plans were prepared and used for each operation and environmental monitoring was undertaken. Personal monitoring and protective clothing was used where appropriate for each trial.  The effectiveness of these procedures is demonstrated by the fact that the majority of participants received little or no additional radiation exposure as a result of participation. </span>

The latest Report NRPB-W27 entitled “Mortality and Cancer Incidence 1952-1998 in UK Participants in the UK Atmospheric Nuclear Weapons Tests and Experimental Programmes” published in 2003 concluded that overall levels of mortality and cancer incidence in the nuclear weapons test participants have continued to be similar to those in a matched control group, and for overall mortality to be lower than expected from national rates. Cancer is the predominant marker of ill health caused by exposure to ionising radiation. The one exception is the suggestion especially in the first study that leukaemias, other than chronic lymphatic, are more common in participants in the first twenty five years after participation.  </span>
