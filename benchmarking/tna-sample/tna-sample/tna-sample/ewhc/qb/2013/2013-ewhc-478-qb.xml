	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Claimant (“IG Index”) is a well known company which specialises among other things in spread betting transactions. The First Defendant (“Mr Colley”) was at all material times employed by IG Index as a senior shares dealer. The Second to Sixteenth Defendants were clients of IG Index who entered into various spread betting transactions with it. In this claim it is alleged that over a considerable period of time between September 2005 and September 2008 Mr Colley perpetrated a fraud against IG Index in concert with the other Defendants, in some cases through their agents. The purpose and effect of the fraud was to enable the other Defendants to place spread bets with IG Index at artificially low and thus false prices resulting in artificially high profits or low losses. The means used was the systematic fraudulent manipulation by Mr Colley of the trading prices offered by IG Index on certain US stocks, to which, as a senior trusted shares dealer he had access, by the insertion of false dividends which had not been announced and were not expected to be paid, the subsequent placing by the other Defendants of spread bets at prices which, by reason of the insertion of the false dividends, did not reflect the market prices, the retention of the false dividends in the IG Index price long enough to evade detection of the fraud by the two checks made which compared the IG Index price with the contract price, and the subsequent removal of the false dividends to enable the other Defendants to close the bets with the benefit of the true market price of the stocks.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As against Mr Colley, it is alleged that he occupied a position of trust and acted fraudulently and in breach of a fiduciary duty owed by him to IG Index as a senior employee to act honestly and in its best interests. As against the other Defendants it is alleged that they traded fraudulently at the false price and profited from the fraudulent activity of Mr Colley in respect of which they were acting in concert with Mr Colley of which they were aware and in which they willingly participated. It is further alleged that the sums by which they profited by the fraud were sums diverted from IG Index by reason of Mr Colley’s breach of fiduciary or other duty owed by him to IG Index, and that the other Defendants were knowing recipients of such sums. One of the matters said to give rise to the inference that the client Defendants and Mr Colley were acting in concert was that Mr Colley could not otherwise profit from his fraudulent activity. In an interlocutory judgment. I held that amounted to an allegation that the profits made by the client Defendant would redound to Mr Colley’s advantage.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As appears below, there was dispute between IG Index and some of the client Defendants as to what was the nature of the causes of action relied on against them, and whether they were good in law. In the Amended Particulars of Claim it is alleged that, as a result of the matters pleaded, IG Index has suffered loss and damage and IG Index claims against Mr Colley the sum of £1,242,190.43, said to be the total amount of money by which the other Defendants profited by reason of the fraudulent transactions. As against each of the other Defendants, IG Index claims the amount by which it is alleged that he or she profited and IG Index suffered loss by reason of the fraudulent transactions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As against the client Defendants IG Index also have a claim in contract based on a term of the Spread Betting Customer Agreement by which it is alleged they had agreed to be bound. IG Index allege that under that term it had the right, either to void from the outset or to amend the terms of any bet containing or based upon a Manifest Error. A Manifest Error was defined as “any error that we believe to be obvious or palpable. In deciding whether an error is a Manifest Error we may take into account any relevant information including the state of the Underlying Market at the time of the error or any mistake in, or lack of clarity of, any information source or pronouncement upon which we based our quoted prices.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Where the opening level of the relevant bets was based upon an anticipated dividend, when no such dividend was in fact anticipated, it is alleged that the bets were based upon a Manifest Error. IG Index had decided that each of the relevant bets was based upon a Manifest Error. It is therefore alleged that it was entitled to, and has amended, the opening level of each relevant bet to that which would have been the correct opening level had the false dividend not been fraudulently entered by the First Defendant.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">Spread betting is not so much or not merely a bet, although it can be described as such, as a form of contract for differences. It enables a customer to take a position on a market (or an event) for a very small stake. Thus if the Dow Jones Index is, say, at 10,000, one can "buy" or "sell" the market at a spread around the index of, for the sake of example, 10 points either way, 9,990 to 10,010. If one buys, one is betting that the market will rise above 10,010. If one sells, one is betting that the market will fall below 9,990. If one buys and the market rises, one stands to gain £1 for every point that the index exceeds 10,010. If one sells and the market falls, one stands to gain £1 for every point that the index drops below 9,990. If, however, one calls the market wrong, then one will stand to lose £1 for every point that the index exceeds the spread point in the wrong direction. Thus if one sells at 10,000 with a sell spread point at 9,990, one will make £1 for every point the market falls below 9,990 and lose £1 for every point the market rises above 9,990. Until the bet or "trade" is closed, the gains and losses are merely "running" gains or losses. They are real enough, but constantly changing with every change in the index, and have not yet been fixed. Closing the bet will fix the position, win or lose. Unlike a classic bet, the customer can of course lose more than his stake. Indeed, on the example given, of a sale spread point of 9,990 when the market is at 10,000, if the market does not move an inch, the customer will lose £10 for every £1 staked. Nor, again unlike a classic bet, are his winnings fixed at the outset by an agreement on odds. In theory winnings based on rising markets are infinite (in practice of course they are not) and losses based on falling markets are limited only in so far as they cannot exceed the consequences of a fall in the index to zero.</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">Normally, of course, to gain by £1 for every rise (or fall) of a single point in a stock market index such as the Dow Jones would take an investment of significantly more than £1. In effect, one's £1 bet commands a position in the market significantly greater than the stake. In other words, there is a large element of gearing in the trade, and the situation is correspondingly volatile. Where the market in question is itself in a volatile phase, the risks become even greater. Thus, if the Dow Jones is capable of moving within a range of 100 or 200 points in a single day, the customer can be £100 to £200 richer or poorer per £1 stake within a matter of hours of his trade. On a trade of £100, those figures become £10,000 to £20,000.”<br/></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“The Claimant offers spread bets on, inter alia, the future price of individual US quoted stocks. As an example the Claimant might offer the quoted September 2009 price of “US Inc” as being 99-101 cents.  The difference between 99 and 101 is the “spread”. If a client considered that the quoted price of US Inc would rise the client would “buy” at 101 cents for a stake of e.g. £5 per point (cent). If a client considered that the quoted price of US Inc would fall the client would “sell” at  99 cents for a stake of e.g. £5 per point (cent).</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">The client is free to close out his bet at any time before the relevant settlement date. Thus, in the example above the client may have placed his “buy” bet on the 1st June 2009. If, by 1st August 2009 the underlying quoted price of US Inc has increased, then the offer for the September price will increase accordingly. Thus the price offered by IG on the 1st August 2009 for the September 2009 price may now be, e.g. 109 – 111 cents. The client can choose to close out his bet by “selling” at 109 for the same stake i.e. £5 per point. This would lock in a profit of £40 (8 point increase x £5). Conversely if the price offered on the 1st August 2009 had fallen to 89-91 the client may choose to crystallise his losses by selling at 89 for the same stake. This would lock in a loss of £60 (12 point fall x £5).</p>

However it was asserted that that position was unaffected by the insertion and removal of the false dividend (unless, it was explained at trial, the client traded). That is because the dividend would not expire on that day.</p>

However it was alleged that in both cases the client closed out after the false dividend had been both inserted and removed so that neither of them saw any realised profit or loss as a result of the manipulation. The inference, as I understood it, was that there was a risk that the clients could have been alerted to the entry and removal of a false dividend if they had checked their running profit and loss between the date of entry and removal of the false dividend but that in the event they did not notice it, presumably because they did not check their running profit and loss between those dates.</p>

IG Index’s response was that it did not know the precise details of how the Defendants operated the fraud between themselves and in particular the precise details of when or how any agreement was reached between Mr Colley and the customer Defendant or the precise details of such agreement. It was alleged that in each case Mr Colley would input a false dividend so causing the quoted price of stock to fall and that subsequently the relevant customer Defendant would purchase the stock concerned. It was said to be an irresistible inference from all of the pleaded circumstances that the relevant customer Defendant was acting in concert with Mr Colley and that both were participants in the fraud. In my judgment that amounted to an allegation first Mr Colley’s insertion of false dividends and the subsequent placing by the client Defendants of bets at the reduced prices were fraudulent acts done pursuant to an agreement between them.</p>

The first and less accurate was to check the morning reports which contained a view of all open client and broker positions in all instruments offered by IG Index. It was correct as at a time on the previous night and could thus be out of date once live trading in the instruments in question started. The second was a real time database search called TCL, where queries were retuned either on screen or via an output to Excel to find out the number of IG Index’s existing open client positions in a single US stock, which should take no more that 30 seconds and would be correct as of the point of output. Almost every IG Index employee had access to TCL so that as of September 2005 there would have been well over one hundred employees in a position to check that no IG Index customer had a position in a particular stock.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the allegation that individual trades were not large enough for various people to see a need to investigate the profit and loss on the stock, it was said that the financial dealing director, shares dealing director, head of equity trading and previous financial dealing director had discretion as to the criteria used in deciding whether to investigate a particular trade. IG Index takes exposure to risk on every product it offers.  On any particular day there will be a profit or loss due to a combination of dealing spread or commission and market movement on the stock in question. The individual stocks to be investigated would typically be those which provided the biggest swing on profit or loss. IG Index offers dealing in over 7000 stocks and the largest profits  or losses tend to come from those which have seen extreme volatility and/or a disproportionate volume of dealing from clients. A very general rule of thumb on US shares was that profits or losses of about £10,000 or more would require investigation. As to the Risk department it would review the P/L on new trades and the variants in the dealt price to the close of business price, starting with the largest P/L on the day and stock with approximately 15% variants. They would also review the system generated P/L to the calculated P/L, starting with the largest and with variants to actual or approximately £2,000-£3,000.  It was alleged that Mr Colley knew the criteria adopted by each of the individuals to determine whether there was a need to investigate the profit and loss of a particular stock. He was a trusted and experienced dealer with over nine years of experience at IG Index. Reconciling profit and loss was a skill which he would have been told about very early in his IG Index career and he would not have been asked and allowed to do it if he was not capable of so doing. His ability to reconcile any P/L was specifically mentioned in his annual appraisal in 2003.</p>

If a dividend discrepancy between the prediction and the announced amount (or Ex-Date) was not considered to be significant in comparison to the price of this stock then the change would be made to the system settings and no positions would be adjusted. If the change resulted in a large change in the futures valuation price or a significant P/L swing for or against a client then it would adjust the opening level of the bet to account for the change in the dividend prediction. The decision whether or not to adjust positions was down to dealer discretion.</p>

Second in respect of each of Mr Slaney, Mr Teller and Tom Benn whenever he placed one of the allegedly fraudulent trades no other person placed a trade.

The second matter was an allegation that in relation to Mr Regan, Mr Slaney, Mr Teller and Tom Benn, on the 369 occasions in the case of Mr Regan and Mr Slaney, the 284 occasions in the case of Mr Teller and the 340 occasions in the case of Tom Benn when other customer Defendants (or the three other alleged fraudulent accomplices whom IG Index chose not to sue) placed bets following the sharp drop in price on a stock caused by the insertion of a false dividend, they did not do so. The inference as I understood it sought to be drawn from this allegation was that there could be no innocent explanation for the allegedly fraudulent bets which these three Defendants did place based on them having alighted upon the particular trades because they noticed the sudden drop in the price because if they had been so alert they would have spotted the sudden drop in price in relation to the other stocks on which the other co-Defendants traded.</p>

They were that although the bank statements had been disclosed quite some time earlier the client Defendants had not been aware that it was intended to put to them that the inferences to be drawn from the particular cash withdrawals sought to be relied on by IG Index and their connection with the receipts from IG Index was that those monies or most of them were paid to Mr Colley. Two of the client Defendants indicated to me that in responding to those allegations if they were allowed to be relied on by IG Index they would wish an opportunity to respond by evidence in at least two ways. First by reference to bank statements for periods between the opening of their accounts which I understood in some cases went bank to 2003 and the beginning of the allegedly fraudulent transactions which began in most cases in 2005 for the purpose of showing that other cash withdrawals were made which could not have been connected with the alleged fraud, and second for the purpose of adducing evidence as to what the cash withdrawals that were made during the allegedly fraudulent transactions were in fact spent on. An example given was expenditure on building works for which invoices and evidence from a relevant builder might be forthcoming.

Mr Regan did not wish his employer to know that these allegations had been made against him on the basis that they were not true and that even if he were to win at trial the fact of the allegations having been made against him would be unhelpful. Mr Slaney, who was not represented, indicated that it would be difficult to know when he could take further time off as holiday if there were to be an adjournment since the fire brigade has a system requiring applications for holiday to be made. They did not think it likely that they would be able to get the relevant material in time to enable them to rely on it and adduce it if the case were to proceed.

Initially Mr Mayall submitted that it was IG Index’s case that it was only the money coming from the bank that was said to give rise to an inference that that money was going to Mr Colley because the contrast was made between that on the one hand and the money withdrawn from the cash dispensers on the other which it was said it was to be inferred were used for his own personal expenses. However later in the argument Mr Mayall changed his submission and said that he wished to rely on a submission that the money withdrawn from the ATMs as well as the money withdrawn from the banks went to Mr Colley. That seemed to me to flag up the fact that even at that stage no clear case had been formulated by IG Index as to what inferences it was seeking to argue could be derived from those payments.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I gave careful consideration to whether it would be possible for IG Index to rely on the particular payments now sought to be relied on and the inference sought to be drawn form them without unfair prejudice to the Defendants by the Defendants seeking to gather material that they would wish by way of rebuttal by the end of the trial. That however was for the reasons given not realistic in my view. The choice therefore was between giving IG Index permission to rely on this material without the Defendants having a reasonable opportunity to gather evidence in rebuttal or to adjourn the trial or to refuse permission to amend. The first option would in my judgement have been unfair not least in circumstances where it was entirely IG Index’s fault that the proposed allegations had not been pleaded before or flagged up in some other way. In other circumstances there might have been strong arguments that the appropriate course would have been to adjourn the trial on terms that IG Index should pay the costs of the adjournment. However that would not in my view have been just or consistent with the overriding objective. These were serious allegations which had been hanging over the Defendants for a long time. They had come to court to meet the allegations and any adjournment would probably have had to be for some considerable period of time given the difficulties of two of the Defendants to which I have referred and that would have been unfair not least on the other Defendants against whom the proposed amendments were not sought to be made. The option of a short adjournment was in my view too uncertain having regard to the difficulties to which I have referred which Mr Regan and Mr Slaney were likely to encounter. In those circumstances in my judgment the only fair course was to refuse permission in respect of the bank statement amendments.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However as I pointed out in the ex tempore interlocutory judgment which I gave it remained the case that a central part of IG Index’s pleaded case against the Second to Fifteenth Defendants was that the profit from the allegedly fraudulent bets would be credited to the account of the particular client Defendant who placed it, that Mr Colley could not profit from his fraudulent activity unless he was acting in concert with the particular Defendant who placed the bet and that it was an allegedly irresistible inference that the other Defendants were acting in concert with him. That as it seemed to me involved two propositions. First that, assuming that Mr Colley was acting fraudulently by inserting and removing false dividends, unless there was a fraudulent counterparty there would be no mechanism by which Mr Colley’s fraudulent  manipulation of the price offered by IG Index arising out of the manipulation could be given effect to. Second that because Mr Colley could not profit from the fraudulent activity unless he was acting in concert with a particular Defendant the inference was that in some way the profit made by the client Defendant was a matter which would redound to Mr Colley’s advantage. In effect it was an allegation that it was agreed that the client Defendant would make a payment or confer some other financial benefit on Mr Colley in return for being given the opportunity to benefit from his fraudulent insertion of false dividends.</p>

That would have involved detailed examination by them of the bets placed by other Defendants and a comparison with their own transaction history.</p>

Thus by way of example Mr Regan pleaded that he identified certain sectors of stocks when choosing which stocks to place bets on. If it were permitted to be pleaded against him that he did not bet on any of the 389 allegedly fraudulent transactions placed by other customer Defendants so as to undermine that defence and to suggest that his explanation for his selection of his allegedly fraudulent transactions, namely that he noticed the sudden downwards spike in IG Index’s price, or that he had done research on the stock, was implausible, he would be deprived of the opportunity of identifying particular reasons why he did not bet on other customer Defendants’ bets, such as that he did not like the particular stock on which the other Defendants placed bets or that there was some reason connected with the timing on which a particular stock was traded. It might have involved some very considerable analysis by him and/or his legal team to go through the 389 other trades for the purpose of preparing a defence. As with the cash payments, this was a matter which could have easily been identified by IG Index a long time before the trial and in sufficient time to enable the Defendants to respond. For the same reasons as in the case of the cash payment proposed allegations, I did not consider that it would be fair either to deprive the client Defendants of a reasonable opportunity of responding to these proposed new allegations or to adjourn the trial for what was likely to be a considerable period of time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Again it remained a central part of IG Index’s pleaded case that one of the matters giving rise to the inference that the 415 allegedly fraudulent transactions were indeed fraudulent was the fact that with a handful of exceptions the bets were in every case placed on stocks in which no innocent client had an open spread bet position. As I understood it this was relied on as giving rise to two inferences. First that Mr Colley deliberately chose stocks where his false insertion and subsequent removal of a false dividend so as to benefit his fraudulent counterparty would not be detected by any innocent client of IG Index who happened to have an open position on that stock and who might therefore notice an unexplained profit (or more likely loss) in their open position during the period between Mr Colley’s insertion and removal of the false dividend with a consequential risk of a query to IG Index and an investigation of why the price had moved. The second was that if it were proved that Mr Colley fraudulently inserted and removed false dividends on the 415 transactions, since there would be no point in the fraud from his point of view unless it led to at least one customer placing a bet between the insertion and removal of the false dividend and then closing down the bet, the inference in each case must be that the only customer who placed a bet after the false dividend was inserted and then closed it out after the false dividend was removed must have been acting in concert with Mr Colley.</p>

(Paragraph 15 (iii) of the Amended Particulars of Claim). It also remained part of the pleaded case that Mr Colley always used stocks with no other open positions to circumvent the second part of the check carried out each morning by a graduate trainee dealer which involved comparing the price traded by the client to other trades from other clients in that asset that day.</p>

Rather since seats on the dealing desk were not allocated whichever dealer on the early shift happened to be seated at the position on the dealing desk in front of the Bloomberg terminal would be responsible for updating dividend information that day.

He denied that in the context of the types of trades routinely undertaken by IG Index all of the allegedly fraudulent transactions were small and he denied that he frequently reconciled the profit and loss on the US stocks.

As to the allegation that even if the trades were investigated the investigating dealer would simply have deleted the dividend and phoned the client to tell them the opening level would be amended to which the other Defendant would clearly agree as they were complicit in the fraud, Mr Colley averred that the dealer would have been unlikely simply to have deleted a dividend without further investigation and would not in all cases have phoned the client to inform him of any change. In practice on many occasions clients were not informed of changes to opening positions if the dealer took the view that the client was unlikely himself to notice that change.</p>

Such negligence included failing properly to supervise the activities of its employee Mr Colley by putting in place such systems or taking such other steps as would have been prudent to detect and thereby stop any fraudulent activity at an early stage.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In a defence and counterclaim dated 1 December 2009 Mr Teller denied that he was a party to any fraud, that he fraudulently traded at false prices following the fraudulent entering by Mr Colley of false dividends on IG Index’s systems and that he acted in concert with Mr Colley. He denied that he was a knowing recipient of the profits of any fraud.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Teller pleaded a defence and counterclaim broadly similar to that of Mr Slaney based on allegations that if IG Index’s own case was true it was vicariously liable for the fraudulent actions of Mr Colley pursuant to Clause 27(2) of the Spread Betting Customer Agreement, and had vicarious liability for Mr Colley’s actions or was in breach of an implied term of the agreement to exercise reasonable skill and care in the provision of its contractual services to Mr Teller.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the Counterclaim Mr Teller alleged that the dividend deflation and changes alleged by IG Index were caused or permitted by its negligence or wilful default or fraud or breach of the implied term that it would exercise reasonable skill and care. He claimed to have suffered loss and damage in the amount of such sum as he would have received but for the dividend changes. He claimed such damages as will restore to him the sums which were debited to his account by IG Index after it amended the opening level of each of the bets placed by him to what IG Index contends would have been the correct level but for the allegedly false dividends. He averred that he acted at all material times in reliance on the truth of and accuracy of the information received from IG Index as to betting prices and as to the balance standing to his credit in his account with IG Index and changed his position as a consequence thereof by continuing to place further bets, calculating the risk by reference <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span> to the credit balance then stated to be due to him.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Colley was employed by IG Index from 1999 to Sept 2008 as a Shares Dealer. According to him his duties consisted of taking spread betting and CFD deals from clients including CFD advisory clients, hedging IG Index’s UK, European and US exposure by way of direct market access from a computer and telephone access via a broker and basic administration duties including setting up shares and adjusting dividends on IG Index’s Xcon system.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The evidence of the discovery by IG Index of suspicious trades was given by three witnesses from IG Index. Gary Tibbs was a Share Dealing Director who ran the shares dealing desk. Mr Tibbs’ boss was John Gordon, who was Shares Dealing Director and ran IG Index’s shares dealing desk. Mr Gordon’s boss was John Noble, who was a Dealing and Operations Director of IG Index. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Tibbs said that on 25 September 2008 he noticed that a client had opened a bet on a US stock and closed it within a very short time and had made a surprisingly good profit on it. Because the stock was a sensitive one he looked into the account and the transaction more closely. It appeared from external information that the price at which the client had dealt was wrong. He reported to Mr Noble that a client had been dealing on a very good price just before the US markets had closed and it was agreed that they would both look into the matter. He then discovered that the IG Index price had dropped between 10 and 5 minutes before 9:00 pm just before the US market closed. He became suspicious that the price had changed for no apparent reason, the client having dealt shortly thereafter. Discussing it further with Mr Noble it was agreed that one potential explanation was that a dividend had been entered. It was agreed that they would check if any changes had been made to Xcon, the programme used by IG Index to enter dividend prices into its pricing system since if a dividend was entered that could cause a spike in the price.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Noble’s initial thought was that Mr Tibbs had uncovered a systems error. However as they looked at the client’s account they saw that there had been other trades which were very similar and he could see a pattern to them. He considered that it was very unlikely that the same systems error would be made repeatedly on the same account and at that time became pretty positive that the matter was suspicious and fraudulent. It seemed to him clear that prices had been deliberately changed to allow that client to deal at favourable levels.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Noble sought to establish who had altered the prices. He asked enquiries to be made of two IT department developers as to whether it was possible to identify who had logged in to alter the prices in the IG Index systems.</p>

Mr Tibbs told him that he believed that he had discovered that the spread betting futures prices on two shares products, US companies called Sonosite Inc (Sono) and Scansource Inc (SCSC) had been altered by Mr Colley the previous evening for what he believed to be the benefit of Clients 3182 (David Abrahamovich) and R9476 (Neil Rowe) respectively.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">He said that during his investigation he had found that the person responsible for changing the prices was Mr Colley, that the method was the insertion of large dividend values in the amount of 400 cents into their calculation and that Mr Colley had made the changes at 20:49:43 hours and 20:50:20 hours respectively.  The only way a dividend could get into a published price was if someone manually typed it in and separately manually typed in a payment date known as “Ex” date, within a specific date range.  One of those pieces of information alone would not cause a dividend to affect a futures price.  They could be either manually typed into IG’s pricing system itself or they could be manually typed into the spreadsheet and the values could then be copied and pasted into IG’s pricing system.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Tibbs could think of no logical explanation as to why someone would make such a change unintentionally in view of the fact that neither of the affected stocks had any previous history of ever paying a dividend to shareholders and had made no announcements that they would do so.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Tibbs had also discovered that clients had dealt on the amended prices very soon after the changes at 20:53:12 hours 20:56:43 hours respectively and told Mr Gordon that he was suspicious that Mr Colley had inserted the dividends into IG Index’s dealing prices specifically to reduce their value and make them cheaper for the benefit of those clients.  After discussion with Mr Tibbs and Mr Noble it was decided that Mr Gordon should investigate the nature of the allegations.  He said that he did not inform Mr Colley that he was under suspicion although his and Mr Tibbs’ desk were situated a few feet from Mr Colley’s and their meeting in Mr Noble’s office would have been in full view of Mr Colley.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The next day Mr Noble was informed that it was Mr Colley who had altered the dividends in IG Index’s systems. He then met Mr Gordon and understood that Mr Colley had explained to a colleague that he was ill and had left the premises. Mr Noble thought that he received that information at about lunchtime on 26 September 2008 and that during a meeting with Mr Gordon and one of the IT developers in his office he understood that Mr Colley had explained to a colleague that he was ill and had left the premises. There was an ambiguous passage in Mr Gordon’s first witness statement, which he adopted as his evidence in chief, which might have given the impression that Mr Colley left the office on the afternoon of 25 September 2008 but when he was cross examined on that passage by Mr Colley at trial who put it to him that he in fact left the offices on the morning of 26 September 2008 Mr Mayall, of counsel who appeared for IG Index at the trial, on behalf of IG Index accepted that the correct date was indeed the morning of 26 September 2008. Because he and Mr Tibbs were busy dealing with the exceptional market volatility associated with the problems with Lehman Brothers Mr Noble asked Mr Gordon to concentrate on making enquiries and investigating the matter further. Mr Gordon advised him that from his initial enquiries he had found other clients’ accounts which appeared to have been used for what Mr Noble described as the fraud and had ascertained that Mr Colley had in all cases which he had so far discovered changed the dividend.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ms Bornor was the Head of Human Resources at IG Index. Ms Bornor said that on the morning of 26 September 2008 Mr Noble came to see her to explain that he suspected Mr Colley of fraud. He explained the details which in essence were that he suspected that Mr Colley had been fraudulently entering dividends onto IG Index’s system. That would depress the price, a third party acting in concert with Mr Colley would then buy at that depressed price, Mr Colley would then remove the dividend which would have the effect of increasing the price and the third party would then close his position. If no other factors had occurred the third party would thus make a profit.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Noble explained that he, Mr Gordon and Mr Tibbs had spent some time already investigating the manually corrected records and that the evidence was so far that all of the fraudulent activity had pointed to Mr Colley’s sign-on and that so far there had been nothing to suggest that he had colluded with anyone else in IG Index. Ms Bornor said that she agreed with Mr Noble that they would meet Mr Colley to present him with the evidence and ask his explanation. Mr Noble returned to his desk and then advised her that Mr Colley had left the premises. She therefore attempted to call Mr Colley on his mobile telephone and being unable to speak to him left a message asking him to meet her that afternoon at 4 p.m.</p>

Equally, there was no apparent outrage or claims that he was innocent again for us to believe that the evidence was damning.</p>

It is a three page document in which entries for 23 dates between 19 June 2008 and 24 September 2008 were arranged under a series of un-headed columns. In each case in the left hand column were a number of entries on the same date. The entries in the next column were of times. In the case of each set of dates the times for the first and subsequent entries excluding the last entry, were at various times between 20:49 hours and 20:58 hours. In each set the time of the last entry was a few minutes after the time of the preceding entries ranging from 20:52 to 20:58. There was one exception to which I refer shortly. </p>

In one case (19 June 2008) there were two entries with two separate client account numbers. In the second one the entry in the time column had a time which was 12 minutes before the dividend insertion times but also added “2006”. The entries in the next column were not explained by Mr Noble. In the next column in every entry except in each case the last line which had the client account number was written “James Co at IGPC 3034 (Unknown)”. Mr Noble said that this showed that the person entering the dividend was Mr Colley (his username in IG Index’s systems being James Co and IGPC 3034 identified the computer terminal which was used to enter the dividend). There were two further columns which were unexplained by Mr Noble.</p>

He said that Mr Colley repeated many times that he did not know what to say and that he said that he thought he needed a lawyer.

He explained the details of the fraud as being in essence that Mr Colley had been fraudulently entering dividends onto IG Index’s system. That would depress the price, a third party acting in conjunction with Mr Colley would then buy at that depressed price, Mr Colley would then remove the dividend which would have the effect of increasing the price and the third party would then close his position. If no other factors had occurred the third party would then make a profit.</p>

Ms Bornor said that Mr Colley apologised for not coming in earlier but explained that it was to do with him being unwell and having to go to hospital.

However during the meeting as he received more information from Mr Noble and was shown the spreadsheets he started to look worried and at the end looked ashen and she thought that he was sweating. Her overall impression of the meeting was that Mr Colley was in receive mode, that is to say that he wanted to listen to what Mr Noble and Ms Bornor had to say, learn what information they had but then just say “I do not know what to say”.</p>

Mr Colley said that Ms Bornor threatened him by saying that if he did not tell the truth the police would become involved and he would likely go to prison. He asked if she was threatening him at which point Mr Noble took over by saying that she was not and apologising.</p>

However he said that he asked to see the documents and take them away and look through them, to which Mr Noble responded that he could not and took them back. Mr Noble had accused him of making the changes in the documents and made allegations of fraud against him.

To that Ms Bornor said that this was an internal disciplinary hearing. They had not decided that Mr Colley had done anything wrong. They were looking for evidence and therefore she would have expected someone to say either that they were innocent or that they had done it. She denied threatening Mr Colley. She merely explained that if people were found to be guilty the police could be involved. She denied threatening him with prison. She did however explain that in her experience if someone had embezzled money the police did not see it as the first time because there would have been hundreds of attempts.</p>

To that end she enclosed a draft letter addressed to the CAPITA registrars instructing them to sell the shares registered in Mr Colley’s name and to have the resultant cheque sent to IG Index.

However he accepted that he did not appeal against the termination of his employment for gross misconduct. He said that he did not see an employment lawyer until 8-12 weeks later whereupon he was told that it was too late. He accepted that he received the termination letter of 2 October 2008 which gave him 5 working days to appeal against his dismissal but said that he did not recall seeing that in the letter. He was asked why if it was a huge error he did not write to say that it was monstrous that he had been sacked. His reply was that he had several conversations with Mr Noble. However he did not suggest to Mr Noble in cross examination that he had any conversation after receiving the 2 October 2008 letter in which he challenged the dismissal. He did not accept that the reason he did not appeal against the dismissal was that he knew that he had been rumbled. He said that in hindsight he would have seen an employment lawyer sooner.</p>

As early as the letter of 26 September 2008 he was put on notice that IG Index had discovered a consistent pattern of dividend adjustment to US stocks resulting in a number of identified clients dealing at incorrect prices and that IG Index had reason to believe that he made the relevant dividend adjustments. I accept Mr Noble’s evidence that Mr Colley would have understood from the spreadsheet exhibited to his witness statement which he showed Mr Colley that it recorded dates on which dividends had been inserted into stocks, that according to the spreadsheet the person recorded as having inserted the dividends was recorded as having used his username and that clients had traded on those stocks within minutes of the dividends being inserted. I accept Mr Noble’s evidence that Mr Colley looked at the document for some time but said nothing about its contents other than to repeat many times that he did not know what to say and that he thought he needed a lawyer.</p>

However even if, as he asserted, he was not given a chance to look through the papers which Mr Noble placed in front of him, the answer to his rhetorical question in evidence: “ how could I accept or deny something I did not have a chance to look through?”, is in my view that he could and might reasonably have been expected at the very least to say that whatever might turn out to be the explanation for the documents the one thing he could assure Ms Bornor and Mr Noble of was that he had not been involved in any kind of untoward, dishonest or fraudulent behaviour and had not colluded dishonestly with any clients of IG Index. It must in my view have been very clear to Mr Colley, by the time of the meeting from the contents of the letter he had received and in the meeting from what was said by Mr Noble and Ms Bornor, that evidence had emerged giving rise to suspicions at the very least that he had been involved in entering false dividends with the result if not the aim of benefiting clients. If, as was his case at trial, Mr Colley was entirely innocent of any fraud and had not colluded in any way with clients to benefit them at the expense of IG Index, in my view there was no good reason why he could not and would not have protested his innocence even in the most general terms.</p>

Only in that way would it have been possible for any financial value to be transferred from IG Index to anyone else. Since it was not alleged and there was no evidence that Mr Colley himself placed bets at the artificially depressed prices and then closed them out the inference was that he must have been acting in concert with clients who did.</p>

Single isolated audits were not missing by themselves. Rather it was all audits over a specific period of time such as a month. The audit report provided for this case was extracted from the audit database.

First it explains why of the 415 spread bets details of which appeared in the Colley Master Detail Schedule May – 12, there were only 130 for which audit data showing details of the date, time Ex-Date and amount of the allegedly inserted dividend was available. Second because some of the Defendants challenged the authenticity and/or reliability of the detailed information adduced by IG Index. It was not always clear whether these challenges were intended to suggest deliberate falsification or self serving selection of data or merely its unreliability. Significantly Mr Colley, when cross examining Mr Gordon, expressly stated that it was not his case that IG Index knowingly doctored material placed before the court. I deal with this in more detail below but indicate at this stage that, having heard Mr Cloke, Mr Gordon and Mr Blair Wright, the Head of Microsoft Services of IG Index who also gave evidence, I am quite satisfied that they all gave truthful and honest evidence which was designed to assist the court. I have no doubt that none of them set out to select information in a slanted or one-sided way or to omit potentially unhelpful information so as to provide a misleading or false picture to the court. Although it is unfortunate that the audit data was limited to 130 of 415 alleged insertions of false dividends. I am satisfied that in relation to those 130 insertions the data was authentic and reliable.</p>

Mr Gordon described this process in terms which broadly mirrored IG Index’s pleaded case as referred to earlier in this judgment. Thus he said that IG Index made spread betting prices on shares futures by taking a live price from a stock exchange, then adding an adjustment for interest, subtracting the sum of all dividends expected to be paid by the company in question before the expiry date of the bet and then finally adding a dealing spread to that futures price.</p>

IG Index would then wrap a dealing spread of say 2 points around that number and offer it to its clients to either buy or sell at a price of 191-193. All shares futures are priced in pence (or equivalent in other trading currencies) and clients deal in a stake size per “point” (pence in that example) movement. Thus a buy bet of £10 per point of March Vodafone would be made at 193 and every penny increase above the dealing price of 193 would yield the client £10 profit and every penny reduction below that price would yield a £1.10 loss. Assuming that the LSE price of Vodafone did not change at all and that interest rates remained unchanged IG Index would expect the futures price to reduce by 5% x 200 / 365 = 0.027 each day as the number of days to expiry reduced. </p>

Thus the amount and date of dividend included within a shares futures price could have a big impact on the resulting value and it was important that the dividend values and dates held within IG Index’s prices should mirror the actual values and dates that companies like Vodafone used.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It was typically a two stage process involving SuperDiv and Xcon. Xcon was the name of IG Index’s pricing system which calculated the prices at which IG Index offered 7000 shares futures markets for spread betting clients of which approximately 2000 were on US shares. Xcon was effectively an enormous calculator which took in a live price feed (P in the formula referred to above) from an exchange via a price supplier such as Reuters or LSE. That value got altered according to the P + i – D = F formula which required constant settings such as the number of days to expiry, the interest rate for a specific trading currency and the dividend dates and amounts expected of the company in question.</p>

Other price making dealers on different desks at IG Index also had access to Xcon but would never be expected to make changes to shares prices. The dividend information was unique for every stock and required daily reconciliation by a shares dealer to maintain the accuracy of IG Index’s prices. IG Index quoted US shares futures up to 9 months in advance. Thus for example if the date was 1 January 2006 IG Index would be making prices for March 2006, June 2006 and September 2006 futures.</p>

The time when a company confirms the date and amount of the dividend, usually 1-3 weeks before the date it becomes effective, is known as the Ex-Date, that is to say the date at which a shareholder must own shares in order to be entitled to the dividend. That is the date on which the amount of dividend would normally be expected to be deducted from the exchange price.</p>

The same dealer would also remove any dividends from which the Ex-Date had passed since they no longer contributed to a futures price and replaced them with a far-dated prediction for upcoming futures.</p>

The US shares which pay dividends (approximately half of IG Index’s data set) almost all pay four times per year – once per quarter – where each payment is roughly equally spaced.  If a company has paid ten cents for the previous six dividends it is very likely that it will try to pay ten cents for the next one or possibly a small increase which it would then try to maintain thereafter.</p>

The cells in SuperDiv which contained dividend information had to be input by a person.  That is to say they were not linked to other sources which could update them automatically. A second spreadsheet called DivCheckUS&amp;OZ was able to look at the list of US and Australian stock identifier codes from SuperDiv and effectively ask Bloomberg the question “for each of these stocks what, if any, dividends have been confirmed to the market and what is their Ex-Date and amount?” If Bloomberg produced announced dividend data then the DivCheckUS&amp;OZ spreadsheet would reference that data against that held in SuperDiv and if there was a discrepancy between SuperDiv’s prediction and DivCheckUS&amp;OZ’s confirmed data that would be highlighted for the dealer.</p>

The fact that it was inserted no later than the date on which the relevant client defendant placed their bet was proved by the fact that the closing cash price for the relevant stock on that day was significantly higher (by an amount that could only be explained by a dividend having been inserted into IG Index’s futures price)  than the price at which the  client placed the bet and the IG Index futures closing price on the day the bet was placed.

That enabled Mr Gordon to check the overnight IG Index valuation against the cash price which in each case revealed no discrepancy between the two other than explicable by interest.  On the day of the allegedly fraudulent trade there were reports both for the allegedly fraudulent trade and the innocent trade.  A comparison between the cash and futures prices showed that the false dividend had been inserted on the day of the two trades. If that was the case not only in respect of those randomly identifiable trades for which there was no audit information but also in respect of the 130 trades in respect of which there was audit information, it is to be inferred that in respect of those trades where it was not possible  to pinpoint the date of insertion in either of those two ways the date was likewise the same as the date of the Defendant client’s trade. </p>

If the difference between the cash and futures price moved by more than one day’s interest that must be caused by a dividend being inserted or removed from the price.  If a real dividend went ex-dividend on that day IG Index would stop subtracting it from its futures price and would therefore expect to see the difference between the cash and futures price change to reflect that.  The change would be the amount of the dividend removed and one day’s interest.</p>

Where there was audit evidence of the actual time of the insertion of the dividend on the vast majority of occasions the dividend was inserted very shortly before the relevant market closed.  It was unlikely that Bloomberg would announce a dividend shortly before the close of the relevant market.  Mr Gordon said that, at least in respect of UK stocks, he would expect announcement of dividends before the market opened. Thus the large scale insertion of dividends at those times was for that reason extremely unlikely to have been done for the honest purpose of updating Xcon to reflect genuine new dividend announcements from the relevant companies.</p>

Mr Gordon said that shares dealers did not have their own list of dealing clients so that if a client spotted an error, including a pricing error, and brought it to IG Index’s attention there was no guarantee that a specific dealer would receive the call. Concentrating the insertion of the false dividends and the subsequent placing of bets at the favourable artificially depressed prices by the client Defendant in a brief window of time before the close of the US markets was, it was submitted by IG Index, calculated to minimise the risk of the fraud coming to light as a result of questions raised by innocent clients. In addition IG Index relied on the following matters as supporting the inference that the insertion and removal of dividends (whether proved by the comparison of cash and futures prices in the case of the 285 bets or the combination of that comparison and the audited information in the case of the 130 spread bets) were part of a dishonest fraud.</p>

He had found no evidence of those companies having made any announcement that they intended to pay dividends on the occasions relating to their input into IG Index’s pricing system. Further the average share price of the US stocks concerned was 4450 cents. The average dividend entered into those prices was 4450.67 cents, 9.9% of the average price. Mr Gordon said that dividends yields of that scale were very rare in the financial markets and any experienced shares dealer would know that. The overwhelming majority of US dividends were in the range of 2 cents to 30 cents.</p>

It is in my judgment critical evidence. The anticipation or announcement of dividends formed an integral part of the calculation by IG Index of the prices which it offered its clients for spread bets on US stock futures. The insertion into those futures prices via SuperDiv and Xcon of massively inflated dividend prices which bore no relation either to the history of the individual US stocks concerned or to the general level of US stock dividends can only have been done by mistake or deliberately.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Gordon said that there was no reason why Bloomberg would have wrongly suggested that the companies concerned were about to pay large dividends on so many occasions and then withdraw that information. IG Index’s dividend reconciliation process relied on Bloomberg information to alert the dealer who conducted the evening’s price reconciliation check as to which companies had announced pending dividend payments. Even if Bloomberg had on all those occasions made the errors which ultimately found their way into Xcon, the dealer would have had manually to type both the dividend Ex-Date and the dividend amount into SuperDiv in order for it to form part of the evening’s price reconciliation check. The information would then have to be either manually typed or pasted into Xcon. Mr Gordon said that it would be very unusual and grossly unprofessional for an experienced dealer manually to type in dividend values of an average of 440 cents, in circumstances in which it was well known that the overwhelming majority of US dividends were in the range of 2 cents to 30 cents without questioning the number. Further there were many examples of the insertions into Xcon being done at a time when no other stock dividends were being updated which points to them having been deliberately either typed or pasted into Xcon individually rather than as part of a bigger process.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The position is most dramatically illustrated by reference to the 130 trades in respect of which there was audited information as to the actual amount and Ex-Date inserted into Xcon. The large majority of dividends inserted were in respect of US shares which did not pay dividends. In the handful of cases where real dividends were paid by the stock in question after the allegedly fraudulent bet was placed the dividends were a small fraction of the amounts entered into Xcon. They ranged from 3 cents to 48.9511 cents. That was in contrast to the dividends entered into Xcon which in the case of those shares ranged from 350 to 600 cents. Moreover the actual dividend Ex-Dates were different. It was suggested on behalf of the Defendants at trial that the amount of false dividend inserted in Xcon could be a simple error, for example by misplacing the decimal point. However that suggestion was inconsistent with the handful of cases in which the US stock in question did actually pay a dividend after the allegedly fraudulent bet was placed. Thus by way of example in respect of one trade (number 256 in the Colley Master Detailed Sheet May 12) the dividend inserted into Xcon was 500 cents, whereas the dividend actually paid on the next date following the placing of the relevant bet was 48.9511 cents.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In order to find their way into Xcon both the dividend amount and the Ex-Date had to be entered into both SuperDiv and Xcon. For the reasons given the likelihood of so many glaringly incorrect dividend amounts and Ex-Dates being manually typed into a document by a shares dealer without the error or at least oddity being obvious to him or her is in my judgment very small. This gives rise to a very strong presumption that whoever entered the 130 dividends for which there is audited information into SuperDiv was aware that the dividends being typed in were obviously incorrect and very significantly overstated if not completely wrong in the sense that no dividend was likely to have been either anticipated or announced at all. Taken together with the absence of any evidence of any dealer either having queried these inserts with Mr Gordon, Mr Tibbs or anyone else or having corrected the insertions before inserting them, this in turn in my view leads to a strong presumption that the insertions were made deliberately. There was in my judgment no evidence which rebutted that presumption. On the contrary there was a large amount of evidence which supported it.</p>

Thus the same logic leads to the conclusion that there is a strong presumption that whoever entered the incorrect dividend information into Xcon did so both knowingly and deliberately. Moreover that would still leave unexplained why the false dividends were entered manually into SuperDiv in the first place unless deliberately and if deliberately, what purpose was served unless it was to be a precursor to changing Xcon.</p>

IG Index submitted that the only rational answer to that question is that it was done for the purpose of artificially depressing the price offered by IG Index on the relevant US stocks to enable a client to place a bet at the artificially depressed price, thereby benefiting to the extent by which the insertion of the false dividend depressed the price. I accept that submission. It is again in my view telling that neither Mr Colley nor any of the client Defendants was able to provide a plausible alternative answer to that question (although of course they did not accept that the false information was deliberately entered into Xcon).</p>

Second for the same reason it supports the inference that the person who entered the dividends must have been aware of that fact and thus, given the large number of occasions on which false dividends were entered and the absence of evidence of the person who entered them having queried the information with management, the person who entered the information must have done so intending to enter false information.</p>

By limiting to a few minutes the period of time in which an innocent client of IG Index might spot the artificially depressed price the putatively dishonest inserter of the false dividend might thereby hope to minimise the risk of the fraud being detected. Alternatively if an innocent client by chance placed a bet on a US stock after the insertion of the false dividend at the artificially depressed price there was also a risk that he might notice the unexplained contrast with the underlying cash price and raise the anomaly with IG Index. If the bet placed was a sell bet he would have an obvious interest in doing so. Even if it were a buy bet he might do so if he were an honest person. A client with an existing open buy bet on the relevant stock who spotted the dramatic fall in the futures price might be alarmed at the sudden increase in his downside exposure were he to check the cash price and discover, as he would, that there was no equivalent drop in the underlying market cash price, he might very well contact IG Index and alert them to the anomaly. It is for the same reason, said IG Index, that almost all the stocks chosen for the fraud were stocks in which no existing innocent client had an open position which could be affected by the insertion of the false dividend.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the event there were only a handful of allegedly fraudulent bets placed following the insertion of a false dividend which were placed on stocks on which bets were also placed by clients not alleged by IG Index to have been involved in the fraud. IG Index had particular submissions in relation to some of them to which I refer below. More generally however, IG Index’s submission on this point was that, while it accepted that even in a short window the alleged fraudster was taking a chance that an innocent client might place a bet at the artificially depressed price during the short window of time, the risk was a very small one and much smaller than would have been the case if the insertion of the false dividends had been made soon after the opening of the US market. If the insertion of a particular false dividend did come to light, either prompted by an enquiry by an innocent client or otherwise, the remedy (assuming that it was indeed fraudulent) would be for the dishonest client who had placed the bet at the artificially depressed price immediately to agree that the contract price should be adjusted when, as Mr Gordon said would be the normal practice, he was contacted by a dealer who had been asked to investigate the anomaly and told that the futures price which he had been offered had been incorrect. </p>

There were two aspects to that. First on the vast majority of occasions the dividend was left in the IG Index quoted price overnight. That IG Index submitted was necessary in order to avoid the false dividend being picked up in either of the two overnight IG Index checks. Second, and relevant in the present context, where there is audit evidence of the actual time of removal it shows that on the vast majority occasions the dividend was removed before the US market opened the following working day. That would lessen the chances of any other innocent IG Index client trading on the manipulated price and thus, in the same way as timing the insertion of the dividend the previous way to within a few minutes of the close of the US market, lessen the chances of detection.</p>

However there was no audit evidence of that. What was clear was that the cash valuations on those two stocks on the day the dividend was inserted were different to that shown by Bloomberg, which suggested that the price feed was either genuinely wrong or had been manipulated that evening. The overnight valuations on both stocks had futures prices well in excess of that expected by interest alone suggesting a negative dividend was present somewhere in IG Index’s price. Based on the primary evidence of the audit information Mr Gordon did not believe that the dividend was removed on the night of the placing of the allegedly fraudulent bet. As to why the IG Index valuation on the day of the trade was incorrect he could only speculate that it was because the cash price was incorrect. As to the futures price containing a premium far in excess of the cash price even though the cash price was wrong the only way that could have happened was if there had been a negative dividend inserted. As to why a fraudster would have put in both a false positive and a false negative dividend Mr Gordon said that if it had been done when the innocent party dealt it might have been an attempt to conceal the fraud. The innocent party might have dealt on the false positive dividend and then queried it with IG Index to which the fraudulent dealer might have responded by trying to offset the false positive dividend with a false negative dividend. </p>

It might well have been that the reason he was not sued was because it was an isolated bet in respect of which Mr Mayall said that the benefit attributable to the false price was only £99. Significantly Mr Gordon pointed out that even in the case of the transactions identified in Rows 282-285 the audited information showed that the removal took place after 11:00 a.m. on the day of removal (the day after the dividend was inserted) which is consistent with the general point referred to below that the dividends were left in the IG Index price until after the second of the two price checks to which I refer below was likely to have been completed. Since the dividends were shown by the audited information to have been added a few minutes before the market closed there was only a small window of opportunity for the putatively innocent clients to have noticed any change to their profit and loss.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The sheer volume of occasions in which the audited information shows a bet being placed within a very short time of the insertion of a false dividend is very striking. Taken on its own it is of course not conclusive proof that the person placing the bet had been told in advance that the dividend would be inserted and selected both  the individual stock and the time at which to place a bet on it so as to benefit from the artificially depressed price created by the insertion. The proximity of the time at which the dividend was inserted and the bet was placed may in any individual case have been fortuitous. Alternatively the bet may have been placed because the client noticed the downward spike in the price and saw it as a buying opportunity. At its lowest in my judgment it calls for an alternative plausible explanation as to why the bet was placed. In this context it is important to bear in mind that on the one hand a person placing a bet after a false dividend was inserted who was unaware of the false insertion would have no reason to appreciate that the price represented a bargain in the sense that the underlying cash price had not also fallen by an equivalent amount unless they had the cash price open on a screen. On the other hand if they were aware of the underlying cash price, an experienced spread better might be expected to assume that there was some mistake since the size of the discrepancy was almost always very significantly greater than could be explained by the insertion of a genuine dividend announcement or anticipated dividend. If he did believe the discrepancy was caused by a genuine dividend insertion it would not logically constitute a bargain.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">If the person placing the bet did not have the cash price open on a screen, the natural assumption on seeing a sudden drop in the futures price offered by IG Index would be that it reflected a similar drop in the underlying cash price of the relevant stock. As in the case of ordinary shares listed on stock exchanges a drop in the futures price of a stock would not necessarily show that the lower price was a bargain. It would depend on why the market had taken a negative view on the stock in question and a decision to place a bet might be expected to be based on some background knowledge of the stock in question so as to reach an informed view as to whether the sudden drop in price represented a good buying opportunity or not.</p>

It is for those reasons important when considering whether individual client Defendants had been tipped off in advance that a false dividend would be inserted what alternative explanations they had for why they happened to place their bets on the stocks on which the dividends were inserted on several occasions shortly after the dividend was inserted.</p>

His starting point was the information given to him by Mr Tibbs on 25 September 2008 to which I have referred that he had discovered that large dividend values in the amount of 400 cents had been inserted into the prices offered by IG Index for 2 US stocks a few minutes before bets were placed on them by Mr Abrahamovich and Mr Rowe respectively. The dividend had been inserted at 20:49:43 hours and 20:50:20 hours respectively and the bets on the amended priced had been placed at 20:53:12 hours and 20:56:43 hours respectively.</p>

Having checked with Bloomberg he found that there were no Ex dividend dates and nothing unremarkable which could explain the anomaly. He then looked at the IG Index graph which shows the IG Index price adjusted for dividends and interest for that stock and found a downward spike in the price for which there was no apparent reason. On discussing it with Mr Noble they agreed to see if any changes had been made to Xcon since one potential explanation would be that a dividend had been entered. Mr Noble contacted someone in IT, possibly Mr Imre, and later that day Mr Tibbs was told that a dividend had indeed been inserted into the price using Mr Colley’s login details.</p>

The fact that the prices of the two US stocks had been reduced by 400 cents or points for no obvious reason made Mr Gordon suspicious that there was an intention to remove those dividend values while the client positions were still open thus increasing the valuation of the futures prices by 400 points in each case. He decided to investigate whether any previous bets made by those two clients had been subject to advantageous insertions of dividends and if so if they had profited by subsequent removal of those dividends.</p>

He compared the difference between the closing stock exchange cash prices of the underlying stocks as supplied by Bloomberg on the days the positions were opened against IG Index’s closing futures prices at close of business on the same days. He then compared the difference between the cash and IG Index futures price on the day on which the bets had been opened against the difference between the two prices on the following days. If no dividends had been inserted and then subsequently removed he would have expected those price differences to change only by the value of one days interest each time.

It was from that investigation based on comparing the difference between cash and IG Index’s futures prices at close of business on the dates on which suspicious bets were placed against the diminishing differences on subsequent dates that Mr Gordon produced his list of 415 allegedly fraudulent transactions on which this claim is based.</p>

In particular he put to Mr Gordon that evidence of a difference between the cash and futures price at the close of business was not the same thing as evidence of a difference between the cash and futures price at the time at which a bet was placed. It was only the latter and not the former which, in the absence of audited information as to the time a dividend was inserted, which could conclusively prove whether, at the time a bet was placed, the futures price had already been artificially depressed by a prior insertion of the dividend.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Gordon’s answer to that was as follows. First, as previously mentioned, there were six or seven transactions in which other clients had open positions in the relevant stocks and where it was possible to tell that there was no false dividend in the futures price the night before the allegedly fraudulent bet was placed. The fact that on the day the fraudulent bet was placed there was a substantial difference between the closing cash and futures price demonstrated that the false dividend must have been inserted on that day. Second although Mr Gordon accepted that on IG Index’s case there must have been a disparity at the time every fraudulent bet was placed between the cash price and the bet price if a false dividend had been inserted before the bet was placed, he acknowledged that the differences between the cash and futures prices relied on in the Colley Master Schedule May 12 were as at the close of business on the day the bet was placed rather than at the time the bet was placed.</p>

In addition when the audit information for the additional 95 transactions going back over the previous three years were made available to him in 2011, the false dividends which had previous been revealed by his comparison of the cash and futures prices at the close of business were consistent with the information as to the false dividends inserted contained in t he audited Xcon information.</p>

Although when he did the exercise in 2008 there were a number of transactions where he was able to contrast the difference between the cash and the IG Index futures price at the time the bet was placed, he did not at that time see the cash price at the time the bet was placed in respect of all 415 transactions and the figures included in the Colley Master Schedule May 12 were confined to the cash and IG Index futures prices at the close of business.</p>

He was told that it was possible and that the software had been purchased by IG Group’s financial charts developers. He found the identification codes for each of the stocks used in the 415 bets and used the software, called Thompson Reuters Tick History, to find the Bid and Ask prices of the underlying stock at the time of booking the 415 bets the subject of the Colley Master Detailed Sheet – May 12. Those values were summarised in the historical cash prices spreadsheet. Mr Gordon added in the spreadsheet a column called “open level w/o Spread” which was the client’s dealing price with IG Index’s spread removed. Those prices he said were invariably significantly below the corresponding Ask value at the time and the number of points, or cents, below the Ask price was summarised in a column called “FUT Below Cash at Deal Time (cents)”. </p>

A final column called “False Div in Price?” was based on a formula which looked at the discount of the future price below the cash price and said “yes” if that must have been achieved by the presence of a dividend of a higher value than could reasonably have been expected.</p>

The comparison between the underlying cash price at the time the bets were placed and the IG Index futures price at that time entirely corroborated and supported IG Index’s case and Mr Gordon’s evidence that very substantial dividends had already been inserted into the IG Index futures price at the time the bets were placed. It thus removed any room for doubt that in relation to the 280 transactions where there was no audited primary evidence of the time and date of the insertion of the false dividend the false dividend had already been inserted by the time the false bets were placed. The inferences which Mr Gordon had drawn from the comparison of the cash price and the IG Index futures price as at the close of the US market were wholly corroborated by the same contrast based on primary historic evidence as at the time the bets were placed.</p>

Since the only way in which the person in IG Index who inserted and then removed the false dividends could realise a financial gain would be by a client placing a bet at the artificially depressed price and then closing it after the price was restored to its true market value by the removal of the dividend the expectation would be that one would find evidence of such bets having been opened after the dividends were inserted and closed after they were removed. The audited information demonstrates that this is what occurred on 130 occasions so far as the insertion is concerned (and 125 occasions so far as the removal is concerned). The historical cash prices spreadsheet shows that that is what occurred on all 415 bets, with one possible exception, so far as the opening of the bets coming after the insertion of the dividends is concerned  and with another exception where the price was artificially raised and the bet was a sell rather that a buy.</p>

It does however in my judgment follow from the strong likelihood that the person inserting the false dividends did so both deliberately and dishonestly that the strong likelihood is that most of the 415 bets were placed by clients who had been tipped off and were thus party to a dishonest plan. That is because the only way in which any financial benefit could be obtained from the dishonest insertion and removal of false dividends was by a client placing a bet after the insertion and removing it after the removal and on all but one case the only person who placed such a bet was one of the client Defendants or the other three alleged accomplices.</p>

That is because assuming that the insertion and removal of the dividend was part of a fraud in order for the fraud to work there would have to be a bet placed by an accomplice. It would be very surprising if on hundreds of occasions on which a false dividend was falsely inserted and removed for the purpose of enabling a client accomplice to place and remove a bet at artificially favourable prices no such bets were placed by a client accomplice but by chance a bet <span style="font-weight:bold">was</span> placed by one innocent client.</p>

These were trades in respect of which the audited information showed that a false dividend of 300 cents was entered into Xcon at 20:51:13 hours on 23 October 2007 on a US stock which had not previously declared a dividend. At 20:55:02 hours on 23 October 2007 Mr Goldstein placed a bet on the stock. At 20:55:45 hours a client with the reference SC666 placed a bet on the same stock. Although the dividend was removed at 11:03 hours the next morning on 24 October 2007, a comparison of the cash and futures prices as at the close of business showed that the futures price was significantly larger than the cash price. IG Index submit, with force in my judgment, that it is likely that the placing by client SC666 of two small trades almost immediately after Mr Goldstein placed his bet was an unexpected and unwelcome development for the fraudulent dealer and that, while it is not possible to ascertain exactly what action he took, it is likely that he took some corrective action since the overnight valuations showed that there must have been a negative dividend in the futures price which was corrected by the removal of the false dividend the following day.</p>

Of course the position in relation to any individual client Defendant needs to be considered individually in the context of the evidence as to the particular bets placed by that Defendant and the evidence given by him as to why and the circumstances in which he came to place the bet. However part of the background against which it is in my judgment not only legitimate but necessary to consider the evidence in each individual case is the general conclusion which I reach that there was a course of conduct over a period of three years in which a person or persons in IG Index dishonestly inserted and removed false dividends to enable accomplice clients to place trades at artificially depressed prices and that in hundreds of cases that is what occurred. </p>

The price at which he dealt was significantly lower than both the cash price and IG Index futures price when the market closed. If IG Index’s checking system was working properly that discrepancy should have been picked up by the morning price check on 30 May 2008. That is indeed what happened as is evidenced in an email from Ms Bradshaw to Mr Colley and his colleague Mr Eastell in which the dealing price was identified and Ms Bradshaw said that the opening price (which Mr Gordon said was a reference to the price at which the bet was placed) looked a lot lower than any level the stock was on FT.com which was the cash price Mr Colley responded to Ms Bradshaw saying “not correct, I think it’s a dividend problem and sorting them out…”.  A comparison of the cash and futures prices at the close of business on the two days following the placing of the bet showed that on the immediately following day the futures price traded at a significant discount to the cash price suggesting the insertion of a dividend whereas on the next following day there was virtually no difference between the cash and futures price at close of business thereby suggesting that the dividend was removed.</p>

Even though there was only a minute between the placing of the bet and the close of the market that would appear to be a rational explanation for the difference between the price at which the bet was placed and the futures price at close of business. They further submit, again with force in my view, that the inference to be drawn from the contrast between the cash and futures closing prices on the following two days is that rather than sorting out the problem by contacting the client and correcting the price at which the client dealt to reflect the closing price, Mr Colley instead reinserted the dividend on 30 May thus apparently removing the profit made by the client and bringing the IG Index price back in line with the price at which the client dealt and then the next day reinserted the dividend so as to restore the fraudulent profit for the benefit of the client. The bet was closed on 6 June 2008 resulting in a significant profit. Mr Gordon’s historical cash prices spreadsheet showed that the price at which Mr Regan placed his bet at 20:59:01 hours on 29 May 2008 was at a 490 cents discount to the cash price at that time. This strongly support the inference contended for by IG Index that a false dividend had been inserted before Mr Regan placed his bet and that for some reason it was removed before the market closed. While the reason for that removal is not clear in my judgment this transaction, while anomalous supports rather than undermines IG Index’s case.</p>

First if the false dividends were inserted dishonestly in order to benefit accomplice clients who were tipped off to place bets after the insertion it would be necessary for the IG Index futures prices to be re-adjusted by the false dividends being removed before the client closed out their bets in order for the benefit to be realised. Second the evidence was that there were two checks routinely carried out by IG Index employees, one in the evening and the second the following morning. If the false dividends were removed before these checks were carried out there was a significant risk that the discrepancy between the artificially depressed prices at which the clients placed their bets and the IG Index futures prices would be detected. It would thus be surprising if the person who inserted the false dividend, assuming the insertion to have been dishonest, removed the dividend before the two checks were likely to have been carried out. Third the sooner the dividend was removed after the completion of the second check the smaller was the risk of other innocent clients placing bets at the artificially depressed price with a consequent risk of questions being asked.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the first point, Mr Gordon said that of the 130 transactions for which there was audited Xcon information there were 125 in respect of which it was possible to identify the removal of the dividend and the actual date and time on which it was removed. This information showed that the removals took place before the clients closed their bets, with one exception when the dividend was partly removed before Mr Regan closed the bet.</p>

Quite apart from the fact that the reliability of that approach is emphatically corroborated by the fact that in the 125 transactions where there was primary evidence of the fact and date of the removal of the dividend the same conclusion is established by that approach, I accept the evidence of Mr Gordon that there is no other or no other plausible explanation for the disappearance of substantial differences between the cash and IG Index’s futures prices other than the removal of a dividend. Again just as in the case of the 125 transactions so in the case of the 290 transactions (save for the exceptions to which I have referred above) the dividends were removed before the bets placed by the alleged accomplice clients were closed. It is striking that this pattern was the same for those transactions where Mr Gordon inferred the date of removal from the reconvergence of the closing cash and IG Index futures price as it was in respect of those transactions where the Xcon audit information precisely identified the date or removal.</p>

The audit data revealed 130 occasions on which a dividend was inserted and 125 on which a dividend was removed. Of the 130 insertions Mr Gordon believed that only 3 were entered into Xcon as part of a bulk paste, that is to say where the alterations were copied and pasted from SuperDiv into Xcon at the same time. Of course, as already mentioned, even in those cases the alterations would have to have been entered manually in each case into SuperDiv, which could not have been done without the person making the insertion focussing on the size of the dividend whose size made it glaringly anomalous and the Ex-Date, for which there was unlikely to have been a legitimate source. He also said that in the large audit of Xcon changes set out in exhibit 5 to his first witness statement (which covered the three years between July 2005 and July 2008) 73% of the insertions into Xcon were done at times when no other stock dividends were being updated, suggesting that they must have been deliberately either typed or pasted into Xcon individually and not as part of a bigger process.</p>

In relation to the insertion of dividends Mr Gordon said that it would be necessary for the dividend to be inserted not only in Xcon but also in SuperDiv in order to avoid detection by the two daily checks. It was not clear whether this was also the case in relation to the removal of dividends so as to avoid detection of the disparity between the price at which an accomplice client closed a bet and the futures price at the close of business on the day on which the bet was closed. If that was also the case it would further support IG Index’s case since alterations to SuperDiv had to be effected manually.</p>

Mr Gordon rejected that out of hand. In those cases the size of the dividends and the fact that they were in round numbers as well as the times of the insertions followed the same pattern as those which were not part of a bulk paste and were all done on days when Mr Colley was working. This latter point is an example of the point I flagged up earlier namely reliance by IG Index on evidence that Mr Colley was involved in at least some fraudulent transactions in order to support an inference that other transactions were also fraudulent and reliance on the fact that at least 130 false dividends were inserted by the same person, Mr Colley, to support the inference that the insertions are unlikely to have been done by mistake and are thus likely to have been done deliberately and therefore dishonestly.</p>

Moreover once it is accepted that the dividends which were inserted could not have reflected actual announcements of dividends or reasonable forecasts thereof and must therefore have been known to be false by the person who inserted them, the unlikelihood of dividends in the same amount having been removed on so many occasions purely by error is in my judgment enormous. If they were removed deliberately because the person removing them understood that they were false then unless they were removed dishonestly as part of the fraud, it is in my view very unlikely that on none of the 415 occasions on which they removed would the standard operating procedure referred to below have been followed.</p>

If there was a difference it would have to be either because the Bloomberg price feeds differed from the Reuters price feeds (which would be very unusual as both took their values from the relevant stock exchange) or because different dividends were being applied. The daily dividend maintenance job involved the dealer reconciling SuperDiv and then pasting those values into Xcon so in theory they should be identical. Thus if an Xcon price contained a large dividend which should not be there it would be highlighted by this check unless SuperDiv had also been updated with the same dividend. (Spreadsheets like SuperDiv could not be audited in hindsight for changes made to them). When the original dividend manipulation had been discovered on 25 September 2008 Mr Gordon knew that both Xcon and SuperDiv contained the same 400 cent dividends on the transaction which he investigated because he saw the dividend entries in SuperDiv at the time. The fact that the evening check, which Mr Gordon himself did on many occasions, never revealed the dividend insertions demonstrated that in addition to their inclusion in Xcon they must also have been manually typed in SuperDiv. It was the act of updating both systems and retaining the dividend insertions until the checks were completed which made the incorrect prices bypass the check.</p>

This involved taking all the previous days’ bets and checking to see if they had been entered into IG Index’s systems at prices which were different to IG Index’s internal valuations. Thus if IG Index had been pricing the FTSE Index at between 5000 and 5100 over the course of the day and a client had dealt at 4500 the deal would stick out and be likely to be investigated. Also if a client deal had been struck at a price which was out of sequence to those preceding and following it that would also be investigated. Thus if FTSE deals had gone through at 5000, 5010, 5015, 5008, 5090, 5011, 5028 then the 5090 deal would attract attention.</p>

The check was always performed early in the mornings. In order for a deal to appear worthy of investigation due to the subsequent removal of a large dividend the dividend would need to be removed on the same day as the opening deal or before that check took place. On the 130 deals where there is audit information as to the time and date of the insertion or removal of dividends none were removed on the same day they were inserted. Of the remaining 285 deals the process of comparing the closing futures price against the closing cash price showed that, with the exceptions referred to earlier, all had the dividend removed at least one day after the insertion. </p>

Thus the real risk of detection lay in removing the false dividend before the two routine checks were carried out rather than the reverse.

As to the former in particular after April 2006 almost all the dividends were removed the following day. Again it is striking that this same pattern applied not only where the actual date was identified by the audit information in respect of the 130 trades but also where Mr Gordon inferred the date of removal by comparing the cash and futures closing prices.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The significance of this point is that it lends some weight to IG Index’s case that the person responsible for the fraudulent insertion and removal of dividends took care to minimise the risk of innocent IG Index clients dealing at the artificially depressed prices and thus giving rise to a risk of detection. It is to that extent the mirror image of the point that very many of the dividends were inserted and very many of the allegedly fraudulent bets were placed shortly before the close of the market. Mr Mayall accepted that, just as in the case of the handful of transactions where an existing innocent client held and open position on a stock into which an allegedly fraudulent dividend was inserted there was a risk of detection, so in the case of those dividends which were removed after the US market opened the following day and in some cases two or more days thereafter, the person responsible for the removal was taking an unnecessary risk of an innocent client spotting the price drop and contacting IG Index. In respect of all those transactions where either because of the timing of the insertion or removal of the dividend or because an existing client held an open position there was a risk of detection Mr Mayall submitted that taken together the evidence as to the timing of the insertions of the dividends, the proximity between the insertions and many of the bets placed, the proximity between the timing of the insertion and the closing of the market, the selection of stocks on which in all but a handful of cases  no other client either had an open position or placed a bet, the lack of removals on the day of the insertion, the fact that most dividends removed the following day were removed before the US market opened all point very strongly to a systematic pattern of a course of conduct designed to avoid detection. The fact that there were some occasional lapses is a matter to be taken into account but does not demonstrate that the inferences to be drawn from the overall pattern are wrong. In my judgment that submission was well founded.</p>

If spotted at the time of insertion the person would have declined to insert the false dividend without checking whether the dividend was justified, and since it never was, would not have inserted it. If spotted at the time of removal. That would have led to a standard operating procedure for correcting the IG Index futures price, notifying senior management with a view to considering whether to cancel the bets placed or to adjust the contract price. There was no evidence of this correction procedure having been implemented in any of the 415 transactions. The strong inference, so it was submitted, particularly given the need to type dividend alterations manually into SuperDiv, was that since the size of the insertions and removals would have made it obvious to the person inserting and/or removing them that they were false, the reason why no attempts were made to correct the contracts was that the insertions and removals were part of a dishonest deliberate course of conduct. </p>

Mr Gordon said that with any process which required manual input or maintenance there is an ever present risk of error. Errors experienced by IG Index’s clients fell mainly into two categories: input error when a deal was agreed at the correct price but the dealer typed in the wrong data during the booking process or pricing error when there was something wrong with the price provided to the client and the resulting deal got booked at the price quoted. A pricing error would usually be caused by a failure of one of IG Index’s price leads or possibly one of the constants that contributed to a price calculation being wrong. Input error was usually easily solved by listening to the recorded phone call or looking at the online deal logs and correcting the booking details to the agreed values. With a pricing error the correct price at the time of the deal would need to be reconstructed using the correct constituent parts of IG Index’s price at the time of the error. If an open deal needed to be corrected the deal was simply deleted and replaced by a correct version. If a closed deal needed a price correction then the profit or loss attributed to the deal containing the error needed to be adjusted to account for the correction. That was done by either adding or removing funds under client’s cash ledger and those funds transfer being processed by IG Index’s back office staff.</p>

Taken together with the fact that in almost all cases no other IG Index clients placed bets after the dividends were inserted, the connections make it less likely or plausible that the fact that particular clients placed bets between the insertions and removals from which they benefited was an innocent coincidence or the result of bona fide investment decisions. If there was a fraud bets would have to be placed by accomplices of the inserter in order for the fraud to be effective. In principle I accept that submission subject to the qualification that it is not of itself conclusive and that the strength or weakness of the submission is likely to be affected by whether it is possible to conclude in respect of individual client Defendants or other allegedly dishonest clients that they were in fact participants in a fraud. It was not IG Index’s case that because there was a fraud it must follow that any client who placed a bet on a stock on which a false dividend was inserted must have been party to the fraud. It thus accepted that it was in principle possible for a client to have placed a bet on such a stock by chance or for some legitimate reason and indeed in respect of at least one transaction it accepted that that is what happened.</p>

Plainly if as a matter of fact there was no connection between a particular client Defendant and either the dishonest inserter and remover of false dividends or between that Defendant and other allegedly dishonest clients who benefited from similar transactions that would point very strongly if not conclusively against that particular client Defendant having been party to a fraud. It does not of course however follow from the fact that IG Index was unable to identify evidence of any such connection that it did not exist. It is a commonplace in many financial frauds that the victim is unable to point to a smoking gun and must prove its case by inference to be drawn cumulatively from different strands of circumstantial evidence.</p>

I accept that submission but again subject to this important caveat that plainly where there is no evidence of such connections it is necessary to be particularly astute to guard against falling into the error of tarring all clients Defendants with the same brush.

When I scan them I will forward them to you, you will laugh SO much!!!”. Mr Colley relied: “Yeah, tight trousers. Nice. I reckon he’ll get the job, Credit Derivatives”.</p>

She said that Ms Pearlman had a property business in Marbella in Spain to which there was reference in an earlier email. In the emails Mr Colley and Ms Pearlman appeared to discuss a planned visit by Mr Colley to Marbella. In answer to a question as to who he was thinking of coming with Mr Colley replied that it would be “me, Adam (who was there two week back) a couple of others from Merrill Lynch and Ben Rossfield. Do you remember Ben?” As can be seen the terms and context of that email suggest that the Adam referred to was a mutual friend of Mr Colley and Ms Pearlman and that Mr Colley was planning to go on holiday with 4 people, one of whom was Adam and another of whom was Mr Rossfield. Mr Rossfield is the 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Defendant. He placed 111 bets during the period of the alleged fraud of which 21 benefited from having been opened after the insertion of a false dividend and closed after its removal.</p>

Those transactions were on five different US stocks. Before his allegedly dishonest bets commenced there were only eight deals on Mr Jeffcoate’s account. During the period of the allegedly fraudulent bets there were a total of 41 deals. The six transactions for which there was audited information identified Mr Colley’s PC number 3034 as the PC number from which the false dividend was added, the PC having been logged in under Mr Colley’s details. The dividends were removed either the day after they were inserted or the day after that.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment the evidence in relation to Mr Jeffcoate provides powerful support to IG Index’s case both that the insertion and removal of false dividends was deliberate and dishonest and that it was Mr Colley who dishonestly inserted and removed them. It is in my judgment probable that Mr Jeffcoate was an accomplice of Mr Colley, albeit on a small scale, and that he both benefited and was intended by Mr Colley to benefit from the insertion and removal of false dividends in respect of the nine transactions relied on by IG Index. If the insertions and removals were done by Mr Colley, it is in my judgment very unlikely to have been an innocent error if the only IG Index client to benefit by placing bets on the relevant stocks was his girlfriend’s father. If the insertions were dishonest it is in my view more likely that the person who did the insertions was a dealer whose girlfriend’s father placed the bets which benefited from them rather than any other dealer.</p>

His then partner was a friend of Mr Slaney’s wife from the gym they both went to. He accepted that £159 was not cheap but said that he remembered that his partner paid him back.

However even if the friendship was confined to Mr Colley’s ex partner and Mr Slaney’s wife the nature and extent of that friendship which it is possible to infer from the email in my judgment leant considerable weight to IG Index’s case that it is extremely unlikely that Mr Slaney should by chance rather than by prior arrangement with Mr Colley have placed 46 bets which benefited from the insertion and removal of false dividends or that the insertion and removal of those dividends should have been done by someone other than Mr Colley.</p>

That is because it is accepted by all parties that Mr Teller placed all the bets on the accounts in the names of Mr Osborn and his mother and sister on their behalf. I do, as I have indicated, accept that the friendship between Mr Colley and Mr Teller does support IG Index’s case in the respects and for the reasons I have given. In so far as some of the transactions which benefited from the insertion and removal of false dividends were placed by Mr Teller on the accounts of Mr Osborn and Mr Teller’s mother and sister that fact in my judgment does provide further support for IG Index’s case in that it increases the unlikelihood that the bets placed by Mr Teller on those other accounts as well as on his own which benefited from the insertion and removal of false dividends all benefited therefrom by coincidence or by the fact that he happened in each case to identify them as potentially profitable bets to place. It also increases the unlikelihood that the insertions and removals were made by someone other than Mr Colley.</p>

(CPR 33.2(2)(a)(b)). I was not told that IG Index had so informed the other parties and I infer that it did not do so because had it considered that it had satisfied the requirements for relying on Ms Dove’s witness statement as hearsay evidence I would have expected Mr Mayall to rely on the contents of her witness statement not only in relation to the extract shown to Mr Colley but more generally.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There was some discussion during the trial as to what weight if any should be attached to the fact that certain of the Defendants and the other three alleged dishonest clients were Facebook friends of each other and/or Mr Colley. I accept the submission of the Defendants that it cannot be inferred from the fact that people are Facebook friends that they are friends in the general sense of having a friendship. Nonetheless in the present context it seems to me that what is material is that the Facebook evidence shows that there was at least some connection between various of the Defendants and other alleged dishonest clients even if it went no further than that they knew of each other and/or had friends or acquaintances in common. To that extent I consider that that evidence goes some way to providing further support for IG Index’s case as to the unlikelihood of the insertion and removal of false dividends having been done by someone other than Mr Colley, or having been done by Mr Colley by mistake and that the insertions and removals were intended to and did benefit accomplice clients by enabling them to place bets at a favourable price. In all these cases it must be remembered that (1) if the dividends were inserted by someone other than Mr Colley it is remarkable that the only client who placed a bet was connected directly or indirectly to Mr Colley and there was no evidence of connections with other IG Index dealers and (2) if Mr Colley inserted the dividends dishonestly to benefit accomplice it is remarkable that the real accomplice did not place a bet and the only person who did just happened to be connected to Mr Colley.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However the position in relation to Ms Cooper and Ms Dove in my judgment goes further. Mrs Benn’s evidence was that they were both former girlfriends of Tom Benn. That direct evidence of a very close connection between three more of the clients who placed bets which benefited from the insertion and removal of false dividends in my judgment adds to the unlikelihood of all those favourable bets having been placed other than as a result of a tip off from the person inserting and removing the dividends. I repeat the comments I made in relation to Mr Teller placing bets on behalf of Mr Osborn, and his sister and mother. Moreover this must be seen in the context that Tom Benn allowed judgment to be entered against him in default of a fully particularised defence in the sum of no less than £197,317. It does not seem to me unreasonable given the size of that default judgment and the serious nature of the fraud allegations made against Tom Benn to draw, in the absence of any alternative explanation, adverse inferences as to his involvement in the alleged fraud. Moreover there was a large number of bets placed by Tom Benn where there was audited information identifying Mr Colley’s computer as being the source of the insertion and removal of dividends. Also striking in this context is the fact that during the period in which she is alleged to have placed dishonest bets, Ms Dove placed only eight bets in all with IG Index, no fewer than three of which benefited from the insertion and removal of false dividends. As to Ms Cooper it is also striking that of the three bets placed on her account which benefited from the insertion and removal of false dividends, audited information showed that in respect of two of them the insertions and deletions were made on a computer logged in under Mr Colley’s details and in both cases the dividends were inserted two or three minutes before the bet was placed and removed the following day.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is in my judgment abundantly clear on all the evidence that the false dividends were inserted and removed not by coincidence or by error but deliberately and dishonestly. I have referred to the relevant evidence and arguments. By way of summary and again in no particular order it is in my judgment clear beyond argument that the dividends were false in the sense that they did not reflect either dividends that had been announced or dividends that were reasonably anticipated. Mr Gordon’s evidence on this point was utterly compelling and not seriously challenged. The fact that the insertions had to be manually inserted into SuperDiv before being inserted into Xcon shows that the person doing the insertion must have noticed both the wholly disproportionate size of the dividends and inserted an Ex-Date which did not in truth exist. It defies common sense to suppose that on no fewer than 130 documented occasion a dealer or dealers could have entered such false data without realising that it was false.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The fact that the false dividends were inserted on no few than 130 occasions by a person using only one username and by inference password makes it all the more fanciful in my judgment to suppose that these hugely and obviously inflated false dividends were on every occasion inserted in error without the person inserting them being aware that they could not possibly be accurate. That is so irrespective of whether the person doing the inserting was Mr Colley or an anonymous person using his username.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment it further beggars belief that 130 mistakes were repeated also by mistake when the audited Xcon information shows that the equally obviously wrong dividends were subsequently removed with no follow up action to investigate and contact clients who had dealt an the false price. In my judgment the overwhelming inference is that the person removing the false dividend no less than the person inserting it must have been aware that the dividends were false.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Gordon said that if a pricing error was discovered by a share dealer there was a set procedure. First he would correct the price and then establish if a client had dealt at the false price. The client agreement would allow IG Index to force the client to accept a change to the contract price but if it was only a small difference IG Index would as a gesture of good will give the client a choice of either voiding the contract or keeping it. He would expect a dealer who discovered a pricing error to wonder how the false dividend got into the pricing system. He would expect the person who discovered it to report it as very unusual unless they got the client to agree to change the price. It would in the main be unusual enough to be reported to Mr Gordon because of the size of the erroneous dividends. There were in this case 415 false dividends removed, 125 of them in circumstances where the detail of the size and date of the removal was proved by audited information. Yet the contract price of the bets which benefited from the initial dividends having been inserted was in no case amended nor was there any evidence of the dealer who removed the false dividend having reported the matter to Mr Gordon or Mr Tibbs or having initiated any enquires or investigations. It is again in my judgment not credible if the removals were done by mistake, that on so many occasions either the mistake was not noticed or if it was noticed for some innocent reason the dealer neither altered the contract price nor reported the matter nor investigated it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Further and closely allied to the last point the very fact that in respect of 125 of the 130 documented transactions the false dividend as removed as well as inserted by a person using the same username strongly suggests that it is inherently extremely unlikely that identical false dividends were entered by mistake and then removed by mistake by the same person.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I also consider that the evidence of the timing both of the insertions and removals of the false dividends lends strong support to the dividends having been dishonestly inserted and removed to benefit accomplice clients. In particular the proximity between the insertion of the dividend and the placing of the relevant bet on so many occasions in circumstances where the person placing the bet stood to benefit financially and where there was almost always only one person placing the bet makes it inherently unlikely that on each occasion the bet was placed either by chance or for some independent legitimate investment reason. That is particularly so given that the only common factor to all the bets which made them attractive was the insertion of a false dividend. There was no corresponding drop in the underlying price of  the shares and the no reason why an innocent client who happened to notice the price drop were regard that fact in itself as a good buying opportunity. (This unlikelihood is very significantly increased in my view by the fact that on very many occasions the person placing the bet was shown to be a friend of the person whose username was used to insert and remove the dividend. However as mentioned above this is an additional point supporting a conclusion which does not depend on it.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The other timing points are also in my judgment compelling. In particular the fact that in almost every case the bet was closed only after the dividend was removed is very powerful evidence. If there was a fraud it could only work if the dividend was removed before the bet was closed. If there was no fraud it is an astonishing coincidence that in almost all cases the lucky placer of the bet did not close the bet until the dividend was removed and then in most cases closed the bet soon after it was removed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is also striking that almost none of the false dividends were removed on the same day on which they were inserted. That had the consequence that they would not be and indeed in almost every case were not detected by either of the two checks which could only detect a contract price affected by the insertion of a false dividend if the false dividend was removed on the same day. If neither the insertions nor the removals were deliberate and dishonest it is a remarkable coincidence that the falsity was in every case removed presumably because it was noticed but in no case noticed or removed on the same day as the insertion.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The fact that very many of the false dividends were inserted and the consequential bets placed shortly before the close of the US market provides some, but in my judgment less, support for the conclusion that there was a fraud. It is certainly consistent with the fraudster having wished to minimise the chance of an innocent client placing a bet on the relevant stock after the dividend had been inserted thus giving rise to a risk of the innocent client raising the matter with IG Index leading to enquiries which might reveal the fraud. However this must be seen in the context that on not a small number of occasions the dividend was left in the price after the opening of the US market the following day, thus giving rise to a similar risk of an innocent client placing a bet at the distorted price. Indeed in some cases the dividend was left in for more than one day. It is however the case that on very many occasions the dividend was removed the next day and on many occasions before the US market opened. </p>

When he gave evidence Mr Colley accepted that jamesco@igpc was his username and that in respect of the 130 occasions on which the audited information showed that dividends had been inserted from terminal 3034 with the username jamesco@igpc the person who inserted the dividends was either Mr Colley or someone using his password and username. If the dividends on those 130 occasions were inserted fraudulently he accepted that he was in the frame. If it was someone else using his username and password Mr Colley said that it was impossible for him to suggest who that was. In his witness statement he said that passwords were known amongst dealers on the desk meaning that it was quite easy to place deals on anyone else’s desk PC.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">If the false dividends were deliberately inserted and removed by someone who realised that they did not reflect genuine announced or anticipated dividends the only rational explanation is that the purpose was to benefit a client who would place a bet on the relevant stock. In all these cases with one exception there was no evidence of any other clients placing bets on the relevant stocks. There are thus two possibilities. Either the person who placed the bet was the person intended to benefit or not only was the person who placed the bet not intended to benefit but for some unexplained reason the person who was intended to benefit by the anonymous fraudster failed to do so. Of these two possibilities it is in my view abundantly clear that the former is by far the more probable. That being so the inference must be that the person who dishonestly inserted and removed the false dividends intended to confer an illegitimate financial benefit on among others the father in law of Mr Colley’s partner, two friends of Mr Colley’s with whom he planned to go on holiday, another friend of Mr Colley’s with whom he planned to go on holiday, and the husband of a friend of Mr Colley’s partner. In my judgment it would be fanciful to conclude that another anonymous dealer somehow obtained Mr Colley’s username and password and used them to make dishonest insertions and removals of dividends in order to benefit a series of people with such close personal connections to Mr Colley rather than for the benefit of his or her own friends or relations.</p>

Ms Crowther examined IG Index’s personnel records for the period between September 2005 and September 2008 during which the allegedly fraudulent transactions took place to see if any false dividends were inserted on days when Mr Colley was out of the office. Copies of the records were exhibited to her first witness statement and adduced in evidence. They showed that there were only four days when false dividends were inserted on which, according to the records, Mr Colley appeared not to have been in the office. Moreover on making further enquiries Ms Crowther identified evidence suggesting that Mr Colley was in fact in the office on those four dates. Thus on 7 October 2005 Mr Colley was shown as having a half day annual leave. His shift started at 4:30 p.m. and allegedly fraudulent bets were placed at 5:42 p.m. and 7:56 p.m. On 27 August 2008 the records showed that Mr Colley was on a half day annual leave but did not indicate whether he took the morning or afternoon off. However the email archive showed that Mr Colley sent his first work email at 1:47 p.m. and his last at 9:29 p.m. suggesting that he took the morning off work and was at work in the afternoon/evening shift.

That raises the question whether the holiday records may more generally have been inaccurate. However Ms Bornor said that her department coordinated holiday leave policy and insured that details of all holiday records were maintained with particular reference to the area in which Mr Colley worked. The holiday details were extremely accurate. They had to be because there were different shifts and everyone had to ensure that there was sufficient manning for each shift. Her understanding with regard to the area in which Mr Colley worked was that the rota was planned at least one week in advance on a spreadsheet. If someone wanted a holiday they sent an email to the coordinator. If someone booked a holiday and then changed it they had to correct the entries. Otherwise they would be logged as having a holiday which in fact they had not had. </p>

A deal could only be processed if the dealer was logged in under their own password and if they left the machine logged on and unattended for more than 10 minutes the screen would go blank and require the dealer’s password to unlock it.

Although the two instances in which the holiday records were shown to have been inaccurate raise a question as to whether there may have been other inaccuracies, it is striking that Mr Gordon’s evidence that Mr Colley was the only dealer present on all 482 dates when dividend insertions or removals were proved by direct primary evidence or, as I accept, by inference to have been made Mr Colley was the only dealer present is not dependent on the accuracy of the IG Index holiday records. </p>

Making all possible allowances for the natural stress and anxiety which anyone might feel on being asked by their employer to explain suspicious and apparently dishonest transactions executed by someone using their username and by inference password, I find it striking that at no time either before Mr Colley’s meeting with Ms Bornor and Mr Noble or thereafter did Mr Colley protest his innocence. At no point did he deny knowingly entering and removing false dividends or even deny in the most general terms that he had been dishonest. He certainly did not at that meeting suggest that someone else must or may have been using his username and password. He had worked at IG Index at a senior level on a good salary for nine years and yet did nothing to contest his summary dismissal for dishonesty.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However I am satisfied that the insertion and removal of the dividends was done deliberately and dishonestly even without reliance on the connections between Mr Colley and the alleged accomplice clients and the connections between the clients. That said I do also consider that the fact that on so many occasions the people who benefited from the false insertion and dividends placed by someone using Mr Colley’s username and password were close friends of his does provide further evidential support for the conclusion which I have already reached for other reasons that the insertions and deletions were dishonestly done in order to benefit clients. Since there is no evidence that either Mr Colley or any other dealer placed bets which benefited from the insertion and removal of false dividends it would be necessary for the fraud to work, if there was a fraud, that friends of the fraudster would place bets at the artificially depressed prices created by the insertion. The fact that that is in my judgment precisely what the evidence shows happened makes it far more likely in my judgment that the false dividends were deliberately and dishonestly inserted and removed than that they should on so many separate occasions have been inserted and removed by error.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A further factor which contributes to my conclusion that Mr Colley dishonestly entered and removed false dividends to benefit clients was the manner in which he dealt with his friendships with the alleged client accomplices. In his witness statement he completely ignored Ms Crowther’s statement that she believed that Frederick Jeffcoate was the father of his girlfriend and his account of his connection with Adam Teller was in my view deliberately misleading as was his statement that he had no contact with Mr Rossfield and did not know him. I am satisfied that this was designed to avoid any conclusion that any false dividends entered and removed using his username were designed to benefit his friends. Nor do I consider that that attempt to mislead was motivated by a fear that an otherwise good defence might be wrongly undermined. As I have mentioned before Mr Colley neither in his witness statement nor in cross examination gave any plausible innocent explanation for the many matters to which I have referred which were relied on by IG Index in their case against him. His denial in the witness box that he was a friend of Mr Teller was not even supported by Mr Teller and was in my view deliberately untruthful, as was his sophistic denial that he knew Mr Rossfield.</p>

However the basic facts, when one stands back and looks at them, are very simple and very stark. On 130 occasions massive dividends were inserted into US stocks. They were so high that it would have been obvious to any experienced dealer that they could not possibly reflect any dividend announced by the company and could not reasonably be anticipated by anyone in IG Index. Assuming that it was he who inserted the dividends he typed them into SuperDiv on no fewer than 130 occasions and then transferred them into Xcon. On every occasions a client placed a bet at the artificially depressed price and either the next day or a few days later in all but five cases Mr Colley, assuming it was him, removed the dividend but did not take any or any effective steps either to change the price at which the client had bet or to initiate investigations or enquiries or report the matter to his superiors.</p>

The basic pattern was the same in respect of the 285 transactions as it was in the case of the 130. That is to say a massive and obviously false dividend was inserted and then removed for no good reason. A client derived financial benefit by placing a bet at the artificially depressed priced caused by the insertion of the dividend and then closing the bet after the dividend was removed. The friends of Mr Colley who placed bets which were among the 130 for which there was Xcon audited information were also among those who placed bets which benefited from the 285 transactions.</p>

It is in my judgment implicit in that allegation that it was agreed between the client Defendants and Mr Colley that he would and that Mr Colley did in some way profit from the fact that the clients who placed the bets were acting in concert with him by payments or the conferring of other financial benefits from them to him.</p>

In my judgment it does not.  That is principally for three reasons. First in my judgment the generality of the other evidence is overwhelming. Second it does not follow from IG Index’s inability to adduce evidence of particular payments from Mr Colley’s alleged accomplices to Mr Colley’s bank accounts that no payments or other financial benefits were made by them to him. In my judgment it is probable that they were Third it is not necessary in order for IG Index to succeed against Mr Colley for it to prove that the friends (or relatives of friends) whom he enabled to benefit by placing bets at artificially depressed prices shared some of their profits with him. While that would be the most obvious motive for Mr Colley’s dishonest conduct it could also have been motivated by a desire simply to confer benefits on his friends. Of these three reasons the latter is the one on which I place least weight. As to the second it would not be surprising if, as part of the precautions taken to avoid detection or subsequent proof of fraud, Mr Colley had been paid by his accomplices in cash or in some other way than traceable payments into his main bank accounts.</p>

In my judgement the nature of the fraud carried out by Mr Colley, the length of time over which it was perpetrated, the large number of fraudulent bets which were placed and the substantial profits which were created in the hands of his client accomplices make it very unlikely that Mr Colley would have carried out the fraud, with all the adverse consequences in the event of detection, unless it had been agreed with the client accomplices that they would and unless in fact, at least in most cases, they did make payments to or confer other financial benefits on him in return for being given the opportunity to profit from the fraud.</p>

I am satisfied that the dividends were false in the sense that they did not reflect either announcements by the relevant companies of dividends which were to be paid or genuine estimates by IG Index or anyone else of dividends which would be announced in the future. I am satisfied that when he inserted the false dividends Mr Colley was aware that they were false in the sense just referred to and that when he removed them he was aware that the removals did not reflect any actual change in relation to real dividends. I am satisfied that he made the insertions and removals dishonestly with the intention that particular clients who were either friends of his or relatives of friends of his friends would thereby be enabled to place bets at the artificially depressed prices created by the insertion of false dividends and to close the bets after the prices had risen by reason of the removal of the dividends thereby resulting in unwarranted fraudulent financial benefit to them. I am satisfied that in order to enable those particular clients to place and close bets at favourable prices Mr Colley communicated to them (or to the person placing a bet on their behalf) the name of the US stock into which he had inserted or was going to insert a false dividend and the date and time on which he had removed or was going to remove it. I am satisfied that in acting as he did he acted in concert with the clients whom he wished to benefit and agreed with them that they would make payments or confer benefits on him in return for being given the opportunity to make unwarranted and fraudulent profits.</p>

When assessing the probabilities the court will have in mind as a factor, to whatever extent is appropriate in the particular case, that the more serious the allegation the less likely it is that the event occurred and, hence, the stronger should be the evidence before the court concludes that the allegation is established on the balance of probabilities. Fraud is usually less likely than negligence…built into the preponderance of probabilities standard is a generous degree of flexibility in respect of the seriousness of the allegations. Although the result is much the same this does not mean that where a serious allegation is in issue the standard of proof required is higher. It means only that the inherent probability or improbability of an event is itself a matter to be taken into account when weighing the probabilities and deciding whether, on balance, the event occurred. The more improbable the event, the stronger must be the evidence that it did occur before, on the balance of probability, its occurrence will be established.”</p>

There is only one rule of law, namely that the occurrence of the fact in issue must be proved to have been more probable than not. Common sense, not law, requires that in deciding this question, regard should be had, to whatever extent appropriate, to inherent probabilities. If a child alleges sexual abuse by a parent, it is common sense to start with the assumption that most parents do not abuse their children. But this assumption may be swiftly dispelled by other compelling evidence of the relationship between parent and child or parent and other children. It would be absurd to suggest that the tribunal must in all cases assume that serious conduct is unlikely to have occurred. In many cases, the other evidence will show that it was all too likely. If, for example, it is clear that a child was assaulted by one or other of two people, it would make no sense to start one’s reasoning by saying that assaulting children is a serious matter and therefore neither of them is likely to have done so. The fact is that one of them did and the question for the tribunal is simply whether it is more probable that one rather than the other was the perpetrator.” (para 15)</p>

In particular on all issues where a question arises whether particular conduct was dishonest or fraudulent on the one hand or innocent on the other I have proceeded on the basis that it is inherently more likely to have been innocent. However on the question of whether the false dividends were inserted by Mr Colley or by someone else it is in my judgement clear on the evidence that someone inserted them. The question for me is whether it is more probable that Mr Colley inserted them rather than some other anonymous person. Having said that, however, I wish to emphasise that in my judgement on this latter question no less than on the other questions which I have had to consider, the evidence pointing to the allegations against Mr Colley being true was very compelling.</p>

Although one of the factors which in my judgment points strongly towards the conclusions which I have reached that Mr Colley perpetrated a series of dishonest transactions over a three year period was the evidence of his friendships with several of the other Defendants and his direct or indirect connection with others of them, IG Index itself accepted that it does not follow from the fact that Mr Colley dishonestly inserted false dividends that every client who placed a bet on a stock into which he had inserted a dividend did so dishonestly as a result of having been alerted by Mr Colley that he had done or would do so. It is therefore necessary to consider the case against each of the other Defendants separately on its own merits. It does however follow, in my judgment, that since, as I hold below, Mr Colley’s conduct was a breach of his contractual and/or fiduciary duties to IG Index and was a fraud on IG Index that he is liable to compensate IG Index for all losses resulting from bets placed by clients which benefited from his false insertion and removal of dividend whether or not the client was an accomplice and participated in his fraud.</p>

None of the dividends was removed on the same day on which they were inserted and on all but five occasions the dividends were removed the next day by which time the disparity between the contract price at which Mr Teller placed his bet and the restored IG Index futures price would not have been detected by the two IG Index checks  to which I have referred.

He would watch and trade a wide range of financial products, futures, UK and US equities, currencies, commodities and indices. Between 1999 and 2008 he traded a huge amount of diverse products. He would trade over the phone, by the internet or by mobile. He would trade at any time of the day. All prices he traded on were executed in good faith based on the prices he saw in front of him.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Mayall put it to Mr Teller that if it was anticipated that a dividend would be paid before the expiry of a futures contract and he had to pay the same price for the futures contract as for the underlying stock you would be a fool to enter the futures contract because you would miss out on the dividend. He therefore put it to Mr Teller that he knew that the futures price included an allowance for dividends. Mr Teller denied that, which in my view was a deliberate lie, as was his response to Mr Mayall’s proposition that if there was no difference between the way in which the cash and the futures prices were made up no-one would place a futures bet because they would not get the dividend. Mr Teller’s response that he was unaware of that and did not understand how dividends worked was in my view wholly implausible, even allowing for the fact that there are other advantages of spread betting as empowered with buying shares such as leverage and lack of capital gains tax.</p>

It was one of the trades on the Colley Master Detail Sheet May 12 which he placed for which there was Xcon audited information as to the date and time of the insertion of the dividend. A dividend of 500 cents was inserted at 20:41:40 some 7½ minutes before Mr Teller placed the bet. The audit information showed that the stock was one which did not pay dividends. The dividend was removed at 10:20:15 the next morning before the US market opened and Mr Teller closed his bet three days later.</p>

Towards the close of the US market he would look for stock with the biggest downward movement on the day because there was a good chance that the next day the price would bounce back. Such stocks might be oversold due to news. He would go through the US stock list on the IG dealing platform on the IG website looking through the list of losers or the stocks with the biggest potential fall. The stocks were listed alphabetically A – E, F – I etc. He flicked through 2,000 stocks.

There were other trades about which Mr Teller was not but could have been asked in which the gap between the insertion of the false dividend and his placing of the bet was even shorter. Thus for example on 3 January 2008 he placed a bet on a US stock at 20:57:37 only 45 seconds after a 500 cent dividend was inserted at 20:56:52. In that case he would have had 45 seconds within which his exercise of scrolling through 2,000 shares picked up the dramatic price fall if that was really the explanation for how he came to notice it. The explanation was in my view wholly implausible.</p>

At first he said that he used to compare the futures price offered by IG Index with those offered by two other futures operators, Finspreads and World Spreads with whom he also had accounts. He said that he had those prices open at the same time as the IG Index prices. Sometimes he said that the spread betting price offered by one operator could be out of line with those offered by others. The clear implication in my view was that he was suggesting that his reason for selecting the particular stocks on which he noticed a sharp drop in the IG Index price was that he checked the price offered on the same stock by Finspreads and World Spreads and saw that the sharp downward movement of the IG Index price was not mirrored in the Finspreads and World Spreads prices.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">When Mr Mayall pointed out the complete implausibility of IG Index offering a price 5 dollars cheaper those offered by World Spreads and Finspreads, both of whom took their underlying cash price from Bloomberg so that the only difference in prices offered between the firms was the spread, Mr Teller floundered. His first response when Mr Mayall put it to him that if the different operators offered wildly different prices people would arbitrage was to say that he was sure they did. Faced with the implausibility of that answer, Mr Teller changed tack. When it was put to him that it was not probable that there would be a 5 dollar difference in the spread offered by IG Index and the other operators, Mr Teller said that he might not have compared the IG Index price with those offered by the other spread betters. Instead he might have looked at the percentage change in the IG Index price on the day in the particular stock that he was looking at. At this point Mr Mayall put it to Mr Teller that he was making it up as he went along, which in my judgment accurately described Mr Teller’s evidence. When it was put by Mr Mayall that there was no time to check the change in IG Index prices, Mr Teller changed tack again and said that price comparison was only one way of trading. There were many others. One method he used was to look at CNBC and to do research on particular stocks. When it was pointed out by Mr Mayall that if the reason he selected all the nearly 80 stocks on his own account which benefited from the insertion of false dividends was because of what he saw on CNBC and had nothing to do with the downward spike caused by the false dividend it was a coincidence that he happened to get the benefit of the downward spike in price. To that Mr Teller replied that he would have seen the downward spike. Asked if he was saying that for each of the 160 allegedly fraudulent bets placed on his account and the others on which he traded the reason he placed the bets was because he saw the downward spike Mr Teller said that it was. He then said it was probably only a small number of those which he checked against Finspreads and World Spreads. When it was put to him that that answer was ridiculous because the other operators might offer a better price than IG Index, Mr Teller changed tack again and said that sometimes the other operators would not accept a bet due to its size. When it was put to him that he would nonetheless look to check the prices offered by Finspreads and World Spreads Mr Teller said that he would not. He said that it never struck him as odd that there were huge disparities in prices between those offered by Finspreads and World Spreads and the IG prices. He said that he knew that lots of mistakes can happen in the market. He also said that he never compared the IG Index futures price against the underlying cash price because the cash price was always delayed on the Internet. Again I found that implausible and inconsistent with his evidence that at work he would have open eight screens and a price feed and at home two or three screens.</p>

He said that the proceedings had put a huge strain on his family, which is why “we” got to the point that “we” had to take a view as a family on various accounts. He wished they could have fought the claim all the way and although confident there was always that uncertainty of coming out victorious, coupled with other things “we as a family” had to take into account. It was a huge claim against the family so his parents made a commercial decision to settle his mother’s account of £16,295. “We” understood that that amount with interest and costs added to it would jump very quickly. His parents also decided to settle his sister’s account of £45,285. He said that decision was based on a couple of key reasons. First, his sister was then teaching in Israel and “we” did not think it was fair in many ways to bring her back for a trial due to the stress and time off etc. Also his sister has a history of anorexia and depression which she suffered for years and “we” did not want to put any strain on her or unsettle her in any way. Thirdly, “we” chose to settle Mr Cowan’s account of £18,245. Although the account was in Mr Cowan’s name it was fully Mr Teller’s responsibility and there was always the risk of losing a trial and he did not want that hanging over Mr Cowan and his wife and two children. It was not fair. He did not want him potentially receiving any judgment or dragging him into a trial in relation to something he had nothing to do with. His complete lack of funds which were thrown towards his legal costs meant that his parents settled those claims from their own funds.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Teller in cross-examining Mr Colley asked him if Mr Teller had ever paid Mr Colley cash before, during or after the alleged fraud. Although technically this was cross-examination it was in reality a friendly full toss which Mr Colley had no difficulty despatching to the boundary by answering that he did not. By asking the question Mr Teller demonstrated in my judgment that it was clear to him, and in my view to all the parties, that it was a part of IG Index’s case that the client Defendants agreed to and did make payments to or confer benefits on Mr Colley in return for being given the opportunity to make unwarranted and fraudulent profits at IG Index’s expense. The same is true in my view of the fact that Mr Colley asked Mr Osborn in cross examination if Mr Osborn had ever given him money (to which the answer was no). As I have already indicated in the context of my findings in relation to Mr Colley, I have taken very carefully into account and weighed in the scales in favour of Mr Teller that IG Index did not adduce any direct evidence of payments directly or indirectly from Mr Teller to Mr Colley. However, in my judgment the weight attributable to the absence of such evidence is insufficient to outweigh the strength of the evidence to which I have referred, which leaves me in no doubt that Mr Teller was an accomplice of Mr Colley with whom he acted in concert in placing the 160 bets which are the subject of this claim, knowing that because of Mr Colley’s insertion and removal of false dividends the bets would defraud IG Index. When Mr Osborn gave evidence he said that whenever he paid Mr Teller, pursuant to his agreement to pay him two thirds of the profit on any bet placed by Mr Teller on Mr Osborn’s account, he always did so in cash at Mr Teller’s request. Since profits on spread betting were tax-free and there was no obvious legitimate reason why Mr Teller would wish to be paid in cash, that evidence contributed to my conclusion that Mr Colley’s denial that Mr Teller ever paid him cash was probably untrue. However even if it was true, I consider it probable that in one way or another Mr Teller conferred made payment to or financial benefits on Mr Colley in consideration of his enabling him dishonestly to place bets with IG Index at artificially depressed prices and did so pursuant to agreement with Mr Colley.</p>

Mr Teller did so dishonestly and in concert with Mr Colley, having been informed by Mr Colley in advance that he had inserted or would insert large false dividends which did not reflect announced or genuinely anticipated dividends, together with the times and dates and that when he closed them he did so having been told by Mr Colley that he had removed or would remove the false dividends together with the dates and times. I find that he participated with Mr Colley in a fraud designed to enable him to profit by placing bets with IG Index at prices which were below those which IG Index would have offered without the insertion of false dividends and below those which reflected the underlying cash market prices of the stocks. I find that he did so in pursuance of an agreement with Mr Colley that they would do so and that it is likely that as part of that agreement he agreed to make payments to or confer other financial benefits on Mr Colley and subsequently did make payments or confer other financial benefits on him in return for being given the opportunity to place bets at manipulated prices at the expense to IG Index. I find that when he paced the bets Mr Teller was trading fraudulently and that he was a willing participant in Mr Colley’s fraudulent activities.</p>

He said that live share price graphs of individual stocks in more volatile markets offered by IG Index’s pure dealing trading platform showed that in the peaks and troughs created from shares being bought and sold there was an underlying median price to which it would almost return. If the peak or trough was great enough to beat IG Index’s spread costs and the spike was not related to an obvious underlying cause in the market he would sometimes trade on those differences to realise a very quick profit.

Generally he decided to bet either because he felt from information on the internet that a stock was a good buy or if he observed a particular stock in more detail and there was a big spike in the share price when he was on the IG screen he might buy it. It was always based on some kind of information. Generally when he placed a bet he looked at the IG Index screen. He had no financial feeds open but might have looked at the Internet.

To ensure I recorded his answer accurately I asked: “ On the screen it showed 20 to 40 at a time. Is that what…?” Mr Slaney replied: “Yes. You could either narrow it down to look at individual stock or (pause) in fact it was probably more than 40 I couldn’t say with any certainty.” When Mr Mayall put it to him that at any one time he would be looking at a maximum of 40, Mr Slaney said that there could be more than 40 he did not want to take it as gospel but he agreed that he was able to look at a number of stocks. He said that if he bought a stock a few minutes after the price came down after a dividend had been inserted, if it was not one which he had researched and had gone into the IG Index screen to buy, he was saying that he bought it because he just happened to notice the price drop on the IG Index screen.</p>

If the screen was not open on the page on which the relevant stock appeared he would not know about the spike. He was asked if he was saying that it was a coincidence that on the 46 times when a false dividend was inserted into a US stock he happened to be on the page on which that stock appeared. He said that that was what he was saying. When it was put to him that he was a very lucky man Mr Slaney said that he thought he was. It was thus pure chance that on each of the 46 occasions when there was a sharp downward spike in the price of a US stock caused by the insertion of a dividend he happened to have either the alphabetical page on which that stock appeared open or the page which showed only details of that stock open. As Mr Mayall pointed out to him if there were 40 US Stocks listed on each alphabetical page, given that there were 2000 US Stocks offered by IG Index there was only a one in fifty chance of the relevant page showing the stock with its downward spike being open at any given moment. If there were only 20 stocks listed per page there was only a one in a hundred chance. If Mr Slaney had open a page having only the details of one stock there was only a one in 2000 chance of that page being open at the time of the downward spike in that stock. </p>

There are only two ways in which he could become aware of such a downward spike. Either he had open one of the pages listing US stocks in alphabetical order. Or he had open the page showing the individual stock. If it was the latter the chances against Mr Slaney happening to have open the page showing only that relevant stock were 2000 to 1 against. If it was the former the chances depended on how many stocks appeared on any one page. In a written response to Mr Mayall’s closing written submissions Mr Slaney did not take issue with the proposition that he had placed all of his 46 bets as a result of seeing the downward spike in the futures price. However he challenged the submission that he had accepted in his evidence that only between 20 and 40 of the 2000 US stocks quoted by IG Index would be shown on any particular screen page on the IG Index screen. He said that in his evidence he had said that he could not remember and that it was possibly that amount. </p>

However it was striking that his initial answer was that there were definitely 20, 30 or 40 names per page. I had the impression that when, after a pause, he changed his evidence to say that it was probably more than 40 that was prompted not by a better recollection but rather by a realisation of the extreme improbability of him having had open on the screen, on no fewer that 46 separate occasions, the one page out of a possible 50 on which appeared a US stock into which a false dividend had been inserted leading to a shard downward spike in the price.</p>

If for example it had been 70 to 1000 or even more than that, I consider it unlikely either that Mr Slaney would have given the original testimony he did or that he would not have corrected that testimony to give some such indication. </p>

However it is in my judgment overwhelmingly unlikely that on so many occasions Mr Slaney would have placed bets on US stocks on which Mr Colley had inserted false dividends for no reason other than that he happened by chance to have open on the IG Index screen in the relevant window of time, which was often very short, the very page on which either the individual stock appeared on its own or on which it appeared with however many other US stocks appeared in the relevant alphabetical page which listed IG Index’s US stocks.

Asked whether he spotted these large profits overnight on the 46 trades Mr Slaney was evasive. He said that he had a stop loss and sometimes checked his profit and loss and sometimes did not. As was pointed out to him a stop loss would limit the downside risk of a further drop in the price but would not be a reason for not checking to see whether he had made a profit. </p>

As with Mr Teller I did not believe that evidence. Mr Slaney had on his own evidence spent some time practising with a paper portfolio before opening his IG index account and managed to trade so successfully that he was always able to use his profits to finance further trades and never had to deposit more collateral with IG index. He was sufficiently well informed to understand the utility of a stop loss and he said that he did a certain amount of market research. Nor did I find convincing his evidence that it was unlikely that he noticed in respect of any of the 46 trades that despite the fact that he made a large profit the underlying cash price had not changed so as to explain that profit because he did not understand how futures worked.  </p>

That did not engage with the question. At the end of his evidence Mr Slaney was asked if it was his case that he placed the 46 bets because of his research on the individual stocks or because he noticed the downward spike in the price or that he could not remember. At that stage he said that it could be either one. If he traded very soon after the downward spike in the price then his reason for placing the bet would have been the visual stimulus i.e. noticing the spike as opposed to an informed process based on information available on the internet. Although that answer appeared to be more limited that the general answer referable to all 46 trades to which I have referred earlier, it remained fundamentally implausible and incredible for the reasons I have given. </p>

It supports the conclusion which I reach that Mr Slaney was a dishonest accomplice of Mr Colley engaged in a fraudulent course of conduct designed to defraud and successful in defrauding IG Index by enabling him to place bets at artificially depressed prices. </p>

The fact that IG Index did not find any further evidence of a connection between Mr Colley and Mr Slaney does not mean that it was limited in the way claimed by Mr Colley and Mr Slaney. But even on the basis of the evidence of the email referring to the purchase of presents for Mr Slaney’s new born baby and the accompanying message, and the admitted friendship between Mr Slaney’s wife and Mr Colley’s former partner and the significant price of the presents, there is compelling evidence to support the inference that Mr Slaney was indeed the intended beneficiary of the financial advantage intended to be conferred by Mr Colley on the person whom he intended to place bets after he inserted 46 false dividends on the stocks on which Mr Slaney placed his bets.</p>

However, as pointed out by IG Index, Mr Colley did not send any email on his work address to any of the alleged accomplices or receive any email from them. The few references to the alleged accomplices found by Ms Crowther appeared only in social emails to third parties and the possibly unsolicited email to Mr Colley from the baby gift supplier. That is consistent with Mr Colley being careful not to leave an incriminating email trail on his work email address but, as not infrequently happens with frauds carried out over a long period of time, making a few small mistakes. </p>

He said that he started his employment with the Fire Brigade in 1995 and at the time of the alleged fraud would have served 14 years which is almost exactly half way through his career. His daughter was born in December 2005, the date of his first alleged trade being September 2005. He said that the bank statements he provided showed that in the three years prior to any alleged involvement in fraud he had earned £141,000 and was therefore financially secure. If he had got involved in the alleged fraud he would be risking not only losing his career in the Fire Brigade but also the pension he had paid into for 14 years plus a very real risk of going to prison and not being able to see his wife or new-born daughter. If he had given Mr Colley a cut of 50% of his profits on the allegedly fraudulent trades he would have been left with £85,000, £46,000 short of what he would have been earning by himself legitimately. </p>

However, it is outweighed by the strength of the evidence against Mr Slaney to which I have referred. As in the case of Mr Teller, it is in my judgment a probable inference from all the other evidence which has led me to conclude that Mr Slaney was an accomplice of Mr Colley when he placed the bets which are the subject of this claim, that he probably conferred some financial benefit directly or indirectly on Mr Colley in return for the profits he was able to make through the fraudulent bets.</p>

I find that he participated with Mr Colley in a fraud designed to enable him to profit by placing bets with IG Index at prices which were below those which IG Index would have offered without the insertion of false dividends and below those which reflected the underlying market cash prices of the stocks.

Seven of the relevant stocks had not declared a dividend before and on the other four the amount of the next real dividend paid by the stock in question after the allegedly fraudulent bet was placed ranged from 3.33 cents to 15 cents. On all 11 occasions the dividend was removed the following day before the opening of the US market, save in the case of the dividend inserted on Christmas Eve which was removed before the opening of the US market on the day after Christmas. All but one were removed by someone using Mr Colley’s computer reference. In respect of the 35 bets for which there was no Xcon audit information, Mr Gordon calculated, using the methodology to which I have referred, that large dividends ranging from about 200 to 600 cents were inserted on the date the bet was placed. The dividends were removed two days after insertion on 8 occasions, 3 days after insertion on 1 occasion and the next day on all the others. On 26 occasions bets were placed in a stock which had not declared a dividend before and in the remaining cases the next dividend announced after the date on which the bet was placed ranged in size from 3 cents to 52.5 cents.</p>

However, as a result of working in the financial markets he had become familiar with the sort of work which traders or market analysts carry out and considered himself to be reasonably familiar with the financial markets. In 1996 he worked at Cazenove where his principal job was to book and settle US equities trades executed for clients on the NYSE and NASDAQ exchanges.  Another part of his job involved collecting market data from other investment banks, Reuters Bloomberg and other publicly available materials to prepare daily reports for the equity trading desks concerning foreign exchange and other market and company news affecting international currency rates.

He noticed that the most successful clients would focus on specific market sectors.  In particular a number of Cazenove clients made large returns by successfully trading US securities in respect of technology, life sciences, natural resources and the healthcare sectors.  As a result he became more aware of the potential to make profits by buying and selling shares across specific sectors within the US equities markets particularly those which displayed greater levels of volatility such as those just mentioned and therefore had the ability to generate significant returns or losses.  </p>

He said that during the period between September 2004 and 2008 while he was working at Barclays Capital he created a spreadsheet of the US stocks he was interested in which was linked to Bloomberg so that live prices would be displayed in the spreadsheet for the stocks and indices he was monitoring at the time.  In oral testimony he said that there were also UK stocks on his spreadsheet. He had identified potentially interesting stocks through researching Stock Scouter and added and removed stocks from the spreadsheet on a regular basis.  The price monitoring spreadsheet grew organically over time. He said that approximately 2 or 3 years before his witness statement which was dated 27 April 2012 Barclays were undergoing a budgetary review which resulted in Bloomberg being removed from his work computer.  At that point he deleted the price monitoring spreadsheet as it became redundant without the live price feed of Bloomberg and he had ceased spread betting at that time.  He said that he no longer had a copy of it.  It was held on his work computer which he now no longer had access to and which he believed was re-formatted some time ago as a result of routine IT maintenance at Barclays Capital.  </p>

He spent large parts of each day keeping a close eye on the stock markets and would be in front of computer terminals for his entire working day which would keep him appraised of the markets.

He would first have searched the Natural Resources industries on MSN Money using the Stock Scouter.  He would have considered the rating of those companies listed with a high score usually not looking at companies with a score below 9 or 10.  On that occasion he would have identified that Hornbeck Offshore Services scored highly on the Stock Scouter and would have added the stock to his watch list in MSN Money and to his personal spreadsheet.  He could not confirm the date that he would have done that before making the bet but it would probably have been days before hand.  He would then have undertaken more web based research on the company before deciding to continue to monitor it.  </p>

He made bets on the prices indicated by IG Index and would have no reason to suspect that the price in that case had been fraudulently manipulated, if indeed it had been.</p>

In the case of each of the alleged fraudulent bets he said that he made his selection based on internet research through which he was well placed to spot any opportunities in the market.  He did not appreciate that IG Index had made a mistake in quoting certain stocks at prices which were below market.  He knew from his own experience of working in the financial markets that often different institutions quote different prices for the same stocks.  He also knew that different spread betting firms have different spreads.  He knew from previous dealing with IG Index that it had a large back office team which actively monitored all bets and had an internal system for contacting clients as soon as a Manifest Error was identified. He was contacted by IG Index on two or three occasions when Manifest Errors had been made in prices quoted for the stocks he had bet on and made corrections to the bets accordingly.  He exhibited and adduced into evidence transcripts of three voicemail conversations, one of which I have referred to earlier.  He was not notified by IG Index that the bets the subject of these proceedings were made on prices containing Manifest Errors and no corrections were made.  </p>

It was suggested to him that this was an illustration of the fact that he had tailored his witness statement by going through the 46 allegedly fraudulent bets which he had placed and pretending that they were in areas which he was interested in.  In his evidence in chief Mr Regan had corrected the reference to automotive and said that it should have read financial.  He explained that when he reviewed the stocks in which he dealt when preparing his witness statement he did it quickly and noticed that he had placed a bet in Phelps Dodge.  He did not think it was one of the 46 allegedly fraudulent bets.  He mistakenly thought that it was a stock in Dodge cars but in fact it was in mining.  He said that when in his witness statement he said that he would select other sectors it was not because he thought that he had done so.  Rather he had looked at the stocks in which he dealt throughout the whole of his account with IG Index and mistook Phelps Dodge as a car company.  However, he maintained that he had been interested in the sectors described in his witness statement and that every now and again he had read some news online about stocks which pricked his interest.  It was put to him that the reason he had written in his witness statement that every so often he would select other sectors such as the automotive was that he needed to come up with an explanation for why he had bet on a stock which was not in the few areas on which he said he focussed.  If that had really been the basis of his stock selection he would have realised that the automotive sector was not one of the other sectors he from time to time selected.  Mr Regan denied that.</p>

Mr Regan accepted that it was his practice to have open at the same time live cash prices for the stocks whose futures prices he was looking at on the IG website. If he realised that any material difference between the cash and futures price on a particular US stock must or at the very least was likely to be the result of a dividend being built into the IG Index futures price, he would have had no reason to interpret the price difference as a potential source of profit. If, as was the case in all the allegedly fraudulent bets which he placed for which there was audited information as to the date size and time of the inserted dividend, the dividend ranged between 3.5 and 6 dollars, one would have expected an experienced trader such as Mr Regan accepted that he was who carried out extensive research into the history of the US stocks in which he was interested, as Mr Regan said he did, to realise that dividends of such a size were entirely out of keeping with the level of dividends normally expected on US stocks. Further and in particular one would have expected him to be aware that seven of them had never declared a dividend, or at least to check and quickly discover that fact. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On that hypothesis Mr Regan would be likely to have realised that a false dividend had been inserted into the IG Index futures price. Unless on eleven separate occasions he considered that such large false dividends had been inserted by mistake and that by chance he happened to have them open in the few minutes between the dividend being inserted and the market closing, not something which Mr Regan said he thought, the only rational way in which Mr Regan could have thought that he could benefit from the price differential would be if he knew or had reason to believe that the dividend would be removed. </p>

He may of course have had sound or unsound reasons for thinking that the particular US stocks on which he bet would be likely to increase in price for reasons based on his research of the relevant stocks or the markets in which they operated, as was his evidence. But that would not provide an explanation as to why he placed the bets he did when he placed them. If one proceeds on the assumption that there is no financial benefit in placing a futures bet on a particular US stock after the price has been adjusted to reflect the announcement of a dividend rather than at any other time, one is left with the striking fact that Mr Regan happened to place eleven bets within minutes of the insertion of obviously false dividends for no apparent financial benefit unless he was aware that the false dividends were going to be removed. </p>

That unlikelihood is in my judgment compounded if one takes into account the evidence, which I have accepted, that Mr Colley dishonestly inserted false dividends with a view to benefiting particular accomplice clients on all 415 occasions which are the subject of this claim including the 35 bets placed by Mr Regan for which there was no audited information and the 11 for which there was. If there was no rational innocent reason for Mr Regan to think that there was extra profit to be made by placing a bet shortly after the opening up of a gap between the cash and futures price, in my judgment it beggars belief to suppose that he did so on no fewer than 46 occasions. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment the substantial unlikelihood of that having happened is made the more unlikely by two further factors. The first is that on all but one of the 46 bets no other IG Index client placed a bet with the benefit of the insertion of the false dividend. Thus not only was Mr Regan the only innocent IG Index client on 45 separate occasions to happen to place a bet on the relevant stock after the false dividend was inserted but in particular on all 45 occasions for some unexplained reason Mr Colley’s intended accomplice failed to place a bet, thereby rendering pointless Mr Colley’s dishonest insertion of the false dividend. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second factor is a consideration of Mr Regan’s trading history with IG Index. Mr White on behalf of Mr Regan emphasised that Mr Regan placed over 2,500 trades during the years in which he had an account with IG Index which he submitted placed the 46 allegedly fraudulent trades in context, by which I took him to mean, as did Mr Teller, that it renders less implausible the possibility that the 46 bets which happened to be placed and closed on dates which benefited from the insertion of a false dividend are explained by coincidence rather than dishonest collaboration with Mr Colley. While in principle I see the force of that point and it is a matter to be borne in mind and weighed in the balance it has to be set against a more detailed analysis of those 2,500 or so trades. (I also observe in passing that there is nothing in my judgment intrinsically implausible in a client who has placed a very large number of innocent bets over a long period of time having chosen to place a number of dishonest bets. That is a separate point from the one which I understood Mr White to advance).</p>

Thus although undoubtedly Mr Regan did place a number of none-fraudulent bets on US stocks both before and during the period when false dividends were inserted, they represented only a modest proportion of his overall trading and not only did he, alone of all IG Index clients, place bets which benefited from the insertion of false dividends on 46 US stocks, but no fewer than 85% of his bets on US stocks during this period were placed on stocks into which Mr Colley had placed a false dividend on the same day as the dividend was inserted and after it was inserted. </p>

I have no reason to doubt that Mr Regan with his long experience in working in the city and his record of a large volume of trading with IG Index did, as he said, engage in thorough research into possible stocks to bet on. However having listened to and watched Mr Regan very carefully as he gave his evidence I was satisfied that he was not giving a truthful account either of his understanding as to how IG Index calculated its futures prices or as to his reasons for placing bets on the stocks which benefited from the insertion and removal of false dividends. </p>

He thus had before him at the same time the live IG futures price and the live underlying cash price for the stocks. He said in relation to his bet on MTSC about which he was asked that he placed the bet because he thought the stock would go up having followed both it and other companies in its sector. However he also said that if, when he was logged onto the IG Index website, he saw that the futures price on one of the stocks on his watch list was lower than the cash price he would place a buy bet on it. </p>

At first he said that he understood that a futures price will usually mirror the cash price and that if there is a dividend in the futures price the futures price will be to that extent slightly lower than the cash price and that it would be slightly higher than the cash price because of interest. He also accepted that he would not expect the IG Index futures price to differ wildly from the cash price leaving aside dividend and interest. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It would seem to follow logically that his reaction on seeing a very sharp fall in the IG futures price compared to the cash price would be to assume that it reflected the insertion of a very large dividend. That of course is precisely what IG Index submitted he knew had happened because he had been tipped of by Mr Colley. However when it was put to him that the futures price and the cash price of MTSC having been almost identical at 20:53 the sudden plummeting of the futures price at 20:54 can only have been to a dividend, Mr Regan said that it could have been due to something else and he did not know why it would go down and become lower than the cash price. That answer was problematical for Mr Regan. First, if true, it would not provide a rational explanation for him deciding to place a bet if he saw a difference between the IG futures price and the cash price. If he did not know what accounted for it, there was no logical reason to suppose that it would be reversed. It was also inconsistent with the evidence he had just given that he understood that the futures price usually mirrored the cash price with the presence of a dividend making it slightly lower and the interest factor making it slightly higher and his evidence that he would not expect the futures price to differ wildly from the cash price ignoring dividend and interest. </p>

Mr Regan did confirm that he was not suggesting that but then proceeded to say that he did not know the reason why the IG Index futures price would be lower than the cash price, an answer which I found difficult to believe. In re-examination Mr Regan completely reversed his evidence and said that between September 2005 and October 2008 he did not on any of the very large number of shares on which he placed bets know that IG Index calculated its futures prices by incorporating a dividend. He said he only became aware of that later. </p>

A moment’s thought reveals that unless a futures price is discounted to reflect the fact that the person placing a bet will not receive any actual dividends paid by the company before the expiry of the futures contract price, it would be to that extent less profitable to place the futures bet rather than buy the underlying share. It is of course true that there are other advantages of spread betting including leverage and the lack of capital gains tax but the point is nonetheless so fundamental to the difference between spread betting and buying shares that it would be very surprising if a man who spent many years working in the City including in particular on a job specifically involving futures was unaware of it. </p>

As mentioned above there was one occasion when Mr Regan was telephoned by an IG Index employee about a bet he had taken the previous working day on a US stock. As the transcript of the conversation shows, the employee could not have been more explicit. She said that checks that morning had shown that there was a wrong dividend amount in the stock which Mr Regan bought. IG Index were accounting for a fiver dollar dividend instead of a 9 cent dividend. Mr Regan’s response was not one of bewilderment as to the relevance of that information to his bet. He simply said “oh dear”. When the employee pointed out that there was quite a big difference of 491 points so that the price IG Index was throwing out on the Friday evening was “quite substantially palpable”. Again Mr Regan simply replied: “Sure”, again suggesting that he understood both that the futures price was discounted to reflect an anticipated or announced dividend and that if an incorrect and excessively large divided had been included in the price that would have artificially reduced it. </p>

Again the adjustment of the futures price to reflect the correct dividend was made explicit. Again Mr Regan’s response indicated that he well understood the significance.

Even if he had been unaware before that conversation that IG Index calculated its futures prices on US stocks by reference to announced or anticipated dividends, it is crystal clear both from the transcript of the conversation and Mr Regan’s own recollection of it that he became aware of it as a result of that conversation. </p>

If in fact he understood that IG Index’s futures prices were discounted to reflect announced or anticipated dividends below the cash prices, there would be no prospect of any additional profit (over and above any future increase in the underlying cash price of the stock) as a result of placing a bet shortly after a divergence between a futures price and a cash price unless he knew that false dividends had been inserted and would be removed before he closed the bets. That completely undermined the plausibility of his testimony that if he saw such a divergence he would place a bet or, to use his graphic expression, “pounce”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Indeed that testimony was in my judgment also deliberately untrue.

Indeed his claim in cross-examination that he did not understand what accounted for such divergences itself rendered implausible his claim that he would see such divergences as an opportunity for making profit. If he did not know the reason why IG Index’s futures price suddenly dropped below that of the cash price, what reason did he have to suppose that the divergence would subsequently disappear?</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Since, as I am satisfied, Mr Regan well understood the connection between the announcement or anticipation of dividends and reductions in IG Index’s futures prices, a number of consequences flow. First it undermines his evidence that the reason he placed bets shortly after the sharp drop in the price following the insertion of a false dividend was because he would have seen the sharp drop as an opportunity to make extra profit beyond that which he anticipated based on his market research of the prospects for the underlying price of the stock. Second it renders even more unlikely the possibility that forty-six of the fifty-four bets which he placed on US stocks during the period of the alleged fraud just happened to be placed on stocks shortly after the insertion of large false dividends by coincidence. It is telling that 69.5% of the allegedly fraudulent forty-six bets were placed between 20.50 p.m. and 20.59 p.m. compared to only 12% of his bets on US stocks which are not alleged to have been fraudulent. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Third it strongly supports the inference that Mr Regan well understood that the reason why the IG futures prices on the eleven US stocks for which there is Xcon audit information suddenly dropped by huge amounts was because a dividend had been inserted of a size far greater than could possibly reflect genuine dividends announced by the relevant company or anticipated for it. Again in my judgment it beggars belief either that Mr Regan did not draw that conclusion or that he thought that on so many unrelated occasions on so many different stocks huge false dividends had been entered by mistake with no chasing contact from IG Index such as happened in May 2006 and that the mistakes were corrected the following working day or shortly thereafter again with no attempt by IG Index to change his contract price to stop him benefiting from the mistake. Indeed Mr Regan did not suggest that he thought that the sudden sharp downwards spikes in the futures prices were the result of the insertion of large dividends by mistake.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Fourth this in turn in my judgment strongly supports the inference that when Mr Regan placed his allegedly fraudulent bets he well knew that a false dividend had been deliberately and dishonestly inserted and that it would be removed shortly thereafter and that that was the reason why he placed his bets. Fifth it also supports the clear view which I formed as he gave his oral testimony that he was being deliberately evasive, trying to avoid answering difficult questions and giving untruthful answers in order to avoid having to admit that he had been tipped off that Mr Colley had inserted or would insert false dividends and then remove them in order to enable him to benefit financially by placing bets at artificially depressed prices and closing them when the dividend had been removed. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In fact the transcript of Mr Regan’s telephone conversation with the IG Index employee on 8 May 2006 suggests that he was already aware by that time of the fact that IG Index calculated its futures prices by reference to dividends. Were it otherwise his ready and almost docile agreement to foregoing the benefit of the bet he had placed the previous Friday would be an unexpected response. His first explanation for that response was that when the call came he was sitting next to his director. If that was the case one might have expected him to ask the IG Index employee to ring back rather than forego a profitable bet. </p>

While that possibility cannot be ruled out, in my judgment the more likely explanation is that put to Mr Regan by Mr Mayall, namely that this was another occasion on which Mr Regan placed a bet following the insertion of a false dividend by Mr Colley, that, unlike the others, the anomalous price had been spotted by the employee and, as would be expected if that was the case, Mr Regan readily agreed to cancel the contract to avoid the risk of further damaging enquiries by IG Index. </p>

As I have already observed that rendered implausible his earlier evidence that if he saw a difference between the IG futures price and the cash price of a stock on his watch list he would place a buy-bet. Indeed Mr Regan agreed that if he saw a drop in the differential between the prices there would be no reason to bet if the differential was to do with a dividend but when asked what else could cause such a drop he admitted that he did not know. When it was put to him that if he did not know what caused the drop that would not be a reason to place a bet there was a long pause and Mr Regan was only able to repeat that if he saw a difference between the futures and the cash price he would pounce. </p>

Again he merely repeated that if he saw that a futures price was lower than the cash price he would have bet on it and he did. When asked again how that would make him money Mr Regan’s answer was that he would look at historical prices and if the analysts said that the stock would go up because it was a good stock and the charts showed that the stock was on the way up he would buy it. That of course was no answer to Mr Mayall’s question because, as he pointed out to Mr Regan, that had nothing to do with the difference between the cash and the futures price.  To this Mr Regan responded that you would expect the cash and the futures prices to be in line and therefore if there was a differential he would have bet. </p>

There is of course in principle no reason why someone might not have two cumulative reasons for placing a futures bet. However the fact that Mr Regan may have had a market based reason for selecting a particular stock as one which was likely to perform well, does not address the critical question as to why he placed bets on such stocks in such large numbers shortly after large drops in the futures price which were not mirrored in equivalent drops in the cash price. Mr Regan did not suggest that this was pure coincidence. He specifically claimed that if he spotted a difference between the cash and futures price he would for that reason place a bet if the stock was on his watch list. He thus relied by way of explanation of his having placed bets on stocks whose futures price had just sharply declined not on mere coincidence but on a positive policy on his part to pounce when he spotted a gap between the IG Index futures price and the cash price.</p>

He submitted that it remains good authority for the requirement for expert evidence in circumstances where a claimant pleads its case in fraud on the basis that conduct which is apparently innocent in fact gives rise to an inference of fraud because it is in some way out of the ordinary or exceptional. He submitted that the court does not have statistical evidence, let alone expert evidence, for the proposition that a habitual user of IG Index’s services who fortunately alights upon favourable prices in a number of instances is in fact so fortunate that his conduct can be said to be exceptional or unusual. The court thus has no reference point from which to draw the inferences which IG Index invites it to draw. He relied by way of analogy on what he said were Andrew Smith J’s successive rejections of an inferential case in <span style="font-style:italic">Camerata</span> as a result of the absence of expert evidence at paragraphs 189, 210, 212, 213 and 218 of the judgment. He added that the late production of evidence said to justify the inference did not plug the gap but simply widened the chasm. I took that to be a reference to the schedule showing the cash prices of the allegedly fraudulent bets at the time at which they were placed exhibited to Mr Gordon’s third witness statement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First, as just pointed out, Mr Regan’s evidence was not that his decisions to place the bets which are the subject of this claim, had nothing to do with the sudden sharp downward spike in the IG Index futures price shortly before he placed the bet. To that extent he was not relying on an argument based on coincidence but making a positive case that if he saw a difference between the futures and cash price on a stock on his watch list he would pounce. For the reasons given I reject that evidence as implausible and untruthful. It is not possible to ignore the fact that Mr Regan gave that evidence which in my judgment was untruthful when assessing the likelihood or unlikelihood of the possible explanations for why he placed the bets he did when he placed them.</p>

(Mr Gordon appeared ambivalent as to whether the other client who bet on the 46<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> occasion did so innocently).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr White is right that what he described as statistical improbability plays a part in IG Index’s case: IG Index offered futures prices on 2000 US stocks. Mr Regan during the period of the alleged fraud placed 54 bets on individual US stocks. 46 of them were on stocks on which IG Index have adduced evidence that Mr Colley inserted and removed false dividends. He placed those bets in addition on each case on the very day that Mr Colley inserted the dividend and closed the bet after he had removed the dividend. Moreover he did so, according to his own evidence, by use of a watch list containing no more than 12 US stocks at any given time. On only two of those stocks did Mr Regan place a second bet on another date. Thus on each occasion when he placed one of the 46 bets, it could not have happened unless the US stock on which he bet happened to be one of the 12 of the 2000 US stocks quoted by IG Index which was on his watch list. In my judgment the proposition that that is extremely unlikely to have occurred by coincidence does not require expert statistical evidence to prove. It is in my judgment self evidence. A fortiori the proposition that it is even more unlikely that on at least 10 occasions Mr Regan had his watch list open within a few minutes of Mr Colley having inserted a false dividend in one of the 2000 stocks quoted by IG Index which was on his watch list of 12. </p>

Nor do I consider that it requires expert statistical evidence to conclude that it is inherently unlikely that by chance 85 % of the bets placed by Mr Regan on US stocks during the period when he is alleged to have placed fraudulent bets (46 out of 54) should have been placed by coincidence on stocks and on days on which Mr Colley had inserted and then removed false dividends. </p>

It is not an absolute rule… but, less than in an obvious case, in the absence of relevant evidence the claim will not be proved”. I take and accept that as a general observation that, in the absence of expert evidence, the court will have the less material from which it can conclude that there was professional negligence (or gross negligence) and so will be less likely to conclude that negligence is proved, but this neither excuses the court from examining the evidence it has nor imposes a higher standard of proof upon the Claimants in professional negligence cases where there is no expert evidence. That said, I have, as a I shall explain, found it impossible to uphold some parts of Camerata’s contentions without expert evidence to support them.”</p>

The point was taken by Mr White among others that this might not be a reliable reflection of the difference between the cash and futures prices at the time the bets were actually placed.

Third he was the only client Defendant to trade in immediate succession to a co-Defendant on the same stock. Fourth he was the only Defendant to “bet short” on a stock. Fifth he was the only Defendant to have closed his position on a trade before the removal of the allegedly false divided.

Indeed it is the factor which I had at the forefront of my mind both during his evidence in the trial and in my review and consideration of that evidence and the submissions of Mr Mayall and Mr White. It undoubtedly does place him in a different category from the other alleged client accomplices (with one or two exceptions who did not appear at the trial and for when the evidence of connection to Mr Colley or other Defendants was weak or shown to be unreliable). Plainly if Mr Regan had such a friendship or connection it would significantly strengthen the case against him, as in my judgment it did in the case of Mr Slaney and Mr Teller.

It is not uncommon for large scale frauds to be conducted with great care being taken to avoid detection. There are in this case in my judgment aspects of the way in which Mr Colley perpetrated the fraud which show that he took considerable care to minimise the risk of detection: the selection of relatively obscure US stocks, the selections of stocks on which for the most part other IG Index clients did not hold open  positions, the timing of the insertions and removals of dividends so as to minimise the risk of the insertions being picked up by the two checks to which I have referred by the frequent insertion of false dividends and placing of bets by accomplice clients shortly before the close of the US market and the removal before the opening of the US market the following day so as to reduce the risk of innocent IG Index clients placing bets with the benefit of the false dividend.</p>

Indeed there were no emails to or from Mr Colley’s work email address passing between Mr Colley and any of the alleged client accomplices. The only email evidence relied on by IG Index against Mr Slaney was an email to him from a supplier of baby gifts. The only reference to Mr Osborn was a reference to “Tommy” in an email to Mr Colley from his then partner. The only references to Mr Teller were references to “Ad” and Adam” in emails between Mr Colley and two of his former girlfriends and the only reference to Mr Rossfield was in a single email from him to his former girlfriend.</p>

This illustrates that while the lack of evidence of a connection between Mr Regan and Mr Colley is undoubtedly an important factor to weigh in the scales, it is not decisive and must be weighed against the evidence on the other side of the scales to which I have referred.</p>

However, for the same reasons as in the case of Mr Teller and Mr Slaney, the absence of such evidence is in my judgment by no means determinative or consistent with the truth of the case again him. I have set out in some detail the circumstances in which IG Index sought at the beginning of the trial to rely on evidence of payments out of the accounts of various of the alleged accomplices including Mr Regan and the reasons why I refused to allow IG Index to amend its case late in the day to rely on particular payments. However as already mentioned it was always a central part of IG Index’s pleaded case against the client Defendants including Mr Regan that the profit generated by the insertion of false dividends by Mr Colley would be credited to the account of the particular Defendant who placed the bet; that Mr Colley could not profit from his fraudulent activity unless he was acting in concert with the particular Defendant and that it is an irresistible inference that the other Defendants were acting in concert with Mr Colley. It was in my judgment implicit in that allegation that it is to be inferred that it was agreed between Mr Colley and the accomplice clients that the accomplice would make payments to or confer financial benefits on Mr Colley and that he subsequently did so in return for the opportunity to derive unwarranted and fraudulent profits at she expense of IG Index. </p>

In the context of 415 bets the fact that only 2 were placed by alleged accomplices on the same stock on the same date does not in my view detract from the force of the point that it is striking that the general pattern is consistent with an intention to avoid drawing attention to possible links between accomplice clients and suspicious bets.</p>

The effect would thus be the same as placing a buy bet into which a positive dividend had been inserted. It is in any event, as Mr Mayall submitted, not inconsistent with Mr Colley having inserted a negative dividend by mistake and having told Mr Regan that on this occasion he should place a sell bet rather than a buy bet. </p>

It is not a necessary part of IG Index’s case that the accomplice clients in every case realised a cash profit by virtue of placing their fraudulent bets. Rather it is its case that they resulted either in a profit or in a smaller loss than would have been the case but for the benefit attributable the insertion and removal of the false dividend.</p>

Mr White submitted that this was inconsistent with the allegation in paragraph 15 (iii) of the Amended Points of Claim that one of the sophisticated techniques employed by Mr Colley to ensure that the fraud was not capable of being detected by IG Index was  that “accounts were rarely used for a fraudulent trade twice in close succession”. This point does not in my view much assist Mr Regan because the allegation as I understood it was directed at the infrequent occurrence of two bets being placed in close succession by the same accomplice client on the same account.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr White had a separate submission based on the fact that half of Mr Regan’s 46 bets took place in circumstances where a co-Defendant fraudulently traded on a separate stock in quick succession. He suggested that it could perfectly possibly be that Mr Colley in conducting his fraud provided the intended purchaser and partner in the fraud with a range of stocks to deal on and that that would account for the circumstances in which Mr Regan innocently traded on manipulated stock where Mr Colley’s true accomplice had elected a different stock. This was in my view clutching at straws.  First it does not address the implausibility of Mr Regan’s explanations of why he chose to bet on those stocks after the false dividends were inserted. Second it is in my view inherently improbable that Mr Colley would complicate his fraud by inserting and removing more false dividends than he needed to achieve his aim and it would be out of character with the pattern of all the other fraudulent insertions of false dividends. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr White made a number of other points which in my judgment did not much advance Mr Regan’s defence. Thus he pointed out that on 14 of the occasions when Mr Regan placed an allegedly fraudulent bet there was an anticipated dividend within the relevant period. There were indeed, as I have already printed out in the context of the 11 trades for which there was Xcon audit information, occasions on which Mr Regan placed a bet on a US stock which subsequently paid a dividend within the expiry period of the futures contract. However as in the case of those 11 bets, so more generally in the case of those for which there was no audit information, the size of the real dividend and the disparity between it and the false dividend inserted by Mr Colley was so great that in my judgment there is no material difference between those instances and the instances where the US stock had never paid or announced a dividend. In both cases it is in my judgment obvious that the dividend inserted was a false one and that that would have been obvious both to Mr Colley and to an experienced spread better, particularly one who placed a significant number of bets following the insertion of such a large dividend which was removed shortly thereafter.</p>

In fact the evidence to that effect was provided in further information supplied by IG Index which Mr Gordon confirmed in evidence that he compiled and which he verified. Allied to this Mr White submitted that the fact that of Mr Regan’s 46 trades there were 8 where there were two working days between the insertion and removal of the dividend and one where there were three working days was evidence of innocent conduct in that what he described as those prolonged periods showed an indifference to a prolonged exposure to the risk of innocent clients trading on the same stock. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is in my view some force in the point that the longer the gap between the opening of the US market (by which time the two relevant checks would have been done) and the removal of the dividend the greater was the risk of an innocent client placing a bet on a relevant stock. However on the majority of occasions the dividend was removed the day after it was inserted and the general pattern was that the timing of the removals of the dividends, albeit to a lesser extent than the timing of their insertions, was consistent with a plan designed to combine leaving the dividend in the price long enough to avoid detection by the two relevant checks with minimising the period of time in which there was a risk of an innocent IG Index client placing a bet on the relevant stock.</p>

Whenever a new client appeared he searched their entire previous dealing history to see if any other spread betting markets had been subject to similar manipulation but that it was only US shares which appeared. In oral testimony Mr Gordon confirmed that whenever a new client was shown to have dealt in a similar dealing pattern on US shares futures as Mr Rowe and Mr Abrahamovich he looked at all the other markets that client might have dealt in and did not confine his search to US shares.</p>

As Mr Regan gave his oral testimony I had the strong impression of a witness who was prevaricating, evasive, reluctant to answer awkward questions and giving inconsistent and on important issues untruthful evidence. Having recorded those impressions as he gave his evidence, I revisited his testimony after the trial more than once not only by reference to my notes of what he said but by listening to the tape recording of his testimony, important parts of it more than once. That process served to reinforce my initial impressions. Moreover the more I considered both the detail of the evidence and argument relied on against Mr Regan and by Mr Regan the more satisfied I became that he placed the futures bets having been tipped off in advance by Mr Colley as to the details of the stocks into which he had inserted or would insert false dividends including dates and times and from which he had or would remove them including dates and times in order that Mr Regan could place bets on those stocks to realise a dishonest profit.</p>

I find that he participated with Mr Colley in a fraud designed to enable him to profit by placing bets with IG Index at prices which were below those which IG Index would have offered without the insertion of false dividends and below those which reflected the underlying market cash prices of the stocks. I find that he did so in pursuance of an agreement with Mr Colley that they would do so and that it is likely that as part of that agreement he agreed to make payments or confer other financial benefits on Mr Colley and subsequently did make payments to or confer other financial benefits on him in return for being given the opportunity to place bets at manipulated prices at the expense of IG Index.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">So far as Mr Teller is concerned, Mr Osborn’s evidence supported IG Index’s general case against him. His request to be paid in cash was certainly consistent with a desire to avoid a paper trail which could support a suggestion that Mr Teller was using Mr Osborn’s account to place dishonest bets. It provides some support to the inference that Mr Teller paid cash to Mr Colley to enable Mr Colley to benefit from the fraudulent bets placed by Mr Teller on his own account and those other accounts on which he placed bets.</p>

It was a knowingly false representation of fact made on behalf of Mr Osborn which was designed to induce IG Index to accept Mr Osborn as a customer and to allow him to open a spread betting account and was relied on by IG Index, I infer in agreeing to do so.</p>

Why should Mr Teller agree to share any profits made on the account while shouldering all of the losses? If Mr Teller wished to enable Mr Osborn to benefit from his trading skills or market research as a favour to a friend, why did he need to go through the complication of opening a separate account in Mr Osborn’s name, when he could achieve the same result by placing more money than he otherwise would on bets on his own account and giving Mr Osborn a proportion of the profits? Why, if there was nothing dodgy about the arrangement, did Mr Teller ask to have his share of the profits paid in cash?</p>

Although, as indicated before, there is no Xcon audit information in relation to any of these 12 bets, in all but two of them the false dividend was removed the day after it was inserted. Half of the bets were placed on US stocks which had never declared a dividend and the dividend next declared on the other six ranged in size from three cents to 52.5 cents. For all the reasons why I have held that Mr Teller acted dishonestly in placing the bets which he did on his own account and those of his mother, his sister and Mr Cowan, I am satisfied that Mr Teller placed these 12 bets dishonestly in concert with Colley.</p>

As with the other client defendants I take into account, in assessing whether Tom Benn, when he placed and closed the bets, did so in concert with Mr Colley after having been tipped off by him as to the details of the insertions and removals of the false dividends the fact that on all 60 of Mr Benn’s bets, it is clear either by direct Xcon audit information or by inference that the bets were placed after the insertion of huge and obviously disproportionate dividends and closed after the dividends were removed. A number of them were placed a few minutes before the markets closed and a few minutes after the insertion of a false dividend and most of the dividends were removed the following day, in many cases where Xcon audit information was available before the US market opened.</p>

In essence the actions referred to were the systematic and fraudulent entering of false dividends into IG Index’s systems, thus lowering the mid price of US various stocks and then removing the false dividend from the system, thus increasing the mid price to its proper level after the other defendants (and three other accomplices) who were acting in concert with him fraudulently traded at the false price from which they derived an unwarranted profit by closing the bets at the higher price created by the removal of the dividends.</p>

I have found that it is to be inferred that Mr Colley was acting in concert with accomplices who placed bets with IG Index on the stocks into which and from which he entered and removed false dividends either on their own accounts or, as in the case of Mr Teller and Tom Benn, in the accounts of friends or relatives whose accounts they operated.</p>

This was a fraud carried out by Mr Colley against IG Index.  It involved the active participation not only of Mr Colley but also of the persons who placed the relevant bets.  It was a necessary part of the fraud, without which it could not have been effective, that Mr Colley informed the relevant accomplice that he had inserted or would insert a false dividend and would then remove it and secured the agreement of the relevant accomplice to place and close a bet on the relevant stock at times which would benefit from the artificially depressed price created by the false insertions.  In my judgment this involved not only Mr Colley informing the accomplice of the details of his intended or accomplished insertion and removal of dividends but also securing the accomplice’s agreement to place and close bets on the relevant stock at times which would benefit from his price manipulation.  Without such agreement not only would Mr Colley derive no benefit from his dishonest manipulation but he would expose himself unnecessarily to a risk (albeit reduced by his attempts to minimise it) of detection if an innocent IG Index client placed a bet while the false dividend was in the price, with no corresponding prospect of gain for him.</p>

It is in my judgment improbable that Mr Colley would have embarked on such a large scale systematic fraud with the inevitable adverse consequences to him which would flow from detection unless he gained financial profit from the fraud.  The only way in which he could secure such profit would be by agreeing in advance with the persons placing the fraudulent bets that in return for Mr Colley providing them with the opportunity of placing fraudulent bets resulting in profits to them they in turn would confer on him directly or indirectly some financial benefit, thereby in effect sharing the profits resulting from the fraud.  </p>

That is because there is no evidence of such an agreement and it does not arise in my judgment as a necessary or probable inference from the evidence.  On the contrary in the case of Mr Osborn and Mrs Benn I have found that they were unaware of the fraud.  In my judgment there is no logical reason why Mr Colley should have been made aware by Mr Teller that he was going to place a dishonest bet on someone else’s account which he operated on their behalf rather than or in addition to on his own account.  Nor is there any logical reason why Mr Colley should have sought Mr Teller’s agreement to do so.  The only inference to which the evidence in my judgment gives rise is that Mr Colley agreed with Mr Teller that Mr Teller would place a fraudulent bet with IG Index at the manipulated price and that he would receive some financial benefit thereafter.  The same applies as regards Tom Benn and Mrs Benn.</p>

It also involved Mr Colley informing those clients of IG Index that he had inserted or would insert false dividends and the dates and times thereof and that he had removed or would remove them and the dates and times thereof.  It also involved Mr Colley agreeing with his accomplices that in return for him providing them with the opportunity to make fraudulent and unwarranted profits at the expense of IG Index they would pay him or confer some other financial benefit on him which I have held probably occurred in most cases. All this was done behind IG Index’s back and using means designed to prevent IG Index from finding out that Mr Colley was inserting and removing dividends in concert with its clients to enable them to place bets with IG Index at prices which, had IG Index known the truth, it would not have been prepared to accept and which would result in loss to IG Index and profit to the clients. </p>

The first three were said by Ms Crowther not to have been included as defendants in the proceedings because sufficient funds were claimed by IG Index from their accounts which meant that they did not owe any monies to IG Index.  It follows that IG Index has suffered no loss resulting from the bets placed by those three clients.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The pleaded allegations against these three Defendants as well as the other client Defendants included the following allegations.  They fraudulently traded at the false price created by the systematic and fraudulent insertion by Mr Colley of false dividends into IG Index’s systems.  They closed their bets at the higher price created by Mr Colley’s removal of the false dividends thus making a profit subject to any legitimate movement in the underlying price of the stock.  In placing a “buy” bet on the stock at the lower price after Mr Colley input the false dividend they were acting in concert with him.  IG Index does not know the precise details of how they operated the fraud with Mr Colley between themselves and in particular the precise details of when or how any agreement was reached between them and Mr Colley or the precise details of such agreement.  However it is an irresistible inference from all of the pleaded circumstances that they were acting in concert with Mr Colley and both he and they were participants in the fraud.  Each individual Defendant profited from the pleaded fraudulent activity of Mr Colley on the bets listed in the spreadsheet annexed to the Amended Particulars of Claim which set out the extent by which each individual Defendant profited from the fraud.  The amount claimed from each of them took into account any balance due to any of them as a result of legitimate transactions between him and IG Index and set off by IG Index against the sums due as a result of the matters pleaded.  The profit from any relevant bet would be credited to the account of the particular Defendant who placed it.  Mr Colley could not profit from his fraudulent activity unless he was acting in concert with the particular Defendant.  It is an irresistible inference that the other Defendants were acting in concert with him.  The timing and nature of the relevant bets, in particular the fact that they were opened shortly after the false dividend had been entered by Mr Colley and closed shortly after the false dividend was removed by him also indicated that the other Defendants must have been aware of the fraud being perpetrated by Mr Colley and must have been willing participants in that fraud.  In further support of its contention that they were willing participants in the fraud and were acting in concert with Mr Colley IG Index relied on the contents of its witness statements and the fact that, apart from one occasion in the case of Mr Regan, whenever they placed one of the allegedly fraudulent trades no other person did so. Further the sums by which they profited by the fraud were sums that were diverted from IG Index by reason of the breach of fiduciary or other duty owed by Mr Colley to IG Index. They were knowing recipients of such sums. IG Index relied on the pleaded matters in support of the allegations of knowledge. As a result of “the matters aforesaid” IG Index has suffered loss and damage IG Index then claimed against Mr Regan, Mr Slaney and Mr Teller the sums of £191,940, £176,017.50 and £290,164 respectively.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As against each of Mr Regan, Mr Slaney and Mr Teller I have made the following findings of fact. When they placed the relevant bets they did so dishonestly and fraudulently, having been told by Mr Colley that he had inserted or would insert a false dividend together with the time and date of the insertion. Before they placed the bets Mr Colley dishonestly inserted a false dividend. In placing the bets they were acting pursuant to an agreement with Mr Colley that he would dishonestly insert false dividends into IG Index’s pricing system to enable them to place bets at the manipulated price from which they would make an unwarranted and fraudulent profit by closing out the bet after Mr Colley removed the false dividend. After the bets were placed Mr Colley removed the false dividends and informed them that he had or would do so together with the time and date of the removal. After the false dividends were removed they closed the bets resulting in fraudulent profits (or smaller losses than would otherwise have resulted) at IG Index’s expense. Part of the agreement was that they would confer on Mr Colley a financial benefit in return for him giving them the opportunity to place fraudulent bets at manipulated prices from which they would derive unwarranted profits. It is probable that they did confer such benefits on him. By their conduct they were willingly and knowingly participating in a fraud perpetrated by Mr Colley against IG Index. The profits which they made, or the smaller losses which they made, as a result of placing bets on the manipulated prices were the intended results of their dishonest conduct and the fraudulent activity in which they and Mr Colley jointly and willingly participated pursuant to their agreement with Mr Colley. Their actions and those of Mr Colley were dishonest and were part of a fraudulent scheme which was designed to and did enable them to defraud IG Index. Mr Regan, Mr Slaney and Mr Teller were aware of the fraud being perpetrated by Mr Colley against IG Index and were willing participants in that fraud.</p>

Indeed it went beyond assistance and, as pleaded they willingly participated themselves in the fraud. For present purposes however what is relevant is that, by placing bets at the artificially depressed prices created by the insertion by Mr Colley of dividends which they knew to be false the details of the timing of which he had informed them of in advance, and thereafter closing the bets after the removal by Mr Colley of the false dividends at times and dates of which he had informed them in advance, these three Defendants dishonestly assisted Mr Colley in his fraudulent breach of his fiduciary duty to IG Index.</p>

These three Defendants were fully aware at the time of his conduct and fully aware that it was dishonest and a fraud on IG Index. They understood that the purpose of Mr Colley’s conduct was to defraud IG Index and to enable them and him to make fraudulent profits as a result of it. By agreeing to receive from Mr Colley and act on information as to when he would insert or had inserted false dividends and would remove or had removed them, and by then actually acting on that information by placing bets at the dishonestly depressed prices and closing them when the prices had been restored, they were dishonestly assisting Mr Colley’s fraudulent breach of fiduciary duty. Their subsequent receipt of the monies resulting from that conduct and their agreement to confer financial benefit on Mr Colley and their actual conferring of financial benefit on him so as to enable him as well as to profit from his fraudulent breach of fiduciary duty further dishonestly assisted Mr Colley’s fraudulent breach of fiduciary duty.</p>

It is my understanding that in such circumstances the claimant would ordinarily be entitled to an account of profits, but that is not the relief sought by IG Index in the Amended Particulars of Claim. It may be that in practice there is no difference in outcome. The profits made by the Defendants are measured in the case of each relevant bet by the difference between the opening level of the bets and the level it would have been but for the insertion of the false dividend. The loss suffered by IG Index on each bet is the loss resulting from having accepted bets into which false dividends had been inserted. </p>

Although the damages to which IG Index is entitled should place it in the position in which it would have been but for the tort and is not a contractual measure of damages, in practice the loss suffered by IG Index is that it has paid out money representing the false dividends or received less than it should have done by reason of the false dividends.</p>

The context of that case was a claim that the appellant building society was liable to the purchaser of a house, who bought it in reliance on a fraudulent misrepresentation in a brochure issued by builders, because its representative must have known of the representations and their falsity and their effect in inducing the purchaser to buy the house from the builders and obtain a loan from the appellants so that they were knowingly availing themselves of the builders’ fraud and reaping its fruits. Thus the context in which those remarks were made was one in which the fraud from which it was alleged that the building society through its representative knowingly availed itself and from which it reaped its fruits was a classic case of fraudulent misrepresentation on the part of the builders.</p>

In that case a widow who owned two cottages and a sum of money secured on a mortgage, being dissatisfied with the income derived therefrom, consulted a firm of solicitors and saw their managing clerk, who conducted the conveyancing business of the firm without supervision. Acting as the representative of the firm he  advised her to sell the cottages and induced her to give him instructions to sell the cottages and to call in the mortgage money, and for that purpose, to give him her deeds and also to sign two documents which were neither read over nor explained to her and which she believed she had to sign in order to effect the sale of the cottages. Those documents were in fact a conveyance to him of the cottages and a transfer to him of the mortgage. He then dishonestly disposed of the property for his own benefit.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“The appellant Mrs Lloyd had bought some property and thus had come to know of the Defendant, a solicitor. She had doubts about having got her money’s worth and went to the Defendant’s office to enquire. When there she saw one Sandals, the Defendant’s managing clerk, and was induced by him to give him instructions to sell or realise this property, and for that purpose to give him the deeds and to sign two documents which she neither read nor knew the tenor of, which put into Sandal’s possession her interest therein. She gave him the deeds as the Defendant’s representative. Having got them and the signed documents, he dishonestly disposed of this lady’s property and pocketed the proceeds. That is the whole story as it is either found or admitted because it was incontestable. It is clear in my mind from the simple facts that the jury ought to have been directed if they believed them to find for the plaintiff. The managing clerk was authorised to receive deeds and carry through sales and conveyances, and to give notices on the Defendant’s behalf. He was instructed by the plaintiff, as the representative of the Defendant’s firm – and she so treated him throughout – to realise  her property. He took advantage of the opportunity so afforded him as the Defendant’s representative to get her to sign away all that she possessed and put the proceeds into his own pocket. In my opinion there is an end of the case. It was a  breach by the Defendant’s agent of a contract made by him as Defendant’s agent to apply diligence and honesty in carrying though a business within his delegated powers and entrusted to him in that capacity. It was also a tortious act committed by the clerk in conducting business which she had a right to conduct honestly and was instructed to conduct on behalf of his principals.” (page 724).</p>

That representation induced her to sign what were in fact conveyances to him.  It could also be said that there was created between the solicitor and the widow a fiduciary relationship giving rise to a fiduciary duty which he breached.

It considers that a bribe (or ‘secret commission’ or ‘surreptitious payment’) has been paid where ‘(i) …the person making the payment makes it to the agent of the other person with whom he is dealing; (ii) …he makes it to that person knowing that the person is acting as the agent of the other person with whom he is dealing; and (iii) …he fails to disclose to the other person with whom he is dealing that he has made that payment to the person whom he knows to be the other person’s agent’: <span style="font-style:italic">Industries and General Mortgages Co.

I emphasised that it had always been and remained part of IG Index’s case that it is to be inferred that in some way the profit made by the client Defendants would redound to Mr Colley’s advantage, that being implicit in the allegation to which I have referred that the profit from any relevant bet would be credited to the account of the particular Defendant who placed it and that Mr Colley could not profit from his fraudulent activity unless he was acting in concert with the particular Defendant and that it is an irresistible inference that the client Defendant were acting in concert with Mr Colley.</p>

Indeed the unsuccessful amendments for which I refused leave sought to introduce a series of allegations as to unexplained payments into Mr Colley’s account and various payments into and out of the accounts of Mr Regan, Mr Slaney and Mr Teller which were introduced as being facts and matter relied on by IG Index in support of its contention that these Defendant were willing participants in the fraud and were acting in concert with Mr Colley.</p>

Indeed I do not think that IG Index had such a claim in mind by the end of the trial hearing. The bribery cases were only sent to me in response to my invitation to Mr Mayall to send me any further authorities on which he relied to support his contention, which he had supported in oral submissions, by reference to <span style="font-style:italic">Lloyd v Grace Smith</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">and Co</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Nocturn v Ashburton</span>, that the tort of fraud does not require proof of a fraudulent misrepresentation. Although there is in my judgment some support for that proposition in <span style="font-style:italic">Petrograde</span>, as I have indicated, and in that context Mr Mayall was entitled to rely on that line of authority, had I not asked for further authority there is no indication that IG Index would have relied on those authorities in support of a free standing or discrete cause of action founded on damages for the payment of bribes. In short prior to the written closing submissions the issue of whether payments were made by the other Defendants to Mr Colley featured in the case not as the basis for an additional free standing cause of action entitling IG Index to damages but as a disputed matter of evidence going to the question of whether Mr Colley was acting in concert with the client Defendants.</p>

None of these three Defendants had an opportunity of advancing detailed submissions as to why such a claim is not open to IG Index on the pleadings and/or as to why even if it were it should not succeed or as to why IG Index should not be given permission to amend its pleading to rely on this additional cause of action.

As I have indicated the findings of fact which I have made are very serious and it would offend ordinary notions of justice if despite such findings IG Index were entitled to no relief and these Defendants were entitled to retain the benefit of what I have found to be their dishonest conduct. Had that been the position there might have been an argument for reopening the hearing and having a pitched battle on whether IG Index would need permission to amend their pleading in order to assert a claim for damages for the tort of bribery if so whether such permission should be given and whether in any event it is too late for IG Index to raise a new cause of action. Even then I would have been very reluctant to adopt such a course. Mr Colley, Mr Slaney, Mr Teller and Mrs Benn are litigants in person and Mrs Benn was assisted by a McKenzie friend. Mr Regan is an individual and ranged against them is a very large sophisticated Spread Betting company which has had a long time to formulate its claims.</p>

I have also held that Mrs Benn and Mr Osborn are liable to IG Index independently of any liability arising out of the payment by respectively Tom Benn and Mr Teller as their agents of bribes to Mr Colley. In those circumstances a formal ruling that any of the Defendants is liable to IG Index in damages for the tort of bribery would make no practical difference to the parties or to the financial consequences flowing from the findings of fact which I have made.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is necessary at this stage to address what in my judgment is a fatal flaw in IG Index’s claim against Mr Teller under this head. In the version of the Manifest Error clause which I have held applied to him, IG Index did not reserve an unqualified right to amend the terms of any bet containing or based upon a Manifest Error. The right was qualified. It was “to void ab initio or, <span style="font-weight:bold">at your request</span>, to amend the terms…”. (Emphasis added). IG Index purported to amend the relevant bets in its solicitors’ letter dated 3 February 2009. That purported amendment was not made pursuant to or as a result of any request made by Mr Teller. In those circumstances in my judgment no right to amend on the part of IG Index had arisen. In principle and subject to any contentions or submission to the contrary, IG Index might have been entitled to exercise a right to void the bets. Had it sought to do so it may well be that Mr Teller would have requested it instead to amend the bets and would have been entitled to do so under the second sub-clause of the Manifest Error clause. However that is not what happened. In those circumstances this head of claim as against Mr Teller in my judgment fails. In so far as the following parts of the judgment under this section address arguments raised by IG Index and Mr Teller in relation to the claim against him they would only arise if I were wrong in this conclusion and I address them on that basis. </p>

As to the insertion of false dividends in the bets which are the subject of the claims against these three Defendants I have found that they were inserted by Mr Colley and that they were false in the sense that the relevant US company had not announced a dividend and no dividend in the amount inserted or anything remotely approaching that level was anticipated by IG Index or Mr Colley to be payable before the expiry of the relevant futures prices at which the bets were placed.</p>

He submitted that Thomas J in considering the meaning which should be attributed to a Manifest Error stated: “Manifest means in ordinary language plain and obvious”.

In any event it fell away in my judgment when IG Index adduced into evidence the schedule showing the cash prices of the underlying stocks at the time the relevant bets were placed. Implicit in that submission of Mr White appeared to be an acceptance that in considering whether the opening level of the bets were based on a Manifest Error it was permissible to have regard to extrinsic evidence.</p>

Therefore they must have contemplated an examination of the reasoning of the determination to see if it disclosed any Manifest Error. The purchasers contended that there were two Manifest Errors. The expert had misunderstood the parties’ submissions and wrongly concluded that the purchasers had accepted a certain treatment of the transactions. It was on the basis of that clear and obvious misunderstanding that the expert had decided in favour of the vendor. Second the expert had clearly misconstrued the original contract.

On the contrary Stanley Burnton LJ made the explicit point that if “manifest” meant “apparent on the face of the document” it might be difficult to see how any error could be manifest in that sense. For that reason in the context he was considering “manifest” had the wider meaning of “obvious”. He held that it would be open to an appointed representative to demonstrate that a statement or certificate signed by Axa for the purposes of clause 1.6 of the Schedule was subject to a manifest error by reference to records of the commission payable on policies it had sold and commission claw backs resulting from cancellation or termination of policies. Similarly in relation to clause 5 incorrect calculations of commission could be challenged as subject to error if Axa failed to pay commission on a policy taken out by a client of an appointed representative. A failure to pay such commission would be an obvious and therefore manifest error on the part of Axa.</p>

I cannot accept that submission. The reason the errors went undetected was because the information against which the levels at which the Defendants’ bet were or would have been checked by IG Index in the ordinary course was deliberately falsified by Mr Colley’s dishonest insertion and removal of false dividends into IG Index’s pricing systems and the timing thereof. Once the level of the bets is compared to the underlying cash prices at the times they were placed, or once the futures price at the close of the US market is compared to the cash price at that time, the errors are, in my judgment, both obvious and palpable. One definition of palpable is “plain to see or comprehend”. Once a comparison is made between the terms of the bets and the underlying cash prices at the time they were placed, which is, in my judgment, plainly relevant information, the error in the level of the bets is both obvious and plain to comprehend. Similarly, once one compares the level of the IG Index futures price before and after the insertion of the false dividends (both of which are, in my judgment, plainly relevant information) or once one examines the Xcon audit information on the 130 insertion of false dividends, which in my judgment is also relevant information, it is obvious that the prices shown in Xcon on which the bets were based contained manifest errors. </p>

As I have indicated in my judgment once the level of the bets is compared to the underlying cash price at the times they were placed or once the futures price at the close of the US market is compared to the cash price at that time the errors are both obvious and palpable.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The fact that the errors relied on by IG Index went undetected by it in some cases for years does not in my judgment show that they were not obvious or easily demonstrable without extensive investigation. But for the fraudulent and dishonest timing of the removal of the false dividends which ensured that they remained concealed during the two relevant checks made by IG Index, the errors in the relevant bet prices would have been obvious and easily demonstrable without extensive investigation. That is well demonstrated by the incident to which I have referred in which an IG Index employee telephone Mr Regan the next working day after an apparently false dividend had been inserted to inform him that there had been an error. But for the fraudulent insertion and temporary retention of the false dividends in IG Index’s pricing systems in which I have held each of Mr Teller, Mr Slaney and Mr Regan dishonestly connived the manifest errors would probably have been revealed easily and quickly. They would not have required extensive investigation to identify. They are easily demonstrable by the comparisons to which I have referred. Even without knowledge of the IG Index futures price formula the sheer size of the discrepancy between the level of the bets and the underlying cash prices showed and shows that the bet levels were obviously wrong. There was no other rational explanation for the disparities.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr White’s next argument was that IG Index could not rely on the manifest error clauses because, in making the decision that the errors were manifest errors, they failed to comply with their contractual obligation to act in good faith. That was put on the basis that consideration of liability under the manifest error clause only falls to be considered where fraud is not proved. In those circumstances, it would be unconscionable and artificially inconsistent with IG Index’s own belief that the price differentials were the product of fraudulent manipulation and not human error for IG Index to invoke the manifest error clause. I do not accept that argument. First, it proceeds on the premise that “fraud is not proved”. IG Index would be entitled to claim under the manifest error clauses even if, notwithstanding my findings that Mr Regan, Mr Slaney and Mr Teller acted fraudulently and dishonestly in concert with Mr Colley and participated with him in his fraudulent scheme, there were no legal bases or cause of action resulting in their liability to IG Index as a result of their dishonest conduct. As it is I have held that there are such legal bases and causes of actions. The premise is therefore not applicable. It has been proved that Mr Colley fraudulently inserted false dividends and that the Defendants knew that and acted in concert with him.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, and in any event, IG Index is not, in my judgment, precluded from being entitled to judgment under the manifest error clauses against these defendants, by reason of the fact that it is entitled to recover from them under one or more cause of action based on their dishonesty. Further, and in any event, it does not lie in the mouths of these three defendants to submit that IG Index was not entitled in good faith to decide that the bets which they placed contained and were based on manifest errors on the ground that the cause of the errors was deliberate dishonesty on the part of Mr Colley of which they were aware when they placed their bets, and indeed in which they had colluded pursuant to dishonest agreements.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Allied to the last submission was the indication in Mr Regan’s defence that IG Index was put to strict proof that the insertion of an intentionally false dividend can be characterised as a manifest error within the meaning of the manifest error clause. In his written closing submissions on behalf of Mr Osborn, Mr Seifert, a solicitor who acted as Mr Osborn’s McKenzie Friend and whom I happily and gratefully permitted to make representations on his behalf, explicitly said that Mr Osborn did not seek to argue in the circumstances of his case that the mistake was not palpable or obvious. His agent Mr Teller was aware of it if the fraud against him was proved. That, in my judgment, was a sensible and realistic concession. In ordinary language, an error has a number of definitions. They include “a mistake” and “a measure of the estimated difference between the observed or calculated value of a quantity and its true value”. Mistakes are most frequently made inadvertently. However, the common expression “a deliberate error” illustrates, in my judgment, that an error is not necessarily restricted to a mistake made by inadvertence or oversight. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The contrary argument is based on the notion that the parties cannot have contemplated or intended that IG Index should be able to rely on its own fraud in creating an error for the purpose of invoking the clause. I do not accept that argument. The clauses provided that in deciding whether an error was a manifest error, IG Index would act reasonably and in good faith. There seems to me no element of unreasonableness or bad faith in IG Index seeking to amend the terms of the bets so as to prevent clients benefiting from a wholly unwarranted profit resulting from Mr Colley having dishonestly inserted false dividends into the IG Index price. That is, of course, particularly so in the context of clients who, as these three defendants, were aware of and colluded in the insertion of the false dividends. But even in the case of a wholly innocent client, I would reach the same conclusion. The purpose of the manifest error clause, as it seems to me, was to entitle IG Index to insist on dealing with its clients on the terms which reflected the normal basis on which it calculated its futures prices. If the false dividend had been inserted by clerical error, an innocent client would stand to make an unwarranted profit  and IG Index an unwarranted loss without the exercise by IG Index of its right to void or amend under the manifest error clause. The same would be the case if the false dividend were inserted by some third party who managed to hack into IG Index’s computer. The same, in my judgment, is the case if, as happened here, the false dividend was inserted by a dishonest employee of IG Index. In all three examples, the profit which the client would make as a result of the error would be wholly unwarranted and there is, in my judgment, no reason why it should be assumed that the parties intended or contemplated that the in the latter example the client should be entitled to retain the unwarranted windfall. </p>

The effect of invoking the manifest error clause is simply to protect them from that loss. </p>

The manifest error which resulted from Mr Colley’s fraud caused them to enjoy unwarranted profits and not losses. If IG Index were ordered to pay them damages to restore to them the sums debited to their account by IG Index after it amended the opening level of the bets to what it contended would have been the correct level but for the false dividends, the order would have the effect of allowing them to retain the profits they made as a result of the fraud. </p>

Nor did it impose any liability on IG Index to them for any loss following the manifest errors. They suffered no such loss. Nor did they suffer any loss as a result of Mr Colley’s fraud or wilful default. It follows that IG Index cannot be vicariously liable to them for any such loss.

IG Index was liable for that negligence and/or breach of contract, and term 27 was unenforceable under the 1977 Act “for the reasons pleaded above.” They counter-claimed, in the alternative, that if the dividend deflation and changes to share prices were made by IG Index not through wilful default or fraud of IG Index through Mr Colley or otherwise, they were made by the negligence of IG Index through Mr Colley or otherwise. They, accordingly, counter-claimed the same damages. Again, this does not arise because I have found that Mr Colley’s conduct did involve fraud and wilful default in the sense of breach of the duties he owed to IG Index. The 1977 Act does not therefore arise.

In any event as appears in what I say in relation to the claim against Mr Osborn I do not find that Mr Colley’s ability to perpetrate his fraudulent scheme without detection and IG Index’s failure to detect the fact that the relevant bets were placed at artificially depressed prices resulted from negligence on the part of IG Index in the way in which it operated its supervision of him and/or its systems.  Moreover, even if I had that would not avail Mr Regan, Mr Slaney or Mr Teller both because what caused them to place their bets was not an innocent belief that they represented IG Index’s bona fide futures prices but the fact that they knew that they did not, and also because the result of placing their bets was not to cause them loss but, on the contrary, unwarranted profits.</p>

I do not consider that under the Spread Betting Customer Agreement IG Index was reasonably expected to contract at a price which was artificially depressed by reason of the insertion of a false dividend.

Otherwise IG Index would be exposed to the risk of loss and the client would stand to profit from a Manifest Error. I observe that its right to decide that an error was a Manifest Error was subject to an obligation to act reasonably and in good faith. In my judgment these conclusions apply a fortiori where either the client or the person authorised by the client to place the bet (as I have found to be the case with the bets placed by Mr Teller on behalf of Mr Osborn and Tom Benn on behalf of his mother) was aware at the time the bets were placed that the levels at which they were contracting with IG Index were distorted and artificially depressed as a result of the dishonest insertion by Mr Colley of false dividends.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the skeleton it was submitted that the clause in the agreement is intrinsically one sided providing IG Index with a contractual provision which operated as an unfettered mechanism to pass loss to the client in circumstances where the client had neither the right nor authority to do so. As I have indicated it was accepted by Mr Mayall in closing submissions that the applicable agreement and therefore the applicable Manifest Error clause as between IG Index and Mr Regan was that which was provided to him on 7 February 2003 on registration of his membership. The clause in that agreement contained the last sentence in the second sub-clause which is set out above in bold. In my judgment properly construed that sentence conferred a right on the client to require IG Index at his request to amend the terms of the bet to what IG Index believed would have been fair and reasonable at the time it was entered. I do not consider that the conferring of a right to amend on IG Index rendered the clause in the 2003 Agreement unfair, contrary to the requirement of good faith or such as to cause a significant imbalance in the parties’ rights and obligations to the detriment of the clients. In any event it was not contended by Mr White that the Manifest Error clause in the version of the agreement which was binding on him was unfair and not binding on him by reason of regulation 5(1).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In his written closing submissions Mr White made two further submissions.  First he submitted that the Manifest Error clause was a significantly one-sided abuse of a dominant contractual position.  IG Index was seeking to engage in a one-way bet.  If a user of its services made an error, manifest or otherwise, they could not have a refund.  However, if IG Index made an error, moreover with the right unilaterally to deem there to have been an error, it could exit from the deal.  In my judgment there is no merit in that submission.  First IG Index did not seek to void the relevant bets.  Second as already stated I do not consider that in exercising its right to amend the terms of the relevant bets IG Index was claiming to be entitled to render a contractual performance substantially different from that which was reasonably expected of it.  Third the fact that the contract conferred no equivalent right on the client to amend the terms of a bet in respect of which it had made an error does not in my judgment mean that the Agreement failed to satisfy the requirement of reasonableness.  The prices at which IG Index dealt with its clients were set by IG Index following its pricing formula.  It is in my judgment obvious that there was no realistic equivalence between the risk to IG Index that the terms of a bet might contain or be based on a Manifest Error made by it and the risk to the client that the terms of the bet might contain or be based on a manifest error made by the client.  The fact that the contract did not confer on the client a right to amend in the latter scenario did not in my judgment render the contract unreasonable.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For the reasons set out earlier in my consideration of the causes of action against Mr Teller, as well as Mr Slaney and Mr Regan, one of the bases on which I have held that Mr Teller is liable to IG Index in damages is that IG Index suffered loss and damage resulting from his fraudulent conduct. That conduct included dishonestly using his own account as a vehicle for defrauding IG Index. By placing bets after Mr Colley had to his knowledge dishonestly entered false dividends and closing them after to his knowledge Mr Colley had removed them Mr Teller defrauded IG Index and dishonestly intervened in its affairs. Mr Teller’s liability to IG Index as a result of that conduct was analogous to that of the solicitor’s clerk in <span style="font-style:italic">Lloyd v Grace</span>. The act of the solicitor’s clerk in getting the widow to sign away all that she possessed and put the proceeds into his own pocket was held to be a tortious act committed by the clerk. Because it was committed by him in conducting business which he had a right to conduct honestly and was instructed to conduct on behalf of his principals, his principals were held to be vicariously liable for it.. </p>

In using Mr Osborn’s account which he had a right to use honestly and which he was authorised by Mr Osborn to use to place bets, just as the solicitor’s clerks principals were vicariously liable to the widow for the losses caused by his fraudulent conduct in Lloyd v Grace Smith, so Mr Osborn is liable to IG Index for the fraudulent conduct of Mr Teller.</p>

He relied on the dictum of Lord McNaughton: “I must say that it would be absolutely shocking to my mind if Mr Smith were not held liable for the fraud of his agent in the present case.” (Penultimate paragraph). In <span style="font-style:italic">Nathan</span> Blanchard J at para 44 cited Holt CJ with approval: “It is more reason that he, that puts a trust and confidence in the deceiver, should be a loser, than a stranger.”</p>

Mr Osborn he submitted is an innocent loser if he is required to pay IG Index more than the sum of £7,500 which he freely admitted that he innocently received from the fraud. That I take to be based on Mr Osborn’s evidence that he only retained one third of the profits realised on his account. In his analysis Mr Seifert submitted that fraudulent agent A, Mr Colley, enlisted the support of fraudulent agent B, Mr Teller, in defrauding innocent principal A, IG Index. In pursuance of that joint fraud with agent A, agent B tricked innocent principal B, Mr Osborn, into lending his name to agent B thereby putting innocent principal B at great risk. That risk has now materialised with a very large claim for damages against innocent principal B. In order to succeed in its claims he submitted that IG Index must show among other things that the two guilty agents abused the trust of their innocent principals. Both Mr Osborn and IG Index put their trust and confidence in a deceiver. He therefore submitted that the loss should be apportioned between both principals equally.</p>

He also freely admitted that the application contained false information inserted by Mr Teller as to Mr Osborn’s income and savings. It is in my view plain that that was done by Mr Teller to induce IG Index to accept Mr Osborn as a client and that it succeeded in doing so. Although this only emerged in the course of Mr Osborn’s evidence towards the end of the trial and did not from the basis of a freestanding claim against him, it is in my view difficult to see what defence Mr Osborn could have had to a claim by IG Index that he is liable to it in damages resulting from a fraudulent misrepresentation made by his agent within the scope of his authority which was intended to and did induce IG Index to accept Mr Osborn as a client. Again it would be hard to see what answer Mr Osborn would have had to a claim by IG Index to recover by way of damages caused by that misrepresentation the sums it lost by reason of the bets placed on his account which benefited form the false dividends.</p>

That is that, unlike Mr Osborn who said that Mr Teller agreed that he would retain one third of the profits made on his account as a result of the bets placed by Mr Teller on it, Mrs Benn told her son that she did not wish to retain any profits made by him on her account. Unfortunately for Mrs Benn in my judgment that is not a material distinction which assists her in resisting IG Index’s claim. Like Mr Osborn she benefited from the fraudulent bets placed by her son on her account to the detriment of IG Index.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In her defence it was pleaded that she had changed her position in good faith and to her detriment in the belief that she was beneficially entitled to the profits from the betting transactions made by her son acting pursuant to a power of attorney to manage her account which she conferred on him. In fact, as mentioned at the trial Mrs Benn accepted that she did not confer such a power of attorney on her son. Nonetheless she did authorise him to do anything necessary in connection with the operating of her account. It was pleaded that the profits made on the bets were paid into an Alliance and Leicester bank account in the joint names of herself and her husband and then paid from that account to Tom Benn’s account with the Royal Bank of Scotland. She had not herself been enriched by the payments and has parted with the money which she is alleged to have received in breach of her fiduciary duty. She would not have parted with such money if she had been aware of IG Index’s claim. It would in the circumstances be inequitable to require her to pay compensation or make restitution to the Claimant.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mrs Benn was not legally represented at the trial and this contention was not developed by her. Leaving aside the fact that Tom Benn acted pursuant to oral authority rather than a written power of attorney, the fact that Mrs Benn has parted with the profits made on her account through the fraudulent bets placed by her son by giving them to her son does not in my judgment constitute a defence to IG Index’s claim that she is liable to it in damages as a result of the tortious fraudulent acts of her son. Apart from anything else on Mrs Benn’s evidence she has a good claim to receive from her son any money she has paid him. There is no evidence that she has asked him to do so or that he cannot or will not do so.</p>

Her liability to compensate IG Index for the losses it had incurred arises out of her vicarious liability for the fraud of her son which caused them. Just as in the case of Mr Osborn there is no evidence that Mr Colley was aware that Tom Benn was using Mrs Benn’s account to place any of the fraudulent bets following his insertion of false dividends.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">IG Index also has a claim against Mrs Benn pursuant to its asserted right to amend the opening level of the relevant bets under the Manifest Error clause. In her defence it was not admitted that IG Index’s current Manifest Error clause applied to her and IG Index was put to proof of the terms of the agreements in force at all material times. In her application to open an account Mrs Benn declared that she had read the version of the Spread Betting Customer Agreement dated November 2001 and consented to be bound by its terms in respect of her dealings with IG Index. In the absence of any other evidence in my judgment that is the Agreement governing her relations with IG Index. The Manifest Error clause was in the same terms as that applicable to Mr Regan save that in the first sentence in place of the words “from the outset” there appeared the words “Ab initio”. In my judgment nothing turns on that distinction. Like the other Defendants Mrs Benn in her Defence denied that if there was an error it was a Manifest Error. For the reasons already given I do not accept that contention.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Further or in the alternative it was contended that the effect of the first sentence of the second sub-clause of the Manifest Error clause is that IG Index is liable for any loss to Mrs Benn following a Manifest Error caused by the wilful default or fraud of its employee Mr Colley for which it is vicariously liable. She will have suffered loss by reason of the wilful default or fraud of IG Index if she is required to pay it profits which she made in consequence of the Manifest Error caused by Mr Colley’s fraud or wilful default. She has paid those profits to her son with the result that she would suffer loss if she has to repay them to IG Index. She is therefore entitled to set off the amount of profits she is asked to repay to IG Index which she has paid to her son.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Next it was contended in her Defence that it was an implied term that IG Index must act reasonably in exercising its right to amend the terms of a bet on the basis of a Manifest Error and it would be unreasonable not to take into account her change of position in having paid money to her son. That was said not to be covered by the right of IG Index not to take into account any financial commitment that the customer has entered into or refrained from entering into in reliance on a bet. I do not accept that submission. In my judgment there is no material difference between giving away the profits made on a Bet and using them to discharge a commitment so far as the reasonableness of IG Index’s right not to take it into account is concerned. IG Index had no way of knowing the use to which its customers would put any profits made on bets placed as a result of a Manifest Error and it was entitled in my view to ignore such matters. Bets may be closed within minutes of being placed and before any Manifest Error comes to light.  The protection afforded to IG Index by the Manifest Error clause would be undermined if it were dependent on the customer having retained the profits at the time the error was discovered. In any event in this case the reason it was not discovered earlier was entirely the fault of Mrs Benn’s son who was her agent. </p>

That is of particular significance since the first ground on which it was contended that the Manifest Error clause in the current version of the Agreement was unfair was that it enabled IG Index to amend the terms of the Bet unilaterally where it believed there had been a Manifest Error with no corresponding right being given to the consumer. </p>

IG Index’s right to amend was not in my judgment unfair or contrary to the requirement of good faith and did not cause a significant imbalance in the parties’ rights and obligations. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In her Defence Mrs Benn contended that by seeking to exclude or restrict liability in reliance on the second sub-clause of the Manifest Error clause for breach of an implied term that it would exercise reasonable care and skill in the provision of services IG Index has sought to exclude all strict liability for its own breach of contract and that that provision does not satisfy their requirement of reasonableness in section 3(2) of the 1977 Act. That contention is in my view misconceived. IG Index did not rely on the second sub-clause to exclude or restrict its liability for breach of any implied term. Nor in my judgment was it in breach of any such implied term.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It was further contended that by seeking to exclude its liability for negligence and/or in relying on a Manifest Error, where such error has been caused by the negligence of one of its employees IG Index was seeking to be entitled to render a contractual performance substantially different from that which was reasonably expected of it contrary to section 3(2)(b)(i) of the 1977 Act and the Manifest Error clause did not satisfy the requirement of reasonableness in that respect. Again I do not accept that contention. IG Index did not seek to exclude its liability for negligence nor was the Manifest Error caused by the negligence of one of IG Index’s employees. It was caused by Mr Colley’s dishonest conduct but for the reasons I have already given. In my judgment the Manifest Error clause was apt to cover a Manifest Error in such circumstances. By seeking to amend the level of the bet to that which would have operated but for the Manifest Error in my judgment it cannot be said that IG Index was seeking to be entitled to render a contractual performance substantially different from that which was reasonably expected of it. On the contrary what was reasonably expected was that the parties should contract at the level which would have applied but for a Manifest Error. </p>
