	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">The claimant (“SABIC”) is a manufacturer of petrochemical products.  It is a subsidiary of the Saudi Basic Industries Corporation and is part of the SABIC group, which is a major producer of plastics in Europe and has a centre of European operations in the Netherlands.  In 2006, when it was known as Huntsman Petrochemicals (UK) Limited, SABIC wanted to develop a plant capable of producing 400 kilotonnes of low density polyethylene (“LDPE”) per annum on part of the old ICI site at Wilton.  To that end, it turned to Simon Carves Ltd (“SCL”).  SCL was part of the Punj Lloyd group, and was a subsidiary of the defendant (“PLL”), which is based in India.  SCL held itself out as being a world leader in the delivery of LDPE plants, and it had considerable experience in the application of proprietary licensed engineering knowhow from ExxonMobil [“EM”] in their delivery.  SCL went into administration in 2011 having received substantial financial support from PLL over a number of years before then.  PLL is the defendant to SABIC’s claims because it provided a Parental Company Guarantee in respect of SCL’s performance of the Wilton contract in June 2008.  When speaking about the presentation of the case against SABIC, I shall generally refer to PLL and SCL collectively as PLL/SCL. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">On 9 February 2006, SABIC entered into a contract with SCL by which SCL agreed to design, procure and construct the LDPE plant.  The contract sum was £135 million. SCL was required to provide a performance bond in the sum of £13.5 million, which it did.   By the end of 2006 it was apparent that the original date for completion would not be met and the parties entered into a compromise, which varied the main contract by extending the completion date and increasing the contract price by just under £5.5 million. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">Further problems arose as a result of which the revised completion date was not going to be met.  SABIC considered that SCL was failing to discharge its obligations under the contract, while SCL contended that it was entitled to additional payments over and above the revised contract price.  After a meeting of senior management, a handshake agreement was reached on 15 May 2008.  That agreement was eventually formalised in a further agreement and variation of the main contract on 2 July 2008, known as SSA2. </p>

	  <num style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000;background-color:auto;margin-left:0.50in">4.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">The agreement which led to SSA2 had a number of key provisions.  First, SCL agreed to carry out certain works that it had previously said were outside the scope of its contractual obligations.  Second, the parties identified the date upon which ethylene could first be introduced into the plant for the purposes of commissioning (the “Ethylene In Date” or “EID”) as the critical date going forward.  They agreed that EID should be on 5 December 2008, in accordance with a Completion Plan that was agreed and incorporated as part of the compromise; and they agreed that liquidated damages should be payable by reference to the EID rather than (as had previously been the case) by reference to Sectional Completion Dates.  Third, SCL agreed to procure the services of such key subcontractors as were necessary to ensure the EID of 5 December 2008.  Fourth, SABIC agreed to make payment of the whole of the balance of the existing contract price (which amounted to £14,338,609) in advance although it was not yet due.  The advance payment was made on 1 or 2 July 2008.  Fifth, in return for the advance payment, SCL was required to provide an Advance Payment Guarantee in the sum of £15 million, which it did on 24 June 2008.  Fifth, the existing contract price was increased by a further £15 million.   Sixth, SABIC agreed to pay the additional £15 million in advance of completion of the works, which it did on 2 September 2008.  Seventh, any claims which SCL may have had up to 2 July 2008 were compromised and, subject to immaterial exceptions, so were any claims which SABIC may have had against SCL. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">The background to SSA2 and its terms will be considered in greater detail later.  For present purposes it is sufficient to say that SABIC’s decision to make the advanced payment of £14.3 million and also to pay the additional £15 million in advance of completion of the works was influenced by its concern that SCL was in financial difficulties and its hope that the aggregate advanced payment of nearly £30 million would enable SCL to complete its work on SABIC’s LDPE project. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">Further difficulties arose and further slippage to the timetable occurred after SSA2.  Just three months after SSA2, SABIC issued a letter on 3 October 2008, relying upon terms of the original Conditions of Contract that would allow SABIC to terminate the contract if  “despite previous warning by [SABIC] in writing [SCL] is failing to proceed with the Engineering Works with due diligence or is otherwise persistently in material breach of its obligations under the Contract” or if “the financial position of [SCL] deteriorates to such an extent that the capability of [SCL] adequately to fulfil its obligations under the Contract has been placed in jeopardy.”<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
		<p class="footnotedescription"> Clauses 27.2.10 and 27.2.5 respectively. </p>
	      </authorialNote>    A month later, on 3 November 2008, SABIC terminated the contract and took on the task of bringing the project to completion itself, employing the same principal sub-contractors as SCL had used before termination.  At about the same time, it called in the Advance Payment Guarantee of £15 million and the Performance Guarantee of £13 million.  PLL/SCL dispute SABIC’s entitlement to terminate the contract on both procedural and substantive grounds.  They also dispute SABIC’s entitlement to call upon or retain the proceeds of the Performance Bond or the Advance Payment Guarantee. </p>

These authorities therefore tend to support the proposition that the obligation of diligence will be linked to the parties’ contractual obligations.

The absolute obligation to achieve EID by 5 December 2008 was imposed by Clause 25 of SSA2, with non-compliance giving rise to liability for liquidated damages.  Unless and until that date was changed (which it never was) SCL was under two separate obligations, which were (a) to achieve EID on that date and (b) to exercise due diligence in pursuing that objective.  A failure to achieve EID on 5 December 2008 would amount to a breach of the first obligation but not necessarily of the second.   Similarly, once SSA2 introduced the obligation upon SCL in completing the Engineering Works to procure the services of such key subcontractors as were necessary to ensure the [EID] of 5 December, SCL was under two separate obligations, which were (a) to procure the services of such subcontractors as were necessary to ensure the EID of that date and (b) to exercise due diligence in pursuing that objective. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">However, I would not accept that the mere fact that an absolute contractual obligation is or has become impossible for SCL to achieve renders that contractual obligation irrelevant when considering the separate obligation to exercise due diligence. A number of points arise.  First, the fact that complying with one or more of its absolute contractual obligations has become impossible or not realistically achievable for a particular contractor does not mean or imply that those obligations are objectively incapable of achievement.  The court is likely to look to the contractor who asserts that it is impossible to comply with his absolute contractual obligation to prove it.  On the facts of this case, there can be no doubt that by October 2008 SCL was not going to achieve EID by 5 December 2008 (for reasons that are examined in detail later).  However, no one has set out to prove that it would (or would not) then have been quite impossible to achieve under any and all circumstances.  Second, the fact that by October 2008 the parties contemplated that EID would not be achieved before February or March 2009 if the EPC Contract remained in place does not mean that February or March was necessarily the earliest date upon which in any circumstances </p>

	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.00in">EID could have been achieved.  Third, there is nothing in the terms of the contract to suggest that the obligation to exercise due diligence should be emptied of content in the event or to the extent that a particular contractual obligation was or became incapable of performance.  Taking the contractual completion date as a working example, if achievement of that date became impossible and the Purchaser would be deprived of his plant by the Contractor’s breach of contract then, in the absence of special circumstances, the Purchaser is likely to want his plant as soon as possible.  In those circumstances the obligation to exercise due diligence should attach to the contractual objective of minimising the ongoing breach.  In other words, if an absolute contractual requirement becomes incapable of performance, the obligation to exercise due diligence will attach to the nearest possible approximation to proper contractual performance of the obligation.  Fourth, where a contractor asserts that an absolute contractual obligation (to which an obligation of due diligence is attached) has become incapable of performance, the court is likely to wish to scrutinise the reasons why it is said to have become incapable of performance.  Fifth, the obligation to exercise due diligence is flexible in the sense that what constitutes due industry, assiduousness, efficiency and expedition will depend upon what is required from time to time to achieve the contractual objects in hand.  It follows that, unless the terms of the contract compel a different conclusion, circumstances may arise where the exercising of due diligence may require the taking of measures that were not originally contemplated in order to achieve (or come as close as possible to achieving) the contractual objects in hand – and these may include accelerative measures if that is what is required. </p>

There is no substance in this point.   Clause 20.2 includes a sequence of sub-clauses, of which Clause 20.2.2 is one, which apply when it becomes reasonably apparent to the contractor that the progress of the Engineering Works is likely to be delayed “by any event which would entitle [SCL] to an adjustment of Sectional Completion Dates.”  In those circumstances, SCL is to give notice of the event as soon as possible (Clause 20.2.1) and shall use best endeavours to avoid or mitigate any delay but without being required to increase resources (Clause 20.2.2).  The reasoning is clear: SCL does not have to increase resources because the delay will entitle it to a change in the Sectional Completion date and therefore it should not be obliged to increase resources to try to restore the original date.  That reasoning and the terms of Clause 20.2 do not apply more generally.  It is therefore quite wrong to suggest that Clause 20.2.2 and Clause 20.4 are related so as to provide a comprehensive code covering SCL’s obligations in the event of delay.  Taken on its own, Clause 20.4 gives SABIC protection in circumstances where it identifies that a delay has been or will be caused by reasons attributable to SCL.  However, it does not follow that if SABIC does not implement the Clause 20.4 machinery SCL can allow delay to accrue with impunity.  It remains under its obligation to comply with its contractual obligations, including as to the achievement of Sectional Completion Dates (under the original Conditions of Contract) or EID (under the contract as amended by SSA2) and the need to exercise due diligence to that end. </p>

What would satisfy the obligation to act with due diligence would depend upon what was required in order to achieve the contractual objects and might include the adoption of accelerative measures if delay occurred which threatened those contractual objects.  There is no reason to think that the obligation of due diligence would become less onerous if it was or became impossible for a particular contractual object to be achieved.  Delay does not of itself provide conclusive proof of lack of due diligence; but it may suggest and evidence a lack of due diligence and may call for an explanation – not least because if and to the extent that the delay is attributable to a breach by SABIC of its obligations under Clause 3 of the Conditions of Contract, SCL is released from its obligation to carry out and complete the Engineering Works in accordance with the Contract and with due diligence. Although once the achievement of the contractual object becomes impossible the exercise of due diligence will, by definition, not render it possible, the standard to be applied is not to be determined by what can realistically be achieved when the particular contractor’s rate of progress is being assessed. Due diligence is not determined subjectively by reference to the individual contractor’s achievements (or lack of them): it is a contractual requirement with which the contractor must comply; and it is to be assessed in the light of the other contractual obligations that the contractor has undertaken.  In that sense it is an objective concept, though its requirements will depend in each case upon the terms of the contract in question. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">The first point to note is that the Completion Plan specified steps to be taken by each of the parties on the way to EID.   Second, SSA2 imposed obligations that were in addition to those to which the parties were already subject pursuant to the EPC Contract, not all of which were varied or superseded by SSA2.  The subsisting obligations included the obligations imposed upon SCL by Clause 2.1.1: see [14] above.  Third, 5 December 2008 was a fixed point which both parties had agreed “to secure” and in respect of which SCL was under the express obligations imposed by Clause 32: see [28] above.  Fourth, in the context of a major construction project (or even the later stages of one as in this case) it might be thought commercially absurd to suggest that any deviation from the interim times in a complex programme, however modest, constituted a breach of the obligation to secure the [EID] of 5 December 2008 “in accordance with the Completion Plan.”  However hard and cooperatively the planners worked in order to produce the Completion Plan, it was inevitable that some tasks would or even could not be executed in precisely the time allowed by the planners in the Completion Plan.  That said, the agreed Completion Plan was agreed by the parties to demonstrate how the EID of 5 December 2008 “shall” be achieved.  In order to give this a commercially sensible meaning, there were therefore two separate obligations: the first was to achieve the EID of 5 December 2008; the second was to achieve it substantially in accordance with the route set out in the Completion Plan, making due allowance for the necessary imprecision of the planner’s predictions of how long individual steps would in fact take.  Substantial compliance was reasonably to be expected because of (a) the fixed date for EID and (b) the ability to increase speed as necessary by the application of additional resources. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">First, I have already said that the EPC contract made detailed provision for collaboration between the parties.  The key personnel identified in the Conditions of Contract were the Project Director, who generally had full authority to act on behalf of SABIC in connection with the Contract, and the Contractor’s Representative, who was to have full authority to act for SCL in connection with the Engineering Works.  The Contract had many and detailed provisions identifying how SABIC, and in particular the Project Director, should interface with SCL, and in particular the Contractor’s Representative.  For example, SCL was to provide programmes “setting out in such manner as the Project Director may reasonably require” the manner in which it intended to carry out the Engineering Works and “the date by which the Contractor reasonably requires that the Project Director should have provided any further Documentation or information or taken any other action required under the contract to permit the Contractor to perform its obligations.”<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="11">
		<p class="footnotedescription"> Clause 6.1 of the Conditions of Contract. </p>
	      </authorialNote>  To like effect, the Contractor was obliged to provide within 7 days from the end of each calendar month (or at such other times as the Project Director shall from time to time direct), a progress report to the Project Director on the progress of the Engineering Works.  There was to be a meeting to review such reports and, following such review, SCL was required “to co-operate with the Project Director and shall take such steps as may be reasonably required to expedite performance if performance is not in accordance with the Contract.”<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="12">
		<p class="footnotedescription"> Clause 6.3 of the Conditions of Contract. </p>
	      </authorialNote>  The many provisions provided a detailed and express contractual framework for co-operation between the parties.

The list provided by the Description of Works was also extensive and included express provision for many activities which in other contracts have been the subject of implied terms.  By way of example, Section 4.5 of the Description of Works included amongst SABIC’s responsibilities that “[SABIC] will ensure that access to the site is made available to the Contractor as shown in Attachment 23” and that SABIC would “obtain Regulatory Approvals, permits and licenses to build and </p>

A further example is provided by the detailed express provisions at Section 2.6 of the Description of Works, which itemised the stages whereby Systems would be handed over from SCL to SABIC.  These included SCL giving “the opportunity to the Project Director to carry out an inspection of the System” which would result in “the preparation of a detailed Punch List by [SABIC’s] Commissioning Team to identify any defects to the plant specification”.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">Fifth, when the terms of SSA2 were being negotiated, an issue arose between the parties as to whether the recitals should include a statement to the effect that the parties would “collaborate”.  Agreement was not reached because of disagreements that were internal to SABIC and went right to the highest levels of management of SABIC Europe.  As a result the proposed provision was not included.  Pre-contract negotiations are inadmissible as an aid to construction, and I do not draw any assistance from these negotiations when interpreting the contract.  However, the fact of the negotiations is a timely reminder that both the EPC contract and SSA2 were the product of detailed negotiations between substantial and sophisticated commercial parties.  This does not exclude the possibility of implied terms; but the court should be careful to resist the easy but unjustifiable tendency to assume that a term which the parties have not incorporated as an express term is to be introduced by the court as an implied term.  In other words, in a context such as this, the court’s first instincts should be to respect the terms of the contract which the parties have agreed rather than to introduce terms which they have not.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">Sixth, there is a tension between the terms that PLL/SCL have proposed in this case, which is the result of a lack of precision in formulation. Neither term addresses what should be the contractual outcome in circumstances where actions taken by SABIC which are intended to be cooperative and with a view to achieving the desired outcome have the unintended effect of hindering progress.  In many cases this question might not arise and so the lack of precision would not matter, but that is not so in the present case.  Here, one of the major areas of complaint is that SABIC’s involvement in negotiations with Cape hindered or prevented SCL’s progress.  However, by the conclusion of the trial, PLL/SCL accepted (entirely correctly, in my judgment) that SABIC’s involvement with Cape “was initially no doubt an attempt which was well intentioned to assist” although it subsequently “went wrong”.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="13">
		<p class="footnotedescription"> T21/8.10-13 </p>
	      </authorialNote>  Since the implied term not to hinder or prevent is alleged to arise from an obligation to cooperate, it is not obvious that an attempt to cooperate which subsequently has the unintended effect of hindering or preventing progress should be regarded as giving rise to a breach of contract.  Put another way, any implied term requires further refinement so as to recognise the fact that, in a major contractual undertaking such as this, the road to prevention, hindrance or non-performance may be paved with good intentions.  For this reason if no other, in my judgment, the implied term for which PLL/SCL contended in their pleadings is too crude to be justifiable. </p>

The Description of Works therefore does not purport to be an exhaustive list of SABIC’s obligations even though it is stated to be an exhaustive list of “activities” that are to be SABIC’s responsibility.  Furthermore, if taken on its own, the activities listed in the Description of Works themselves could be said to leave room for further elaboration.  For example, Section 2.6 of the Description of Works does not say how soon after he is given the opportunity to inspect the Project Director should prepare and present his Punch List of defects.  Taken in isolation, this can be said to be a matter of timing that is germane to the good working of the contract and one for which no express provision has been made.  However, even if the contract leaves scope for implying a term that Punch Lists should be prepared and presented within a reasonable (or a particular) time after the opportunity to inspect is given, this is not a sound basis for implying a much broader term such as those for which PLL/SCL contend.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">When the possibility of implying those broader terms is considered, the court is confronted by the fact that the contract makes detailed express provision for collaboration and cooperation between the parties and for the contractual consequences if SCL is hindered or prevented by SABIC from achieving its contractual obligations.  Even if those express provisions are found not to cover every conceivable circumstance that could arise, they argue powerfully against the notion that the implication of further implied terms about cooperation or hindering or preventing is necessary or what the parties would inevitably have assumed should happen or would have understood as the meaning of the contract.  When that is allied with the tension that I have just identified, I consider that the correct conclusion is to reject the existence of the implied terms as formulated and proposed by PLL/SCL.  This conclusion is not dependant upon the burden of proof and applies whether or not, as PLL/SCL contend, the burden rests upon SABIC to disprove the existence of the terms because they are similar or identical to those that are sometimes described as “usual” in construction contracts. </p>

Neither party made detailed submissions about what would constitute a “wrongful” prevention in this context; nor were any detailed submissions made on what exactly would constitute a “wrongful act or omission” for the purposes of Clause 18 or an “action of prevention or default” for the purposes of Clause 20.2.5.  However, at this stage of this judgment it is sufficient to find that it is the express terms of the contract that governed the parties’ conduct in this regard and not any implied term such as proposed by PLL/SCL.   </p>

That contractual context included the steps to be taken by SABIC, and specified the contractual consequences if SABIC failed to perform.  The contractual context also included the provisions of Clause 20, which specified the circumstances in which SCL’s obligation to comply with Sectional Completion Dates could be relaxed, including the occurrence of circumstances constituting force majeure as defined by the contract.  As a matter of factual record, PLL/SCL have not contended that any circumstances entitling SCL to adjustment of Sectional Completion Dates or the 5 December 2008 date for EID have occurred.  Instead, they have asserted a number of facts which they allege amount to hindering or disrupting the expeditious progress of the works: these allegations, to the extent that they were maintained by the end of the trial and in closing submissions, will be considered later in this judgment.  In addition to the allegations of hindering and disruption, it has also been submitted that the issue of SCL’s exercise of due diligence is affected by the fact that, on PLL/SCL’s case, EID would not have been achievable on 5 December 2008 because of work being carried on by SABIC on the Secondary Compressor.  This is addressed in detail later; but PLL/SCL’s case raises a relevant legal question: what is the impact upon SCL’s obligation of due diligence of an external occurrence (i.e. one for which SCL was not responsible) which would in any event have prevented the achievement of EID on 5 December 2008?  There is a short answer to this question.  SCL’s obligation was to exercise due diligence to carry out and complete its part of the Engineering Works in accordance with the contract.  If some external event over which SCL had no control and for which it was not responsible prevented EID occurring on 5 December 2008, that might in theory (but not, in fact, in this case) trigger a relaxation of the 5 December 2008 date; and it might also be shown that the effect of the external event was to prevent SCL performing its other works with the diligence that would otherwise have been required of it.  However, this is case and fact sensitive and would require SCL to show that its conduct had in fact been affected by the external event.  If, for example, SCL had not been aware of the external event, it seems unlikely that it could justify a failure to progress its works by reference to an event of which it had been unaware at the time and which therefore did not affect its conduct.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">Some matters internal to SCL might also be material to the exercise of due diligence, though SCL’s internal inability to discharge the contractual obligations that it had freely undertaken is unlikely to be material.  For example, PLL/SCL submitted that a delay to progress resulting from the illness of a member of SCL’s personnel would not amount to a lack of due diligence.  So far as I am aware, this did not happen, and it is not advanced as an actual reason affecting the issues in the case.  If it had been, I would have rejected the submission.  The obligation to man and manage the project appropriately was one that was undertaken in the knowledge that illness can strike.  On a contract such as this, in the absence of express provision, the contractor’s obligation to man and manage continues and has to be discharged even if an employee is ill. </p>

There were issues about the scope of SCL’s contract works, but SABIC’s fundamental concern was that SCL’s project management lacked leadership and drive. In March 2008 SABIC drew up a number of options for internal consideration.  Those options included continuing with SCL, which gave an estimated EID of the end of 2008 but was considered to be a high risk strategy; or terminating the Contract with SABIC completing the works, which gave an estimated delay of 4-6 months over the best option; or SABIC taking an increased role in carrying out the work, which gave the best option in terms of time, with an estimated EID of October 2008.  In a presentation to SABIC made on 14 April 2008, SCL referred to contractual issues arising out of what it considered to be disruptive engineering modifications; it also acknowledged that there were difficulties in working relations between SCL and subcontractors, to which it said that it was committing Senior Management resources.  Despite these difficulties, SCL was projecting EID for 3 December 2008 i.e. about the mid-point of SABIC’s March 2008 projections.   </p>

Given reassurances that SCL was still receiving support from PLL, he confirmed that the company could continue to trade.  Later in the meeting the board agreed that the accounts should be prepared on the basis that the SABIC contract would break even “since this was the minimum acceptable outcome” and despite the prospect that this might lead to the accounts being qualified. </p>

First, given the projected loss of £66 million and the absence of any realistic prospect of recovering that loss, there was no rational justification for preparing the accounts on the basis that the SABIC contract would break even.  Mr Leggett said that the decision to prepare the accounts on that basis represented the board’s view and, when pressed, that it “more or less” represented his view.  That evidence is incredible in the face of the information that was being presented to the board and Mr Leggett at the time.   Second, SCL was being advised that it could continue to trade, but only on the assurance that it was still being supported by PLL.  Third, and most important, it is apparent from the minutes of this meeting and from a wealth of subsequent evidence, some of which I shall refer to below, that from 30 April 2008 SCL’s strategy in its dealings with SABIC and its running of the contract was dominated by the need to recover some of the losses that it faced on the contract.  To that end, SCL set about adopting the tough stance with SABIC that the board had sanctioned.  </p>

The same day, 1 May 2008, Mr Buckley sent Mr Leggett two spreadsheets.  The first showed the savings to be achieved by a “structured ramp down, maintaining some integrity and quality”; the second, which would achieve greater savings, was “a non-structured ramp down, immediate cut-off of trades, maintaining the scaffolding crews to strip the scaffold.” </p>

That was not what happened.  After site meetings on 6 May 2008, SCL wrote to Shaw, its mechanical subcontractors, and Cape, its insulation and PFP subcontractors.  The letter to each subcontractor confirmed an instruction for them to cease all further weekend overtime working and immediately to remove the night shift.  In addition, they were instructed to issue notice of demobilisation to 50% of the combined workforce and staff book total (with the exception of Cape’s scaffolders).  According to Mr Buckley, this was the structured demobilisation approach to which he had referred in his email on 1 May 2008.  Evidence was adduced which showed that Shaw were in fact over-manned on site for the work that was currently available for them.  However, I find that the driving motivation behind the instructions to demobilise both Shaw and Cape was the one which Mr Abel had identified in his email to Mr Buckley and which Mr Teague had been told in confidence, namely to reduce SCL’s spend on site.  This in turn was driven by SCL’s financial standing and the losses it was incurring on the contract and not by any considerations of what was required to bring the project to a successful and timely conclusion. </p>

It had been told that SCL was unable to meet its proposed programme without further cash injections from SABIC and had only averted substantial demobilisation by the intervention of Mr Al-Ohali with Mr Punj.  In addition, and not surprisingly, there was gossip on Teesside that SCL were in difficulties.  SABIC therefore decided to call a meeting of SCL’s subcontractors.  Mr Booth intended that SCL should be invited and asked Mr Teague to invite them.  Although Mr Teague’s recollection was </p>

The meeting went ahead without SCL despite some of the contractors expressing concerns at SCL’s absence.  The key messages included that SABIC was and remained committed to the completion and successful commissioning of the project and that it continued to hold discussions with SCL to resolve the current situation and other differences.  SABIC confirmed its understanding that there had been difficulties with payments to subcontractors and said it had every confidence in the capability of the main subcontractors to complete the project.  It ended with the plea: “Before you lay people off from our Project, please talk to us.” </p>

Mr Teague accepted that the presentation contemplated SCL becoming insolvent, but he justified that premise by reference to the fact the subcontractors were, with reason, very worried that SCL were going to become insolvent and SABIC were very concerned that the subcontractors may not wish to continue with the project if SCL dropped out.  I accept his evidence that the purpose of the presentation was to give confidence to the subcontractors that SABIC were determined to complete the project as soon as possible, even if the worst came to the worst and SCL became insolvent.  I also accept that SABIC viewed the prospect of SCL becoming insolvent as the worst coming to the worst.  I reject the suggestion that this meeting was an unjustified interference with SCL’s position as main contractor.  It was a reasonable commercial and strategic response to a very difficult position.  SCL was directly responsible for that difficult position: it had cultivated it by using its financial difficulties as a central bargaining tactic in its negotiations on 30 April 2008 and by its demobilisation instructions on 6 May, which were inconsistent with the plan it had recently presented to SABIC and contrary to the assurance that Mr Teague had been given that no demobilisation would occur before the week commencing 12 May 2008.  It could not reasonably complain if SABIC took steps to protect its position against the possibility of SCL dropping out of the project. </p>

That does not mean that everyone at SABIC was confident that the commitment to SCL was the right choice or that there was widespread confidence that SCL would perform as it agreed.  In particular, Mr Teague always doubted SCL’s ability to bring the project to fruition; but he was overruled by the decisions made by his superiors and, at least until quite late on, his commitment to SABIC and SABIC’s need to bring the project home outweighed his doubts about SCL, and that he acted properly in his role as Project Director seeking to implement the contract successfully.  Whatever the doubts harboured by individuals, I have no hesitation in rejecting any suggestion that the handshake deal and SSA2 were merely stratagems that were intended to set SCL up to fail. </p>

The weekly statistics produced by SCL were plotting progress against the then current programme (AP24) which showed EID on 25 October 2008.  This programme was the result of SCL’s rebaselining in April 2008.  The 13 June 2008 weekly statistics showed a clear falling off from planned progress in several areas, including equipment &amp; pipework installation, insulation, PFP, and loop checking.  On 13 June 2008 SABIC wrote to SCL expressing their serious concern that SCL was already 2 weeks behind required progress and that, in the context of continuing slippage by SCL against programme requirements, it was “undertaking a severe de-manning exercise at a time when the current level of manpower is failing to achieve the required progress.”  It also pointed out that there was yet no contract in place between SCL and Halliburton who were the selected Cleaning &amp; Blowing subcontractor. </p>

It referred to independent research proving that prolonged and excess overtime resulted in reduced productivity rates and that increasing manning levels to compensate for low productivity levels also has the same effect.  It stated that “a management decision was reached to balance the site manning to a level consistent with the work to go and achieving the overall completion schedule.”; and it stated that the reduction in the insulation labour force was a temporary measure and that it would be increased as necessary to enable the EID of 5 December 2008 to be secured.  No contemporaneous document has been identified to support this explanation.  It is inconsistent with the ample evidence that SCL’s reduction was at least primarily driven by its own financial concerns. It was substantially untrue and I reject it.   In evidence Mr Buckley supported the letter’s assertion that the reduction was a temporary measure, but he was unable to point to any document supporting this view.  While he may have had some hope that manning levels would increase again one day, I reject his evidence to the extent that it suggested that there was any coherent plan to increase manning levels in the future. He also suggested that the reason why SCL decided to stop spending money was that negotiations on SSA2 were not getting very far.  I reject this explanation: it was not suggested by SCL at the time and, although the finalisation of SSA2 took some time, there is no evidence of particular difficulties or of any suggestion that SABIC was going to renege on the handshake deal. </p>

That plan had been compiled by the planners on both sides, but neither set of planners knew of the de-manning that was taking place.  On 1 July 2008, the day before SSA2, Mr Hall sent an email to Mr Buckley which adverted to the fact that there had been demanning which was not reflected in the current plan and indicated a level of concern that the plan would be misleading if issued without taking the de-manning into account.  There is no evidence that his concerns (or the mismatch between the current plan and current resourcing levels) was brought to SABIC’s attention, and I find as a fact that they were not.  </p>

In addition, Mr Buckley knew that the EID to which they were meant to be working was 5 and not 18 December 2008.  My assessment of him is that he would not have deliberately instructed Mr Hall to plan to the wrong EID for two main reasons.  First, although the programme later slipped, it would have been irrational to programme on the basis of achieving EID on 18 December 2008 on 2 July 2008 when the contractual EID was (and was known to be) 5 December and there is no other evidence to suggest that SCL had yet given up on that date. Second, even if he had been tempted to do so and Mr Hall had not objected, the level of planning expertise that was available to SABIC and the degree of continuing communication and collaboration between the planners would have raised the pragmatic problem that SABIC would be likely to rumble what was going on.  Finally, the parties have not identified any S-curves produced as a result of Mr Buckley’s instruction to Mr Hall which were based upon achieving an EID of 18 December 2008. </p>

As a result, I find as a fact that programme to which Mr Buckley referred in his email on 2 July 2008 was a version of 12JU with a Data Date of 16 June and which showed an EID of 5 December 2008.  That still leaves unresolved the question why he should have instructed Mr Hall to use a 12JU programme rather than the contractual 10JU completion programme.  That question was one for which Mr Buckley did not provide answer.  However, it has not been shown that working with the 12JU rather than the 10JU programme had any significant impact on SCL’s planning or progress and it is not self-evident that it must have done so.  It is therefore of less practical importance than the fact that SCL’s planning ignored the de-manning about which Mr Buckley was aware but Mr Hall was not. </p>

The further £15 million was stipulated in SSA2 to be payable on or before 31 July 2008 conditional upon SCL achieving milestones identified in Appendix 3 to SSA2 and the procurement of the PCG from PLL.  The PCG was provided but the milestones had not been achieved by the time that SABIC paid the additional £15 million on 2 September 2008. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">From the outset, SCL proved unable to maintain the planned levels of progress after SSA2.  Further detail appears later in this judgment.  SABIC relies upon the fact that SCL’s Weekly Progress Report for the week ending 11 July 2008 showed that no progress at all had been made on insulation during the week of SSA2, with minimal progress the week after.  The S-curve for insulation shows that progress had virtually flatlined during the four weeks commencing 16 June 2008 and was over three weeks behind programme.  This pattern was repeated elsewhere: equipment and pipework installation was falling progressively behind schedule, as was E&amp;I Installation.  However, it was insulation that caused most concern.  This was probably for a combination of reasons: Cape was recognised to be a difficult subcontractor to manage; its productivity levels were inadequate; and insulation and PFP were recognised to be on the critical path for many systems, as was pointed out by SABIC in its letter of 13 June 2008.  Mr Buckley accepted (as do I) that by May 2008 SCL’s relationship with Cape was not good.  That continued to be the case into July 2008, though relations on site were rather better than those at higher managerial and commercial levels.  Even on site there was friction, with Cape’s supervisors being discontented and lacking commitment to completion of the insulation and fireproofing work and  SCL being driven to instruct the removal of Cape’s site manager because of his refusal to accept instructions and violent and unacceptable behaviour.  These happened in May 2008, but industrial relations involving Cape and its workforce were at best strained from then on.   <span style="font-style:italic">Dealings with Cape </span></p>

The second concerned the introduction and subsequent removal of a site manager, Mr Echlin.  PLL/SCL relies upon each of these episodes as demonstrating unwarranted interference which hindered or prevented it from carrying out its obligations expeditiously and efficiently. </p>

Although SABIC had a commercial relationship with Cape by virtue of another contract known as the IMS contract, Mr Booth had not spoken to Mr Shuttleworth before and the call came out of the blue.  Mr Shuttleworth told Mr Booth that he was concerned about SCL’s administration of the subcontract valuation process and that SCL was undercertifying, issuing payment certificates late and paying invoices late.  He said that Cape had an exposure to SCL of up to £3 million.  In the course of the conversation, Mr Shuttleworth suggested to Mr Booth that Cape’s contract with SCL might be novated to SABIC.  This was the first time that novation had been suggested as a possibility.  Mr Booth said that there was nothing he could do, as it was a matter for Cape to resolve with SCL under the subcontract. </p>

Mr Al-Ohali asked them to consider how they could get SCL to get Cape to increase manning, insulation being regarded as critical to progress.  Mr Booth and Mr Teague then had a conversation with Mr Shuttleworth on 10 July 2008, during which Mr Shuttleworth suggested that SABIC should pay Cape direct for the work it was doing, adopting the rates that were current on the SABIC/Cape IMS contract.  He agreed to increase manning levels in the interim to 25 men and Mr Teague said that he would speak to Mr Buckley and get back to him.  Although Mr Buckley did not remember having a conversation with Mr Teague, I accept Mr Teague’s evidence that he spoke to Mr Buckley on 10 July and told him about the conversation with Mr Shuttleworth, including that because of the on-going disputes about payment Cape were reluctant to commit more resources to the project, that Cape had suggested that SABIC should make direct payments, and that he had said to Cape that nothing would be done without SCL’s approval.  Mr Buckley said he would go away and think about it: he did not either then or later suggest or complain to SABIC that SABIC’s involvement was unwarranted, unhelpful or should cease. </p>

During the conversation, Mr Shuttleworth raised the prospect of varying the scope of Cape’s subcontract with SCL and the scope of the SABIC/Cape IMS contract so that work which would have been carried out under the SCL subcontract would now be carried out under the IMS contract, with the result that it would be paid for direct by SABIC. Mr Buckley did not object to the suggestion being made but made clear that the position was not straightforward.  He too made clear to Mr Shuttleworth that any arrangement with Cape to that effect would require SCL’s consent and said that he would have to look into the suggestion.   </p>

Mr Shuttleworth replied to Mr Teague, copied to Mr Buckley in which he said his discussion with Mr Buckley had been very different from his earlier discussion with Mr Teague about the possible way forward.  He set out a basis of how Cape should progress and be paid which involved transferring work content from the SCL/Cape subcontract to the IMS contract.  He did not repeat his earlier suggestion that Cape’s subcontract with SCL should be novated to SABIC.  He confirmed that Cape would increase its resources to 25 insulators ASAP, pointing out that the last instruction from SCL had been to down man to “circa 10”.  Although he referred in the email to there being “agreements between the parties”, no such agreement had in fact been reached since the earlier conversations had been inconclusive.  To that extent, Mr Buckley’s view that Mr Shuttleworth was “posturing” was correct.  There was a dispute at trial about whether Mr Teague had previously told Mr Buckley that direct payment <span style="font-style:italic">on IMS rates</span> was being discussed.  What is clear is that Mr Buckley knew that direct payment under the IMS contract was on the table from the time of his conversation with Mr Shuttleworth and receipt of Mr Shuttleworth’s email. </p>

The reason for this became clear in Mr Buckley’s oral evidence.  He accepted that, if SCL had wanted SABIC not to have any direct involvement with Cape, it was important that SCL should say so clearly.  But, although he later came to think that it had detrimental results, in the period just after SSA2 he did not regard what was happening as objectionable.  At the time, he saw SABIC’s intervention about possible adjustments to the contract as all part and parcel with Mr Booth using his commercial leverage to try to help in getting Cape to increase their resources on site, which he regarded as beneficial, and for which he was grateful.  It is therefore not surprising that the impression of the SABIC team was that SCL were happy with SABIC to be involved in breaking the deadlock with Cape<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="16">

He said that SABIC had agreed to facilitate a conversation between Cape and SCL, which had now happened with the conversation between Mr Shuttleworth and Mr Buckley.  SABIC had also agreed “to use our influence with regard to timely payment of due amounts.”  He continued that “[SABIC] also offered (and the offer still stands) that if, following your conversation with [SCL] you remained concerned about payment going forward, SABIC would pay directly under the existing IMS arrangements … .” and he added “If, following your discussions with Richard Buckley you wish to adopt the IMS arrangements, I suggest that these commence from Saturday 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July.”  Mr Teague did not copy SCL in on this email.  There was no underhand or improper motive underlying his failure to do so.  It was suggested to Mr Booth in cross-examination that this email meant that if SCL could not sort things out to Cape’s satisfaction, SABIC would step in and pay them on IMS rates.  Mr Booth rejected this suggestion and was right to do so.  SABIC had already made clear that any change to the contractual structure would require SCL’s agreement and its position did not change.  Read in that light, the email meant that if, following Mr Shuttleworth’s discussions with Mr Buckley Cape still wished to adopt the IMS arrangements <span style="font-style:italic">and SCL agreed</span>, then the arrangements could commence from 19 July.   </p>

He therefore emailed Mr Teague and Mr Smith (and others) pointing out that he had received no formal order or variation to the IMS contract and nothing from SCL terminating their contract with Cape.  He also pointed out that he had heard nothing from SCL about Cape’s outstanding claims and suggested that SABIC might take direct responsibility for monies due under the SCL subcontract although Mr Buckley had promised to look into them and come back to him on 11 July 2008. </p>

Neither SCL nor SABIC considered that Cape had substantiated its claims.  At some point, Mr Leggett had a meeting with Mr Shuttleworth in the course of which Mr Shuttleworth alleged that SCL were in financial difficulties and that Cape wanted an agreement with SABIC instead.  SCL considered that the parties were too far apart and therefore did not attend the re-convened meeting; but SABIC decided to meet Cape as planned in order to listen to any proposals they might have so that they could advise SCL with the intention of moving matters forward.  Cape proposed that it should enter into a direct arrangement with SABIC from Monday 30 June 2008 and that SABIC should settle Cape’s disputed claims direct, recouping its outlay from SCL at a later date.

Noting that relations between Cape and SCL were not good, SABIC was willing to act as a quasi-mediator/arbitrator to try to broker a settlement; and he added that, because time was of the essence for the project and increased insulation resources were urgently needed, SABIC was willing to consider Cape’s proposal (for direct engagement of Cape) if “the current arrangements are untenable for a successful project.”   He also made proposals for the funding of the outstanding balance of the insulation, access and cleaning subcontracts. </p>

He described Mr Teague’s summary as “reasonably accurate”.  His view was that transferring the contract to SABIC would not make any difference as SABIC’s QS would take the same line as SCL’s in requiring justification of claims.  While he recognised the possibility of novating the contract, the email made clear that his preferred way forward was for SCL and SABIC to stand united and use their collective purchasing strength and influence to force Cape to complete their existing contractual obligations.  The email notably did not express any criticism of or complaint about SABIC’s continued involvement in the ongoing negotiations with Cape.  To the contrary, after an unsatisfactory conversation with Mr May, Mr Leggett suggested that a direct call from Mr Booth might help.

He had been brought in to Wilton after SCL had required Cape to replace its site manager on 30 June 2008.  He had previously been working on the IMS contract.  For some reason which was never fully explained, his removal from the IMS contract required authorisation from SABIC, but his employers were Cape and it was necessary for Cape and SCL to decide how Cape was going to man the Wilton site: I reject the suggestion that they merely did SABIC’s bidding in deciding to transfer Mr Echlin.  At first his influence appeared to be beneficial and welcome, but the honeymoon did not last.  On 27 July 2008 he suspended a scaffolder and supervisor for failure to adopt safe working practices.  This led to unofficial action which quickly progressed to a walk out by the scaffolding workforce.  Despite being threatened with dismissal for gross misconduct, they were still out on 30 July 2008 and Shaw’s men had downed tools in sympathy, bringing their hydrotesting to a halt. </p>

Initially he expected to stay at Wilton until about the end of September.  In the event, he remained until just before 6 November 2008, although he was away from the site during two important periods, first between 10 and 21 September and, second, between 16 and 27 October 2008 during the Warning Period.  In addition to being a highly competent construction manager (which he demonstrated by resolving disagreements between SCL and Shaw swiftly after his arrival) he is a man who holds and expresses strong views; and he saw clearly that his primary obligation was to his employers.

Furthermore, it has not been shown that the decision to transfer Mr Echlin to the Wilton site caused any delay or increase in the cost of SCL’s works.  As I have said, at the outset his involvement was welcomed and seen as beneficial to Cape’s performance on site.  No attempt has been made to show that equivalent progress would have been made if Mr Echlin had not been transferred in the first place or someone else had been transferred in his stead.  PLL/SCL has concentrated exclusively upon the happening of the strike making no allowance for the earlier benefits of Mr Echlin’s presence; but, in the light of my finding that Mr Echlin did nothing wrong in his suspending men for unsafe working practices, there is no basis for assuming that any other (competent) person in his shoes would have acted differently or that the strike would not have happened.  Even when the strike is looked at on its own, the evidence of Mr Naisbitt was that it was not a major factor affecting progress of the works.  His evidence is likely to be correct on this point: there is a complete absence of any contemporaneous assessment of the effect of the strike and SCL’s contemporaneous documents do not identify it as a major feature, though it undoubtedly could have become so if it had not been resolved promptly.  For these reasons, and because I reject the submission that SABIC is to be held responsible for his presence on site or his actions while employed there by Cape, I reject PLL/SCL’s criticisms of SABIC arising out of the employment of Mr Echlin. </p>

In his absence, Mr Turner of Cape wrote to Mr Naisbitt of SABIC wanting to discuss various matters including “position with [SABIC’s] discussions with [SCL] in terms of agreeing to a novation”, operational arrangements and control on the ground (whether by SCL or SABIC) and a payment on account in respect of the historical SCL account.  After a prod from Mr Shuttleworth to Mr Booth, Mr Naisbitt met Mr Turner on 7 August 2008. Mr Naisbitt set out his understanding of their discussions the next day, which included that “the process of any acceptable novation must come from [SCL] and Cape, SABIC will assist where applicable, but have no power to interfere in the subcontractor/contractor relationship (without the agreement of both parties). [SCL] do not favour the novation of the Access and Insulation subcontract to SABIC, and desire to continue working directly </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.00in">with Cape.”  This was regarded as “totally unacceptable” by Mr Turner who asserted that it did not “in any way” reflect the agreements that he had reached in Wilton the previous week.  He requested an urgent meeting.  Mr Naisbitt replied that, given SCL’s reluctance to consent to novation, the matter was out of SABIC’s hands.  A meeting was then set up to be held between Cape and SABIC on 12 August, in advance of which Cape sent to SABIC a draft tri-partite novation agreement which would have novated the existing SCL/Cape subcontract from SCL to SABIC.  The draft said nothing about altering the terms of the sub-contract after novation or to suggest that Cape would thereafter work on other rates in general or IMS rates in particular.  Cape forwarded it to SCL on 11 August 2008, on which date there was a meeting between SABIC and SCL where Mr Booth and Mr Smith agreed with SCL that their favoured option was to find a solution that would allow the current contracting arrangements with Cape to continue as well as addressing the lack of resources being deployed by Cape.  This set the scene for the meetings involving SCL, Cape and SABIC on 12 August 2008. </p>

Mr Leggett attended on 12 August with Mr Martin, whose view was that novation was problematical – a view with which Mr Booth came to agree.  At the initial meeting, SCL and SABIC discussed the claims being put forward by Cape.  They then met Cape who pressed their claims, which were challenged by Mr Martin on the basis that further substantiation was required. It was agreed that there should be a further meeting with all three parties later in the day after SABIC and SCL had reviewed the position and come up with a proposed solution.  In the event, SCL decided not to attend a further meeting with Cape, so SABIC met Cape in their absence.  No agreement was reached.  This concluded SABIC’s active involvement in the negotiations with Cape.  At no stage had SCL objected to SABIC’s involvement in the discussions. </p>

Two days later, on 15 August 2008, Mr Buckley wrote to Cape asserting that communication between Cape and SABIC concerning any proposed or potential novation of their subcontract would itself be a breach of contract and stating that SCL did not accept the proposal to novate the subcontract.  This was the first clear rejection of the possibility of novation by SCL and marked a distinct change in the tone of the communications.  It was written because Mr Martin was beginning to take charge of events: the letter was his idea.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Martin’s primary concern was recovery of SCL’s financial position.  He had sent a detailed email to Mr Leggett on the subject on 10 August 2008 setting out SCL’s current opportunities for capital recovery; the letter to Cape on 15 August was in execution of his second recommended path forward; and he saw what he regarded as SABIC’s “mistake” in becoming involved in communications with subcontractors as “a key component” in his financial recovery strategy.  His thinking was further developed in an email to Mr Kaushik, the CEO of PLL, which he sent on 14 August 2008, setting out the financial situation as he saw it.  The projected loss to SCL as shown in the latest cost report had increased by £8.2 million. While he felt that some £3.5 million of that increase could be avoided by changes and savings, he was left with an increase in the shortfall of £4.7 million.  His view was clear: “the only credible option for recovery of the £4.7 million is Sabic.  Any attempts to manufacture claims against subcontractors or withhold payments for questionable deductions will result in contractors demanning.”  In another email, sent to Mr Kaushik on 8 August, he had reported that relations with the client site team were good, which was accurate.  In the 14 August email he identified that SABIC site management was “developing a degree of confidence the 05 December completion date will be met and understands their dependency on Simon Carves.”  This gave SCL leverage against SABIC.  In addition he set out his view that SABIC had destroyed SCL’s contractual relationship with Cape and tainted relations with other contractors; he asserted his view that SABIC’s involvement with Cape had been without the knowledge or consent of SCL and that “I do not mean to imply we will be able to demonstrate damage of £4.7 [million] but rather that we are in a strong position with the end in site”; he recommended that the time to address the shortfall of £4.7 million with SABIC was within the next 2 to 4 weeks because, as he accepted in crossexamination, that would put SCL in the best negotiating position. </p>

While the terms were slightly elliptical, the general thrust was clear: SCL gave notice that it was going to claim from SABIC in respect of any impact that SABIC’s involvement may have had on the completion of the Engineering Works or SCL’s commercial position.  In a second letter on the same day SCL said that it would be taking “appropriate recovery steps” against Cape arising out of the industrial relations problems and that it put SABIC on notice that it reserved its position generally in that </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Martin’s view of SABIC was materially affected by misunderstandings on his part.  As part of his understanding of the dealings with Cape, he came to believe that SABIC had advised Cape that they would agree to settle Cape’s outstanding claims against SCL for £1 million, which he regarded as both ridiculous and incredibly generous.  No such offer or statement was made to Cape by SABIC.  He also came to believe that SABIC had led Cape to believe it had an agreement that it would be paid on more generous rates than provided by its subcontract with SCL.  Once again, though Cape undoubtedly angled for such an agreement from about 10 July 2008 and latterly adopted the posture that it had been agreed, SABIC’s willingness to enter into an agreement was contingent on the agreement of SCL, which was not forthcoming.  Although SCL knew of this proposal from 11 July 2008, it did not object to the proposal having been made or reject it in the weeks that followed.  This may in part have been because of a common confusion about whether what was being discussed was novation of the subcontract or transfer of some of the work scope into the IMS contract or, possibly, some other composite agreement.  The main reason was that, at the time, SCL was content with SABIC’s involvement because it understood it to be a collaborative attempt to assist in getting Cape to perform.  Whatever the complete reasons, SCL did not effectively terminate the discussion until 15 August 2008.  Mr Martin’s understanding that SABIC had led Cape to believe that it had an agreement was therefore both wrong and partial.  It was wrong because any agreement was contingent; and it was partial because SCL had, by its continuing engagement in the discussions after it knew that IMS rates were being proposed by Cape, contributed to the tripartite debate which (from the point of view of both SABIC and SCL at the time) was a well-meaning and constructive attempt to find a way to get Cape to perform in accordance with the needs of the contractual programme. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">Most damaging to his relations with SABIC was that Mr Martin came to believe that SABIC had behaved duplicitously in its dealings with SCL surrounding an offer made by Mr Booth in early September 2008 arising out of Cape’s industrial action at the end of July.  Mr Booth took the view (correctly) that SABIC was not responsible for the happening of that industrial action.  However, by the beginning of September 2008 he was concerned that the time lost to the strike was not being regained and decided to make an ex gratia offer to pay demonstrable additional costs of making up the lost time.  Instead of taking up that offer of an ex gratia payment covering additional costs of making up lost time, SCL submitted a formal Variation Notification on 26 September 2008 indicating a claim for £2 million.  This bore no relation to the additional costs attributable to the Cape industrial action.  Its derivation appears to have been to take 2,000 hours for Cape and 22,000 hours for Shaw in August 2008, neither of which figures could sensibly be attributed to the consequences of the industrial action<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="17">

SABIC rejected the claim but reiterated its offer of an ex gratia payment in respect of demonstrable sums that were attributable to the industrial action on 27 October in a letter that, with justification, described SCL’s pursuit of the larger claim as “mischievous and unnecessary”. </p>

He stated during his oral evidence that, in the course of a long and cosmopolitan career he had “never experienced such duplicitous conduct as Paul Booth and Andy Teague exhibited on this contract.”  There was no justification for this view and PLL/SCL did not attempt to support it in its closing submissions; but there can be no doubt that Mr Martin held it at the time and that he felt he could not depend upon SABIC to conduct business in good faith.  The combination of SCL’s pursuit of the exaggerated and unsustainable claim and Mr Martin’s mistaken beliefs about SABIC’s conduct contributed significantly to the breakdown of trust and good relations that happened between August 2008 and the termination of the contract. </p>

I accept his evidence on this point which is consistent with Mr Martin’s evidence that “negotiations and discussion with Cape became fruitful once they were fully aware that they weren’t going to get a novation and they weren’t going to have this pot of gold at the end of the rainbow with SABIC.”  But it is clear that, even after such resolution, Cape continued to be troublesome.  During August 2008 SCL attempted to secure increases in manpower and productivity because current levels were inadequate.  On 18 August 2008 SCL wrote to Cape requiring Cape to man the work at the level required to achieve 1,000 linear metres each week and 2,000 linear metres each week from 25 August through to 17 October 2008 so as to ensure completion of pipe insulation by 31 October.  Cape responded that it had more than sufficient capability to progress the works diligently and was doing so.  It implicitly accepted that the contract was in delay but denied responsibility for the delays that had occurred, adding that if acceleration was required, the contract provided a mechanism for achieving that.  By this time, SCL was contemplating engaging other contractors to do some of Cape’s work and word had clearly got to Cape of what was in the offing, since it warned SCL of the “very serious implications of this suggestion.”  On 10 September 2008 SCL wrote again to Cape pointing out that the contract required sufficient resources to be applied to achieve some 400 linear metres each normal working day and stating that current progress was not sufficient to achieve the current programme.  On 11 September 2008 Cape wrote referring to a recent meeting and repeating the proposal they had previously made for future work to be paid on a cost reimbursable neutrally funded commercial mechanism and other commercial adjustments that would be favourable to Cape.  A similar letter was sent on 30 September.  The net effect of this correspondence was that Cape was prepared to increase resources if it was paid more but SCL was not prepared to instruct it to do so on that basis. </p>

Internally, by then SCL was deeply concerned about progress on insulation and the fact that it would not be completed on time unless there was an improvement in progress.  At the meeting, SCL presented various options and recommended terminating Cape’s contract.  Mr Teague felt that not enough thought had been given to the risks involved in bringing in another contractor but took the view that the decision was one for SCL to take.  On 23 September 2008 Mr Martin met an alternative contractor, Hertel, who told him they were prepared to start work within a week or two.  On 24 September he drafted a letter that was sent to SABIC referring back to correspondence asserting that SABIC was in breach of contract because of its dealings with Cape and outlining the four options (including termination of Cape’s subcontract).  Following his strategy of attempting to recover some or SCL’s losses from SABIC, Mr Martin attempted to shift the onus onto SABIC by saying that SABIC had not responded to the options at the meeting and that “further delay and prevarication by SABIC in determining an appropriate remedy for SABIC’s own breach of Contract and the foreseeable and natural impact this is having on SCL’s ability to procure delivery of Cape’s scope of work is hindering the programme and causing SCL to incur additional cost; all of which will require to be reflected in a Variation to our Contract.”  The letter did not mention Hertel or seek approval for Hertel to replace Cape.  At the same time, SCL was writing to Cape alleging that it was in breach of contract for failing to provide sufficient resources and that Cape’s failure was causing unnecessary delay in meeting the date of practical completion.  By now, everyone believed that insulation was on, or was coming onto, the critical path. </p>

I have already said that the motivation behind SABIC’s intervention in the negotiations with Cape was collaborative and essentially consensual.  It is correct that SABIC did not keep SCL fully informed of where the negotiations had got to at all times.  Specifically, SABIC did not copy in SCL on the email traffic which identified 19 July 2008 as the potential switch-over date with costs thereafter being funded directly by SABIC.  But SCL knew that novation and transfer of work scope to the IMS contract were under discussion and took no steps to prevent those discussions continuing; and I reject the suggestion that the failure to keep SCL informed of every stage and detail of the discussions was intended by SABIC to be covert or underhand, although it is easy to understand why, in retrospect and given the serious deterioration in relations that has since occurred, SCL has come to that view.  What is clear beyond argument is that Mr Martin saw the episode as an opportunity to generate claims alleging breaches of contract and thereby to reduce SCL’s losses on the contract. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">PLL/SCL’s case is that the effect of SABIC’s intervention was to harden Cape’s position such that Cape would not bring additional resources to site without a commercial agreement with SCL on terms that included payment on a time and materials basis.  This is alleged to have reduced the progress that could be made in relation to the insulation works during and after the negotiations.  The evidence does not establish PLL/SCL’s factual case.  First, I find that the main driver for Cape’s negotiating position was, as Mr Shuttleworth said to Mr Leggett on 24 July 2008, that Cape were concerned about SCL’s financial stability and wanted a direct contract with SABIC.  The source of that driver was the widespread perception amongst subcontractors that SCL was in financial difficulties and not any unwarranted interference by SABIC, although I accept that part of the benefit of a transfer to direct working for SABIC was that Cape were more likely to achieve their goal of a costplus basis of reimbursement.  However, the evidence does not justify the conclusion </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.00in">that Cape would have acted materially differently in the absence of SABIC’s involvement in negotiations.  In particular, the fact that some increase in resourcing and progress was achieved in October 2008 does not demonstrate that Cape would have acted differently before then.   Second, the immediate effect of SABIC’s intervention was that Cape increased its resources on site, and there is no evidence to suggest that SCL would have been more successful in arranging for further increases in the absence of SABIC’s involvement.  Third, the effective period of negotiation was relatively short, with SABIC backing out on 12 August 2008 and SCL requiring a further increase in resources from Cape within a week after that.  Fourth, a significant reason (if not the only reason) why resolution with Cape was not achieved was (in the terms of PLL/SCL’s submission) “due to Cape’s commercial expectations in relation to what remained unsubstantiated historical claims”.  Those expectations were not attributable to unwarranted interference by SABIC since SABIC and SCL were in agreement that the claims (which were claims against SCL and for SCL to deal with) were not substantiated.  Fifth, no attempt has been made by PLL/SCL to quantify the effect on progress of the interference of which it complains.  I therefore reject PLL/SCL’s factual assertion that SABIC’s involvement with Cape caused a reduction in the progress that could and would otherwise have been achieved. </p>

The lead witness for SABIC on this area of dispute was Mr Corking, who was successively SABIC’s Planning Manager and then Project Controls Manager for the Wilton Project and who was directly involved with the events in question.  For PLL/SCL the lead witness on this topic was Mr Buckley.  The person most directly concerned on behalf of SCL had been Mr Hall, SCL’s chief planner for the Wilton Project until he left SCL’s employment on 30 October 2008.  Mr Hall was not called to give evidence.  I found Mr Corking to be a thoughtful and good witness and accept the main thrust of his evidence.   </p>

However, as usual, programmes were generated as time passed which were updated to reflect past progress and adjusted to reflect current planning for the balance of the project.  Until August 2008 primary responsibility for updating programmes rested with SCL.  The programme platform being used by SCL was Primavera 3.1.  SCL was contractually obliged to provide SABIC with regular updates of programmes in pdf rather than in native format, which meant that SABIC’s ability to interrogate or understand the basis for the pdf version they were given was limited.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">Approaching August 2008, SCL was producing its updated programmes generally on a fortnightly basis only and it took another week for SCL to submit the information to SABIC.  This meant that the information that SABIC had in order to assess progress was up to three weeks out of date.  This gave rise to practical difficulties for SABIC as it was having to plan its commissioning works by reference to the plans generated by SCL and provided after the time-lag.  The position was exacerbated by the fact that Mr Hall was to go on holiday at the start of August 2008 and no deputy had been appointed in his place, which would affect SCL’s capacity to update programmes.  So, in advance of Mr Hall’s holiday, Mr Corking discussed with him a proposal for SABIC to take over the task of updating the live plan.  It was agreed that it would make more sense for SCL to pass information to SABIC to facilitate SABIC’s updating of one schedule.  SABIC’s plan was to transfer the programme to its P4.1 platform, making a terminal available to SCL, thereby reciprocating the arrangement that had been in place previously.  There was at this stage a considerable amount of collaboration between SCL’s and SABIC’s planners and I accept Mr Corking’s evidence that the intention was for SABIC and SCL to continue to work on programmes and plans together.  Mr Hall agreed to this proposal and went on holiday.  The transfer was achieved by SABIC being provided with a copy of SCL’s current programme.  SCL kept the original.  SCL was therefore free to work with its original on its own platform or on the programme that had been transferred to the SABIC platform, using the terminal made available to it for that purpose by SABIC. </p>

The original transfer was agreed by Mr Hall with Mr Corking; SCL had access to the SABIC platform and was free to input whatever data it wished either onto the original SCL programme that it had retained on his platform or by accessing the SABIC platform; and although some difficulties were being encountered, SCL did not at any stage request that SABIC hand back primary responsibility for inputting data to update programmes or for the general control of the ongoing programming.  On the evidence, SABIC carried out its responsibilities for updating programmes after the transfer responsibly and, even if the detail in the programmes as maintained by SABIC was at a higher level than SCL required for detailed planning, it was open to SCL to programme at whatever level of detail it wished for the purposes of contract management.    Equally, on the evidence, although SCL encountered some difficulties in working with the new arrangement and did not contribute to updating information on the current plan after early August 2008, PLL/SCL did not put forward any evidence that sustains the generalised pleading assertions on the effects of the transfer to which I have referred.  I find that the transfer and difficulties which followed did not make any appreciable or measurable difference to SCL’s progress in the period to termination. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">SABIC had contemplated terminating the contract before SSA2.  In April or May 2008 a detailed presentation was compiled in preparation for possible insolvency on the part of SCL.  After SSA2 it maintained what it called “Plan B” although senior management in the Netherlands were not in favour of implementing it and it ultimately took considerable persuasion from the United Kingdom management to persuade them to do so.  Given the difficulties and delays that had already been experienced on the contract there was nothing intrinsically sinister about the maintenance of Plan B, but the documents relating to it shed some light on the thinking and responses of the parties in their dealings with one another. By mid-July 2008 Mr Heath had prepared a draft summary of SABIC’s position on Plan B which identified financial deterioration and failure to proceed with due diligence as potential triggers for termination; it expressed the view that the financial choice (i.e. in favour of termination) was now clear but that other factors had to be taken into account in reaching a decision; it reviewed the prospect of “picking up” (i.e. working after termination with) various subcontractors and said that Cape had already been picked up<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="23">
		<p class="footnotedescription"> This was correct in the sense that SABIC had indicated its willingness to take over the Cape subcontract if SCL agreed and Cape was in favour of the idea, but no concluded agreement had been reached. </p>
	      </authorialNote>; and it contemplated calling the two bonds with a claim and counter claim then ensuing to establish final settlement.  On the same day Mr Al-Ohali directed SABIC UK that, because SCL was potentially “a losing horse”, it was necessary to put enough of SABIC’s people in charge of the key contracts with Shaw and others to be able to take charge should SCL “let go of the project”.  In the event, though SABIC personnel worked alongside SCL with a number of contractors, they did not take charge of key contracts in the manner apparently envisaged by Mr Al-Ohali. At the end of August 2008 Mr Heath prepared a draft termination letter and circulated a presentation in advance of a meeting with Mr Booth on 28 August 2008: the presentation recommended termination on the grounds that SCL was now six weeks behind the SSA2 Completion Plan, its deteriorating financial position was affecting performance, and termination would maximise value to SABIC.  On the same date, the presentation that had been prepared in April/May against the event of the possible insolvency of SCL was circulated more widely.  However, SABIC Europe was not persuaded and the second major payment under SSA2 was paid at the start of September. </p>

By now, SCL was well aware of slippage against the Completion Plan and it would at the end of the month estimate that EID would be in March 2009, subsequently revising that date to bring it forward to early February 2009.  However, SCL had not put in place anything in the nature of a recovery plan and did not do so at any stage before termination.  Although SCL’s Weekly Progress Reports included some charts (including for Passive Fire Protection and Insulation) which included a “Recovery Curve” and outline figures suggesting resourcing for recovery, Mr Martin’s evidence was that Mr Hall (who was SCL’s chief planner) was not capable of developing a recovery plan; and Mr Buckley confirmed that “Recovery Curves” were theoretical only and that there had been no planned recovery.  I accept their evidence on these points.  Neither PLL/SCL’s witnesses of fact nor Mr Laslett, the expert called by PLL/SCL to give evidence on Process Engineering, identified any coherent recovery plan or strategy or any activities that could be described as the implementation of a recovery plan, even on the most charitable of interpretations.  Specifically, although Mr Martin in his witness statement said that he told SABIC at a meeting on 30 September 2008 that an expediting programme was being developed, his oral evidence was that he did not see the need for a recovery plan “per se”: he merely saw a need “to make sure that [SCL was] hitting the metrics that assured us we were going to complete on time.”  This applied specifically to Insulation and Passive Fire Protection, the work content of the Cape Subcontract. </p>

Although it is probable that further steps would have been taken to investigate whether Hertel could help if SABIC had been more enthusiastic, the need to achieve satisfactory progress was part of SCL’s existing contractual obligation, which SCL is not entitled to avoid by attempting to pass responsibility to SABIC.  The discussions relating to insulation are to be contrasted with those relating to PFP (outlined below) where, when SCL formally asked SABIC permission to bring Hertel in, SABIC gave it promptly.

SABIC gave approval the same day, though with the slightly surprising proviso that SCL confirm in writing that Hertel possessed the appropriate certification and licenses to install the PFP materials that were to be used.  This was surprising because Hertel were already well known to SABIC, but no great significance can be attached to the proviso.  It did not materially hinder SCL from progressing matters with Hertel and, in the event, while Mr Martin reckoned he had a deal with them, SCL’s intention to bring in Hertel had not been converted into contractual reality by the time of termination.  The last relevant contact was on 3 November 2008 when Mr Martin met them again to discuss the scope of works and noted in his diary that Hertel would mobilise.  That same day, SCL’s contract was terminated.  In summary, although SCL had discussions with Hertel before the Warning Letter, and SCL’s intention to mobilise Hertel would probably have been converted into reality within about a week of the date of termination, progress towards bringing them on site was left by SCL until the end of October, and no additional resources from Hertel had been formally contracted for or deployed by the time of termination. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">Two incidents occurred during the Warning Period which illustrate the progressive deterioration of relations.  The first occurred on 10 October 2008.  For some time, Mr Malan and Mr Sanderson of SABIC had been involved with the cleaning and blowing works that were being carried out by Halliburton as subcontractor to SCL.  Their role was to be there in an advisory capacity, offering help and support; but it is clear that there were sensitivities about whether SABIC would overstep the mark and take on the role of management, to the detriment of SCL’s organisation of its subcontractor.  There had been an incident on 29 September 2008 when Mr Martin, who held typically forthright views on the matter, excluded Mr Sanderson from a meeting between SCL and Halliburton, though Mr Sanderson’s evidence was that he had not been giving instructions to Halliburton on that occasion.  On 10 October 2008, shortly after noon, Mr Cockerill sent an email to Halliburton in which he said that SABIC had concerns about the Halliburton calculations that were being used to calculate the necessary flow rate for nitrogen blowing.  Mr Cockerill wrote that SABIC “recommend that Halliburton aim for a flow rate of at least 3000 stft<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">3</span>/min for the remaining blows ...”.  This email was passed by Halliburton to Mr Martin with the comment that “communication paths are being bypassed again. …”  Later that afternoon Mr Malan was meeting Halliburton.  On his evidence, which I accept, he was simply enquiring whether there were blowing activities planned for that evening, which would be innocuous enough, when Mr Martin stormed in and, in front of Halliburton, made quite clear that he was not welcome.  So he left.  Mr Martin accepted that he was acting on the basis of the feedback he had received, and it does not appear that he took the trouble to enquire what Mr Malan was in fact doing.  After the incident Mr Martin sent an email to Mr Teague in which he said that “any further direct communication by SABIC with [SCL] subcontractors that intentionally bypasses [SCL] will be considered a wilful intent to subvert the work”; and in its closing submissions PLL/SCL relies upon this incident as an example of unacceptable interference by SABIC.  On the evidence that I have summarised above, I am not satisfied that Mr Malan was doing anything unacceptable when Mr Martin came in on 10 October 2008.  Mr Martin’s evidence was that he found Mr Sanderson argumentative; that may be so, though I think it likely that Mr Martin would have given as good as he got.  Although I accept that there may have been occasions when SABIC went close to or even marginally beyond the line, I find that there was no substantial hindrance or disruption.   Although Halliburton were SCL’s subcontractors, SCL and SABIC had agreed that SABIC should have some significant involvement, not least in liaising with Halliburton’s planner to optimise the Halliburton plan.  In my judgment, this episode is merely a regrettable illustration of parties to a major contract whose commercial relations were gradually unravelling under the pressures of a contract that was and continued to be in substantial delay. </p>

Shortly before that date, Mr Buckley and others at SCL became concerned because Shaw had unilaterally decided that it would not release QA documentation to SCL when it was complete and because the flow of such documentation from BK seemed to have slowed.  SABIC had not interfered with the flow of QA documentation at this stage.  At the same time Mr Buckley was concerned that SCL should have a complete set of records at its offsite base at Cheadle and wanted to ensure that records that had been checked didn’t get mixed up with those that had not been.  He therefore gave the instruction that any QA documentation that was completed should be taken offsite.  He apparently believed that the documentation was SCL’s property.  Had he consulted the contract he would have realised that this was wrong since Clause 21.2 of the EPC Contract vested property in all such documentation in SABIC.   What Mr Buckley correctly understood was that the QA documentation was extremely important on a site such as the LDPE plant, but he failed to realise at the time what was apparent to him with hindsight, namely that the removal of the documents might be sensitive (particularly in the strained atmosphere then prevailing).  Regrettably, he did not explain what he was doing to SABIC.  </p>

On the same day, SABIC also removed QA documentation held by Shaw. </p>

By the end of the evidence a reasonably clear picture had emerged.  Although some loop test packs had been left in SCL’s offices, the assumption that these would support SCL’s current loop testing was unwarranted.  Over the weekend of 25/26 October 2008 SCL did not have access to any additional loop test packs other than those few that may have been left on desks.  Over the following week, thanks to a residual spirit of cooperation between Mr Honeyman of SCL and Mr Burns of SABIC, the supply of loop test packs to SCL increased from an initially inadequate 20 packs per day to 100 packs a day.  This incremental process took about five or six days.  By now, however, the morale of those working for SCL was atrocious and productivity dropped.  I accept without any reservation Mr Honeyman’s evidence that he “could not get men to do barely anything” and that they would come to him each day asking him if he still had a job, to which his (accurate) response was that he had no idea. </p>

I disagree.  While Mr Buckley’s decision to remove the QA material offsite was misguided and insensitive, I have no doubt at all that, but for the poisonous lack of trust by then prevailing on site, SABIC must have sought an explanation first and, in all probability, a solution would have been achieved without the necessity for anything approaching the raid.  SABIC must have realised that removing the loop test packs was bound to hinder SCL’s progress and should have realised that an offer of 20 loop test packs per day was quite inadequate for SCL’s needs, particularly at a time when SABIC was applying constant pressure on SCL to increase the speed of its works.  The hindrance lasted for just over a week, but it occurred at a time when any disruption was liable to have knock on effects on SCL’s planning and the carrying out of its works.  Looking at things at a high level, the disruption was relatively minor in the overall scope of things, coming as it did only 10 days before termination; but to the extent that disruption followed, I accept SCL’s submission that SABIC hindered and prevented SCL from carrying out its work and did so without contractual justification. </p>

His view appears to have shifted after a further meeting on or shortly before 21 October 2008: Mr Teague reported that Mr Al-Ohali “was very positive about termination and has proposed a timetable that would end in termination next Wednesday unless [SCL] come back with a better option.”  A meeting was therefore set up for 28 October 2008.  SABIC told SCL that the purpose was to require SCL “to present their detailed programme to achieve delivery of an acceptable … EID … and confirmation that this EID can be delivered without further unjustified demands for additional monies”.  Internal SABIC correspondence generated suggestions for the demands that might be made of SCL, which led to the compilation of a list of requirements.  Commercial requirements included that all claims for delay since SSA2 should be withdrawn (including those relating to interference with subcontractors and the consequences of industrial relations problems), confirmation from all of SCL’s subcontractors that SCL was up to date with valuations and certification and a statement from the subcontractors that they believed SCL to be properly certifying, and proof from subcontractors that all claims were settled or had agreed to be deferred.  Scope of work requirements included that SCL should accept that the scope of work for cleaning and blowing identified in PI092 should be executed in full and that resource levels should be in accordance with the “requirements of earliest Ethylene-in”.  On any view, it was a daunting list given the current state of progress and relations. </p>

In reply, SCL stated that they were committed to bringing the project to completion as soon as possible.  Mr Martin took the view that SABIC had decided to terminate and that the meeting was merely a formality.  He did not hold back on his frustrations and blamed SABIC for most of the delays since he had come on board.  He said that he thought EID in January 2009 was possible but felt he was not being listened to.  Part of his frustration was because of his view that the state of the secondary hyper-compressor, which had been deconstructed by SABIC for cross-head alignment (of which more later) meant that there was no sign of that work being completed in the foreseeable future, while “SCL’s staff and I had been breaking our backs to deliver the project.”  After the meeting he recorded his view that further effort on the project was “futile” and recommended that SCL take legal steps to remedy the situation it was in immediately. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">For the reasons discussed earlier, SCL cannot blame its delays upon unwarranted or non-contractual hindrance or disruption by SABIC.  On the contrary, SCL failed across the board to procure the services of such key subcontractors as were necessary to ensure the EID of 5 December 2008.  When confronted by the fact of slippage, SCL failed to take any steps to try to retrieve the position by accelerative measures.  It seems simply to have accepted delays (particularly at the hands of Cape) as being an established fact about which it took no effective action.  PLL evidently recognised the need for heavyweight project management but, while the introduction of Mr Martin at the end of July 2008 introduced someone of high competence, his overriding concern was to retrieve SCL’s financial position rather than to take effective steps to improve its performance against the Completion Plan or generally.  Hence, at a time when SCL should have been increasing resources, it took the path of de-manning and reducing its costs which its board had sanctioned on 29 April 2008.  That course was not pursued </p>

Mr Martin’s contribution to this course was to suggest and then pursue the strategy from mid-August 2008 of generating unjustifiable claims against SABIC arising out of the tripartite negotiations with Cape.  Even when SCL’s problems with Cape had been resolved in August 2008, SCL took no effective steps to ensure adequate resourcing of PFP and Insulation, both of which were rightly regarded as critical. </p>

However, the failure was also contributed to by the absence of heavyweight project management at site until the arrival of Mr Martin and the strategies he adopted thereafter, at least when he was on site.  When he was absent, there was again a lack of sufficient site management.  These failures were compounded by the weaknesses in SCL’s planning capability, which Mr Martin recognised<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="32">

Apart from relying upon alleged interference and hindrance by SABIC, SCL has not argued that it was always impossible either for it or for a competent contractor to have ensured EID by 5 December 2008.  To have mounted such an argument would have required SCL to establish not merely that the Completion Plan as drawn was impossible to achieve but that EID on 5 December 2008 was impossible to achieve even with appropriate allocation of resources and any necessary adjustments of planning.  What the factual background summarised above establishes clearly is a persistent absence of assiduity or expedition when confronted by a contract that was known to be slipping seriously into delay.  In other words, in the period to 3 October 2008, SCL persistently and substantially failed to carry out the Engineering Works in accordance with the contract or to use due diligence to achieve that object. </p>

Under this clause, it would be commercially absurd for the draconian right of termination to arise if the Purchaser has not identified the material breach in question: it cannot be for the Contractor to work out what the material breach is alleged to be without it being identified by the Purchaser.  If, however, the Purchaser identifies the breach and the notice is clearly given under Clause 27.2.1, the onus shifts to the Contractor to take steps to rectify the breach which will reasonably satisfy the Project Director.  But the clause does not state that the Project Director must identify the steps that the Contractor must take.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">Under Clause 27.2.10 what is required to give rise to the right to terminate is that the Contractor is failing to proceed with the Engineering Works with due diligence or is otherwise persistently in material breach of its obligations under the contract “after warning by the Purchaser in writing”.  The context makes clear that the warning must be a warning that the Contractor is failing to proceed with due diligence or is otherwise persistently in material breach of its obligations under the contract.  As with Clause 27.2.1 the notice must make plain to the Contractor the breach that is alleged.  But it does not follow that, where the Purchaser gives warning of a failure to exercise due diligence, he must particularise the respects in which the contractor has failed.  The difference between a warning of failure to exercise due diligence and an allegation of another material breach is that, where material breach of another obligation is relied upon, the particular obligation requires it to be specified so that the Contractor may understand the allegation of breach; however, where failure to exercise due diligence is relied upon, the particular obligation (namely, to exercise due diligence) is fully identified and the nature of the breach is sufficiently clear.  Once again, the clause does not say that the Purchaser must prescribe the steps to be taken in order for the Contractor to avoid termination: there is no need to do so because, once the obligation (of due diligence or not otherwise to act in persistent breach) is clearly identified, it is for the Contractor to comply with its obligations as it sees fit. </p>

First and foremost, it identified that the obligation to use due diligence attached to securing the EID of 5 December 2008.  Next, it identified that its concerns related to delay in carrying out the works.  Then it gave specific (but not exhaustive) examples of the activities causing the delays, including Loop Testing, Insulation, Systems achieving MC1, and System Cleaning and Blowing.  It went on to identify bulk work in the reactor bay, the absence of QA documentation, and SCL’s ongoing inability to manage subcontractors as additional areas.  As will be seen when considering Issue 3, these formed much of the bedrock upon which SABIC’s case has been and continues to be founded.  Having identified them, it returned to its central concern, namely that EID was projected to be 12 weeks late on a programme (the Completion Programme) that was meant to last 23 weeks.   It then stipulated that its preference would be for SCL “to remedy its breaches by completing the engineering works with due diligence” before repeating that the delays it had identified (i.e. the delay of 12 weeks on a 23 week programme) “confirm that [SCL] are failing to proceed with the engineering works with due diligence.” </p>

Had the letter come out of the blue and if SABIC had in fact only allowed SCL seven days, SCL’s suggestion that seven days was an insufficient period might have held some attraction.  Even in that event, however, seven days would have been sufficient for SCL to demonstrate that it was taking steps to get a grip of the contract, although it would obviously have been unrealistic to expect all problems to have been resolved within that time.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.00in">The first has been, what progress (typically against plan) did SCL achieve during the Warning Period?   The second has been, was the work on the particular element critical?  PLL/SCL has advanced arguments on criticality that have been both general and specific.  Generally, it is PLL/SCL’s case that at all material times the Secondary Compressor was on the critical path because of extensive delays to the cross-head alignment works and therefore other work elements were not.  It has pursued this argument to suggest that a failure to comply with the Completion Plan in relation to elements other than the Secondary Compressor is unimportant and should not be taken as evidence of a failure to comply with SCL’s obligations under the EPC Contract and SSA2, including the obligation to act with due diligence.   More specifically, in relation to particular elements, it has addressed arguments about whether those elements were or were not on the critical path on any view. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">I will address the significance of the Secondary Compressor later.  However, when looking at the other individual elements, two points should be made.  First, it is in my judgment most important to look at how SCL reacted to those elements that were thought to be critical during the Warning Period since those were, or should have been, the ones to which SCL should have been giving primacy at the time.   A failure to exercise due diligence in relation to the works that were perceived to be critical would tend to support a conclusion that SCL was not exercising due diligence overall.  Second, the mere fact that an element was not critical (or not thought to be critical) at a particular moment does not render SCL’s performance on that element uninformative when assessing its attempts to comply with its contractual obligation of due diligence.  This is because there were a number of elements at any given time which could have become critical if they had slipped into delay.  It is to be remembered that SCL’s obligation to secure EID covered the whole of the works (apart, of course, from category 3 defects, which were those that could be left until after EID). </p>

This included evidence on what was or was not on the critical path from time to time and on whether SCL’s performance matched the requirements of the completion plan or was otherwise to be regarded as satisfactory.  For SABIC, Mr Crane analysed the work scope and progress on systems as at 3 October and 3 November 2008 and, typically, extrapolated forwards the progress that was made during the Warning Period as a straight line to arrive at a date when that speed of progress would have led to completion of the required work content.  At the same time, he plotted actual progress against S-curves that showed his opinion of what progress was required in order to complete the works on time.  On the basis of the assumptions that he made, he gave opinion evidence about what would or would not have been on the critical path from time to time.  As was common ground, these exercises do not show with absolute precision either what had happened to the relevant dates or what would happen in the future.  As with any form of modelling and extrapolation from past performance, they are dependent upon the validity of the underlying assumptions and adjustments may need to be made.  Thus for example, an assumption that progress on PFP would have been at the same rate after termination as in the month before needs to be seen in the light of the evidence that SCL was making the arrangements with Hertel which, it was hoped, would lead to an increase in the resources applied to PFP, with a consequent upturn in progress.  However, Mr Crane’s projections provide useful indicative evidence on the basis of the assumptions that he set out in his reports.   </p>

He did not update that programme to 3 October 2008; nor did he create or adopt any other programme to show progress as at 3 October 2008.  Thereafter, he did not do a further updating (either in relation to 31JL or otherwise) to show the position as at 3 November 2008, although he accepted that it would have been a relatively straightforward task for him to do so.

His analysis led him to conclude that insulation was not on the critical path, contrary to the working assumption of the parties at the time of the Warning Letter.  Detailed cross-examination revealed the reasons why this and other surprising conclusions flowed from Mr Crossley’s critical path analysis.  First, Mr Crossley considered that it was realistic to ignore actual progress before the data date.  In other words, however poor progress had been to date, his </p>

To give a concrete example, where an item of insulation that had originally been planned to take 10 days had in fact taken 50 days to reach 46% completion, the analysis assumed that it would be complete in 6 more days. Second, a consequence of the historic delays was that very large numbers of activities now required to be carried out simultaneously, all of which were attributed their original planned durations.  In compiling his analysis, Mr Crossley did not consider whether it was feasible to resource such numbers of activities simultaneously.  In evidence he accepted that his analysis bore no relation to the resources that were available on the data date; and he conceded that it was not realistic for so many activities to be carried out as shown on the programme<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="33">

The artificiality of this approach was shown by the fact that, according to his 3 October projected analysis in relation to insulation, there would, by reference to their early finish dates, only be five insulating activities outstanding on 3 November, which bore no relation to reality;</p>

SABIC held the same view, which continued through the month.

Mr Crane’s retrospective analysis supports the view that PFP was critical.  Mr Crossley disagreed but, for reasons given above, I do not find his evidence on this point persuasive.  On this evidence, I find that the parties believed PFP to be critical and also that, subject only to the question of the Secondary Compressor (to which I return later) it was critical. </p>

Separately, the negotiations with Hertel at the end of the month about bringing on additional PFP resources came about because Mr Martin was concerned that progress was “falling off the curve”.

It is common ground that the perceived scope of the insulation works increased with time.  This was at least in part because, as was also common ground, SCL did not have in place comprehensive or robust systems for recording or reporting either scope or progress by the time of termination.  Although Mr Tottey, who was the lead witness for PLL/SCL on this topic, said that SCL had provided a full set of isometric drawings to Cape before termination, he was not involved in their issue and was not copied in when they were sent; so he had no direct knowledge of what had been issued.  On the evidence as a whole, it appears that further drawings were issued after termination, which increased the scope (though to an extent which the Court is not able to identify).  Mr Tottey accepted that the systems in place for recording were not complete and that he could not identify with precision the state of progress in a number of important areas.  For example, his pretermination tracker omitted any allowance for the reactor bay because he had not completed an assessment of the progress in that area when the contract was terminated.   </p>

It was out of bounds for safety reasons when in operation and therefore all insulation needed to be in place by EID, since additional works would require an outage.  The final Cape assessment of insulation work in the reactor bay was 9,108 metres (which contributes to SABIC’s overall figure of 47,421 metres).  Although Mr Tottey had not completed the necessary work to assess scope in the reactor bay by the time of termination, PLL/SCL rely upon an estimate (produced by Mr Tottey) of 5,041 metres supported by a detailed buildup in spreadsheet {H.4/2}.  The difference is therefore 4,067 linear metres.  To give some idea of what this might entail, at the beginning of October 2008 SCL was trying to achieve 400 linear metres per day and generally achieving considerably less. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">The competing submissions may be shortly summarised.  SABIC submits that the Cape assessment reflects what was done and therefore what needed to be done; and the figure produced by Cape is submitted to be consistent with Cape’s pre-termination estimate of 12,572 metres and an assessment by a Mr Toth, who carried out another assessment on 2 October 2008.  PLL/SCL points to the lack of detail in the Cape estimate and the fact that the early October assessment includes items which did not require insulation, namely bolts, brackets and lens ring flanges.  I consider it is necessary to make some allowance for the likelihood that Cape’s pre-determination estimate may have been inflated for its own financial motives and that it would have been in Cape’s interests after termination to carry out as much insulation as possible (whether strictly necessary or not) because it was now being paid on day rates.  In addition, the complete lack of detail supporting the Cape final assessment does not inspire confidence or enable the Court to engage closely with it.  For these reasons, and subject to the inclusion of the bolts, brackets and lens ring flanges, I find that SABIC’s figure needs to be discounted to a limited extent. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">The evidence in relation to this dispute is diffuse and inconclusive.  It is common ground that, before termination, Cape fabricated and installed some boxes to insulate bolts attached to the pipework.  On 14 October 2008, when some of these had been damaged, SCL’s view was that they should be replaced.  In his witness statement, Mr Tottey said that such boxes were unnecessary but not that they had been done by Cape without authorisation.  However, in his oral evidence he said that Cape had not been instructed to do the work and that it had merely been trying to increase its scope of works (for its own financial advantage).  Mr Buckley’s witness statement went further, asserting that the boxes were not merely unnecessary but detrimental to safe operation.   For SABIC, Mr Lumley gave expert evidence that the bolts needed to be boxed in, but Mr Payne for PLL/SCL disagreed, provided that the edges of the insulation were sealed against water ingress.  Mr Toth (who was not called as an expert but was an insulation inspector) expressed the view that a failure to box in the bolts would be “very poor and would not achieve correct insulation levels.”  No drawing, specification or instruction was identified that required the provision of the boxes.  There is no contemporaneous correspondence that unequivocally states either that the boxes are required or that they are not. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">On balance I prefer the submissions of PLL/SCL on the boxing in of bolts for four main reasons.  First, there is an absence of any unequivocal evidence that they were in fact required.  Second, though no quantitative evidence has been provided, it seems unlikely that the boxes would have made a substantial or significant difference to the thermal qualities of the insulation as a whole, since they affected short (though numerous) stretches of pipework.  Third, insulating the bolts and brackets would hinder subsequent access for no appreciable operational advantage. Fourth, as already stated, inclusion of the work by Cape is equally likely to be attributable to Cape’s perception of its own financial interests as it is to be to actual need.  However, if the boxes were to be omitted, the edges of the insulation adjacent to the bolts and brackets required to be sealed. </p>

Illustrative photographic evidence of defects in August and October 2008 is of limited assistance since there is no evidence to establish when such defects were remedied, although Mr Reynolds for SABIC gave evidence that SCL did little to remedy defects before termination, which I consider likely to be true in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, because of SCL’s known financial consraints and Cape’s general levels of performance.  I would therefore accept that SABIC is entitled to bring in an element, which is not capable of precise quantification, for the remedying of SCL’s defective insulation work.  I would also accept that some if not all of the defects would have been defects that had to be remedied before EID, not least because some would have been within the reactor bay.</p>

For the reasons set out in the preceding paragraphs, SABIC’s figure requires downward adjustment; but SCL’s figure is too low.  The omission of the insulation boxes is a reasonably significant item but is mitigated to some extent by the need to seal edges.  The lens ring joints are a relatively minor item.  Otherwise, SABIC’s case has held up reasonably well.  I therefore adopt a fairly high level approach and assess the overall scope of SCL’s insulating work to be approximately 45,000 metres.</p>

PLL/SCL pleaded that temporary rockwool insulation could have been used on areas that required to be insulated before EID.  Although Mr Tottey described applying temporary insulation as being like putting on a duffle coat, I reject the suggestion that widespread use was contemplated or would have been acceptable if it had been contemplated.  First, there was no evidence of any plan for any significant use of temporary insulation at the time of termination, and Mr Buckley rejected the suggestion that the use of temporary insulation could cover anything approaching the whole of the outstanding 50% of the perceived work scope.  Second, I accept the evidence of Mr Teague that widespread use of temporary insulation would be unsatisfactory because it tends to fall off, and the evidence of Mr Lumley that only limited use would be acceptable.  Third, Mr Lumley’s view (which I accept) was that he would expect discussion between the parties before the expedient was adopted; and Mr Buckley agreed that SABIC would have to agree.  There was no such discussion and no reason to suppose that SABIC would have agreed.  Fourth, SCL had placed no orders for temporary insulation before termination.  Furthermore, if the suggestion be made, I reject the suggestion that the use of temporary insulation formed any coherent part of SCL’s thinking during the Warning Period such that it could be brought into the scales when weighing the issue of due diligence during the period.</p>

Other evidence shows that SABIC continued to look at whether insulation could be omitted.  This is not surprising given the delays that had occurred and were occurring on the contract; and it does not demonstrate that any particular level of omissions overall would have been acceptable if a coherent plan had been formulated.  </p>

It was SCL which determined to insulate straight runs first, leaving bends and more complicated areas until later (of which more anon) and it was SCL’s design office that produced the insulation specification and the isometric drawings for Cape.  SCL did not at any stage prepare a plan or approach SABIC with a plan for what might be omitted; nor did SCL at any stage ask its design office to identify what insulation could be omitted for the purposes of achieving EID.  Had the design office been asked to do so, it would have had to consider (at least) issues of personnel protection and thermal insulation.  It did neither.  Mr Payne for PLL/SCL considered that the amount of insulation required for personnel protection was “fairly minimal” but he did not quantify it.  Similarly, Mr Payne did not carry out any quantitative analysis of what the thermal effects of omitting insulation would be, no doubt in part because of the absence of any coherent plan about what might be omitted.</p>

PLL/SCL says that this would have been within the times that were by then being contemplated for EID; it can equally be said that it is well after the agreed contractual date.  However, since I do not accept that Mr Bence’s figures are to be relied upon as showing what could or would have been delayed until after EID, I do not accept the end point of Mr Buckley’s calculation. </p>

Mr Payne’s evidence fell well short of the mark; and it was countered by Mr Lumley for SABIC, whose view was that any material absence of insulation is a category 1 defect (which precludes handover, let alone EID) because of the disruption to thermal values on which the LDPE processes are dependent.   There is substance in this view though it can be overstated and Mr Lumley, like Mr Payne, had not conducted a full or detailed quantitative analysis.  That said, his view (which was rationally based) was that only 1,714 metres of insulation (about 6% of the total) could reasonably be omitted.  I suspect that this is an underestimate, but PLL/SCL has not provided satisfactory evidence to support any larger figure.</p>

Since the intention was relatively unformed and the proportion that could have been omitted cannot be decided with precision, the consequence of SCL’s intention is that, although some advancement of EID might have been achieved by delaying insulation, it was not substantial.</p>

Mr Martin’s evidence was that he regarded insulation as a critical area up to the time of termination.  Therefore, throughout the Warning Period, the parties considered insulation to be critical or potentially critical.

I have held that the total scope was 45,000 metres, which (adopting the same rate of 264 metres per day) would result in a reduction from 99 days outstanding work to 83 days: a reduction of 16 days.  Adopting SCL’s figures and making allowance for either increased time to complete bends and more difficult areas or the resources actually applied by SCL, the extrapolation led to a date towards the end of April 2009.   Treating these analyses as indicative rather than as being absolutely precise, and subject to the Secondary Compressor issue, they support the conclusion that insulation was seriously in delay and was critical, as the parties believed at the time.</p>

During the Warning Period SCL carried out negotiations with Cape, including agreeing to pay part of Cape’s outstanding claims.  In return, by 17 October 2008 Cape had agreed to increase resources on site, and to carry out work on straight runs of pipework only.  Two points need to be made about this agreement.  First, PLL/SCL submit that this was an accelerative measure.  It was not.  What it meant was that the achieved daily meterage would increase as Cape would be doing straightforward work – the best assessment in evidence being that bends would take about 1.5 times as long as straight pipework.  The bends had to be done, so the carrying out of straight lines first would not advance the date of completion.  If anything, it was likely to delay it since the contractors </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">SCL’s contractual scope of cleaning and blowing was as specified by PI 092.  Any derogation from that scope therefore required SABIC’s agreement.  SABIC’s case is that SCL attempted to derogate from its proper scope of cleaning and blowing works consistently in the period to termination.  The Completion Plan provided for equipment to be mobilised at site at the beginning of July 2008, with cleaning and blowing to commence on 27 July 2008.  In fact, SCL did not enter into a subcontract with Halliburton until 31 July 2008.  The subcontract covered the whole scope of the PI 092 works and was priced on a daily rates basis.  The risk of cost increases therefore fell on SCL, as would the benefit of cost savings.  It is clear that SCL saw the cleaning and blowing subcontract as a potential area for saving expense, since this was recorded in a strategy document on 30 June 2008; and on 14 August 2008 Mr Martin identified potential savings of £3.5 million.  There is no evidence to suggest that SCL ceased to be motivated by the imperative desire to make savings on the cleaning and blowing contract; but it is not clear that the desire to make savings was a reason for the delay in entering into the subcontract with Halliburton.  </p>

At the weekly meeting on 18 September 2008, on which date SCL provided a further cleaning and blowing plan, Mr Teague told SCL that the proposed reductions were not acceptable to SABIC and Mr Buckley agreed to provide a separate plan for the whole scope of PI 092 works.

Mr Hall informed Mr Buckley that the full scope of work would lead to an EID of 24 January.  These plans were not issued to SABIC.   Instead, on 23 September 2008 SCL wrote to SABIC asserting that “we do not accept that amendments to method or quantity require to be formally submitted through the existing concessions process prior to changes being undertaken in the field.”  In other words, SCL was entitled to amend the method <span style="font-style:italic">and quantity </span>of the cleaning and blowing without submitting the changes to SABIC for approval.  Mr Buckley’s evidence was that this letter only went to the question of priorities, but that is not what the letter said or meant.

Mr Hall was projecting EID on 8 February 2009 on the assumption that outstanding PFP and Insulation issues would be resolved.

With limited exceptions, the reduced scope shown on the schedule omitted the works that Mr Hall had omitted on 1 October.  The following day, Mr Hall sent an email to Mr Buckley attaching a programme issued by SABIC which incorporated the full scope of cleaning and blowing works.  He pointed out that it would be “very misleading” for anyone getting the SCL version of the scope or the SABIC version of scope, explaining that he had followed Mr Buckley’s instruction from two weeks before to produce a reduced scope plan.  He asked “Can you PLEASE clarify [SCL] project strategy with respect to Halliburton? (Full scope/reduced scope?  What should Halliburton be working to?  What should SCL be engineering?).  Is there anything further you require with respect to SABIC plan? Obviously, with work within their plan, which will not be carried out, this impacts on float and criticality.”  In evidence Mr Buckley was unable to explain why it was that Mr Hall was issuing plans on his instructions showing reduced scope at a time when SABIC was proceeding (and SCL should have been proceeding) on the basis of full scope.</p>

It is apparent from the email that SABIC and SCL had agreed to some adjustments with further reviews to be carried out by Mr Buckley and Mr Malan.  SCL had expressed a concern about the amount of work involved in blowing the reactor system.  Mr Buckley had queried why it was necessary; a representative of EM had explained that he was concerned about damage to thermocouples and that the blowing was an EM requirement; and the parties had agreed to consider a simplified proposal for reactor blowing so that it could be progressed.  In evidence, Mr Buckley said that SCL was not refusing to carry out its full scope of work but that it was looking at alternative ways to carry it out.  That is an accurate reflection of the discussion recorded in the email of 18 October 2008, and there were discussions before then which led to changes and clarifications in the contract scope<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="36">

Mr Buckley’s evidence was that this was the programme from which he was working on a day to day basis and that it showed the position as agreed between SABIC and SCL just before termination with the exception of the reactor systems which were not included as the parties were discussing how to blow them.  His explanation for the omission of the reactor bay work was that SCL would have blown them just before EID with installed equipment as part of the nitrogen run of the compressors, without the need for any additional engineering; and he said that Halliburton had prepared work packs showing how they intended to do the works.  This would be an approach endorsed by EM in its precommissioning guidelines.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">I make the following findings of fact on the basis of what I have summarised above.  First, SCL’s subcontract with Halliburton was for the full scope of the PI 092 works.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.00in">Second, SCL was constantly alert to the possibility of making savings on the Halliburton contract and looked to do so by varying the methods of work or reducing the scope of works if it could do so.  Third, SCL’s current intention on 1 October 2008, which was made explicit in Mr Myers’ email to Halliburton on 7 October 2008, was that the scope of work to be carried out by Halliburton would be reduced from that required by PI 092.  However, I accept Mr Buckley’s evidence that SCL did not expect or intend to omit the reactor bay altogether, though it wanted to reduce the amount of work involved, as discussed on 17 October 2008.  Fourth, SCL negotiated with SABIC to reduce the scope of work or the amount of work involved in various areas and reached agreement on a number of points.  Fifth, although SCL would have liked to reduce the scope of works beyond those adjustments negotiated with SABIC it did not actually refuse to carry out works, although it is possible that it might have done so after 3 November 2008 if termination had not occurred.  Sixth, it was not satisfactory that SCL should be asking Halliburton to carry out and programme for a reduced scope of works without the knowledge of SABIC, but no analysis has been done to show whether (and if so to what extent) that caused any actual delay during the Warning Period.  Seventh, there is no programme from Halliburton or SCL for the full scope of works.  All that is known, from the observations of Mr Hall, is that the full scope of works would have pushed back the end date for the cleaning and blowing works, with consequential effects for EID.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">On the evidence that I have summarised above, I make the following findings of fact.  First, at the beginning of the Warning Period, cleaning and blowing was significantly in delay against the Completion Plan.  Second, the rate of progress during the Warning Period did not match the rate that would have been required to meet the targets in the Completion Plan if Halliburton had started on time in accordance with that plan.  Third, the rate of progress improved to some extent during the Warning Period, at least in part because Halliburton increased resources in the second half of the month.  Fourth, the increase in resources started in the second half of the Warning Period and, by the end of October, progress was still being constrained by the need for further rig mobilisation.  Fifth, even the improved rate of progress fell short of what was required to achieve a target EID of 7/9 February 2009.  Sixth, the failure by SCL to produce a plan for SABIC showing the full scope of works will have affected SABIC’s ability to plan its commissioning works, but the extent of that effect has not been quantified and cannot be measured. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">There are two criticisms that can validly be made of SCL’s performance in relation to cleaning and blowing during the Warning Period.  The first is the rate of progress.  This was recognised to be unsatisfactory in the period to 9 October 2008, with Mr Martin’s assessment being that Halliburton was not diligently pursuing the work.  By 16 October 2008, half-way through the Warning Period, resources had increased but more were still required.  Three cleaning rigs were identified as necessary, but by 24 October 2008 only one further rig had been mobilised and rig mobilisation was a continuing constraint on progress.  By the end of the Warning Period, though progress had improved, SCL was still falling off the curve required even for EID in February.  Had this level of response by SCL been forthcoming earlier, it might have been regarded as a sufficient start; but in the particular context of the Warning Period and the intense need to make maximum progress, SCL’s response lacked urgency and effectiveness.  In part, at least, this was because of SCL’s alertness to the need to make savings in this area; in part it may have been because of a lack of direct and effective leadership, with Mr Martin away for much of the period and Mr Buckley feeling sidelined and not in full control, as indicated by his email on 1 October 2008.  In the result, no effective steps were taken to increase resources until the second half of the Warning Period and, even then, urgency was lacking.  The second criticism is of SCL’s failure to plan or provide plans for the full scope of the works.  While I would accept Mr Buckley’s evidence that he did not anticipate that the reactor bay would be omitted altogether, the lack of any plans showing the full scope of the works is symptomatic of SCL’s hand-to-mouth approach, which involved attempting to agree reductions in the amount of work to be carried out (not unreasonable in itself) and a failure to plan the works coherently with a view to full and proper coordination of its works. </p>

First, it alleges that SCL’s procedures were inadequately robust to provide assurance of quality.  Second, it alleges that SCL misreported the true state of its loop checking, representing that many loops had been completely checked when in fact they had not been.  Third, it alleges that SCL made many errors in its loop checking.   It is SABIC’s case that, as a result of these three broad criticisms, it was justified in taking the decision after termination to retest all (or nearly all) control loops again.  More generally, although it is common ground that loop checking was not on the critical path (because there were other areas of delay that were greater than the delays on loop testing), SABIC raises two issues for determination, namely: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">SABIC criticises SCL’s procedures on three grounds.  First, it criticises the fact that the paperwork for each loop check (known as the loop check pack) comprised 13 sheets of paper and was split into separate procedures.  Mr Lumley’s evidence was that this approach ran the risk that the procedures would not be read as a whole, with the consequential risk that some procedures might be omitted.  While I accept that it might have been possible to develop loop check packs that were more compact, the evidence does not show that the form of the loop check packs led to actual errors.  I regard this criticism as being academic only.  The second criticism is that the quality plan developed by SCL in 2006 was not updated to reflect the revised programme or other requirements of the first Supplemental Agreement or SSA2.  That is true as a matter of fact but, once again, the evidence does not show that any actual errors occurred as a result.  Third, SABIC criticises the lack of audits.  This criticism is more substantial.  Mr Summersgill did not know of any procedure for checking that the loop checking procedures were being carried out correctly; and he did not himself check or institute checks on the quality of the work his team was carrying out.  In the event, when SABIC carried out checks on SCL’s work, it identified what it considered to be defects, of which more later.  Apart from that, the only form of audit established by the evidence was that, apparently, a quality assurance team at SCL’s Cheadle design office had some QA involvement with the Wilton project.  Whether that team did anything to audit the loop checking work does not appear from the evidence: if it did, reports were not passed to site and Mr Summersgill did not see them.  It therefore appears that there was no effective audit or oversight of the loop checking operation. </p>

SABIC naturally took these figures to mean that the stated number of loops had been fully and completely tested and had passed their tests.  That was also Mr Summersgill’s understanding; but it was incorrect.  Mr Honeyman was entering loops into Column K where some work had been carried out but further work was still required.  Detailed interrogation of the electronic version of the loop tracker would have disclosed information that showed this to be the case; but full information was only contained in the individual loop test packs.  Mr Honeyman did not see any problem with this state of affairs, since (as he said) he was in charge of loop checking and he understood the true position.  But it was, as SCL conceded in closing submissions, unsatisfactory because it meant that SCL was representing in its weekly handover statistics that more control loops had been fully tested than was in fact the case.

The reason for this failure is obscure and does not matter: it rested either on a misunderstanding of SCL’s own procedures or a misinterpretation of SCL’s Instrument Installation and Test Sequence ({O/8254}).

First, it was misleading for SCL to provide information to SABIC that the loops in question had been fully tested when they had not.  Second, it is quite unrealistic to suggest that SABIC should have discovered the true position by examining loop test packs: SABIC was entitled to take the information it received at face value.  Third, SCL did not tell SABIC that it intended to get the Vendor to return before its letter of 16 October 2008.  Fourth, I accept the evidence of Mr Burns (who I found to be a good and thoughtful witness) that he looked at the loop test packs and found no reference to the vendor returning.   Even if Mr Honeyman had the intention to get the Vendor to return to site, that intention was not documented; nor had the intention progressed far enough for SCL to have made arrangements for the Vendor to return or to decide when the Vendor would be asked to return.  In other words, though there may have been an intention in Mr Honeyman’s mind, it had not progressed further.  Fifth, in the absence of such documentation there can be no assurance that final certification would have identified the problem. </p>

In September 2008 SCL’s testing revealed a disparity in the temperature readings that it was obtaining on inputting an artificial signal at the field junction box.  The SCL technicians involved SABIC and Mr Clarke became involved in the investigation.  The first significant finding was that there was a design error: SCL had put crimp pins on the cable ends of the cables.  There were about 1800 crimp pins and they had to be removed since they may have been interfering with the readings from the thermocouples.  Subsequently, SABIC removed one of the thermocouples.  On examination it was discovered that the polarity of the thermocouples had been reversed because SCL’s drawings were incorrect.  This had the effect that the reading from the thermocouples would show the temperature as increasing when it was in fact decreasing, and vice versa.  SCL accepted the finding and changed the polarity of the thermocouple wiring.  There was then a dispute between SABIC, who wanted every thermocouple tested to ensure that it now functioned properly, and SCL, who considered that since the problem was a common one it would be sufficient to test one only as representative of them all.  In its letter dated 16 October 2008, SCL stated that this issue had  been “reviewed and </p>

However, although it is right that the existence of a problem first came to light as a result of SCL’s testing, it was SABIC’s intervention that led to the discovery of the reversed polarity, which was itself the consequence of a SCL design defect.  It is not possible to conclude on the balance of probabilities that SCL would not have discovered the reverse polarity without the assistance of SABIC: all that can be said is that it did not in fact do so as things happened and there remains the possibility that it would not have done so.  This is relied upon by SABIC as supporting its general case that SCL’s workmanship and testing did not inspire confidence.  That is reasonable, but the point can readily be overstated. </p>

Despite this, in and from May 2008 SCL reported 115 out of a possible 124 loops on the chillers as testing complete and logged them as such on the loop tracker, although the testing could not have been complete because of the absence of the comms link.  The loops were retested after the comms link had been established, but no change was made to the loop tracker when the link went down again as a result of the sub-contractor’s actions.

Inspection showed that part of the equipment (described as a radar horn) was missing.  When SABIC tackled SCL with these findings, it emerged that the missing piece of equipment was sitting in SCL’s office.

In evidence, the thrust of which I accept, he said “the Endress + Hauser engineer would possibly find … a detector not working or something externally.  He’s not expecting to have to get a crane and lift it out and then find the horn is missing and things.

I also reject PLL/SCL’s submission that SCL realised that the horn was missing, preferring the evidence of Mr Clarke that the horn was in SCL’s office and that he was told that SCL did not know what to do with it.  In these circumstances, the loop tracker was misleading in failing to identify the need for further work.  That does not mean that SCL may not have identified the problem and involved Endress + Hauser at some stage; but as things turned out, SCL had installed the radar alarm incorrectly, had not identified the problem, and had wrongly recorded the loop as completely tested on the loop tracker. </p>

On the front sheet of these certificates, SCL recorded under the heading “Exceptions/Comments” that the loop testing was 79% (System 9.02) and 40% (System 15) complete.  However, close inspection of one of the supporting documents in each case shows that included in the 79% and 40% are some loop tests where there were outstanding faults.  SABIC submits that this shows the assertion that the loop testing was 79% (or 40%) complete was inaccurate and misleading; and that this shows that SCL did not have a rigorous system for resolving defects before handover. </p>

In each case, the certificates were signed off by SABIC in the knowledge that the loop testing was incomplete (because of the reference to 79% or 40% completion).   While I accept that the Comments/Exceptions box could have been more amply filled out, this acceptance of systems with only partially completed loop testing indicates that SABIC was prepared to allow some leeway in the interests of progressing the contract works.  SABIC has not tried to prove that it would have acted differently had the correct position been shown on the front sheet of the certificate; nor has SABIC tried to prove that the discrepancy between the front sheet and the supporting sheet caused material difficulties in practice.  I therefore attach little weight to the point beyond noting that it is an example of a lack of precision on SCL’s part, which SABIC not unreasonably did not notice at the time. </p>

In the absence of any other documented explanation for the reasons for retesting, PLL/SCL submit that the dominant purpose underlying the decision to retest was that SABIC wanted as-built documents.  In evidence Mr De Main did not accept this to be true.  One of the other considerations he had outlined in the email of 20 November 2008 was that SABIC’s retesting before termination (of 239 loops) had been spread across many systems and had not involved comprehensive testing of full systems.  The email had not mentioned any fundamental deficiency in SCL’s loop testing; on the contrary, Mr De Main accepted that he would expect <span style="font-style:italic">most</span> of SCL’s tests to pass on retest.  But he identified SABIC’s difficulty as being that, having retested a small sample (239), they had come up with some errors and they did not know at that point how large the population of errors would be.

The evidence justifies the inference that at least a substantial proportion of the faults identified by Mr De Main would have been present when SCL tested the loops in question.  This inference leads to the conclusion that SABIC’s concerns about the quality of SCL’s loop testing and the accuracy of its reporting were largely justified. </p>

The first is the confiscation of its loop pack tests on 24 October 2008, which I have already held to have been an unwarranted interference and hindrance by SABIC: see [134137] above.  This interference does not affect the finding that SCL was falling off the curve before 24 October 2008, and the impact is relatively limited thereafter since (a) there was then only a short time to termination, (b) the period involved two weekends, and SCL had historically achieved few loop test completions at weekends, and (c) a suitable flow of loop test packs was restored to SCL by about the end of the month (although by then SCL’s loop testers were thoroughly demotivated).  However, it needs to be taken into account in forming an overall view of SCL’s progress. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">The second matter raised by PLL/SCL is that SCL was not given access to the Control Room until 24 October 2008.  On 21 October 2008 SCL requested that it should be allowed to move into the Control Room from the RIB where it was working saying “we are now at the time where we should be in.”  PLL/SCL submit that SCL wanted to work there because it would stop Honeywell’s personnel (who were working in the Control Room and were meant to be assisting with SCL’s scope of work) from being distracted by SABIC and because it would give SCL access to more screens.  In response, SABIC submits that the Control Room had not been handed over by SCL to SABIC and that it was therefore a matter for SCL to decide where its men worked.  SABIC also points to the fact that, when SCL asked SABIC to provide an additional screen in the RIB room, SABIC did so.  However, what is clear from SCL’s letter of 14 October 2008 and the oral evidence of Mr Honeyman is that SCL was pushing SABIC to get the Control Room manned, powered up and fully functional. </p>

Mr Honeyman’s evidence was that SCL’s engineers were diverted from assisting SCL to carry out work that was not within SCL’s scope of work.  However, Mr Summersgill accepted that Honeywell was there to work both on mod packs and on loop testing work, both of which fell within SCL’s scope of work; and he was  not able to identify precisely what Honeywell’s engineers were doing at the times that SCL thought they may have been diverted.   </p>

In reaching this conclusion I take into account that, at the field level, there was still a significant degree of cooperation between SABIC and SCL and that there is a marked absence of reference to specific examples of the alleged diversion in PLL/SCL’s evidence or contemporaneous documentation.  Second, while I accept that SCL wanted to work in the Control Room earlier than it did, I am not satisfied that this slowed the process of loop testing to any material extent.  There is, so far as I am aware, no specific contemporaneous complaint of work being delayed or prevented because SCL was working from the RIB and not from the control room.  Had it been a major problem, I am confident that specifics would have been raised during the Warning Period even if not before.  The overwhelming impression that I have is that, at their highest, these were niggles that would have been quickly forgotten on a contract that was running smoothly and that they have been given disproportionate retrospective prominence because of the demands of this dispute and litigation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">Drawing these strands together, I conclude that SABIC was correct not to put numerical progress at the forefront of its submissions on loop testing.  While SCL’s rate of progress was less than required by the Completion Plan, and the evidence shows that there was no material increase in resourcing by SCL during the Warning Period, loop testing was not regarded as being on the critical path and SABIC is not able to identify clear evidence of a failure to resource the activity adequately (in the sense of showing that there was a significant amount of loop testing available to be done and no personnel available or allocated to do it).  Viewed overall, SABIC has not established that SCL’s progress on loop testing during the Warning Period is of itself additional evidence of a failure to exercise due diligence in carrying out the Works (as opposed to being a reflection of the failure to progress the works overall with due expedition and assiduity).  However, for the reasons set out above, I conclude that the difficulties experienced with the carrying out, recording and reporting of loop testing results justified SABIC’s concerns about the quality of SCL’s loop testing and its decision to carry out a thorough programme of retesting after termination. </p>

The certificate indicates that the system is deemed to be mechanically complete in accordance with the “issued for construction” design.”  Put more shortly, Mr Buckley said “Mechanical Completion is a generic industry term to describe the state at which construction and installation activities are complete.”   That said, as SCL’s description makes clear, the provision of an MC certificate entails review and acceptance of system-specific sub-contractor documentation and the provision of such documentation is integral to the concept of Mechanical Completion.

This issue is concerned with the achievement of MC1 milestones.  Where a milestone has not been achieved, the evidence does not enable the percentage progress that has been made towards achieving the milestone to be estimated.  However, the justification for adopting and reviewing a milestone approach is that, as Mr Teague said, “it is not possible to commission a 90% complete system.”  Therefore, although it is probable that systems that were recorded from time to time as not having achieved MC1 would have shown some progress towards the milestone, it remains relevant to consider the achievement of MC1s as a benchmark of progress, as the parties recognised and adopted at the time. </p>

By the date of the Warning Letter, SCL was not going to achieve EID by 5 December 2008, and some progress may have been made in relation to systems where MC1 should have been achieved (whether following the Completion Plan or subsequent SCL planning iterations); and SABIC does not rely upon achievement of MC1s as of itself being on the critical path.  However, the failure to achieve MC1 in accordance with plan provides further evidence of SCL’s failure to plan or progress the works in accordance with the Completion Plan or to achieve acceptable progress during the Warning Period.

The potential consequence was to impart additional stress to the pipework that was wrongly restrained.  The problem was exacerbated by the fact that only 87 QA forms (out of a theoretical 2500) evidencing correct installation could be identified<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="48">

SCL’s Mr Wray was the High Pressure Equipment Engineer responsible for technical vendor liaison and was the appropriate SCL person to deal with the problem, but it was not brought to his attention until about August 2008.  He was initially concerned that, as there were about 200 of the anchor supports in the reactor bay, if a substantial number were found to be wrongly installed, there could be substantial remedial work involved.  However, when SABIC investigated the problem after termination, it emerged that the problem affected either 11 or 13<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="49">

This had been identified in the letter of 1 October.  PLL/SCL’s response is that the tensioning should not happen until the acoustic orifices were installed.   Mr Tilley accepted that supports near to the acoustic target plates might be left loose; but he rejected the suggestion that supports all along the 7km or so of reactor pipework should be left loose because of the double-working that would be involved in wholesale revisiting of the bolts.  That appears to me to be a compelling argument, such that the wholesale leaving of untensioned bolts is properly to be regarded as a failure of good workmanship. </p>

The remedial works were carried out over two weeks under the direct supervision of UHDE.  In addition SABIC found that there was damage to several high pressure bursting discs and that two reactor bursting discs had been placed in the wrong location.

Mr Lumley reviewed the defects that were outstanding at termination and gave as his opinion that there were 14 category 1 defects, 55 category 2 defects and 97 category 3 defects to the reactor bay systems.  While the precise numbers may be arguable, I accept his evidence as indicative of a significant number of material defects that required to be remedied before EID.  At a higher level, my assessment of the matters that I have reviewed above is that those under the headings of misaligned reactor piping supports, grid supports and UHDE valves were serious, having potential safety implications, while those relating to the tensioning of loose supports and intercooler supports, while not safety critical, are indicative of poor workmanship.  The matters relating to acoustic orifices and thermocouples add little to the overall picture.  Taken overall, the problems that I have reviewed support SABIC’s case that the quality of SCL’s workmanship was not consistent with the exercising of due diligence. </p>

In the case of the anchor supports, which were raised in January 2008 but not brought to Mr Wray’s attention before August 2008, there is clear evidence of a failure to address issues promptly.  SCL did not progress its works in the reactor bay so as to comply with the requirements of the Completion Plan and did not take any active steps to accelerate its works either before or after the Warning Letter.  Otherwise, in my judgment, although there appears to have been a general absence of urgency on SCL’s part, the evidence about reactor bay progress does not substantially advance SABIC’s case that SCL failed to progress matters with due diligence during the Warning Period. </p>

When it operates, water rotates within the vessel, creating dynamic forces in the vessel by the swirling of gas and water.  It was designed and constructed by SCL before termination.  During commissioning tests between May and August 2009 the vessel vibrated dangerously.  SABIC took expert advice from Foster Wheeler which led to progressive stiffening of the EVS and its support.  At the end of those works, the EVS still vibrated, but its operation was underwritten by Ove Arup for 30 cycles (i.e. blowdowns or emergency vents) on condition that it is inspected after each blowdown.  The remedial works involved significant costs valued by the quantum experts at £460,286.  SABIC alleges that it also caused 42 days delay to commissioning, from 4 September to 16 October 2009, with equivalent delay to putting the Wilton plant into production. </p>

These tests were at higher pressure (1500 Bar G).  Significant displacement was again seen with heave on the support feet and significant vibration in the adjacent pipe bridge structure.  A further design review was undertaken by Foster Wheeler which led to further stiffening work.  However, when the new works were tested at 300 Bar G displacement again occurred which, though reduced, was still excessive.  SABIC then commissioned ABB to carry out a design assessment.  ABB recommended further stiffening of the critical joints on the structure.  An internal SABIC email on 22 September 2009 reported that the design of local stiffening was being completed, material being resourced, and that “installation expected to be complete in around 24hrs, after which a final test will be prepared for.”<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="51">

SABIC therefore instructed Ove Arup to advise on whether the EVS was fit for purpose.  Ove Arup’s conclusion was that the design life of the EVS could be underwritten for 30 cycles provided that, after every blowdown, there should be an inspection of the EVS before recommissioning. </p>

Ethylene was first introduced into the Process Plant for the purposes of commissioning on 22 June 2009, 28.3 weeks after the date agreed in SSA2. … Our client has incurred significant losses as a result of the delay in introducing ethylene into the Process Plant.  Following ethylene in, it is accepted that our client had to undertake commissioning works prior to Polyethylene being produced.  While SSA2 provided a commissioning period of 3 weeks, our client is prepared to accept that the commissioning period would have taken up to 6 weeks.  In calculating its losses, our client will allow a 6 week period for commissioning following ethylene in. …  If ethylene in had therefore been achieved on 5 December 2008, it is reasonable to expect that our client would have completed commissioning to have allowed Polyethylene to have been produced by 16 January 2009.  Based upon the actual ethylene in date of 22 June 2009 commissioning should therefore have been completed to have allowed Polyethylene to have been produced by 3 August 2009.  Our client would therefore be able to claim its losses for the period between 16 January 2009 (the date when commissioning should have been completed so that Polyethylene should have been produced following ethylene in on 5 December 2008) and 3 August 2009 (the date when commissioning should have been completed and Polyethylene produced following actual ethylene in on 22 June 2009).

These concessions are properly and inevitably made upon the evidence.  On the evidence, the design of the EVS was inadequate.  I accept the evidence of Mr Hargreaves of Ove Arup that the inadequacy stemmed from a failure by SCL to carry out any adequate assessment of the dynamics or the dynamic loads of the EVS system and its support structure or the interaction between those dynamics and the dynamic loads caused by blowdown.  The immediate cause of the problem was the placing of the inlet nozzles, which SCL failed to investigate or resolve.  I reject the evidence of Mr Laslett (who acknowledged that he had no relevant structural engineering qualifications) who attempted to justify SCL’s design. </p>

PLL/SCL’s approach has been to put SABIC to proof of this area of its case.  For present purposes, it is sufficient to say that I accept the evidence of Mr Tilley that the secondary compressor was ready for commissioning in May 2009, but that the commissioning and ultimately operation of the machine was delayed by the problems with the EVS.  The chronology that I have outlined above shows that some commissioning works could be carried out while the EVS problems were investigated and resolved.  However, I accept Mr Tilley’s oral evidence that, while some cold commissioning was possible after the EVS had been isolated, hot commissioning and the production of LDPE could not commence until it was back on stream, since it was an integral part of the plant’s safety systems.  Thus, although it was possible to introduce ethylene into the Secondary Compressor on 21 July 2009, ethylene could not be sent from the Secondary Compressor into the reactor for the commencement of hot work.  On this issue I also accept the evidence of Mr Farrar that the date of actual production of LDPE in October 2009 was dictated by the EVS remedial works. </p>

SABIC recruited technicians from machinefitting backgrounds, two of whom had previous experience of working on NP hyper compressors when at ICI.  Initially the readings obtained were not consistent on repetition, at least partly because (as was discovered) a number of the crosshead thrust boreholes were themselves out of tolerance, which affected the readings.  By about mid-October 2008 a procedure had been developed which gave Mr Madioni confidence that the alignments had been measured correctly.  The procedure was further developed in November 2008.

NP’s replacement plunger guide rings, supplied in March and April 2009, were themselves out of tolerance, so that SABIC commissioned a local firm to fabricate them in early April 2009.  There was a problem with the alignment of the driveshaft between the main crankcases and the Secondary Compressor motor.  In February 2009 it was discovered that oil resistant paint needed to be applied.  Electric trace heating and insulation was required: the need was discovered in February 2009 but not resolved until May<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="52">

The dispute has been whether or not the more demanding EM vertical alignment tolerances became a contractual requirement.  By the time of oral closing, SABIC accepted that there was no contractual requirement for NP to have applied the EM tolerances to the second stage Secondary Compressor (though it maintained that it would have been good practice for NP to have done so); but it submitted that the position was different in relation to the first stage Secondary Compressor because of the exchange of correspondence between EM, NP, SABIC and SCL on and after 12 September 2006.  I disagree.  Although NP agreed to incorporate the EM tolerances for the first stage Secondary Compressor, and later agreed that it would do the necessary realignment on site, there was no consideration for this agreement and it did not amount to a contractual variation so as to impose a contractual obligation upon NP (or, by extension, on SCL) to apply the EM tolerances.

The first question is whether those differences arose because the Secondary Compressor was in a different condition when the readings were taken in Florence and Wilton respectively, or whether the differences are a function of technique in taking the readings.  PLL/SCL submit that the readings take in Florence were accurate and that those taken in Wilton were not, so that the Court should conclude that there was no failure to comply with the NP tolerances.  SABIC suggests that the crosshead alignments may have shifted in transit, specifically suggesting that the storm in the Bay of Biscay may have affected the second stage Secondary Compressor; alternatively, it submits that Mr Tilley’s evidence is reliable and that, if anything, the readings taken in Florence were not. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">It seems unlikely that the alignments shifted in transit.  The Secondary Compressor is a large and robust machine and the alignment surfaces are securely bolted in place to withstand the substantial forces that are applied during operation.  Although damage to cylinders to the compressors was noted after the Bay of Biscay storm, no damage to the crankcases was apparent, and the cylinders were packed separately.  Furthermore, if shifting in transit had been the explanation, it is unlikely that it would have been unique to the Wilton machines; yet there is no hint of such movements being a recognised problem.  SABIC has not provided any quantitative assessment of the forces that would have been required to cause the alignments to shift, or of the forces that would have been imposed on the Secondary Compressor in transit.  I therefore reject the suggestion that one or other set of crosshead alignments shifted in transit. </p>

First, the Wilton readings were carried out under the direct supervision of NP using techniques that NP had developed and approved.  No rational argument has been advanced to suggest why NP would have approved the techniques (including those adopted after refinement in October/November 2008) if they were not in fact reliable, to the extent of being satisfied with the readings despite the absence of laser technology.  Second, NP had no interest in declaring the Wilton readings to be reliable if they were not because, if correct, the Wilton readings meant that NP’s machine was out of tolerance and required remedial works.  Yet it is clear on the evidence that NP was satisfied and was prepared to develop remedial works on the strength of the Wilton readings.  Third, there is evidence that Mr Wray of SCL had a meeting with NP. Yet he did not suggest that there was any lack of assurance on the part of NP, nor did he observe or develop any compelling reason to think that the readings were not reliable. </p>

SCL has carried out no similar exercise to contradict Mr De Main’s evidence and there is no contemporaneous evidence of SCL asserting that it was being prevented from carrying out any significant number of loop tests because SABIC was carrying out the alignment works.  Instead, PLL/SCL points to the dates in programmes when the cylinders were required to be installed  However, this argument is based on the premise that the cylinders had to be installed for the loop tests to be carried out, which assumes the very fact that PLL/SCL seeks to prove and which Mr De Main’s evidence directly contradicts.  Mr Lumley agreed in cross-examination that the cylinders to the Secondary Compressor would be taken off and placed in storage, being reinstalled shortly before commissioning.  But the evidence was that this was as a matter of protective routine, to prevent damage occurring on a working construction site.  It does not follow that the absence of the cylinders would prevent loop testing.  Mr Crossley was unable to assist PLL/SCL on this issue: he accepted that he was not qualified to give an opinion on whether it was possible or not to do the loop tests in the absence of the cylinders and plungers being installed.  Counsel for SABIC carried out a further filtering analysis on Mr De Main’s evidence which showed that, while some of the claimed loop tests recorded the existence of faults, none of the faults appear to be related to the carrying out of the alignment works.   </p>

However, while the system is at the risk of SABIC from the time of handover and future care, operation, servicing and maintenance is SABIC’s responsibility, that does not relieve SCL of responsibility for defects in the system handed over, as the contract in general and Clause 19 of the EPC contract in particular makes clear. </p>

It is common ground that when the pump was shut down, a non-return valve closed and water hammer caused damage to a concrete plinth. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">The parties are in dispute about the causes of this incident.  SABIC’s case is that it started up the pump properly, that the deformation of the bellows was attributable to deficiencies in SCL’s design or installation, and that its operatives’ decision to shut down the pump was a reasonable response to the emergency that confronted them as a consequence of the failure of the bellows.  Accordingly, SABIC places responsibility for the incident at SCL’s door.  PLL/SCL’s case is that the failure of the bellows was caused by SABIC allowing the pump to run with excess air in the system and that SABIC’s turning off of the pump was deficient because it made inadequate allowance for the risk of water hammer and the damage it might cause. </p>

Their investigation established that the installation of the bellows was incorrect.  First, there should have been four tie bars running between the flanges at the opposite ends of the bellows.  The purpose of the tie bars was to control the expansion and movement of the flexible bellows when the system is under pressure.  SCL had installed only two rods and the two that had been installed had been set to different lengths.  Second, the nuts on the inside and outside of the tie bars were set at incorrect clearances because SCL had omitted necessary spherical washers.  Their investigation also established that the pump had been started up and the system had run without any unusual noise or other evidence of poor priming of the pump for 20 minutes before the bellows distorted; and that the damage to the plinth occurred when the non-return valve closed on the shutting down of the pump. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">For SABIC, Mr Lumley’s opinion as stated in his report was that shutting down the pump was a reasonable reaction to the distortion of the bellows in an attempt to prevent catastrophic failure of the bellows and potential personal injury or damage to property.  He concluded that the subsequent damage to the plinth was consistent with the effects of water hammer caused by the shutting down of the pump.  He criticised SCL for its installation of the bellows and for failing to contemplate sufficiently the consequences of shutting down the pump, including the risk of water hammer.  As a result, the plinth was not strong enough to resist the effects of the water hammer.  He rejected the suggestion that the incident was caused by a failure on SABIC’s part to vent the system.  His opinion was that the bellows as installed was not fit for purpose.  In his oral evidence, while accepting that the damage to the plinth was caused by water hammer, he maintained his opinion that the damage to the bellows was not.  He accepted that, in the event of water hammer such as occurred during the incident, the presence of bellows would not prevent damage to the pipe supports.  He explained that if there had been significant quantities of air in the system, the operators would have become aware of it during the 20 minutes of operation before the bellows distorted, either because of noise, or because of instability or fluctuating pressure in the system; and he gave as his opinion that if a “bubble” of air had become trapped somewhere remotely in the system it would act as an accelerator once the pump was shut down (in the sense that, if the pressure in the system reduced, the air would tend to expand) but pointed out that this was different from water hammer (which is the passing of a shock wave on the termination of flow and not the physical moving of a slug of water). </p>

In his report, while recording the fact that the tie bars were intended to withstand the forces due to normal bellows system operating pressure, that some were omitted and incorrectly set and that the Face to Face dimensions were outside those specified by Posiflex, he suggested that the movement of the bellows may have been due to water hammer which may have involved forces that would have exceeded the capability of the tie bars even if they had been correctly installed.  In doing so, despite rejecting as unlikely the possibility that pump induced vibration may have caused the failure, he ignored the clear evidence that distortion of the bellows occurred before the pump was switched off.  He concluded that the most likely cause of the failure of the bellows was “trapped air somewhere in the pump or pipework system.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">When he gave oral evidence, Mr Payne developed his theory that a bubble of air may have become trapped in the system (perhaps in a “branch” line) which, upon the pump being shut down, would have expanded and caused a slug of water to circulate back along the system, causing an effect similar to water hammer that would have damaged the bellows even if installed correctly.  He accepted that the bellows were incorrectly installed in the respects identified above and that it was not surprising, given the manner in which they were set up, that the bellows distorted under normal operating conditions; but he questioned whether the distortion made it necessary to shut the pump down in an emergency, commenting (correctly in my view) that “only those who were there could answer that question.  I can’t answer that question” and agreeing that those on site should be given a degree of tolerance when making that judgment.  Realistically he accepted that if the operators on site were confronted by what appeared to them to be an imminent failure of the piping system, it was hardly surprising that they would shut down the pump immediately.  Turning to the period before the bellows failed, he accepted that the operation of the system for 20 minutes without incident suggests that there was not air circulating with the water round the system, so that his final position was the suggestion that there may have been a pocket of air under compression which would have expanded when the pump was shut down and pressure in the system reduced. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">The evidence establishes that the bellows failed about 20 minutes after startup and that there had been nothing untoward noticed during the previous 20 minutes.  There is no direct evidence to support the suggestion that SABIC failed to vent the system properly and no circumstantial evidence in the form of unusual noises or fluctuations in pressure in the period before the incident.  Mr Payne’s evidence goes against a finding that SABIC ran the system with air circulating with the water.  As a result, his final position was that there may have been a bubble of water, possibly stuck up a branch line, which only expanded or came into play when the pump was switched off.  By then, the bellows had distorted.  In my judgment the reason for the failure of the bellows is clear: SCL inserted them incorrectly as described above, so that they were liable to distort under normal operating conditions, as Mr Payne accepted.  In the absence of any evidence to support the theory that some other mechanism operated to distort the bellows, I find as a fact that the bellows distorted because of the failure by SCL to install them properly. </p>

In those circumstances, they acted reasonably in shutting down the pump immediately.  That caused conventional water hammer and the closing of the nonreturn valve, the combined effect of which was to transmit forces to the pipework that were sufficient to cause the damage to the plinth.  There is no need or justification for a theory based upon the expansion of a bubble of air that had previously been parked in a branch line, and I reject it.  Even if the theory were sound, the root cause of the damage would still have been the operatives’ decision to turn off the pump as an emergency which, as I have said, was reasonable in the prevailing circumstances. </p>

Viewed overall, when the Warning Letter was sent the contract was considerably in delay with EID likely to be achieved in early February 2009.  During the Warning Period SCL took no effective steps to recover any of the delay that had occurred and, as identified above, further substantial delay occurred in critical areas.  On Mr Crane’s analysis, which was performed using SCL’s progress data, the contract as a whole slipped by a further 18 days during the Warning Period.  As already noted, Mr Crossley was instructed to consider progress during the Warning Period and could readily have done a similar exercise but did not do so.  Mr Crane’s analysis is therefore uncontradicted and, in my judgment, PLL/SCL made no significant inroads on his conclusions.  While there may be scope for argument about whether Mr Crane’s figure of 18 days is precisely correct, I find as a fact based upon Mr Crane’s analysis that during the Warning Period, progress on the works slipped by about a further 18 days.  The only unwarranted hindrance by SABIC during the Warning Period was the raid on 24 October 2008.  The effects of that raid on overall progress would have been minimal since loop checking was not considered to be (and was not) on the critical path to EID at that point.  I therefore conclude that either all or the overwhelming majority of the slippage during the Warning Period was the responsibility of SCL. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">The relevant evidence points overwhelmingly to the conclusion that SCL failed to exercise due diligence during the Warning Period.  Far from maintaining the rates of progress that had been indicated by the Completion Plan, further slippage occurred to the works overall and specifically in relation to those areas which were thought to be critical and which should therefore have been given primacy, namely PFP, Insulation, and Cleaning and Blowing.  In each of these three areas there was an apparent lack of urgency and an absence of the decisive action that was required to turn the contract round and achieve satisfactory progress.  As I have set out in more detail above, in the area of PFP SCL was unable to procure the necessary progress from Cape and effective negotiations with Hertel did not happen until towards the end of the month.  In the area of insulation, SCL was unable to procure the necessary progress from Cape; and it did not formulate any coherent plan either for the use of temporary insulation or for omitting insulation until after EID.  The net result was slippage of 3 weeks on the insulation subcontract during the Warning Period.  In the area of cleaning and blowing, as much energy appears to have been devoted to attempting to reduce the scope of SCL’s work (in the hope of achieving the consequential savings that were driving SCL’s thinking) as to planning how to carry out the full scope of PI 092 works.  This led to the unsatisfactory result that SCL was issuing instructions to Halliburton to carry out a reduced scope of works which was not justified by a proper appreciation of the correct scope of SCL’s obligations.  The evidence does not justify a clear finding of fact that these instructions caused slippage.  It does, however, justify the finding that SCL did not do what was necessary to ensure that satisfactory progress was achieved and that the progress during the Warning Period was not sufficient for SCL to have achieved the target EID of 7/9 February 2009 that was in contemplation at the start of the Warning Period.   </p>

Mechanical completions did not achieve rates of progress consistent with the Completion Plan, with Mr Buckley’s analysis revealing a backlog caused by the sub-contractors’ unwillingness to provide QA documentation – the restriction which led to his disastrous decision to move documentation off site.  The work in the reactor bay was of an inadequate standard that was not remedied in the period to termination.  Neither the EVS nor the Secondary Compressor provides an explanation or justification for SCL’s inadequate performance.  The Cooling Water System does not specifically relate to the Warning Period. </p>

In part, at least, this was because of the absence of Mr Martin during the critical central part of October 2008.  That is not to say that all would have been well if he had been there.  It is likely that he would have pursued his objective of retrieving SCL’s financial position by pursuing the tactics outlined earlier; and his fundamental misjudgement of SABIC’s conduct would have made relations during the Warning Period particularly fraught.  However, in his absence Mr Buckley was unable to make any significant progress in retrieving the situation.   The fact that Mr Buckley was not up to running such a difficult contract was doubtless the reason why PLL put in Mr Martin in the first place.  Whatever the reason, during the Warning Period, SCL floundered. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">Five points arise on the interpretation of Clause 27.2.5.  First, having correctly identified that the clause only operates when there has been a deterioration in SCL’s financial position, PLL/SCL submit that on the facts of this case the only period that is relevant is the period from SSA2 to termination, on the grounds that “the purpose of SSA2 was to re-baseline the parties’ relationship and enable completion in accordance with the Contract as varied by SSA2.  It would be perverse if SABIC was entitled immediately to terminate the Contract after SSA2 had been entered into on the basis of SCL’s financial position, known about and partly necessitating SSA2.”  This submission faces a number of difficulties.  Clause 27.2.5 was in place from the original execution of the contract.  It is implicit in PLL/SCL’s submission that, if SSA2 had not occurred, the relevant period would be the period from the original execution of the contract: I agree that this would be so because there is nothing in the clause to limit the relevant period to be one that is shorter than the duration of the contract as a whole.  Why then should SSA2 make a difference?  There is nothing expressed in SSA2 to vary the meaning or effect of Clause 27.2.5; nor is there anything in SSA2 which necessarily implies that the effect of the clause is varied.  PLL/SCL’s submission that “the purpose of SSA2 was to re-baseline the parties’ relationship” is opaque.  It is true that it provided for additional payments to be made and for past claims to be compromised; but otherwise it is not clear what is meant by the word “re-baselining” in this context.   The second purpose of SSA2 is submitted to be to “enable completion in accordance with the Contract as varied by SSA2.”  It was certainly the hope (as well as the contractual obligation) that the works would then be completed in accordance with the Contract as varied by SSA2; but that begs the question whether Clause 27.2.5 had been varied.  Nor do I understand why it should be held to be perverse if SABIC could have terminated immediately after SSA2 on the basis of Clause 27.2.5.  On the contrary, if SCL’s financial position deteriorated to such an extent that, even with the agreement for the injections of cash provided by SSA2, the capability of SCL to fulfil its obligations was placed in jeopardy, it seems to me to be acceptable that SABIC should retain the protection of Clause 27.2.5.  In the absence of any express term or necessary implication varying the effect of Clause 27.2.5, I reject PLL/SCL’s submission on this point. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, when considering SCL’s financial position it is necessary to take into account any external support that was available to it.  Specifically, as recorded in the judgment of Sir William Blackburne in <span style="font-style:italic">Carillion Construction Ltd v Hussain &amp; Ors</span> [2013] EWHC 685 (Ch), PLL provided letters of support addressed to the directors of SCL dated 12 May 2008 and 14 May 2009, the first of which stated that PLL would “provide the necessary financial and business support to [SCL] to ensure that the Company continues as a going concern” and the second of which stated that PLL would “provide sufficient funds to the company …, to enable [SCL] to continue operating and to meet its liabilities as and when they fall due for the period until May 2010, to ensure that the company continues as going concern.”  As the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Carillion</span> establishes, these letters were not enforceable by third parties; but PLL did in fact provide financial support to SCL until July 2011 when it notified the Bombay Stock Exchange that it was withdrawing financial support to SCL, having by then provided support in the form of unsecured loans to the tune of about £240 million. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">Third, the mere fact that PLL was providing support to SCL does not necessarily mean that SCL should be treated as if it were invested with all of PLL’s financial strength for the purposes of Clause 27.2.5.  What financial support was in fact provided from time to time is a question of fact, as is the question whether SCL’s financial position (as a result of any deterioration but with the benefit of that support) meant that SCL’s capability adequately to fulfil its obligations under the Contract has been placed in jeopardy. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">Fourth, the reference in Clause 27.2.5 to SCL “[fulfilling] its obligations under the Contract” is unqualified.  However, it would be unreasonable to interpret the clause as giving SABIC a right to terminate as soon as SCL’s financial position had any adverse effect on is ability to fulfil its obligations.  Given the draconian nature of the right of termination, the better view must be that the financial deterioration jeopardises the fulfilling of SCL’s obligations under the contract to a substantial extent.  It is not possible to lay down bright lines in advance to define when Clause 27.2.5 would or would not apply.  So, for example, if SCL’s financial position were shown to have caused a one week delay in completion of the works, the Court may well decide that liquidated damages would be the appropriate contractual remedy and that Clause 27.2.5 was not applicable; but there may come a time where the delay attributable to SCL’s financial position was so extreme as to justify reliance on Clause 27.2.5.  Equally, the risk must be significant as opposed to fanciful or theoretical only. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">Fifth, at one point PLL/SCL submitted that SABIC had lost its right to rely upon Clause 27.2.5 by 3 November 2008 because it said in the Warning Letter that it would have been entitled to terminate on the basis of the financial deterioration that had taken place by 3 October 2008.  If persisted in, I reject this submission.  There is nothing in the provisions of the contract that required SABIC to exercise the right to terminate pursuant to Clause 27.2.5 at the earliest possible moment.  To the contrary, Clause 40.3 of the EPC contract provided that “failure [by SABIC] to enforce or partially enforce any provision of the Contract will not be construed as a waiver ofany of its rights under the Contract.”  To my mind, that provides a complete answer to the point. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">The autumn of 2008 saw world markets heading for crisis.  This compounded SCL’s financial difficulties.  Although SCL managed to extend its borrowing facilities with ICICI it had to pay through the nose to do so.  On 1 October 2008 Mr Leggett was provided with flash financial results for September which showed a loss of £500,000 in the month.  Once again Mr Leggett looked for costs that could be deferred.  A contract cost report on the same day forecast a total contract cost of £195 million with a contract price of £156.5 million and additional “target revenue” of £6 million, giving a projected loss of £32.7 million.  By this time, even Mr Leggett and the SCL board were obliged to accept that the notion of the contract breaking even was “hopelessly optimistic”.  SCL’s response was to prepare aggressive claims against suppliers and sub-contractors.  Mr Leggett’s evidence was that there had been an actual deterioration between 1 and 15 October 2008 when he reported to the SCL board.   </p>

The financial losses being incurred on the Wilton contract were a substantial contributor to the progressive deterioration.  The effect of the deterioration was that, from April 2008 at the latest, SCL’s consistent strategy on the contract was to reduce costs and it was this, rather than the need to fulfil its contract obligations, that drove its strategy of demanning.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.00in">The need to reduce costs also largely explains why SCL took no accelerative measures: it was not in a position to pay for them.  What emerges with clarity from the evidence is that, although PLL was ensuring that SCL could continue to be treated as a going concern, it was not providing funding that would enable SCL to progress the works with due diligence.  That is borne out by the fact that, despite repeated requests from SABIC, SCL did not at any stage put forward proposals for mitigating the delays that were occurring, resorting instead to a claims strategy directed against SABIC that was unjustified.  The fact that PLL was not going to let SCL go into administration at this point is irrelevant to the conclusion that the contract was and remained underfunded from March 2008 to the time of termination as a result of the deterioration in SCL’s financial position and its inability to resource it more fully. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">PLL/SCL submit that there has been no detailed analysis of any delays attributable to lack of funding.  That is true.  However, the evidence of financial constraints is plain; SCL used it to frighten SABIC into providing partial funding of its contract losses on the basis that it could not conclude the contract without a substantial cash injection; and the demanning and failure to apply further resources was primarily driven by SCL’s financial constraints.  In my judgment, the inference that the slippage in the period before the Warning Letter and the further slippage in the Warning Period was in substantial measure attributable to SCL’s financially constrained approach to resourcing the contract is irresistible, as is the further inference that such slippage would probably have continued after 3 November 2008 if the contract had not been terminated.  Thus the deterioration in SCL’s financial position during the period of the contract (and, if this is a necessary finding, the continuing deterioration after SSA2) was a direct cause of SCL’s substantial failure to discharge its contractual obligations properly. </p>

By the time of Closing Submissions, the catalogue of matters upon which SABIC relied had increased to include the demanning in June 2008, the taking advantage of SABIC’s dependency upon SCL to exercise leverage in relation to its claim for £4.7 million, further demobilising at the end of September 2008, instructing Halliburton to proceed with a reduced scope of works, and “the sheer scale of the delay by SCL in the progress of its works.”  It is said that SABIC accepted the repudiatory breach by its termination letter on 3 November 2010 or its subsequent letter on 10 November 2010. </p>

An absolute refusal by one party to perform his side of the contract will entitle the other party to treat himself as discharged, as will also a clear and unambiguous assertion by one party that he will be unable to perform when the time for performance should arrive. Short of such an express refusal or declaration, however, the test is to ascertain whether the action or actions of the party in default are such as to lead a reasonable person to conclude that he no longer intends to be bound by its provisions.

At all material times it protested its intention to bring the Project to completion and, although its failure to exercise due diligence was persistent and serious, mere delay – even when substantial – is not necessarily to be equated with a renunciation of the defaulting party’s side of the contract: see <span style="font-style:italic">J M Hill &amp; Sons v LB Camden</span> (1980) 18 BLR 31.

However, on 10 November 2008 SABIC’s solicitors sent a further letter specifically alleging conduct on SCL’s part amounting to repudiatory breach of contract and accepting it as such if it had not done so already.

This is not to belittle the considerable amount of work done both by Mr Naisbitt and by the experts.  It was, in my judgment, a proportionate and reasonable approach to this head of quantum even allowing for the size of the sums involved and the importance of the issue to the parties.  It is easy to conceive that the issues relating to this head of claim could in the past have been allocated weeks of Court time on their own, with minute examination of items and evidence from dozens of witnesses with first hand knowledge of what happened after termination.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">This approach, though reasonable and proportionate, is not without its difficulties.  The first area of tension goes to the question of the burden and standard of proof.  PLL/SCL submit, without fear of contradiction, that it is for SABIC to prove its claim.  It is also for SABIC to decide what evidence it wishes to call in its attempts to do so.  However, the Court has provided the context for those decisions by allocating 20 days of Court time to the entire trial and also by its directions in relation to this head of claim at the PTR on 1 March 2013.  The allocation of the Court’s time means that it was out of the question to produce full and comprehensive direct evidence in support of every aspect of SABIC’s quantum claim: the time available did not permit such an approach, however efficiently it might be pursued.  Furthermore, the Court’s order at the PTR was clearly intended to ensure that SCL identified the matters in issue so that the parties should then concentrate upon them.  In these circumstances it would in my judgment be inappropriate for the Court to cavil at the approach adopted by SABIC, which was that Mr Naisbitt’s third witness statement should address (and only address) the matters raised by SCL in the 12 March Particulars.  On the contrary, the Court is required to make proper findings and draw proper inferences on the basis of the information that the parties have presented, including the important evidence of Mr Walmsley and Mr Brooker.  Lest there be any residual doubt, I consider that the evidence presented is sufficient to justify findings of fact, as set out below, adopting a conventional approach to the burden and standard of proof that rests on SABIC.  That said, the state of the evidence must inevitably be reflected in the findings that the court can properly make, with the result that I accept PLL/SCL’s submission that it </p>

	      </authorialNote>, that it should not be judged harshly when the Court is assessing its performance after termination because it had been put in a position of embarrassment by SCL’s defaults.  SABIC submits that its actions after termination should not be “weighed in nice scales” and that it should not “be held disentitled to recover the cost of [its] measures merely because the party in breach can suggest that other measures less burdensome to him might have  been taken.”  There is substance in this submission, but it can be taken too far on the facts of this case.  On my findings, SABIC was placed in the difficult position of having to take over the completion of the works after termination when it was not itself a construction company.  However, it was a major organisation that had the opportunity to prepare for the possibility of termination, particularly during the Warning Period; and it is part of SABIC’s case on quantum that it was in fact competent to carry the works to completion with the introduction of minimal additional project management expertise<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">66</span>.  In my judgment, a suitable balance is struck by recognising that, although SABIC had significant expertise, much of which it had acquired during the Wilton project, it was primarily a chemical manufacturing company and not a construction business.  Although in mid-October 2008 SABIC thought that the termination had been “technically well prepared”<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="63">

In the event, while I have borne SABIC’s submission on this point in mind in my approach to the evidence, it has not been necessary to resort to it to any great extent since I do not consider that SCL has shown SABIC to have behaved unreasonably so as to need to rely upon indulgence from the Court in making its findings. </p>

	      </authorialNote>.  In summary, SABIC set up a system for recording post-termination costs under five basic headings (A. construction, B. rectification, C. precommissioning, D. commissioning, E. one-off costs associated with termination). Each subcontractor was instructed to allocate its costs on its daily log sheets for labour in accordance with these designations.   The system was monitored by a team of quantity surveyors and the supervisory Construction Management Team was instructed to issue instructions adopting the same categorisation.  Where work was outside the scope of SCL’s work, it was allocated to a separate cost heading under SABIC’s SAP accounting system.  One of SABIC’s project managers oversaw the development and approvals process for what were known as “Link Projects” (i.e. projects that were improvements on the currently agreed design, and therefore outside SCL’s contracted scope of works); and SABIC’s costs engineers set up a cost recording system to ensure that the costs were allocated to the correct cost codes.  The costs engineers were directly employed by Balfour Beatty Management [“BBM”] and would have checked costs and payment applications.   </p>

Having spent two weeks studying the account he was asked to manage the costs of the account, which was by then being run on a net cost reimbursable basis, and he visited Cape twice to audit their systems in March 2009, each visit lasting about two hours.  His audit involved analysing sample allocation sheets, costs reports and materials costs and resulted in a saving of approximately £70,000 which had been wrongly included by Cape.  Thereafter he received weekly costs reports from Cape and continued to audit their account by checking allocation sheets, timesheets and clock records until July 2009.  When Cape submitted its final account in August 2009 in the sum of £9.657 million, he negotiated a reduction to £9.6 million, which he did in the knowledge that there were further costs that Cape could have included and in the belief (formed on the basis of his previous checks) that a figure in excess of £9.6 million was likely to be the true value of Cape’s final account.  In closing submissions PLL/SCL pointed out that the two reductions achieved by Mr Wilson had not been as a result of the detailed studies that he had described; but it was not suggested to him in cross-examination or to the Court in closing submissions that there were other significant reductions that he should have been able to achieve.  Mr Brooker had reviewed the Cape account with Mr Wilson and identified only a further £26,000 reduction, which represents 0.27% of Cape’s final account figure of £9.657 million. </p>

His enquiries had involved following the progress from allocation sheets to payment, which he accepted gave him a reasonable and proportionate level of confidence.  His second reservation was about whether the costs had been reasonably incurred.  His concern appears to have been general and caused by the undoubted fact that the ultimate scope of work, duration of the works and amount of monies expended greatly exceeded the estimates that had been made in November and December 2008.  However, subject to points made on particular items and discussed below, PLL/SCL has not shown that the increased scope and expenditure is because of a misallocation of expenditure or a mis-attribution of the expenditure to SCL’s account; and, as touched on under Issue 3 above, I reject the submission that the increased period to EID was due to matters for which SABIC rather than SCL was responsible.  Rather, the weakness in Mr Brooker’s argument derives from the fact that the full scope of work was not appreciated in the November and December 2008 estimates upon which he founded his position. </p>

PLL/SCL’s criticism appears to ignore the fact that SABIC generally retained the same sub-contractors as SCL had engaged before termination, in many cases on the same or similar terms as before.

That does not mean that all claimed costs are recoverable or that the Court should start with any form of predisposition to find in favour of SABIC on particular items: the experts are agreed that in many cases the sums pleaded by SABIC cannot be justified.

The amount to be certified is the amount of the Contract Price (plus or minus the value of any additions to or deductions from the Contract Price) <span style="font-style:italic">minus</span> the net amount of the saving of cost and expense to the Contractor by reason of its having been relieved by the termination of its obligation to complete performance of the Contract <span style="font-style:italic">minus</span> the total amount paid by the Purchaser to the Contractor under the contract.  The resulting balance will be a balance due to the Purchaser or the Contractor depending upon the constituent amounts included in the calculation.  Payment of the balance (in either direction) shall be paid within 14 days of the debtor’s receipt of the Termination Certificate, as provided by Clause 30.5.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">The Termination Certificate does not finally determine the financial consequences of termination.  In particular, and without prejudice to its other rights, Clause 30.9 provides that the Purchaser may itself complete the works.  If it does so it is not liable to make any further payment to the Contractor until the works have been completed and the expiration of the Defects Period “and until the costs of completion and making good and remedying Defects, damages or delay in completion (if any) and all other costs and expenses incurred thereof certified by the Purchaser.” The clause provides that “if the total cost to the Purchaser reasonably incurred exceeds the total that the Engineering Works would have cost had they been completed by the Contractor (the Contract not having been terminated) the difference shall be recoverable by the Purchaser from the Contractor either by way of set off or as a debt.”  It is on this provision that SABIC founds its first head of claim.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">SABIC’s approach has been to calculate the total costs to it of completing the works, in which it includes the sums already paid to SCL and the cost of remedying Defects left by SCL at termination.  It interprets the words “the total that the Engineering Works would have cost had they been completed by the Contractor (the Contract not having been terminated)” as meaning the total that the works would have cost SABIC had they been completed by SCL i.e. the contract price it would have had to pay had the contract not been terminated and had SCL completed the works.  PLL/SCL submit that SABIC’s approach is incorrect and that the words “the total that the Engineering Works would have cost had they been completed by the Contractor (the Contract not having been terminated)” means the costs that SCL would have incurred in completing the works (without the contract being terminated) from the point at which termination in fact occurred.  In advancing this interpretation PLL/SCL submit that it is to be preferred because it is consistent with the approach adopted by Clause 30.1 in requiring the costs which SCL has saved to be the relevant measure when performing the calculation for the production of the Termination Certificate.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">I consider that SABIC’s approach is correct.  First, the exercises being carried out under Clause 30.1 and 30.9 respectively are different so that it is not self-evident that the same measure of costs should be adopted in each.  Second, the terms of the clauses are different:  Clause 30.1.3 refers expressly to SCL’s costs while Clause 30.9 does not.   This difference does not support the submission that the different provisions of the two clauses should each be given the same meaning.  Third, the purpose of the two clauses is different.  Clause 30.1 provides the route for determining the amount outstanding at termination. At that point, a calculation which effectively entitles the contractor to be paid the contract sum less the amount that he would have incurred in bringing the contract works to completion has logic.  However, Clause 30.9 applies where the purchaser has completed the works himself.  At that point, there is a logic in entitling him to recover the reasonable costs that he has incurred in bringing the works to completion, subject to giving credit for the amount that he would have had to pay to the contractor (i.e. the contract price as amended) had the contractor completed the works in accordance with the contract.  I therefore reject PLL/SCL’s submission that the costs that it would have incurred had the contract not been terminated and if it had completed the works are relevant to the calculation under Clause 30.9.</p>

By the 12 March Particulars,  PLL/SCL took general points to the effect that the personnel would have been on site for the period of SCL’s completion in any event so that the costs would have been incurred whoever completed the works and that the sums were excessive.  Mr Naisbitt’s response was that the staff costs were in respect of staff who had to be brought in to replace SCL’s staff when they went and that SABIC did not introduce more staff than were necessary.  Dealing with the increase between the projected costs in the December 2008 estimate (upon which Mr Brooker relied in his first report) and the eventual outturn cost, he pointed out that the December 2008 report was not comprehensive in a number of material respects and was itself based upon an estimate made in November 2008 when the full scope of the work was not known.  I accept his evidence on these points. </p>

PLL/SCL take the general point that some of the people would have been on site in any event, even if SCL had taken the project to completion.  However, it does not follow that they would have been engaged in work that should have been carried out by SCL.

Neither of these points had been taken in the 12 March Particulars, nor had they been raised in oral evidence or previously in submissions.  Mr Chandramohan is mentioned in an appendix to the experts’ second joint statement, but not in terms that enable the Court to determine with any confidence what his work involved.  In these unsatisfactory circumstances, firm conclusions are out of the question: the description of Mr Bown’s work suggests that not all of his time may have been spent on work that should be attributed to SCL’s account, as does that of Mr Chandramohan.

His evidence was that this item contained other forms of access provision than merely scaffolding; the need for access to the works was determined by their duration; he relied upon the fact that there were numerous defects (particularly in relation to insulation works) that required access to be provided; and the need for reinstatement arose because SCL had removed a substantial proportion of the scaffolding even though the works (and particularly the insulation works) were incomplete. His evidence was that SABIC removed scaffolds at the earliest opportunity as they would then be of no benefit; and the costs were audited and paid for on a net cost plus margin basis.  He was not cross-examined on this evidence and I accept it. </p>

Rix was engaged on a cost reimbursable basis for a number of reasons, including that, because of the delay that had already occurred, there was doubt whether Cape would agree to carry out the works for the lump sums they had originally quoted; the works needed to be accelerated; additional resources were required; and the works were in a state of partial completion.  SABIC therefore took the view that the most pragmatic and appropriate manner of securing cooperation and progress was to work on a cost-plus basis.  The final outturn cost was a function of Rix’s lack of productivity, which was not demonstrably worse after termination than it had been before; and the scope of the work was well defined.

In Closing Submissions PLL/SCL criticised SABIC for retaining Cape without taking measures to incentivise them.  Mr Naisbitt responded to the suggestion that SABIC might have engaged other contractors in his third statement.  For the reasons he gives, it would have been highly disruptive to have attempted to assemble a new body of contractors.  Quite apart from the uncertainty and time involved in attempting to identify, agree terms with and engage others, new contractors would not have the benefit of prior knowledge of the site and works and would have to make a standing start on a part-completed project.  I accept Mr Naisbitt’s evidence that the decision to retain existing sub-contractors was pragmatic and reasonable.  In his first statement, on which he was not cross-examined, he had said that at the meetings on 12 August 2008, SCL had advised that the access contract was at the stage where it was only realistic to evaluate Cape’s work on a reimbursable basis.  It is also relevant to recall that, on 17 October 2008, Cape had asserted to SCL that completion of the straight runs would constitute substantial completion of its works, and that subsequent works should be done on a dayworks basis<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="67">

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">At most, the discrepancy between the allocation sheets and the gate records would require a reduction of about 20% of the sum claimed.  However, such a reduction would be excessive unless it were to be concluded that the gate entry logs provided a full and comprehensive record of those working on the LDPE project, which they do not.  First, the gate entry records were for security purposes and not for the formal purpose of logging men into and out of work.  Second, I accept Mr Walmsley’s evidence that labour would not be rigorous about logging themselves in and out of the gates; and I accept the general thrust of his evidence that about 20% of AMEC’s labour worked offsite and would therefore not need routinely to go through the gates or to operate the gate entry system.  In his evidence, Mr Walmsley took a conservative estimate of 14% of the workforce hours being attributable to those who worked off-site, though his analysis would suggest a higher figure.  That was prudent, but it still makes a substantial dent in the gate entry point.  In my judgment, essentially for the reasons given by Mr Walmsley, I consider that the gate entry point justifies a reduction of 5% on the basis that about 14% is explained by Mr Walmsley’s analysis and a further 1% by the fact that people would not have been rigorous in their use of the gate entry system. </p>

He referred to and relied upon annotated timesheets, daily summaries, supporting invoices, checked measures (where appropriate) contained in  SABIC’s disclosure and he exhibited a spreadsheet produced from the Tolent daily labour allocation sheets which tabulated Tolent’s daily manhour allocations by task from the day after termination to 31 July 2009 (the final date claimed by SABIC) and supports the figure claimed by SABIC.  In response to the criticism that SABIC had engaged Tolent on a dayworks basis, his evidence was that this was the same basis as SCL’s engagement of Tolent before termination and asserts that, because of discounts, Tolent charged SABIC less than it would have charged SCL.

Equally, it appears that a system of categorisation was in place and some costs were allocated to SCL’s scope of work.  Mr Naisbitt’s evidence is very limited on this item.  I accept his evidence to the extent of accepting that there was some work within SCL’s scope and some work required to rectify SCL’s work.  However, given the extent of the upgrade and the lack of detailed justification, the evidence adduced by SABIC does not justify any confidence about what particular sums should be allocated to SCL’s account save for the cost of the electrical work upgrade required by the undersized power cable.  Adopting a broad brush approach, I feel confident (on the balance of probabilities) that a sum of £100,000 should be brought into account, but have no confidence in relation to any greater sum. </p>

Some work (e.g. the DSC mod pack changes made to the high pressure condensate) are alleged to appear to be preferential and much testing is said to have been repeated unnecessarily because SABIC misunderstood the status of the loop testing that had been carried out by SCL.

His response in relation to the DCS modpack example cited by PLL/SCL is that SABIC had a separate Purchase Order with Honeywell for its own modpack and commissioning work, which should therefore have been excluded.  It appears that he does not have personal knowledge of the issue in question as he says that “if SCL are correct [in suggesting that the works have been misallocated] then this would only be clerical error by the Honeywell engineer in allocating his time.”  He also confirms </p>

In carrying out this exercise he noted that SABIC had allocated certain invoices between various parts of the project: he made the assumption that these allocations had been properly made by persons having specific project knowledge.  As with all other items which he and Mr Brooker reviewed, this process did not enable him to form an independent view on whether the items being considered were or were not part of SCL’s scope of work.  He then made adjustments, as set out in Attachment 7 to the joint statement and as elucidated in Appendix 3 to SABIC’s written closing submissions, reaching a figure of £1,300,000 which he is prepared to support as a figure.  In cross-examination he repeated that he could not form a view as to whether particular items were within or outside SCL’s scope of work.  He said that he had spoken to Mr Lumley to make sure that he had not included anything that was obviously outside SCL’s scope of work and where Mr Lumley said that an item might be either within or outside the scope of work or was clearly outside it, he excluded it.</p>

That is to say, it is not the quantity surveying detail which I would expect to see in order to properly verify and substantiate the basis to the amounts claimed by the relevant supplier/contractor and, more importantly, the back up details and calculations to the amounts paid by SABIC either based upon what has been applied for or, if different, to show SABIC’s calculations.”  As a result “the only real check that can be made of the information supplied is a clerical-type process to see that monetary values trace across the documents provided on the basis of identifiable amounts on invoices (at best) or more often, from SABIC allocations of what an invoiced sum comprises… .”<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"> </span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="72">

He too pointed to the fact that parts of invoices had been allocated to different places within the SAP system; and he noted Entry Codes on some invoices, which he understood to be the mechanism by which sums became allocated to the SAP.  His conclusion was that “in view of the above problems, the paucity of the available detailed information, and the lack of any detailed engineering/scoping documents upon which to understand what work is actually being procured so that a quantify surveying evaluation can be made, I consider that I am unable to offer an assessment against these SABIC Scope Completion Projects.”</p>

In relation to this item it is most unfortunate that the issues relating to the Scope Completion Works were not formulated by PLL/SCL in the 12 March Particulars or at any time so as to enable SABIC to respond properly.  In these circumstances, it seems to me that PLL/SCL’s complaints of lack of proof on the part of SABIC lose the potency they might otherwise have.  As it is, the Court is left with Mr Naisbitt’s unchallenged evidence from his first witness statement and the clash of the experts.  In my judgment, Mr Walmsley’s approach is to be preferred as a constructive attempt to review a significant head of claim.  While I accept that Mr Brooker did not have the full information that he would have wished from a quantity surveying perspective, it is to be remembered that the experts did not commit themselves to giving an independent opinion on whether items of work were within SCL’s scope of work on any of the items that I have been considering in this section of the judgment.  The inability to express such an independent opinion does not remove the desirability of at least verifying the audit trail so far as it exists.  I am also influenced by my finding that the system established by SABIC for the allocation of costs was generally sound.</p>

In his first report, dated 18 March 2013, Mr Walmsley noted that it was difficult for him “to reach a properly concluded opinion in respect of each claimed sum, since I do not know the scope of work or how the claimed sums have been calculated.”  However, he expressed the opinion that, if the defects were found to be the responsibility of SCL, it would be inappropriate to include £nil, since there must be a cost associated with rectification.  He therefore (a) assumed that the defects were the responsibility of SCL, (b) noted Mr Naisbitt’s evidence about how the list had been prepared, (c) expressed the opinion that there are likely to be instances where the discipline engineers have correctly identified the scope and the likely cost of rectification has been properly calculated, but recognised that there may be instances where the scope had been over-estimated and the likely cost of rectification over-stated.  While recognising that his approach was based upon speculation, he applied an across-theboard discount of 30% to SABIC’s claimed figures, resulting in a figure of £210,000.</p>

The subcategorisation to which the 12 March Particulars must be seen in this context.  The categorisation of 28.2% as “construction not complete” and 18.8% as “inadequate construction” does not cast doubt on their being properly regarded as defects.

Such an approach is in principle, only permissible where there is some reliable means of adjusting the claim to exclude any out of scope items, preferential engineering and commissioning costs, as well  as the separate SABIC projects such as the LAB/LER room.”  In my judgment, the submission provides its own answer because I am satisfied that the matters which PLL/SCL rely upon as rendering a topdown approach objectionable have been satisfactorily excluded and I have made relevant findings which exclude them on the basis of the evidence and submissions that have been made.  In particular, I have found on the evidence that (a) SABIC generally excluded out of scope items and, where it did not do so, allowance has been made in my findings under Items 1-19, (b) preferential engineering and commissioning costs have been excluded, and (c) separate SABIC projects have been excluded.

The basis of the allegation that SABIC has lost revenue is that there was an agreement between SABIC and SABIC BV pursuant to which SABIC BV was obliged to pay to SABIC a tolling fee, which was calculated as a multiple of the sum of purchased utilities, royalties, fixed costs and depreciation, with depreciation being the principal element.  The tolling fee provided a margin on SABIC’s costs of production.  In 2009 the multiplier under the tolling agreement, </p>

SABIC alleges that, but for SCL’s failure to construct the EVS correctly, it would have started the 20-year depreciation period for the LDPE plan 42 days earlier and would therefore have received “lost earnings” in the form of tolling fees for depreciation, fixed costs and margin on production during that period of 42 days at the expense of losing depreciation tolling fees for an equivalent period at the end of the 20-year period.  In respect of the general delay to EID which SABIC lays at SCL’s door, SABIC claims “lost earnings” in the form of tolling fees of the same descriptions for a period of  199 days.</p>

Although depreciation would in fact be calculated over a 20 year period, he had taken a lower than actual level of capital expenditure and then applied the actual depreciation charge that was applied in 2009/2010 (which had been calculated by reference to actual capital expenditure) and applied it until he had fully depreciated the assumed lower level of capital expenditure, which had the effect of depreciating the lower level of capital expenditure over 15 years, not 20.  A second ground of challenge by PLL/SCL was that he had adopted a discount rate of 10.74%, which Dr Burgess described as a rate set by SABIC Capital “as the standard discount factor to use for project evaluation” whereas SABIC was prepared to lend money on an intergroup basis for capital projects at under 6%.  Dr Burgess explained the difference as being a notional premium for risk but the basis for the actual figure adopted appeared tenuous.</p>

He gave evidence that SABIC used Purchaser Variation Notifications (PVNs) as a method of notifying SCL of SABIC’s intention to re-claim costs expended on behalf of SCL by SABIC in assisting SCL with the completion of the contract scope of works.  PVNs were then converted to Variation Orders by SABIC.  The claim is based on the work carried out adopting this system and covers a range of work from design to work in support of pre-commissioning on site.  Although initially SCL raised queries on the working of the system at the time, it did not question the principle that SABIC should be entitled to contra-charge for the work carried out in this way.  SCL later disputed costs relating to some of the PVNs after the work began and the costs began to be notified.  But Mr Naisbitt gave evidence that there had been an agreement between Mr Leggett and Mr Booth in July 2008 that resources would be deployed on behalf of SCL by SABIC and that SABIC would be reimbursed by SCL.  Mr Naisbitt was not cross-examined on this evidence and I accept it. </p>

What also emerges is that Clause 35.2.4.2 uses the same phrase as Clause 35.1 when describing the liabilities with which it is concerned, namely that it applies to liability “whether or not as a result of the Contractor’s negligence and whether in contract tort, or otherwise at law”.  This linking language is language typically associated with clauses referring to liabilities arising out of breaches of obligations, whether contractual or tortious. </p>

It is not obvious why that balance should be limited to 20% of the adjusted contract price and, if the purchaser had made advance payments to the contractor that meant that a balance of more than 20% would otherwise fall to be repaid, it may be thought commercially bizarre that full repayment should be prevented. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">Similar reasoning applies to Clause 30.9, although the function of clauses 30.1 and 30.9 differ, as noted above.  Clause 30.9 might be triggered as a result of termination justified by reference to a breach of contract, but it need not be. For example, clause 27.2.2 permits termination after any distress, execution or other legal process is levied upon the assets of the Contractor; clause 27.2.3 permits termination if the contractor enters into any arrangement or composition with its creditors; clause 27.2.4 permits termination if the contractor merely threatens to cease to carry on its business; and clause 27.2.5 permits termination if the financial position of the contractor deteriorates to such an extent that the capability of the contractor adequately to fulfil its obligations has been placed in jeopardy: none of these require actual breaches of contractual or tortious obligations by the contractor.  So the liabilities incurred by the contractor under Clause 30.9 need not include any liabilities deriving from a breach of contract or tort, though they may do so.  Rather, Clause 30.9 may be seen as an accounting exercise on termination which may or may not include sums that naturally fall within the ambit of Clause 35. </p>

The better interpretation is that clause 35.2 applies to liabilities incurred as a result of breaches of contractual or tortious obligations.  If and to the extent that they form constituent parts of the calculation under Clause 30.9, they may be limited; but that does not become a relevant issue on the facts of this case since the constituent parts of the Clause 30.9 calculation that might be affected by Clause 35.2 do not approach 20% of the adjusted Contract Price. </p>

Its complaint is pleaded on the basis that it “did not earn revenue that it would [otherwise] have earned” and that these losses were “lost earnings”.  In closing submissions SABIC attempted to deflect the obvious consequences of its earlier characterisation by submitting that the consequence of SCL’s breaches was that “SABIC did not begin production of LDPE until much later than the contractual EID.  As a consequence the date on which it began to receive payment for the manufacturing process was delayed.  The nature of the claim is delayed receipt rather than loss of production or profit.”  I am not persuaded.  It may be said that the payments calculated by reference to depreciation were not payments for loss of production, but they would have contributed to the sums that SABIC would otherwise have brought into account in calculating its profits; and they were payments pursuant to the tolling agreement, which Dr Burgess described as providing a margin on production.  Nor do I consider that it makes a difference to describe the claim as one in respect of delayed receipt: what is claimed is the lost revenue during the period of delay at the start of the plant’s productive life, while giving credit for the value of revenue that would be earned at the end of its life, discounted to present day values.

Although the APG referred to itself as an “on-demand” bond, each bond required SABIC’s confirmation on making the call that SCL was in breach of its obligations under the contract.  Neither stated that, in addition to confirmation of SCL’s breach of its obligations, there should have been loss suffered as a result of such breach; but this is a reflection of traditional bond drafting and did not of itself exclude the need for the breach of obligations to have caused loss to SABIC.  The stated purpose of the bonds differed.  The PB was stated by Clause 36.1 to be a bond “for the due performance by [SCL] of all of its obligations under [the Contract]”.  There was no similar contractual explanation of the APG, but its name, the circumstances in which it came to be required and provided, and the recording in the bond that SABIC had agreed to make the advance payment to SCL “upon the issue” to [SABIC] of a bond in a sum which was stated to be “an amount equivalent to the advance payment contemplated and subsequent payments” all point to it being security against the advance payment not being earned in due course. </p>

The issues for determination were (1) whether the defendant was entitled to make a call for the full amount of the performance bond, if the breach or breaches of contract (a) caused no loss to the defendant, (b) caused some loss to the defendant which was less than the amount of the performance bond, or (c) caused some loss to the defendant which was equal to or greater than the amount of the performance bond; and (2) whether in the event of the defendant having obtained payment under the performance bond as a result of any such call it was entitled to make the defendant was entitled to retain (a) all of the moneys received by it, (b) only such moneys as was equal to the amount of the loss suffered by it, or (c) some other and if so what amount.  In the course of an illuminating judgment Morison J looked to the commercial purpose of bonds, holding that such a bond was, effectively, as valuable as a promissory note and was intended to affect the “tempo” of parties’ obligations “in the sense that when an allegation of breach of contract is made (in good faith) the beneficiary can call the bond and receive its value pending the resolution of the contractual disputes.

Their commercial purpose was that, if a dispute arose, SABIC should have immediate access to the funds without having to await the outcome of proceedings determining the contractual rights and wrongs of the dispute.  So, although the certified breaches of obligation required some actual or potential loss to SABIC for the bonds to be called in good faith, proof of loss was not a prerequisite to a call on the bonds.  On the contrary, the commercial purpose went beyond merely guaranteeing or providing security for due performance, having much in common with other types of financial instrument, such as promissory notes, the dominant purpose of which is to provide ready access to substantial funds.  While Morison J referred to “accounting” at a later date and to the caller’s “true loss”, the fact remains that the calling of the bonds comes first and is intended to provide the beneficiary with an immediate buffer against financial outlay which he may incur.  The commercial purpose of the bonds and the call may be said to be putting SABIC in funds with which to meet the anticipated expenditure or, as Lord Denning MR put it “the bond is given so that, on notice of default being given, the buyer can have his money in hand to meet his claim for damages for the seller’s non-performance of contract.”  Technically, it is only if the potential claim for damages exceeded the value of the bond that a claim over (for the excess) would be brought by the beneficiary. </p>

In addition, in relation to the PB it points to the fact that Clause 36.2 provides for SABIC to have retained 10% of the Contract Price if SCL had failed to provide it in accordance with Clause 36.1.  The effect would therefore have been that, if SCL had not provided the PB and SABIC had terminated the Contract pursuant to Clause 27, the Contract Price when calculating the Termination Certificate would have been taken to be reduced by 10% for the purposes of Clause 30.1.4. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.01in">The first reason is based upon the terms of Clause 30.9, which requires the identification of “the total cost to [SABIC] reasonably incurred” and requires that cost to be compared with “the total that the Engineering Works would have cost had they been completed by the Contractor.”  When computing the cost that SABIC incurred, it seems unrealistic to ignore the fact that SABIC had the benefit of third-party funding from the proceeds of the bonds which reduced its outlay from its own resources (and therefore the cost it <span style="font-style:italic">incurred</span>) pound for pound.  Also, if the two sides of the Clause 30.9 equation are to be made as nearly as possible to be like for like, it is to be remembered that if SCL had completed the works then, although SABIC would not have received the bond monies, it would not have had to pay out as it did after termination for the works to be completed, because it had already paid the contract sum in advance.  Ignoring the receipt of the bond monies therefore renders the equation unbalanced; </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.01in">The second reason is based upon the nature of the guarantees provided by the bond, which was essentially the guarantee of performance by secondary means, or “see to it” guarantees.  Thus the payment of the bond monies was to be a form of proxy for primary performance by SCL.  It therefore seems counter-intuitive to assert that all of the expenditure on costs to complete the works was a “loss” without taking account of the fact that provision had been made in advance to obviate that loss; </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.01in">The third reason is temporal.  As usual, the bonds were called in advance of either working through the consequences of termination or of determining the contractual rights and wrongs of the dispute between the parties, in accordance with the commercial purpose of the bonds.  As a result, SABIC started with a fund which, in real terms and language, it hoped would prevent it from suffering a loss: hence it pointed to the need to be able to demonstrate “that it </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.00in">was spending SCL’s Bond monies wisely.”  To my mind, it is more realistic to regard what happened as being that SABIC exhausted the bond monies before itself incurring a loss rather than to characterise it as having incurred a loss with the bond monies only being recognised at a later date after calculating and fixing the loss; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.01in">The fourth reason that I accept SABIC’s submission is because it is appropriate to look at the consequences of competing interpretations<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="77">

	      </authorialNote>.  The consequence of PLL/SCL’s interpretation is that SABIC’s ability to recoup the consequences of termination from PLL/SCL was materially affected (to SABIC’s disadvantage) by whether or not an advance payment backed by an APG was made.  If no advance payment had been made (and no APG provided) and SABIC had incurred a loss (calculated in accordance with Clause 30.9) of £40 million, it would have recovered about £31 million, the balance of £9 million being excluded by the operation of the cap.  However, if exactly the same circumstances obtained but SABIC had made an advance payment (to SCL’s advantage) of £15 million (with an APG provided), SABIC would only recover £16 million (£31 million capped liability less £15 million APG monies).  This seems a perverse consequence of advance payment and one that requires clear words to be contractually justified. </p>
