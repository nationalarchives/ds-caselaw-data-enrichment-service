	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">This is a claim for damages for negligence and conspiracy to injure brought by the claimant, who from 2008 until early 2014 worked mainly in the Middle East region for entities among those grouped together under the global banner of “Ernst &amp; Young” (<span style="font-weight:bold">the EY network</span> or <span style="font-weight:bold">the EY organisation</span>). The claimant worked in the field of “climate change and sustainability services” (<span style="font-weight:bold">CCASS</span>).  The EY network entities provide accountancy and related services to businesses worldwide.  The defendants are United Kingdom (<span style="font-weight:bold">UK</span>) based limited companies and limited liability partnerships (<span style="font-weight:bold">LLPs</span>) within the EY network. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The claim, in briefest outline, arises from the claimant’s participation in 2013 in an “assurance” audit of a Dubai based precious metals dealer, Kaloti Jewellery International DMCC (<span style="font-weight:bold">Kaloti</span>).  Broadly, the purpose of such an audit is to provide an independent written view on the quality and propriety of the audit client’s business practices.  An assurance audit is not a financial audit but shares some of the characteristics of one.  The word “assurance” is used because the auditor’s written views are intended to assure a reader of the auditor’s assurance report that the audit client’s business practices, in the auditor’s independent view, are as stated in the report. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The claimant was initially the audit engagement partner acting on behalf of Ernst &amp; Young Middle East (Dubai Branch) (<span style="font-weight:bold">EY Dubai</span>).  His case is that early on in the audit of Kaloti in 2013, he became aware of the following serious irregularities, among others.  Kaloti was knowingly dealing in gold bullion smuggled out of Morocco coated in silver, to deceive the Moroccan authorities into believing that it was silver, thereby avoiding restrictions on the export of gold from Morocco.  The “silver” was then declared to be gold on arrival at Dubai (<span style="font-weight:bold">the Morocco gold issue</span>).  And, in 2012 Kaloti had taken part in cash transactions in gold involving about US $5.2 billion (<span style="font-weight:bold">the cash transactions issue</span>). </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">These facts gave rise to a reasonable suspicion that Kaloti was involved in money laundering, as the defendants accept.  Gold is a “conflict mineral” identified as such in certain international instruments, denoting a likelihood that it may be traded, especially when the trade is in cash, for the purpose of financing terrorist activity or organised crime.  The claimant’s case is that he informed the local regulatory body, a Dubai government body called the Dubai Metals and Commodities Centre (<span style="font-weight:bold">DMCC</span>) about the irregularities. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The claimant says the DMCC then, progressively, put improper pressure on the claimant and EY Dubai to do its reporting work in a way that would reduce to vanishing point the visibility of the Morocco gold and cash transactions issues, thereby misleading readers of relevant reporting documents into thinking that Kaloti’s business practices were essentially sound when, manifestly, they were not. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The claimant resisted this and, with the agreement and encouragement of his line manager, escalated the matter to representatives of the defendants at regional and global level. With the knowledge of his manager, he left Dubai with his family in mid-2013, not knowing if he would be able to return and fearing for his and his family’s safety if he were to challenge the position of Kaloti and the DMCC from within Dubai.  He and his family then lived temporarily in London and Sussex during the rest of 2013. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The claimant says his individual interlocutors, senior officers acting on behalf of all or at least some of the defendants, while professing to take his concerns seriously and engage with them, then made and developed proposals that amounted to acquiescence and collusion with the DMCC’s agenda of protecting Kaloti against adverse audit assurance findings and preventing them being made public. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The claimant protested that this behaviour was unethical and amounted to professional misconduct.  He argued that there was an obligation to report it immediately to the London Bullion Market Association (<span style="font-weight:bold">LBMA</span>), a UK based private company (without share capital) acting as an international trade association and unofficial non-governmental regulator intent on promoting high standards of business practice within the international gold trade. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The claimant says his concerns were dismissed.  He refused to sign assurance audit reports in the form proposed and was then replaced as audit partner by an accountant who, encouraged by global and regional leaders within the EY network, helped the DMCC and Kaloti to conceal the findings on the Morocco gold and cash transactions issues, sanitising the findings and improperly lending EY’s name to a flagrantly misleading assurance reporting process. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The claimant’s case is that he told his interlocutors that he feared to return to Dubai and asked to be relocated.  After initial optimism that his request for relocation would succeed, he was then told to return to his duties in Dubai.  He refused, citing safety concerns.  After exchanges involving lawyers in which he asked that the EY organisation should publicly disclose the audit findings, he approached a nongovernmental organisation and disclosed the gist of what he had learned, though not at that stage into the public domain. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">During further exchanges between lawyers, while the claimant was on sick leave and still in this country, he was told he would be dismissed if he did not meet representatives of EY network entities.  His lawyers warned that if the EY organisation did not itself disclose the findings and address his claims for compensation, he would disclose the wrongdoing he had encountered to mass media organisations, as a “whistleblower”.  He then resigned in January 2014 and did so. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In consequence, Kaloti’s practices became public knowledge.  Following a subsequent assurance audit by a different firm, Grant Thornton, Kaloti was “delisted” from the DMCC’s “good delivery” list, causing damage to its gold trading business.  Kaloti brought a criminal complaint in Dubai against EY Dubai.  It was not pursued by the local prosecutor.  The claimant and his family settled in Spain for a short time and then in the UK, his wife’s home country. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The claims are for economic loss only, mainly in the form of loss of earnings.  The claimant says his career within the EY network has been ruined and that he has found little work elsewhere.  He asserts that his employment prospects and earning capacity have been largely destroyed.  The defendants, he says, breached duties of care in respect of the conduct of the Kaloti audit and in respect of his legitimate concerns for his and his family’s safety. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The claimant argues that he had to dissociate himself from the unethical conduct in which the defendants sought to embroil him and acted reasonably in doing so.  He could not then safely return with his family to Dubai, where the defendants instructed him to go.  He further asserts that individuals acting on behalf of the defendants, or some of them, conspired to injure him by driving him out of the EY organisation by ordering him back to Dubai knowing he would not go. </p>

Mr Climent suggested to the claimant that EY could publish a “white paper” showcasing the DMCC’s efforts to scrutinise the gold trade in Dubai. </p>

It is not plausible that Mr D and the audit team would have falsely reported to Mr Otty that the irregularities found in March 2013 were mere assertion. </p>

Mr Andjelkovic opined that there was no legal difficulty about the LBMA application and it was open to EY Dubai to terminate the engagements because their scope had changed. </p>

This change of timing would help acquit him of insincerity in what he said to the claimant.  Second, he is unclear whether or if so when he talked to anyone in the UK about relocation of the claimant; in oral evidence he appeared to rely on a conversation with “our UK managing partner” but gave no details of it. </p>

Mr Labaude, I accept, urged the claimant to trust the leadership and agree to the proposed wording of the draft assurance report.  In one of the conversations, the claimant told Mr Labaude that if he persisted with his approach to the audits, the claimant would be unable to sign the reports.  I accept the claimant’s evidence that Mr Labaude indicated that if he refused to sign them, someone else would sign them and there would be “consequences” for his partnership and it would not be good for him. </p>

Mr Labaude’s position was that the EY organisation had gone far enough to accommodate the claimant’s concerns and it was now time for the claimant to cease his objections.  He continued to insist that there was no reporting obligation to the LBMA because EY Dubai was not on the list of LBMA approved auditors, a requirement the claimant regarded as irrelevant and unnecessary. </p>

I find that he wanted the claimant to believe he would help with job relocation if and when he fell into line with the rest of the EY organisation and ceased being out on a limb on the subject of the Kaloti audit. </p>

Mr Labaude declined, arguing that the claimant could have undisclosed reasons for his safety concerns.  As for the assurance audits, he said he trusted the assurances of Ms Golz and the global PPD team that they had been handled properly.

He did not think the DMCC or the Dubai government would concern itself with the claimant.

By way of example we referred to gold bars received from Morocco that were mixed with silver to the extent that the bars appeared to be silver but were actually scrap gold bars.  All of the documentation that accompanied such bars complied with the prevailing due diligence, supply chain and KYC requirements, and for the sake of clarity this means that the documents recorded accurately the actual amount of gold and silver contained in these bars.  The Ernst and Young staff then asked us to supply the export documentation from Morocco to support this kind of supply, and we advised them verbally, subsequently confirmed in writing, that we did not have these documents, making the point that our procedures at that time did not require us to have such documentation.  In response to questions from Ernst and Young our employee referred to market gossip that it was common practice to have unclear or deficient export documentation from Morocco.  These comments, given in English (second language) rather than the employees native Arabic was interpreted by the English speaking E &amp; Y staff as being confirmation that our management knew about this practice and somehow colluded in it.  This was not the case at all, and indeed it was [Kaloti] that gave stress to this problem in subsequent discussions with E &amp; Y.

This, he explained in oral evidence, was because of the contacts he had built up, his bilingual Arabic and English and his background in the Middle East.

In our review we did not see any documentary evidence of gold disguised as silver.  In fact all import documentation showed the imports to be gold.  The reason for our team to suspect that this occurred is that a member of staff from [Kaloti] said he believed that some of the gold from morocco was likely to have been disguised as silver.

The team were satisfied on all counts except for Kaloti’s response to concerns about cash handling.  Mr Otty said the team had identified that arranging a bank to pay cash to Kaloti’s customers did not suffice and that Kaloti “then took action to ensure that all clients were payed [sic] through a bank transfer to their own account”, from November 2013, and that the team had verified 15 days of that process operating; hence the final report says the issue was “fully remediated from November 2013”. </p>

The obligation to provide a safe place of work and a safe system of work is one example.  The duty to exercise reasonable skill and care when providing services or advice is another.

I have already mentioned the example of the solicitor instructing a subordinate to bury a disclosable document or a barrister instructing a junior to mislead the court.  A doctor instructing a more junior doctor to falsify medical notes is another obvious example. </p>

The submission is, rather, that compliance with the DMCC’s review protocol was sufficient to ensure that the conduct of the Kaloti audit was acceptable and not wrongful. </p>

For EY entities, on the evidence of Ms Adamson’s emails in February 2013 it was evidently good enough to demonstrate the requisite ethical conduct, competence and expertise that they were one of the “big four”.  In similar vein, Ms Crowell presented on 22 February that “[a]ny independent, certified auditors are eligible to conduct the LBMA audit, provided they have the required credentials.” </p>

I regard this part of the claim as not possible for the claimant to prove because it involves speculation about what EY MENA’s regulations will provide for as at 2035 when the claimant reaches retiring age. </p>
