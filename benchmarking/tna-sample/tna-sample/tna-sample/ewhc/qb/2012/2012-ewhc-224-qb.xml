	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At the start of October 2009 the seven, individual Defendants were all employed by Edward Jones Limited. The Company’s business was the provision of financial advice to investors, for which authorisation was given by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) in December 2001.  The job title in their contracts of employment was “investment representative”. The Defendants state that they were working as financial advisers and stockbrokers.  They were all based in different offices situated throughout the UK.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.51in">The American parent company, Edward D Jones, decided to sell Edward Jones Ltd to Towry Law Finance Co. Ltd, one of the companies in the Towry Law Group.  The acquisition, in the form of a share sale, was agreed on 22 October 2009 and completed, following FSA approval, on 12 November 2009.  Edward Jones Ltd subsequently changed its name to Towry EJ Ltd, the Claimant in this case (hereafter referred to as Towry).</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.51in">News of the acquisition was not greeted with universal enthusiasm.  To many   employees it came as a shock.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.51in">Each of these Defendants joined the corporate Defendant, Raymond James Investment Services Ltd, where they now work.

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.51in">Those transfer requests, and the consequent loss of investment business for Towry, have led to this litigation. Towry’s case, in summary, is that the individual Defendants, with the assistance and encouragement of Raymond James, persuaded many of the clients, whom they had formally advised, to transfer their investments to Raymond James.  It is alleged that this conduct amounted, in the case of the individual Defendants, to breaches of their contractual post-termination restrictions, operative for a period of 12 months, prohibiting both the soliciting of clients, in competition with the business of Towry, and the misuse of Towry’s confidential information.  Raymond James’ involvement in the matter is said to be such that the company is liable for procuring or inducing the breach of contract by the individual Defendants, and for conspiracy.  It is alleged that there were unlawful means conspiracies between Raymond James and each of the individual Defendants, using the unlawful means of breach of contract and breach of confidence.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.51in">Towry claims thereby to have suffered loss, which is to be measured either by reference to loss of the value represented by those clients who were unlawfully solicited to transfer their business and investments, or on the basis of loss of a realistic and substantial chance that the clients would have been retained, but for the Defendants’ unlawful conduct.  Alternatively, Towry seeks an account of profits made by the Defendants.  The total loss suffered is said to be almost £6 million.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.51in">The Defendants deny all these allegations, which they contend are being advanced by a rival organisation with a reputation in the industry as an aggressive litigator, and who is pursuing in this case a grossly inflated claim for damages on the basis of serious but wholly unsustainable allegations.  In summary, Raymond James state that they proceeded cautiously at all times, being well aware of the contractual restrictions and of Towry’s reputation, obtaining legal advice and taking considerable care in respect of both the recruitment of individual, Edward Jones’ advisers and their compliance with the relevant restrictive covenants.  The transfer of assets by such large numbers of clients is indicative of the significant disconnect between the business models of Towry and Edward Jones and the similarity of the models offered by Edward Jones and Raymond James, which enabled both advisers and clients to continue to operate in the way they wished. </p>

Further, Towry’s treatment of the Defendants, after the acquisition, is said to constitute a clear breach of the implied duty of trust and confidence owed to them by their employer, amounting to a repudiatory breach of contract, which they accepted.  The Defendants therefore contend that this claim should be dismissed in its entirety.  </p>

Towry said that they complied fully with their disclosure obligations, but that the Defendants sought repeatedly to widen the scope of allegations said to be relevant to the issues to be determined.

I add the following observations in relation to my approach to the evidence in this case.  First, in view of the exceptionally detailed factual analysis undertaken in closing submissions, in particular by counsel for Towry, I emphasise that I shall not be referring to all the evidence to which counsel have referred.  I concentrate on those facts which I consider are relevant to the issues to be determined.  They are inevitably of some length.  Omission of a particular piece of evidence does not mean, however, that I have not taken it into account.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.51in">Secondly, this being a case which, so far as Towry’s case against the Defendants is concerned, is based entirely upon the inferences it is submitted should be drawn from the facts, Mr Tolley invited me to undertake an “appropriately intensive forensic approach to the evidence”.  I have done so, considering each Defendant’s case separately.  In this respect I agree with Mr Tolley that contemporaneous written documentation is important in assessing credibility.  Much of his cross-examination of the Defendants was based upon the contents of contemporaneous documentation, upon which Towry place considerable reliance, and which is said to demonstrate that all the individual Defendants were in clear breach of their restrictive covenants, that Raymond James induced that breach and that there were unlawful means conspiracies.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.51in">However, the oral evidence of the Defendants, both in general and in relation to the documents explored with them in the course of lengthy and probing cross-examination, is clearly relevant in deciding whether the interpretation placed upon the documents by Towry is sustainable.  There is much evidence contained in the Defendants’ witness statements, adopted as their evidence in chief, which was not the subject of challenge at trial and which is clearly relevant to a proper determination of the issues.  I also had the advantage in this case of hearing oral evidence, thoroughly tested in cross-examination, from a number of the former clients of Edward Jones.  The facts I find therefore follow a review of all the evidence in this case, both oral and documentary.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.51in">Thirdly, the extent of the factual dispute in this case has resulted in allegations on both sides being expressed in robust language.  Mr Tolley complained about the numerous and “extravagant” allegations of dishonesty and impropriety by Towry senior managers contained in the written closing submissions presented on behalf of the Defendants.  Mr Quinn complained about inappropriate and wholly unjustified allegations levelled against the Defendants, who are said to have deliberately concocted allegations of repudiatory breach and to have manufactured contrived defences; and also against the clients who gave evidence, in referring to them as “partisan”, and therefore as effectively telling untruths in order to stand by their trusted advisers.  Such allegations are indicative of the strength of feeling on both sides in this case, which was clear to see during the trial.  However, the Court is well able to withstand florid language and robustly expressed submissions of counsel in assessing all the evidence dispassionately and in adopting the intensive, forensic approach that this case requires.          </p>

The report described the Company’s “unusual approach to selling stocks and shares”, with each office housing “a single investment adviser, usually backed up by an administration assistant”.  The tagline of Edward Jones in America is “Bringing Wall Street to the Mainstreet”.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.51in">The encouragement Edward Jones gave to their financial advisers, to become as much a part of the local community as possible, was explained by the view that, “… if you have to meet your customers at church or sports you are going to think twice about what advice you give them”.  The focus for the future was said to be on “selling stocks and shares” with its financial advisers being “registered with the Securities and Futures Authority, the requirement for stockbrokers, and authorised practice as IFAs”.  A number of business cards of the individual Defendants and other former Edward Jones advisers, printed and distributed centrally by their former employer, described each of them as a financial adviser and stockbroker.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.51in">The Edward Jones model, succinctly described in this newspaper article, has been and remains very successful in America.  Between 1999 and 2009 the model was implemented in the UK.  By the time of the acquisition in October 2009 Edward Jones had approximately 317 offices in 240 cities and towns throughout the UK.  The advisers employed there enjoyed a large degree of autonomy as to how they managed their work, including the freedom to choose the hours they worked and when to take holidays.</p>

Clause 4, dealing with remuneration, entitled them to a remuneration package consisting of a salary, commission, or bonus, or a combination, as set out in Appendix A3.  The package showed a low and gradually diminishing salary over the 12 months following their graduation or qualification, and an entitlement to earn commission on transactions, at the rates published from time to time on the Company’s intranet.  There was additional provision for payment of new account bonuses and milestone bonuses in accordance with the relevant performance criteria, again as detailed on the intranet.  Remuneration levels for successful advisers were high.  </p>

Personal contact was important to him and to them and he attributed much of his success to the fact that he was a visible presence in the area and was able to develop close relationships.

After 20 years as an army officer he had worked in the financial services industry from 1993.  Working on a self employed basis he had spent the next twelve years building his own business with Allied Dunbar in his local community in Devon, where he lived with his family.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.51in">In 2005 he sold his business, by which time he had between 300 and 400 clients and enjoyed high earnings.  He joined Edward Jones because he wanted to focus more on investments, enhance his investment proposition and act as a stockbroker in the local community.  He too had spoken to a number of Edward Jones advisers in the south west and had received positive feedback about the company and the work.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.51in">Mr Bennett joined Edward Jones as an experienced financial adviser, but he was responsible for building his own business in the Tavistock area where he lived.  Initially he worked from home, moving to a transitional office in Tavistock after four months.  By mid-2008 he was on track to move to a permanent office in Tavistock High Street.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.51in">Whilst Edward Jones provided all the office support, administration back up and equipment, they were “hands off” so far as work with the clients was concerned.  With Mr Bennett’s background this way of working was particularly attractive to him.  The culture was that “I was building my business branded as Edward Jones in my local community”.  The whole ethos was client centric, with bespoke advice and presence in the locality.  He was totally responsible for marketing and for gaining new clients. </p>

A number of them were elderly.  </p>

Clients could develop a relationship with him personally and he valued this and the way in which Edward Jones operated on a “self-management” basis.  He understood that, right from the outset, he would be accountable for his results and responsible for his performance. It was a wholly commission-paid environment that required business acumen and planning.  He was able to offer, and did offer whole of market advice.</p>

He was a member of various business and social groups and he had a fairly high profile in the area. The vast majority of his clients lived locally. When he commenced employment he would knock on doors, introducing himself and his work.  Clients regularly called in at the office to see him with a query or a proposal and face-to-face or telephone contact was a constant feature of his work.  His clients were individuals, rather than businesses, and many of them had almost all their savings invested with Edward Jones under his service.  He developed strong personal relationships with them and would see them or their families regularly around the town.  </p>

She then worked for the Civil Service for four years before moving to Barclays Bank as a personal banker.  She became interested in the role of financial adviser and discovered the Edward Jones proposition on the internet.  She was attracted by the opportunity to be based in the local community, to be whole of market and to be trained in stockbroking.  After researching the role she successfully applied for a job.  </p>

She subscribed to the local Chamber of Trade and became its secretary, involving herself in local village activities and social events.  She developed close links with the Chamber in Longridge, where Wayne Hayhurst worked.  As a result of her success in securing clients she opened a temporary office in Whalley in January 2009, whilst looking for permanent premises.  The office was a short walk from her house.</p>

Many clients liked individual corporate bonds.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.51in">Nicholas Anderson, Head of Risk and Compliance at Towry, pointed out that the term “stockbroker” in fact has no regulatory meaning and that there is no such thing as a “stockbroker licence” from an FSA perspective.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.51in">The term “stockbroker” is nevertheless, as Mr Anderson acknowledged, a well understood and well recognised name used to describe someone who is involved in the buying or selling of shares for clients, their ability to do so being set by their FSA permissions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.51in">On the evidence before me I am satisfied that each individual Defendant was able to and did, in fact, advise clients, on behalf of Edward Jones, on the buying and selling of individual equities from extensive, approved Edward Jones advisory lists; that there has never been any suggestion that any Defendant was acting outside his or her FSA authorisations; and that Edward Jones was authorised by the FSA to advise on the buying and selling of equities and the Defendants were able to act as they did as a result of that authorisation.  Clearly, Edward Jones sought actively to recruit people to be stockbrokers and financial advisers, trained them in that role and authorised them so to describe themselves.  Sally Burn Jones, now a Towry wealth adviser in the Exeter office, said that she had enjoyed being a stockbroker, stating “I felt it was my USP”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.51in">I therefore found the evidence on this point from Andrew Fisher, CEO for the Towry Group, to be unnecessarily intransigent. His insistence in cross-examination, for example, that “no client of Edward Jones ever conducted stockbroking activities with advisers from Edward Jones”; that “they didn’t have business cards describing themselves as stockbrokers”; and that “I, at no point thought that they were doing stockbroking … I don’t think, for one moment, that the Company felt, at any time, that they were in the business of stockbroking” failed to recognise the reality of the work these Defendants were doing, and were being authorised and encouraged to do by their former employer.  It appeared to be designed to denigrate the Defendants’ work and I found it unhelpful.  </p>

The parent company had enabled Edward Jones in the UK to survive, by contributing regular monthly payments, but their business model had not generated a profit. Without fundamental and, to the parent company, unpalatable changes it could not continue to function in the UK.</p>

The FSA had been conducting a Retail Distribution Review (RDR) since June 2006 and, by October 2009, had begun to implement the recommendations arising from that Review.  The new rules, which are to be in place by the end of 2012, are designed to bolster consumer confidence and improve the level of expertise in the industry.  To this end, all financial advisers in the UK will be required to have a Level 4 Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation Diploma. Further, the FSA proposes, amongst other things, to,</p>

Mr Fisher’s firmly held view has always been that financial advice should be charged for on a fee basis rather than a commission basis, in order to ensure that the advice given to clients is genuinely independent and in their best interests, and that it is not affected by the level of commission available from product providers.  </p>

Of Towry’s total workforce therefore (approximately 750 employees), less than 250 are front-line advisers.  The Towry business model operates on the basis that their front-line advisers have access to substantial back-line and specialist assistance in financial market research, rather than conducting their own researches and associated activities. Wealth advisers therefore go for assistance on investments to Towry employees working in the investment management team, the advice policy team and in the product, marketing and compliance teams. Towry wealth advisers to do not manage the client’s individual discretionary portfolios. Their primary responsibility, as described by David Middleton, Head of Client Proposition at Towry, is to “manage the client relationship”.  </p>

The Defendants strongly disagree with that assessment and opinion.   Fortunately, it is no part of my task to decide which model offers the best service to clients.  There is no evidence before me, in any event, showing that any client of the Defendants was in any way disadvantaged by the service being provided for them at Edward Jones, or that any client would have been better off with Towry.  It is sufficient, for the purposes of this case, to record the fact that the Edward Jones model and the Towry model were very different; and that there are strongly held views on both sides as to which offered the optimal service to clients.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Essentially, the way in which the Towry model works is that the initial meeting with a client is free. Subsequently, if the client wished to obtain Towry’s services, he/she would be required to sign a fee agreement.  Thereafter, all work would be charged for on an appropriate hourly basis.  Before undertaking any work the adviser would provide a “scope of work” note setting out what it was that the client wanted, the work that was going to be done and how much it would cost.  The work would then be done and the client billed.  Towry would be paid for time spent in the provision of advice irrespective of the particular outcome.  The Towry wealth advice services are targeted at relatively affluent clients, defined as those with investible assets in excess of £100,000.00.  </p>

Mr Middleton and the other senior managers at Towry, in particular Mr Fisher, are firm believers in the merits of the IIM and in the weaknesses of the “key offering” by Edward Jones, described by Mr Middleton in disparaging terms as a “transactional service offered by predominantly non-salaried advisers … with little or no investment expertise”.  </p>

Further, some of the media coverage concerning the claimed benefits of Towry’s core proposition was critical of it in a number of respects.  I accept that other coverage expressed a contrary view, but some of the reports in evidence before me, from reputable journalists with relevant expertise, were less than complimentary.  In addition, for example, to concerns raised by Janet Walford, editor of the specialist monthly publication, Money Matters, a report in The Times Online for 16 January 2010 raised a number of questions concerning discretionary investment schemes in general; their impact on choice and whole of market access; and the difficulties in obtaining performance data. Towry was criticised for encouraging its advisers to recommend its in-house investment scheme (the IIM).  </p>

There is doubtless a debate to be had on the advantages and disadvantages of discretionary investment management, as compared with the advisory service carried out at Edward Jones, but here is not the place to rehearse it.  The important fact, as it seems to me, is that while both companies were providers of financial advice and services, the Towry proposition was very different from that offered by Edward Jones; and that reasoned criticisms of the Towry proposition were in the public arena.  </p>

The minutes of the Towry Executive Committee (ExCo) meeting for 16 September 2009 include a reference to Mr Fisher’s description of the Edward Jones advisers as appearing to be “highly ethical, motivated, well-trained and already operating in accordance with many of Towry Law’s values”.  Further, as I have already indicated, there is no evidence before me that any individual client of any of these Defendants would in fact have been better off with their funds invested in the IIM, rather than using the advisory and stockbroking services offered by the advisers at Edward Jones.</p>

The Project Brief, approved at the ExCo meeting on 21 October, confirmed the assumption that there would be a “Client by Client Migration of all [Edward Jones] Investment Holdings (£1.3 BN) to IIM” to be completed by the end of Phase 2, namely 30 April 2010.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Whilst acknowledging that the IIM might not be suitable for everyone, and that no-one would be required to migrate to the IIM the assets of those clients for whom it would be unsuitable, it is clear on the evidence from Towry’s senior managers that total migration of assets was a key objective for Towry, both at the time of the acquisition and in the months that followed.  The training programme for all the Edward Jones’ advisers was devised so as to be in two stages, with training on migration of assets to the IIM as the first, priority stage, to be carried out in December 2009, and more general training on the Towry model not to be provided until the summer of 2010.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The first issue to be determined in this case is whether, as the Defendants allege, the termination of their contracts of employment was due to repudiatory breach by Towry, in relation both to the fundamental changes sought to be imposed upon them and the way in which Towry proceeded in this respect.  Towry’s conduct is said to be such as to amount, in each case, to a breach of the implied term of trust and confidence and thereby to constitute a repudiatory breach of contract.  It is therefore necessary to set out in some detail the events that followed Towry’s acquisition of Edward Jones on 22 October 2009, so far as they are relevant to this issue.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As soon as the acquisition was agreed in October, Mr Fisher stated that Towry had to take action swiftly for three reasons: to start reducing the “massive and crippling” cost base; to ensure that Towry “secured the best employees”; and to ensure that Towry “provided reassurance” to the clients.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">To those ends the action taken included the following.  The starting point, as Mr Fisher described it, was to get rid of a large number of the Edward Jones’ offices. The offices were therefore closed in phases, commencing immediately, with the understanding that each adviser who took up the offer of alternative employment as a Towry wealth adviser would either be allocated an interim office, or remain at their existing office until their base was moved to a permanent office elsewhere.  It was envisaged that the advisers would be relocated to a permanent Towry office within six months from the start of their new contract and, therefore, by approximately May 2010.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, Towry immediately embarked upon what Paul Wright described as an enormous communications drive, in order to engage with the Edward Jones’ employees and to seek to persuade those who met the Towry criteria to stay. The starting point was that on 23 October, on the same day as a press release was issued about the acquisition, two letters were sent to all Edward Jones’ advisers and posted on the intranet (JonesLink), firstly from Tim Kirley (Principal of Edward Jones) and Jim Weddle (Managing Partner) and, secondly, from Mr Fisher himself.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Wright stated that those advisers who had a monthly sales rate of £90,000.00 or above in new investments per selling month, or who had more than £3 million total assets under advice, automatically met the Towry criteria for retention and qualified to be offered a new contract.  These were the “group 1” or “top tier” advisers.  There was then a further pool of less experienced or less qualified advisers, who would need to be interviewed and assessed before a decision could be taken whether or not to offer a contract to any of them.  </p>

Pending regulatory approval the purchaser does not legally own the business and there is therefore inevitably a period of uncertainty and difficulty for employees.  Additional time pressure existed because, in the usual way and as Towry were well aware, competitors and recruitment agencies would be “looking to pick off the best people”, as Mr Wright succinctly expressed it.  Mr Fisher’s description of rival organisations “circling, trying to poach our employees” made the same point.  Notwithstanding this obvious concern, it is nevertheless accepted by Towry that, in the financial services sector, as indeed in other sectors, employees are free to decide where, with whom and upon what terms they wish to carry out their work. </p>

He was approached by a large number of financial adviser firms and recruitment agencies, including Raymond James, with whom Mr Goodship had a meeting on 4 November 2009, before eventually deciding to accept Towry’s offer.  </p>

I shall deal with Towry’s engagement with the Edward Jones’ clients post acquisition later on in this judgment.  At this point it is important to record that, in his letter, Tim Kirley informed clients, amongst other things, (a) that once the acquisition was complete following FSA approval “your financial adviser and branch office administrator will become part of Towry Law and your client accounts will be served by them” and (b) that following completion “we believe that nothing will change.  Your adviser will continue to advise you and your assets will continue to be looked after as they are now.  It is very much business as usual”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Following the acquisition Mrs Rickard stated that the ExCo took on the enormous task of assessing the respective abilities and performance records of all the Edwards Jones’ advisers, which included discussions with senior members of Edward Jones with a view to identifying the “most talented” advisers. The initial phase, discussing the merits and formulating the qualification criteria, took place over approximately three weeks.  Financial performance indicators were identified using the “Financial Advice Performance Summary” in respect of each adviser.  The criteria then had to be applied and the “top” advisers selected.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The key criteria for selection were those described by Paul Wright, referred to above.  As David Middleton and Andrew Cowan confirmed, Towry regarded the most talented or the highest performing advisers as those who had either a total AUA figure of £3 million or more, or a monthly sales rate of £90,000 or more in new investments.  Those who were identified as the top performers numbered 234 (this number appears elsewhere as 227, but I accept Mrs Rickard’s evidence that the number was 234) and they were known as the group 1 advisers.  All the individual Defendants, save Tracey Simpson, were in this group.  They were therefore advisers who were regarded as qualifying automatically for offers of new contracts of employment with Towry. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There were many other advisers, including Tracey Simpson, who were in group 2 or in other groups below that, whose future employment position was contingent upon the outcome of the first set of offers to the group 1 advisers.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A programme of presentations and meetings began, with attendance at such events in the different regions being divided up amongst members of ExCo, the aim of which was to try and secure the group 1 advisers’ renewed employment with Towry as wealth advisers.  There were regular meetings of the Integration Project Team, which included ExCo members and senior Edward Jones’ advisers, to discuss how each member of the team was progressing with their allocated list of group 1 advisers.  At the same time, work was being done to put together the employment “package” that Towry considered could, financially, and should, strategically, be offered to those advisers they wished to retain.  The presentations, to large groups of advisers at various Towry regional centres, were designed to cover an overview of the wealth management advice marketplace and the necessity to move away from commission to a fee-based model; a critique of the Edward Jones’ investment management advisory proposition and why Towry’s discretionary proposition was superior; and the nature of Towry’s employment proposition to the advisers. </p>

The intention was for financial advisers to be offered, in addition, one-to-one meetings with other members of management if they wished to have them. There were also a number of more informal group meetings held at local Edward Jones’ offices, attended by representatives of Towry and Edward Jones’ management, who would try to answer advisers’ questions.  </p>

James Chandler, on discovering in September 2009 that KPMG were “in the building”, had expressed concerns at that point and had been contacted personally by Brian Donaldson, a General Partner at Edward Jones, and told how well both he and Edward Jones were doing. Just two weeks before the acquisition was announced, during a business update conference call, Tim Kirley said that KPMG had been advising the Company on profitability and on how to take the business to the next level. A number of Defendants considered that they had been deliberately misled.  Barry Bennett spoke of “betrayal”. </p>

Jason Cherriman had been employed as their Business Development Consultant since January 2009.  His role was to recruit financial advisers, investment managers and stockbrokers who were suitable to work with Raymond James as independent branch principals.  Generally he did this by directly approaching such advisers through “cold-calling”, attending networking events or using various websites. Sometimes there were recommendations or referrals. His aim was to make initial contact with potential candidates and to “get them through the door” so that Raymond James could assess them.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Raymond James business model is very similar to that of Edward Jones, save that the financial advisers are not employees.  In summary, the main way in which a financial adviser works with the company is through their independent contracting model.  Financial advisers and investment managers are able to manage clients’ funds through authorisation via the FSA, if certain strict criteria are met.  Through their affiliation with Raymond James those who join essentially run their own businesses, but with the necessary resources to do so, including front office and IT systems, provided by Raymond James.  The main difference is therefore that those recruited are self-employed, working under a contract for services. They run their own profit and loss and are in complete control of their own earnings. The candidates Mr Cherriman seeks to recruit as branch principals, working in locations throughout the UK, are those who demonstrate entrepreneurial skills and a desire to run their own business, and who Raymond James considers are likely to be successful.  </p>

He considered, correctly, that there were likely to be many unsettled employees. He immediately contacted six or seven Edward Jones’ advisers (none of the Defendants) to see whether there was any interest in Raymond James and he booked meetings with them.

Generally, when Edward Jones’ employees telephoned Raymond James, they spoke either to Mr Cherriman or to David Hazelton, Head of the Business Development Team, or Tamsin Potter, his PA. Following these calls an introductory email would be sent to the employees and, if it looked as if she/he was a potential candidate, a meeting was organised.  </p>

He also referred to them as demonstrating a complete lack of understanding.  I find that Mr Fisher’s high degree of self confidence and, on his own admission, his passionate belief in the superiority of the Towry business model and his zealous approach to bringing the advisers across, failed to reap the benefits he hoped for.

Mr Fisher also told the advisers that there was no money to be made in stockbroking; that there had not been any money to be made in stockbroking for twenty years; that stockbroking was not a service which was going to be offered by Towry; that the Edward Jones’ model was broken and unprofitable; and that individual shares were never appropriate for clients’ portfolios.  In advocating the Towry core proposition (the IIM) he conveyed the message that the Towry way was the only way, that the FSA considered Towry’s business to be the best, and that everyone else in the industry was not up to the task.  </p>

No doubt this was due to the fact that the deal was still subject to FSA approval, but the uncertainty created added to the concerns.  In addition, whilst many of those present were asking for more details about the IIM, such details were not forthcoming.  The line being taken was that all would be explained at the two-day training course fixed to take place in December 2009, which would be after the advisers had signed their new contracts of employment.  In that respect Mr Fisher informed the group that Towry would be looking to take on no more than 200-300 advisers.  He referred to advisers as preferring to work in teams and to a collective office environment and to Towry having only ten offices.  </p>

Many of them were produced in evidence and they were almost entirely negative in tone and content.  It is not suggested that any of these blogs was posted by any of the Defendants, but the blogs were undoubtedly fuelling the flames already lit by the nature and style of Mr Fisher’s presentations.  They were also providing material that formed the subject of questions at the presentations.  When asked at the Batley meeting why Towry had lost advisers after previous acquisitions Mr Fisher responded that it was because the advisers could not pass exams. When he was asked why no Towry advisers had had a pay rise in two years, he replied that it was because of the state of the economy. To those Edward Jones’ advisers who, despite the state of the economy, had nevertheless been receiving an increase in their individual earnings, the responses from Mr Fisher suggested that both a loss of income and a loss of autonomy were on the horizon.  </p>

Another aspect of Mr Fisher’s remarks that caused concern at the various presentations was his reference to the many firms who, as Towry were aware, were now trying to recruit Edward Jones’ advisers. He warned them, for example, of “the odious St James’ Place” and referred to “commission hungry advisers” who were not qualified to make investment decisions. He spoke in stark terms of the debts the advisers would incur if they went to work for those organisations and of the possibility that they would lose their home.

The evidence shows that other organisations, apart from Raymond James, were also in communication with the Defendants. Such communications were anticipated, and were acknowledged by Towry as one of the consequences of an acquisition of this kind.  I shall deal in more detail with the contact between Raymond James and the individual Defendants when I deal with Towry’s allegations of wrongful conduct, but I have had regard to all of this evidence in arriving at these conclusions, and it is important to understand the context in which this contact was being made. </p>

Statements about Towry’s success and profitability were repeated, their key aim being said to be an IPO in 18 months to three years, and they were on track to achieve this.  Further, whilst it was clear that local offices would close, there were at this stage no details provided as to the precise role of a Towry adviser, or as to where they would be working, their salaries or their targets.  </p>

Although the meeting on 4 November was meant to provide further information about Towry’s proposition and the remuneration package, he stated that he came away from it with more questions than he had when he arrived.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On hearing, at the 4 November meeting, how Towry’s contracts would be structured and remuneration calculated, James Chandler’s swift calculation of what he then understood he would receive produced, in his mind, a significant step backwards.  After several years of pay rises, this was unattractive. This information, now combined with confirmation that most of the local offices would be closing, that they would be relocated to regional offices and that targets would be set for moving funds to the IIM, all combined to increase his concerns as to employment with Towry.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At this meeting Brian Innes of the Inverness/Aberdeen branch was asked by an Edward Jones’ adviser how much of the £75 million he had under management was in the IIM.  His response “all of it” resulted in a general gasp of astonishment around the room. Despite Andy Cowan’s explanation that there was no pressure to put all of their clients’ funds into the IIM, and that this particular adviser had funds under management which were not in fact within the IIM, the impression that the advisers were expected to move all the funds had been created.  The migration of all the clients’ assets into the IIM was, in any event, the “reasonable project assumption” of Towry’s senior management.   </p>

The Towry advisers who spoke at the meeting described in terms how they were managed, how they were paid for their time and how they had to account for their movements.  Further, they explained that they did not themselves become involved in the investment side, but that there were four to five risk profiles for clients and that clients were fitted into one of them according to their profile.</p>

He clearly had concerns about the different world in which the Towry advisers worked and as to the likely changes for him in terms of culture and ethos.  He was also in touch with other organisations, along with many other Edward Jones’ advisers.  However, I accept his evidence that throughout this process he retained an open mind. As he expressed it, his concerns did not mean that he thought what Towry was offering was not any good.  Rather, his concern was that he would no longer have the freedom to make his own choices and to develop strong relationships with clients.  He did accept an invitation to the meeting in Exeter on 25 November, when the individual contracts on offer were given to the advisers to consider.  </p>

Tim Niemann spoke to both of them and referred to the fact that there would be many companies chasing experienced people like them.

At the leadership meeting he attended in Alan Stone’s office in Exeter on 19 November, there was still much disquiet among the Edward Jones’ advisers. There were still unanswered questions concerning the terms of any contract to be offered, the apparent lack of independence for them in the new Towry world and the movement of funds to the IIM.  It was now clear that it would not be business as usual, as they had initially been led to believe.  Details confirming the asserted superiority of the IIM were not forthcoming.  </p>

He asked those attending to do the same, given that Towry was effectively taking a leap of faith with all of them.  This suggestion did not reassure Mr Bennett as to his future, but he too, as I find, wanted to see the Towry offer in detail before he made a final decision.

At that presentation, whilst there was still great emphasis on the benefits of the Towry investment proposition, Mr Burger remained concerned by the refusal to provide any details of past performance.  Mr Cowan spoke about the charges to clients and review arrangements but, when pressed on the underlying fund charges, such as the fund providers’ management costs, there was no elaboration.  The exchanges between them clearly became heated.  Mr Cowan was critical of the fact that the Edward Jones’ SIPP charged trustee fees, stating that the Towry SIPP had no charges.  Mr Burger challenged this, emphatically, at which point Mr Cowan became agitated.  Mr Burger described Mr Cowan as jumping out of his seat at this point and shouting words to the effect that he did not know what he was talking about.  </p>

I find that voices were probably raised on both sides, by Mr Burger because he considered that the information being given was inadequate and inaccurate, and by Mr Cowan because the workload by this point had been immense and there had been a succession of challenging and difficult meetings.  In any event, the effect of this outburst was that few other questions were asked at this meeting.  Mr Burger was left with the clear impression that this was a company in which questions were discouraged and where advisers were expected to do as they were told.  He now regarded it as less likely that he would stay with Towry, yet he too decided to wait and see the detailed offer from them before making a final decision.  </p>

This came on 12 November, following which Andrew Fisher posted a letter on the Towry portal to all Edward Jones’ employees informing them that the deal had been completed.  In the short-term the advisers were asked to direct any questions to their regional leaders and to use the Ask Andrew facility on the intranet for any additional information.  </p>

Following FSA approval, a committee of twenty Edward Jones’ employees (eight advisers, eight BOAs and four senior staff from Head Office) was appointed.</p>

By the meeting of ExCo on 18 November, as the minutes confirm, the 234 group 1 advisers, which it was proposed would be confirmed into role, had by then already been identified by reference to the criteria provisionally selected by Towry, and had been split into seven regions.  Further, the terms and conditions of employment to be offered by Towry had all been worked out and were to be the subject of one-to-one meetings with the advisers on 25 November.  </p>

It is apparent from Alex Rickard’s report to the meeting that the new EJCC appointees would, in fact, only be receiving appropriate training on their role as EJCC members on the morning of 20 November, the date set for their first meeting.  Immediately after being trained they were then to be asked to approve a “measures letter”, setting out Towry’s plans for the next two months and, in particular, the selection criteria for advisers.  Once the criteria were approved by the EJCC they would then be formally applied. The group 1 advisers identified would then be invited to attend one-to-one interviews on 25 November, when each adviser would be handed a personalised pack including the terms and conditions of the contract of employment on offer.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The measures letter, so far as it related to the redundancy selection, referred to the selection criteria for the group 1 advisers and stated: (1) that any adviser who met the criteria would be confirmed into a suitable alternative role as a Towry wealth adviser; (2) that the adviser would be given seven days to accept the new terms and conditions; and (3) that, if acceptance was not received within that time-scale, it would be treated as a refusal of suitable alternative employment, at which point Towry would deregister the adviser.  </p>

Questions about office closures and IIM performance had been asked but not answered in detail.

Further, Mr Cowan said that Towry would not change their contracts so as to prevent only solicitation.  In the event, although he recognised that Clause 16.4 of the Edward Jones’ contract and Appendix 3 of the Towry contract did reflect a difference, he considered that it was “not a hugely material difference”.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">“I would have explained the effect of the non-solicitation clauses, in terms of not allowing the advisers, if they left, to solicit and deal with those clients.

	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">The effect of the non-solicitation clauses is that the adviser cannot solicit or, in fact, deal with the client in those terms, because in giving advice to the client and recommending they transfer to a new business, they are soliciting that client. So the effect of a non-dealing clause is just to amplify the solicitation and to make it easier to prove.  So from having reviewed the contracts in the due diligence process, I had no concerns about the effect of the contractual clauses at all.  </p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">A.   No.  There is a difference in operation.  But in terms of financial advice when clients seek advice and require advice and want advice, this manifests itself in making a non-dealing clause easier to prove than a non-solicitation clause for the same breach of contract.  If there was a relationship that did not involve advice, say a commercial salesman of, I don’t know, photocopiers for example, clients do not require advice.  He is merely selling products to them.  In those terms a non-dealing clause may be more onerous because he could not contact those people or they could not contact him and deal.  In terms of financial advice, the advice is key … most financial advisers will give advice, recommendations, canvass or solicit a client or their former clients and attempt to transfer them to their new business.  So the non-dealing clause effectively makes the evidence easier to find … </p>

The client relationship is actually with the company.  And the employee is merely an agent of the company.  The employee does not own the relationship with the client or control that relationship with the client.  So it’s a perfectly reasonable commercial contract and commercial clause to protect the legitimate interests of the employer.</p>

For present purposes, in terms of the contractual obligation upon the Edward Jones’ advisers, what seems to me to be missing from Mr Anderson’s analysis of the respective clauses is the necessity, in relation to solicitation, for advisers not to persuade clients to deal with them and to transfer their business.  He appeared to conflate the giving of advice to clients with the soliciting of them.  I do not accept his evidence that a non-dealing clause simply amplifies the solicitation and makes it easier to prove.  Nor do I accept that there was no material difference between the restrictive covenants in play in this case.  </p>

As Mr Anderson accepted, if clients chose freely and voluntarily, without any element of persuasion, to follow their adviser and transfer their business, then there would be no breach of that clause.  He is of course entitled to his view that, in terms of financial advice, that is unlikely to occur, but that is a different question.  Whether that is what occurred is a question of fact to be determined on the evidence.  However, a non-dealing clause of the kind in the Towry contract prevents advice being given even to those clients who wish, freely and voluntarily and with no element of persuasion, to transfer.  That is the material difference and, in my judgment, it is a significant difference in terms of the contractual obligation owed by the adviser.</p>

This, he considered, would provide advisers with the security of a fixed monthly income, in place of the variable and fluctuating returns generated by commission driven rewards.  Salary reviews would be linked to performance indicators, including financial objectives.  During the 2010 transition period this represented an opportunity for advisers to increase their basic salary further, as Towry wealth advisers.  If an adviser was meeting his personal targets after six months his salary would rise to 80% of his “current EJ earnings” (CEJE), with his guaranteed bonus reducing to a sum equivalent to 10% of CEJE.  CEJE was calculated so as to include all the advisers’ commission or bonuses, holiday pay, cash value of “diversification trips” (paid holidays as a form of bonus), sick pay and any other financial benefits received.</p>

However, the core proposition to the advisers was that, if they accepted the new terms, their minimum 2010 financial earnings would be guaranteed at not less than 90% of their CEJE.  This global guarantee remained in place at all times regardless of productivity performance through 2010.  If, by the end of 2010, the wealth adviser had met his personal targets his basic salary would be increased to between 90% and 100% of CEJE.  </p>

NRI comprised a combination of commission earned whilst in the transition to Towry, time based hourly rate fees and initial fees generated where clients were introduced to and transferred assets to the IIM service;  (ii) an Asset Accelerator Bonus (AUM) awarded for outperforming an adviser’s IIM target.  For each 10% increment by which the adviser exceeded their target, they would be paid a 2% of year end salary bonus, payable at year end.  Furthermore, if 60% or more of any such over-performance came within the first six months of 2010, that 60% or more would attract an additional 3% of year end salary as a further year end bonus, again payable at the year’s end.  </p>

Mr Bennett acknowledged that the Towry contract offered short-term, financial security and that there were some positive features, in particular the emphasis on professional qualifications and the move to fee-based remuneration, which he considered was long overdue.  However, it was not a contract that he felt he could sign.  He realised that he would have to relocate twice in a matter of months and he considered that the total salary on offer (£43,939.00 and with guaranteed bonus total pay of £56,493.00) undervalued him. Further, it contained a non-dealing restrictive covenant, which he regarded as a highly significant change and which had not previously been brought to his attention.  </p>

Further, he was being asked to sign it before receiving any training or details concerning the operation of the IIM.  Mr Bennett considered it to be a “take it or leave it” offer, which he regarded as unreasonable.  He also felt that it was too much to digest and think about in the short time allowed.

She stated in her witness statement that he informed her he had already decided that he was not prepared to be employed by the Towry Group.  This, however, is inconsistent with the evidence of Mr Hayhurst and Mr Cowan and I do not accept it.  At that, early stage everyone was being told that nothing would change, and I accept Mr Hayhurst’s evidence that he had made no decision about his future and said nothing to suggest otherwise. In any event, when she was cross-examined about this, Ms Mulvihill was less certain about what he had told her, describing it only as “the gist I got from the conversation” and stating that she had understood that he was not going to stay and was going to look immediately at other options. There is no dispute that Mr Hayhurst looked at other options, as indeed did many other advisers, including Ms Mulvihill herself, and I find that this is what he told her he was going to do. </p>

Mr Springall understood the time pressures and was no doubt frustrated by the situation.  He stated that it was neither practical nor commercial to let people have an infinite amount of time to make up their minds and that “we had to get a decision”.  By 11 December that was undoubtedly the view held by all the Towry senior managers, even though as Mrs Rickard rightly acknowledged, the advisers were being asked to make a “big decision.”   </p>

He was, therefore, informed incorrectly that he had received an offer of employment on 25 November and that Towry had not heard from him within the seven days permitted for a response.  He was told that his last day of employment was 18 February.  In subsequent correspondence, his request to be released from his period of garden leave at an earlier point was taken as a request to be released from his contract and his termination date was then brought forward to 4 January 2010.</p>

However, I reject any suggestion that Mr Hutton had a closed mind or that he had already made up his mind to leave.  It is correct that Mr Hutton had not attended earlier presentations since the one on 28 October and he accepted that he did not look at his contract at the meeting, but Mr Evans agreed in cross-examination that he saw nothing wrong with that.  He had asked Mr Hutton what he thought of his contract.  In response Mr Hutton had indicated that it was inside his briefcase and that he would look at it at home.

All the circumstances must be taken into account, in so far as they may be said to bear on an objective assessment of the intention of the contract breaker.  Thus, motive may be relevant if it is something or it reflects something of which the innocent party was aware or of which a reasonable person in his or her position would have been aware and it throws light on the way the alleged repudiatory act would be viewed by such a reasonable person (see <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Tullett Prebon v.

Lord Hoffman made it clear that a claim for wrongful dismissal is limited to the question whether the appropriate notice of termination has been given.  He expressed doubt about the use of this implied term in relation to the way in which the employment relationship is terminated; and he rejected the submission that there was any general remedy at common law for unfair circumstances surrounding dismissal, given the existence of the statutory, unfair dismissal regime.

Whilst there were significant differences between the Edward Jones’ and Towry business models and the Defendants were under no obligation to accept the offer of continuous employment in November 2009, it cannot be said in all the circumstances, viewed objectively, that Towry showed a clear intention to abandon and altogether refuse to perform the Defendants’ contracts of employment, or that the individual Defendants were unfairly and improperly exploited.  </p>

I have therefore had regard to all these matters in addition, having had the benefit of hearing all the evidence upon them and considering the parties’ detailed submissions.

Other Defendants acknowledged in their evidence that they were aware at the time that Edward Jones was losing money (Mr Bennett and Mr Chandler) or that, as Mr Burger expressed it “… the system was broken at the end… there is no doubt about that”, although they were unaware, as I find, of the full scale of the losses as at the date of the acquisition, or in the days that followed.  </p>

Further, the context includes the style and content of Mr Fisher’s presentations, which succeeded in alienating many of those who heard them, including some of the Defendants.

To a room of skilled, entrepreneurial advisers, many of whom had been working autonomously as advisory stockbrokers on a whole of market basis, the failure to impart detailed information of this kind before the contracts had been signed was likely to increase their concerns and I find that it did.  </p>

However, Mr Tolley points to Mr Hayhurst’s evidence in cross-examination that, when he looked at the contract on 1 December  “… the final piece of the jigsaw slotted into place.  After I had seen the 50% pay cut and the reductions in other benefits, that was the final piece that I thought: actually I’m definitely not going to be going ahead with the Towry proposition”.</p>

Viewed objectively, the position of the other employees in the groups below the top tier advisers was dependent upon the level of acceptance of those in group 1.  Competitors were on the scene, and a month had already gone by since the news of the acquisition.  Further, in my view the extensive meetings, discussions and presentations had already laid the ground sufficiently to enable the advisers concerned to consider, within the time allowed, what was on offer when the contracts arrived, and to form a view as to whether they wished to accept the terms offered. There was also scope for renegotiation in some cases, as demonstrated by the cases of James Chandler and Tracey Simpson.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">So far as Mr Spain’s dealings with Mr Wright and Mr Springall are concerned, it was unfortunate that Mr Wright sent him only the Total Reward Statement, rather than the entire contract, but I find nothing sinister in this.  It was not unreasonable for Mr Wright to think that Mr Spain’s immediate interest would be in his potential earnings, rather than in the other terms and conditions of the contract.  At the end of their conversation Mr Spain thanked him for the call and told him he looked forward to receiving his contract.  He also accepted in cross-examination that he did ultimately understand that he had seven days from 4 December to consider the contract, so that he in fact had the same period of time as others.  The unprofitable discussion he then had on Friday 11 December with Mr Springall, who was unaware of the previous involvement of Mr Wright, led to an extension of time until the Monday 14 December for him to consider his position. This therefore adds nothing of substance in his case, so far as the allegation of repudiatory breach is concerned.</p>

Some of the termination letters also contained inaccurate particulars in individual cases.  On the evidence however I find that, viewed objectively, these errors and imperfections in the communication process were inadvertent and owed much to the scale of the task facing Towry following the acquisition.  They were not acts deliberately directed at the individual Defendants whose services, as I have found, they genuinely hoped to retain.   </p>

Mr Quinn suggested to various Towry witnesses that Towry had sought both to conceal the fact of a relevant TUPE transfer and to delay the date of that transfer.  However, for two reasons I need consider this point no further.  First, the parties eventually agreed, for the purpose of these proceedings only, to proceed on the assumed basis that there was a TUPE transfer of the then employees of Towry Edward Jones Ltd to Towry Services Ltd on 10 May 2010.  Secondly, the Defendants themselves adduced no oral or documentary evidence that Towry’s attitude towards the application of TUPE was even considered by them as an issue at the time.  The TUPE points raised do not in my view assist in determining the question of repudiatory breach.</p>

First, it was submitted that the implied term required Towry to enter into genuine and meaningful consultation with the EJCC as to the nature of the proposed terms and conditions in the contract to be offered to the advisers.  In failing to consult or even to show the EJCC the new terms and conditions, and in failing, further, to consult them as to the closure of the local offices Towry were in repudiatory breach of contract.  In reality, it was said, ExCo had made all the relevant decisions long in advance of the first EJCC meeting on 20 November.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I accept that this was less than desirable, but I do not consider it to constitute a repudiatory beach of contract.  The commercial decision, that the local offices had to close in order to prevent further substantial losses, had already been taken as a matter of priority after the acquisition and this cannot be said to be unreasonable in the circumstances.  Further, the EJCC could not be appointed or consulted until the FSA had approved the acquisition and the deal was not completed until 12 November.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Towry then needed to proceed quickly, to try and secure the services of the best performing advisers who, as they were well aware, would have been approached by competitors and recruitment organisations soon after news of the acquisition was announced.   In addition offers had to be made to the advisers in group 1 before any offers could be made to other employees in other groups.  On the evidence I accept that the ExCo, in furtherance of this aim, had drawn up proposed, selection criteria and had provisionally identified those group 1 advisers who met them. However, I find that no offer of employment was in fact made to any employee in advance of 25 November, or in advance of the EJCC approving the measures letter and the selection criteria, together with the time limits for acceptance, on 20 November.  Nor is there any evidence that such considerations played any part in the Defendants’ thinking processes at the time.  </p>

I accept Alex Rickard’s evidence that the role of the EJCC was a broader one, to consider the selection criteria and time limits for acceptance of offers, collective redundancies and the potential TUPE transfer.  Their role was not to consider the particular terms and conditions on offer, in relation to individual advisers’ new roles as Towry wealth advisers.</p>

This, however, does not amount to a repudiatory breach.  After the EJCC meeting on 20 November and after the selection criteria were formally applied and the group 1 advisers identified, these meetings had to be arranged or confirmed, with hotels booked and paperwork prepared in seven regions across the country. I accept Mrs Rickard’s evidence that Towry managers were all working very hard at this point, dealing with a huge amount of detail, and that they were under the time pressures to which I have referred.  Further, the Defendants were by now aware, through the earlier presentations or discussions and email/website information, that the contractual offers were imminent. </p>

In the case of Mr Goodship this was said to be in the form of a retention bonus of £32,000.00 and half a million pounds’ worth of share options.

Further, whilst he did not then know for certain whether he was himself going to be offered a job with Towry, he believed that, if he wanted to stay, there would probably be a job for him, since he had been one of the top Edward Jones’ advisers for some time.  He stated that he had not made up his mind to stay, however, and he recognised that Towry was a very different proposition from Edward Jones.

Mr Goodship said that there had been no mention of him receiving any retention bonus or other incentive before the meeting of 16 November and I accept that there is no evidence to that effect.  As regional leader he considered that his duty was to communicate with the advisers generally and to answer any questions they might have. However, he did recall Mr Cowan raising the prospect of a retention bonus with him on 16 November.  He said that he felt uncomfortable about it, because he did not want the lines to be blurred.  Further, on 20 November, Mr Cowan called him and said that he would be offered a role in Towry and that there would be some sort of retention bonus scheme put in place.  Mr Goodship said that he told him he would be a bit uncomfortable with money and that shares felt more appropriate than cash.  His evidence was that he knew nothing of any specific scheme until 25 November, when he received his contract and made up his mind to sign.  He then sent his email containing his “reasons to stay” to the advisers on 26 November.  </p>

A number of advisers were raising concerns about this at the time with both Fraser Irvine and Andy Springall.  It is submitted that Towry cannot simply rely on clause 3.7 of the Edward Jones’ contract, providing that it is for the employer to determine the appropriate place of business for performance of the employee’s duties.

In its terms no Defendant enjoyed any exclusive right to any particular territory.

The costs of running the 317 local offices and of the additional staff employed there, had materially contributed to the substantial losses being sustained by Edward Jones on an annual basis.  Whilst some Defendants were individually profitable in their own branches, the evidence as to the global picture was clear. It was not unreasonable, in my judgment, for Towry to decide as a priority that local offices would have to close; that advisers would have to be relocated; and that this was not a matter that needed to be considered in consultation with the EJCC.  </p>

That would provide some protection against under-performance in the transition year of 2010.  The intention was then to bring all employees back to at least 100% of their CEJE by January 2011.

As Mr Middleton explained, typically, within the IIM, no more than 5% of a client’s assets would be invested in any one actively managed fund and no more than 15% in any passively managed fund.

I accept Mr Middleton’s evidence on this point.  There was, demonstrably, a heavy emphasis on the IIM and on the benefits it was said to bring to clients, during Towry’s communication programme with the Edward Jones advisers.  It is also clear that Towry’s priority was to train the newly acquired advisers on their core proposition as soon as possible, with the expectation that all clients’ assets would be transferred to the IIM.  This is hardly surprising, given that the IIM was Towry’s core proposition. This, combined with the negative views being expressed in blogs and in the financial press, and Towry’s failure to provide detailed answers to questions asked about the IIM at the presentations, led as I find to the Defendants’ belief that, as Towry wealth advisers, they would in reality have only one investment choice. </p>

The commercial expectation or working assumption, on the part of Towry, that all the assets of the Edward Jones clients would be transferred to the IIM did not equate to a contractual requirement for advisers to recommend transfer for all clients, irrespective of suitability.  Use of the word “churning” made pulses race on the Towry side, but I am not persuaded on the evidence that Towry were in fact requiring the Defendants, or indeed any of their wealth advisers, to encourage transfer of a clients’ assets to their IIM when such transfer would not be in that client’s interests. A full suitability assessment would be carried out before any client would be advised to transfer to the IIM, as was spelled out in materials prepared by Towry for the November presentations.</p>

Notwithstanding the evidence that no action would have been taken in respect of a failure to achieve this target, if all else was going well, the fact remains that this was a term of the Raymond James contract.  Mr Tolley drew attention, in addition, to the high levels of AUA that the Defendants represented themselves as having, in completing the appraisal questionnaires required by Raymond James, which would indicate very little difficulty for any Defendant in reaching the targets set by Towry.   </p>

Fraser Irvine referred in this respect, in an email sent on 2 December 2009, to the previous experience of advisers who had been integrated into Towry upon an acquisition.  They found that, “…on average 182% of on book assets were migrated in year 1 and a further 101% in year 2.  Most of us have targets set at around 100% for year 1, in light of what has gone before these targets appear very achievable.

Nor was there any evidence that the Edward Jones restrictive covenant had changed so that it was, as at December 2009, the same as that contained in the Towry contract.  Even if it were the same, that does not justify Towry’s attempt to impose a non-dealing covenant on these Defendants, whose contracts retained the non-solicitation only restriction.

Whilst the length of the restriction was the same in both contracts (12 months), in my judgment there is a substantial difference, in terms of the obligation owed post termination, between the relevant clauses. For these Defendants, who had developed an impressive client base through knocking on doors and retaining a visible and easily accessible presence in their community, a clause preventing them from dealing with any client in any circumstances, if they moved on to work for another organisation, is plainly more restrictive, with more serious consequences for them, than a clause enabling them to continue to deal with clients so long as they do not solicit them.

On the evidence I find that the main reason for Towry offering the Defendants this contract was to ensure that all Towry’s wealth advisers were employed on the same, standard terms and conditions, so as to obtain consistency across the board.  Towry had done this on the occasion of each previous acquisition, harmonising terms and conditions and integrating each set of new employees.

However, I consider that there is insufficient evidence before me to permit a finding that such a clause is industry standard, or rather that it was industry standard in December 2009.</p>

The reasonableness of a non-dealing clause of this kind will depend upon the nature and specialism of the market in which the employee is engaged.  The financial advice sector is one where strong client connections may well be held to justify a post termination restriction of this kind (see for example <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Beckett Investment Management Group Ltd v Hall [2007] ICR 1539 CA</span>).  </p>

However, the issue in this case concerned the invitation made to those who had agreed not to solicit any clients, post-termination, to agree to a contract which required them not to deal with any clients if they subsequently moved to a competitor.  The focus was therefore different but, for the reasons given above, I do not consider that Towry were in repudiatory breach in the circumstances of this case.</p>

The evidence also shows that, during the notice period, the Defendants received their notice pay, guaranteed pay and holiday pay, to which they were entitled under clauses 14.9.2 and 14.9.3.  None of these entitlements was repaid.  I note too that, by clause 14.8, any period of garden leave fell to be deducted from the period covered by the post-termination restriction in clause 16. </p>

The Edward Jones model was for the same company to provide the advisory services and to hold the clients’ assets. Towry, however, provides its services through different companies, in order to take account of the different, regulatory capital requirements for each type of service.  Therefore, on 10 May 2010, Towry EJ Ltd (the Claimant and the new name for Edward Jones) not only ceased to have any employees, but also ceased to have any customers or to provide any services, transferring all these to Towry Ltd (advisory services) and Towry Investment Management Ltd (investment services).  Further, as Mr Anderson explained, the Claimant has no advisers registered with it by the FSA.

It has been agreed, solely for the purposes of this litigation that, on 10 May 2010, there was a TUPE transfer of the then employees of Towry EJ Ltd. to Towry Services Ltd.  Upon a TUPE transfer, the right to enforce a restrictive covenant passes from the transferor to the transferee.  The Court will only give effect to restrictive covenants of the kind in issue in this case where the Claimant can show that it has a continuing legitimate interest to protect.  Without that legitimate interest there can be no justification for giving effect to covenants which are, prima facie, in restraint of trade.</p>

In cases involving employees and employers, restrictive covenants may be upheld if the circumstances are such that the employee “might obtain such personal knowledge and influence over the customers of his employer, or such an acquaintance with his employer’s trade secrets as would enable him, if competition were allowed, to take advantage of his employer’s trade connection or utilise information confidentially obtained.”  However, where a covenant is directed only to “the prevention of competition or against the use of the personal skill and knowledge acquired by the employee in his employer’s business” it will not be upheld. </p>

Nor am I aware of any other authority, which would support the suggestion that a Claimant must have a continuing business interest at the time of trial in order to be able to enforce a restrictive covenant.  Included in the agreed bundle of authorities were extracts from the leading textbooks, which I have also read and none of which makes any reference to the existence of such a free standing principle.  </p>

The decision, in appropriate cases, as to whether injunctive relief should be granted is a separate matter, to be considered as part of the exercise of the Court’s discretion.  That does not arise in the present case, which is a substantive claim for breach of contract on the basis of enforceable restrictive covenants.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In any event I agree with Mr Tolley that such a free standing principle would not explain the result in a case governed by TUPE, the effect of which is determined only by the terms of the relevant statutory provisions.  There is no suggestion that any of the individual Defendants were employed by the Claimant immediately before the transfer, within the meaning of regulation 4(3) of TUPE.  All the contracts of employment had been terminated long before 10 May 2010.  None was transferred from the Claimant to Towry Services Ltd.  Thus, any cause of action arising out of those contracts was retained by the Claimant.  If an employee’s contract, containing a post termination restrictive covenant, is terminated and several months later there is a TUPE transfer, it cannot be the case that the original employer is, by reason of the TUPE transfer, prevented from enforcing that covenant. If the employee was not employed in the undertaking immediately before the transfer, his contract would not transfer.  Nor would any cause of action arising from it.  A TUPE transfer does not extinguish a cause of action for breach of a restrictive covenant or render non-existent the transferor’s legitimate business interest.  In my judgment TUPE has no relevance to this case.  </p>

The Claimant did not cease to have any legitimate business interest to protect as a result of the company restructuring in May 2010.  The Defendants conceded shortly before trial that the relevant restrictive covenants at clauses 16.4 and 16.5 were reasonable.  Thus it is accepted that, at the time the Defendants entered into the Edward Jones contracts, the Claimant had legitimate business interests to protect by means of those post termination restrictions; and that such restrictions were no more than reasonably necessary for the protection of those interests.  </p>

Mr Tolley submits that, in the context of the type of relationship in question in this case, between a financial adviser and his client, in circumstances where the adviser was encouraged to form close relationships with those clients, the question of who made the first contact is of marginal, if any, relevance.  In my view that is putting it too high, but that is not to elevate initial contact to such a level that it is determinative, or even highly indicative of an absence of solicitation.  Who made the first contact is clearly relevant but the court will need to look at all the circumstances surrounding that contact in order to form a view of its importance in the particular context.  </p>

However, if his response is, for instance, immediately to offer to make a sales presentation, it might be difficult to say that there has been no solicitation.  Each case will turn on its own precise facts.  If the gist of what the ex-employee says is responsive to the customer’s enquiries, there will be no solicitation. If there is significant use of persuasion by the ex-employee, this is likely to be seen as soliciting.  It is often difficult to draw the line.”</span></p>

Employers are entitled to prevent ex-employees from exerting influence of this kind over their clients.  The question in this case is therefore whether Towry has demonstrated to the civil standard on all the evidence that an individual Defendant’s communications with Towry’s clients, as they became, contained a material element of persuasion, with a view to gaining the business of those clients. Whether there has been persuasion or encouragement will depend, in each case, on all the circumstances.  Determination of this issue is clearly fact specific.   </p>

It is not necessary, in order to establish intention, to show that there was a desire to injure. “It is necessary, for this purpose, to distinguish between ends, means and consequences.  If someone knowingly causes a breach of contract, it does not normally matter that it is the means by which he intends to achieve some further end or even that he would rather have been able to achieve that end without causing a breach….On the other hand, if the breach of contract is neither an end in itself nor a means to an end, but merely a foreseeable consequence, then in my opinion it cannot for this purpose be said to have been intended.”  </p>

Originally, interim relief had not been sought against Tracey Simpson because, at that stage, no transfer requests had been received from any clients who had previously been advised by her while she worked at Edward Jones.  After 31 March, however, Towry received transfer requests from five individuals who had formerly been advised by Wayne Hayhurst, where the ISA Consolidation Form recorded that their new adviser was Tracey Simpson.  Towry’s case, as articulated by Mr Anderson, is that Ms Simpson was effectively acting on behalf of Mr Hayhurst, with a view to attempting to circumvent the terms of the Order of 31 March.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In response the Defendants contend that the fact that the requests were received in an identical, Raymond James format is not probative of solicitation, since the format would be the same whether or not there had been solicitation; that the numbers of requests received reflects the substantial number of advisers who left Towry, which was outside their previous experience, and the significant disconnect between the Towry and the Edward Jones business models; that the Table in fact suggests that the number of clients who have chosen to stay with their individual advisers is consistent, whether those advisers stayed with Towry or went elsewhere; that clients were unhappy about Towry’s acquisition and what was happening at this time; that, in any event, the larger the investments were, the more likely an unhappy client was to contact his adviser and give instructions that he wanted to transfer them, so that neither the value of the investments nor the short period of time in which requests were made is indicative of solicitation; and that even if there were any regulatory failings, which is denied, they are in no way probative of solicitation.  Different financial services companies have different methods of compliance and Raymond James do not accept the suggestion that any Defendant was failing to comply with regulatory requirements.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First, the fact that the Raymond James independent contracting business model is very similar to that of Edward Jones is, in my view, highly relevant to the decision of the individual Defendants to approach that company after the acquisition. I have referred already to those similarities in earlier paragraphs.  Cynthia Poole, Head of Relationship Management at Raymond James referred to Raymond James being known as “the grown up Edward Jones” and to the move to Raymond James from Edward Jones as being a “natural progression” for advisers. </p>

Mr Goodship’s evidence mirrored that of the Defendants on this point, namely that the Raymond James model looked very similar to the model in place at Edward Jones.  Mr Goodship referred specifically to his awareness at the time that Raymond James were looking to expand their business and his own wish to find out more.</p>

The reasons included the freedom to be totally independent and offer independent investments, the ability to work from a local office, control over their working lives without micro-management on the number or timing of appointments made, the ability to continue to carry out advisory stockbroking, the ability to grow a business and have control over the clients taken on, and the ability to maintain close contact with those clients.  </p>

David Hazelton, Head of Business Development,   described the Raymond James independent contracting model as being “decentralised”, in contrast to the centralised investment approach of Towry. The advisers providing services to Raymond James are responsible for giving advice on the ground in their own offices.  The advice “happens in the branch”. Financial advisers are signed up to become part of the Raymond James platform, and Raymond James do not themselves deal directly with investors.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Through the independent contracting model Raymond James provides the regulatory umbrella and administrative and operational back up to advisers, in the sense of the administrative platform for advisers to be able to effect their transactions, hold assets in custody and produce reporting for their clients.  They also provide research facilities for the advisers, giving them the tools so that they can carry out research and make local decisions about what is appropriate for their clients.  But it is the advisers who deliver an investment proposition and give investment advice to clients, with Raymond James providing “…access to the marketplace, to the equity market and to the bond market for direst investments in stocks and shares.”  Mr Cherriman, the Business Development Consultant, referred to the opportunity, under this model, for advisers to enter relationships with other advisers so that there can sometimes be two branches within one location and a consequent sharing of operating costs.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In relation to charging clients, under the independent contracting model it is the adviser who charges either fees or commissions to the client and Raymond James takes a share of those fees and commissions.  As between the company and the adviser, in practice the fees are charged by Raymond James in the first instance from the assets and then the relevant share of them is passed to the adviser on a quarterly basis. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Whether fees or commissions are charged, Mr Hazelton stated that the assets have to be held on the Raymond James platform in order to run the business in a sensible way. Whilst he accepted that it would be possible, technically, for assets to be held on a third party platform on behalf of the client, and for the adviser to charge the client an hourly rate by way of fees for advice given, in practice this is just not practical.  From both the operational and regulatory perspectives the assets need to be on the Raymond James platform, so that they can keep track of what is going on and fulfil their compliance function.  To do otherwise would expose them to an unacceptable risk.  Raymond James are responsible for the advice given and they have to make sure that the adviser is giving the right advice.

Whilst there is no other evidence about that before me, and I make no finding in respect of it, I accept that the risk of litigation being pursued by Towry was another factor influencing their thinking processes at this time.  Mr Hazelton stated, “…it was clear that these advisers had pretty strong covenants. And we felt certain, knowing the nature of Towry – and I don’t mean to denigrate them in that, but they’re hard-nosed business people – I felt certain if anything were to transpire then we wanted to make sure that we hadn’t done anything to breach those restrictive covenants.”</p>

They took to that meeting a sample Edward Jones contract provided by another adviser, Robert Ward, who had brought it that day to a meeting with Mr Cherriman.  They therefore understood, at that early stage, the nature and scope of the relevant, restrictive covenants. There is no dispute that, in that respect, Mr Ward’s contract mirrored those of the Defendants.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There was a lengthy discussion at this meeting about the legal obligations on advisers and on Raymond James.

Solicitation and what amounted to solicitation was explained.  In addition, advisers were prohibited from disclosing any confidential information belonging to Edward Jones. They were warned, both at that meeting and throughout the process which followed, that if any advisers breached their contractual obligations and Raymond James were aware of those breaches and colluded in them, there would be a right of action against Raymond James for inducing the advisers to breach their contracts.  They were advised that, if the matter were handled carefully and sensitively, it should be possible for the Edward Jones employees and Raymond James to avoid breaches of any post termination restrictions. They were also advised that the Edward Jones advisers should be told to take independent legal advice as to their own positions, not least to avoid any potential conflicts of interest between themselves and Raymond James.  </p>

They used their standard procedure, monitored via an electronic database called SalesForce, which keeps a record relating to each adviser and the stage he/she has reached in the system.  In this case, however, the procedure was compressed because of the sheer numbers involved and the need to act swiftly.  The usual process is sequential, with a number of steps that can take up to 10 weeks. That was out of the question here.  There were a large number of advisers, who were simultaneously looking at other options with rival organisations, as well as with Towry, and there was an obvious risk that skilled advisers would be lost to Raymond James if there were lengthy delays.  </p>

During the initial telephone calls with all the advisers who contacted him, Mr Cherriman asked them questions about the value of assets they were looking after on behalf of clients and about their annual revenue.  He referred to applying certain “set” or “minimum” criteria as a baseline, which enabled him to decide whether advisers might be suitable for the role of independent branch principal, namely those who individually looked after £10 million on behalf of their clients, and who could bring in annual revenues of £100,000.  The annual revenue would typically be made up of fees and commission received during the last 12 months.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, these baseline criteria were not set in stone and there was some flexibility in relation to recruitment.  Raymond James would also look at the account size and whether the advisers were dealing with high net worth individuals. Their charges are such that it makes sense for advisers to build relationships with higher net worth clients. Those that have that experience will also be more likely to succeed in the Raymond James model. </p>

A proven track record will show that an individual is capable of building up a client base from scratch, which is what they are looking for, in the sense that they want individuals who can potentially build up a business that has £10 million under management.  This “…indicates that they have at least potentially been successful within their previous role.

The expectation was that the advisers would go on generating revenue at the same rate as before. “Past experience, although not necessarily a predictor of future performance, can, indeed, be a good indicator”. But, said Mr Cherriman, Raymond James would not “…hold a gun to their head. We would expect them to get there gradually.”  Such calculations amounted only to a “broad expectation of what we hope might happen over a period of time… we have no idea of how successful they’re going to be and the level of fees they will generate under the Raymond James model.” </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Hazelton stated that, as Head of Operations, Mr Wright needed to “manage his work flow”, and that “..he has to understand what might happen, whether there would be a trickle or a flood.  We didn’t have any idea of that.  Because the clients were the ones that had to make the first move.  They are the ones who had to say: well, I don’t really want to deal with Towry.”  This, he said, was merely a way of enabling Mr Wright to understand what might happen over the course of the next two years and to be prepared for it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Cynthia Poole also referred to the need to have a better understanding of the work flow and confirmed that no more accurate projection was in fact prepared by Anna Pollins.  She explained that Stuart Wright’s team really struggled with estimating account flow. Some method therefore had to be devised, to try and help him to manage it more effectively and to avoid delays in opening accounts.  Numbers were therefore taken from the appraisal questionnaires, simply to provide estimates of what his team might expect to see over the next 12 to 24 months.  The numbers from the independent contracting model are in any event very small and need to be understood in context.  Many more accounts come from the wrap platform firms, with which Raymond James also form relationships.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Hazelton was also questioned closely about his use of the term “pipeline” in his email to Ms Potter of 15 February 2010, at F3 1087 and the attached spreadsheet.  He explained that this document was prepared specifically for the parent company in the US, in order to calculate the transition assistance they wished to offer to the advisers.  The formula was based on what the advisers had done, historically, and on the revenue they had brought in.  Further, the reference to “pipeline”, referring to the AUM, HRG and NRG, denoted the specific formula they had to use, in the report to the parent company, to indicate where they expected the business to be at the end of the next two years.  They had to provide this report to the parent company and,   Mr Hazelton stated, they could not just pull figures out of the air.  They therefore made an estimate of where they thought the advisers would be, based on their past performance.  It was, however, only an estimate and it was in no way indicative of an expectation or intention that former Edward Jones clients would in fact move their assets across to Raymond James.  It was therefore no more than a working assumption, to monitor overall performance against target.  I accept that evidence.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The purpose of all these questions was to seek to establish that the premise of all these calculations, and of the references to “pipeline” and to “what to expect”, was that the advisers would replicate precisely the performance that they had achieved at Edward Jones; and that premise, as Raymond James well knew and intended to bring about from the outset, would only be fulfilled if the advisers brought clients with them from day one. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Rejecting this suggestion, Mr Cherriman’s evidence was that the figures generated in these documents reflected only what they considered the advisers might get to, in terms of revenue, after a reasonable period of time; that they had regard, in this respect, to what the advisers had achieved before, as a way of anticipating what they would be able to do in the future; that there were always new clients for skilled entrepreneurs to go into relationships with; that the business development team had reporting obligations to Peter Moores, their CEO, and to senior management and shareholders in the US, for whom these internal documents were prepared; that in order to provide some estimate of what they expected the asset levels to be, over a reasonable time frame, “…we have to go on something, and one of those things we look at is what they’ve done in the past.”; but that they can’t guarantee the asset level any adviser will get to so “unfortunately, it is, pretty much, a guesstimate.  There’s no better word for it.  It is a guesstimate.”  Mr Hazelton’s evidence was to the same effect.  On all the evidence before me in this case, I find their explanation as to the nature and purpose of these documents compelling and I accept it.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I return to the recruitment exercise undertaken by Raymond James.  By way of general observation, it is apparent that only those who survived what is on any view a rigorous selection process would be recruited.  Of the forty-seven Edward Jones advisers who initially applied to Raymond James, some of them were apparently offered larger financial sums by rival firms and terminated the process. At least two others, Robert Ward and Allan Ross, pulled out because they felt that Raymond Jones were too cautious or “risk averse”, and that the recruitment process took too long.  Of those remaining, Raymond James were  able to give preference to those advisers who had previously been successful in generating the larger client bases, demonstrating strong past performance.  Only nine advisers progressed to the second stage, consisting of investment knowledge and role-play assessments. Two of them failed those assessments, so that only seven advisers, the individual Defendants in this case, were eventually recruited.  Both of the advisers who failed the assessments were in fact looking after higher asset levels on behalf of clients than any of the Defendants.  </p>

After the initial telephone conversation with Mr Cherriman, an introductory email was sent to those advisers who looked as if they might fulfil the relevant criteria, the information given being taken at face value at this stage.  A number of those to whom Mr Cherriman spoke were only half way there, in terms of the baseline criteria, but he considered they were “potentially promising” in terms of their entrepreneurial flair. This was the case for Tom Spain and Stuart Hutton, for example. </p>

At these initial meetings, which were normally with Mr Cherriman, he took them through the PowerPoint presentation of the Raymond James model, referred to above, and questioned them generally about their background, qualifications and revenue levels, about how they generated clients and managed their portfolios, and the types of investments they held and range of asset classes advised on. No confidential information belonging to Edward Jones was either sought or offered at any of these meetings or any subsequent meetings. Owing to the number of enquiries, these initial meetings were sometimes held in groups, with Mr Hazelton attending in addition.</p>

A wide range of information and supporting documentation was required for this application, including the previous employment contract, the completed FSA Form A, names of referees, the personal account dealing notice, personal identification and address verification, professional qualifications, personal financial statement, outside business activities and a CV.  Assembling all this information and dealing with these matters at this early stage would avoid holding up the process later on, if advisers were successful in progressing through the various recruitment stages.   </p>

He also emphasised that any breach of contract would be taken seriously, that the advisers must comply with their contracts and that, if they did not do so, Raymond James would not be prepared to enter into a relationship with them. </p>

Mr Cherriman was aware that a number of the Edward Jones advisers who knew each other, including some of the Defendants, would probably be talking to each other about their various options, including Raymond James.  Whilst this made him a little uncomfortable, he was more concerned, adopting a pragmatic approach, that they did not share any information about the company with any other individuals.  Mr Hazelton stressed that the real reason for this NDA was because they did not want other people, who had no interest in Raymond James, to see the Service Level Agreement they offered to successful advisers, or to know about the transition assistance being offered to them.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The next stage of the process was an appraisal questionnaire (AQ) meeting, which was generally led by David Hazelton and Cynthia Poole (Director of Relationship Management and Business Support).  Advisers, as with any other potential partner or wrap firm with whom a relationship might be established, were asked to complete an appraisal questionnaire regarding their business.  However, neither Mr Cherriman nor Mr Hazelton appear to have attached much importance to this document.  Mr Cherriman’s understanding was that their main purpose was to help in identifying any particular difficulties, for example if the adviser was trading derivatives which Raymond James were not prepared to hold.  Mr Hazelton stated that he regarded the answers to self-appraisal questions as being likely to be “exaggerated”, because in this document people were seeking to sell themselves and their skills.  The FSA application form was the document that really mattered, because that was the document that the FSA would rely upon and the contents must therefore be completely accurate and truthful.  </p>

When they were happy with everything there was then a further, internal meeting where Mr Hazelton, Cynthia Poole, Graham Hill, then Head of Compliance, Legal and Regulatory Affairs, and Peter Moores went through all the documentation and ensured that they were all happy with the recruitment of a particular individual.  If so, the adviser was “signed off” stage one of the process.  </p>

The bar is set high because Raymond James need to be able to rely on their competence, their integrity and their honesty.  Whilst the process was compressed in this case, because of the special circumstances surrounding it, none of the steps was removed or short-circuited in any way.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This is significant evidence, in my view, given the allegations being made against Raymond James in this case.  Mr Tolley submitted that the script contained only very general advice but, whilst it was not itself legal advice, I find that Mr Hazelton gave a clear description, in accordance with the legal advice he had been given, of what Raymond James thought the advisers could and could not do.  Further, he impressed upon the advisers both the need to get their own legal advice and the message that, if they broke their contracts, they would lose their positions at Raymond James.  Mr Hazelton regarded the discussion he had concerning this script, at each meeting, as an essential, formal step to ensure that each adviser was warned appropriately.  His intention was to make it completely clear to them that Raymond James were serious about this and that, if they breached their covenants, they would terminate the SLA and let them go. This, I find, was the clear message that was given to all the advisers at these meetings.   </p>

However, during the internal meeting on 2 November with Mr Hazelton and Ms Potter (referred to above), he too made some handwritten notes of that internal discussion.  For reasons which will become apparent, Mr Tolley cross-examined him closely on these notes.  I accept Mr Cherriman’s evidence that the notes at page 1284 of Core Bundle 4 were notes made by him at that internal meeting, but that he did not use this note when he was speaking to potential prospects subsequently.  Some of the notes made by him are similar to notes made by Mr Hazelton, from which he subsequently prepared the “script” referred to above, which was typed up by Ms Potter some time after this meeting.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The notes at 1284 certainly include a summary of the information Mr Cherriman was going to convey, and did in fact convey to advisers concerning their covenants when he had meetings with them.  Mr Hazelton’s handwritten notes, at 1264, made reference to some of the same points.  These notes included the words “Don’t sign contract with TL”.  The view taken by those at the internal meeting was that it would not be in the advisers’ best interests to sign any new contract with Towry.  Mr Hazelton referred to them having some insight, at that time, that Towry’s restrictive covenants were “much tighter”, and that unless the advisers were certain they were going to stay with Towry, that could be a problem for them if they subsequently decided to leave. This was plainly a reference to the non-dealing covenant in the Towry contract.</p>

Mr Hazelton’s notes contained a similar phrase.  This, I find, was a reference to their understanding that some of the advisers knew each other and that, as a matter of “sensible employment advice” advisers should be told not to act collectively and not to resign as a group in these situations.  That message was also conveyed to the advisers. </p>

When asked about this he stated “There are notes on this page that we subsequently didn’t tell the advisers about because we decided that what we thought we might be able to do would clearly have been encouraging the advisers to breach their covenants, which we knew would be wrong.

He denied, however, that he ever conveyed this message to any adviser.  Referring to the large numbers of advisers expressing interest in Raymond James and in rival organisations at this time, he stated, “…we were perhaps considering: how can we get a competitive advantage?  How can we be attractive?  But this is a thought. This is a note within an internal meeting.  And it’s something that we didn’t carry through with….we didn’t do that…It looks like we are potentially going to say that, but we didn’t. We decided it would be wrong.  It would be encouraging them to do stuff to breach their contracts and we didn’t want that.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On all the evidence before me, I accept that explanation.  I do not consider his account to be one which, as Mr Tolley suggested, was something he had thought of since the proceedings were commenced.  The fact that it was not conveyed to advisers, by either Mr Cherriman or Mr Hazelton, is supported by the following; the final contents of the script prepared by Mr Hazelton, prepared expressly for use in the AQ meetings with advisers, which contains no reference to this point; the fact that none of the Defendants recalls it being said; the fact that there is no other oral or documentary evidence to indicate that it was said to advisers, or indeed by the advisers to any clients; the care that Raymond James was taking generally in regard to this recruitment process, their high level of awareness of the risks and of the need for caution, and their regular consultations with their solicitors;  and the fact that neither Mr Goodship nor Mr Stone, both called to give evidence on behalf of Towry, referred to it being said to them at their meetings with Raymond James.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">That last point is significant in my view.  Both these witnesses, called on behalf of Towry, had attended meetings with Raymond James on 4 November, when they too were considering positions with that company as a possible option.  Mr Cherriman’s note had been made at an internal meeting just a couple of days before this meeting.  Neither of them referred to this being said to them at any stage.  Indeed, Mr Goodship accepted in cross-examination that Raymond James had behaved entirely professionally at this meeting and that they did not at any stage put him in an uncomfortable position.  He also recalled being advised to seek legal advice on the restrictive covenants in his contract.  Mr Stone also accepted in cross-examination that Mr Cherriman may well have told him that he had to respect his covenants or Raymond James simply wouldn’t enter into any relationship with him.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Nor does the evidence as to the approach to recruitment adopted by Raymond James support the suggestion made to Mr Cherriman in cross-examination that the prospect of a personal 10% bonus at the end of the year put him under improper pressure to achieve the targets set for the business development team.  The same suggestion, that his personal bonus was measured by reference to the revenue generated by signings made, was made to Mr Hazelton. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Naturally, the targets related to the number of locations signed and the potential revenues generated by new Branch Principal signings, but such targets are part and parcel of the sales arm of many organisations.  In the financial services sector, incentivising employees to achieve targets by offering bonuses is deeply embedded in the culture, as Towry’s own contracts demonstrate.  No doubt all the members of the business development team wanted to achieve the targets and receive remuneration accordingly, but the evidence as a whole does not support an allegation that there was any improper pressure in this respect, or that members of the team sought to meet their targets by ensuring that existing Edward Jones clients transferred their assets to Raymond James.  In any event, Mr Hazelton’s personal bonus was dependent on a number of factors in addition to revenue, including the quality of the advisers recruited and his management of the other members of the team.   </p>

There were two aspects to these payments.  The assistance was to support advisers in the early stages, when there may be no revenue coming in.  Mr Hazelton stated that they wanted to make sure there was no “undue pressure” on the advisers to breach their covenants and that there was “a cushion for them in that early period.”  It was also offered because of the extremely competitive position Raymond James were in with regard to the advisers and their wish to ensure they did not lose any of the best people to rival organisations. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It was offered only after Raymond James had taken legal advice on 8 December, because of concern that such financial assistance might appear to be an inducement to advisers to breach their contract.  The attendance note at 917A Core Bundle 3 confirms this advice.  Further advice was taken on 11 December re the drafting of these letters, to ensure that the offers of assistance were drafted in such a way as to emphasise the expectation that advisers would build up a new business, and would not be induced to leave their present employment.  Transition assistance had not previously been offered by Raymond James in the UK and it was necessary to obtain the go-ahead for these payments from Chet Helck, the Head of Raymond James in the US.  Authority for establishing such a system of payments generally, where appropriate, had to be obtained at the highest level. It was being introduced, not only for the Edward Jones advisers, but for others who might come after them in future years.</p>

In general terms Raymond James takes responsibility for the advice given in the branches. If there is a problem with advice given by a Branch Principal Raymond James take responsibility for that in respect of the client, and that responsibility is then shared with the adviser through the SLA.  Raymond James takes out professional indemnity insurance on behalf of the group as a whole, but in 2009 the adviser was responsible for the first £25,000.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">He considered that, since the advisers would be submitting an invoice for reimbursement of their legal costs, Raymond James would have been made aware that this had been done.  The evidence shows that an invoice for the legal advice was chased, in the case of Tom Spain, but in general the monitoring of receipt of such invoices was, I find, left to Mr Islam to administer and it is unclear on the evidence when or if this was done in relation to the other advisers.  Mr Tolley suggested that this was a reckless attitude for Mr Hazelton to adopt, but I do not accept that it was.  He had made it very clear to the advisers that they should obtain legal advice and, in my view, he was entitled to assume that the agreement that Raymond James would pay for that advice, on presentation of an invoice, would enable the relevant, internal processes at Raymond James to follow up on this, to ensure that it had been done.    </p>

Their presence in the local community and the regular, face to face contact encouraged by Edward Jones meant that lasting relationships of trust and confidence were formed. The advisers were encouraged to regard them as their clients and would refer to them as such.  They did so when giving evidence. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not regard the Defendants’ use of the term “my clients” or “our clients” on occasions as probative of a belief that the clients “belonged to” the individual Defendant, or as supportive of the allegations of breach of the relevant restrictive covenants.  I am entirely satisfied that each Defendant understood throughout that at all times the clients remained the clients of Edward Jones.  The use of such expressions was no more than shorthand for conveying the undisputed evidence that the client’s day to day relationship was always with a particular adviser.  The clients who gave evidence themselves referred to a particular Defendant as his or her adviser. Of greater importance is what actually happened between the advisers and their clients during the weeks that followed the acquisition and during the recruitment by Raymond James of the individual Defendants in this case.     </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Tolley submits that it is the close nature of the relationship in this case that emphasises the need for financial advisers to adhere strictly to their post-termination obligations, in order to ensure that the intellectual property that comprises the goodwill in the client relationship remains with the employer, to whom it lawfully belongs.  This will be especially so when, as in this case, the advisers retain the same mobile numbers as they had when they were working for Edward Jones.  I accept that submission.  However, as Mr Anderson himself acknowledged on behalf of Towry, “Obviously, if the customer wished to transfer his or her business elsewhere, that is their decision to make, but it should be free of any attempt by the departing employee to encourage the customer to transfer his or her business to the new employee’s new employer venture.”  That too is an accurate statement of the position.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is, in addition, a further consequence of the close relationship that existed between adviser and clients, and it has to be factored into the factual matrix in this case.  The adviser is likely to believe that, if he leaves, the clients are likely to follow him, without any element of persuasion on his part.  Such a belief was held by the individual Defendants in this case.  Mr Goodship similarly accepted that he was aware of the chance, if he left, that some clients would come with him, although he also recognised that he could not rely on that fact.  Giving Raymond James information concerning his AUA was, at least in part, because he was wanting to hold out to them the prospect that a proportion of his client base would follow him.  Mr Anderson fairly accepted in cross-examination that there is nothing wrong with such a belief, or with an employee telling a prospective employer that is his belief.  I accept Mr Quinn’s submission that an adviser’s belief that clients will choose to follow him to his new business, and the fact that he tells a prospective employer he holds that belief, is not in itself indicative of solicitation, or of misuse of confidential information or of participation in a conspiracy.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The same applies, as it seems to me, to the belief held by the prospective “employer” in this case, Raymond James. Whilst assessing an adviser’s suitability for appointment I accept Mr Cherriman’s evidence that he asked about the range of asset classes they advised on in general terms, but that he never asked about, or was given any information about specific clients.  In referring to the non-solicitation covenant in their contracts, I also accept that he made it clear to the advisers that they could not “go after” any clients.  However, he also stated in evidence that, “…from experience and instinct, I expected that some of the financial advisers’ clients would move with them; this was especially so, as the services offered by Towry following the takeover were so far removed from the services Edward Jones had been providing.  However this would not involve any unlawful behaviour on the part of the advisers.  So long as there was no breach of the adviser’s covenants then there was nothing to stop the adviser’s clients transferring their investments.”  </p>

If they’re a good financial adviser and they’ve built up a great deal of trust with their clients and their clients trust them implicitly, see them as the centre of their community, the person they can go to for financial advice, then there’s an assumption there that there will be clients that will move.”</p>

The clients were used to walking past the office and dropping something in.”  </p>

In these circumstances the ex-employer will often recognise the reality of the situation and accept that there is no way they will be able to stop these investors from following this adviser, wherever he or she may be going.  Ms Poole gave a number of examples of this occurring from her own knowledge.

This, I find, was not a concession introduced especially for the Edward Jones advisers but was, as Mr Hazelton explained, the course usually adopted with most advisers recruited, the higher initial charges being deliberately included in the draft SLA to ensure, so far as possible, that advisers will have decided to make the commitment to Raymond James before the final SLA is signed.  </p>

It was the income generated which Raymond James regarded as the most important aspect and which would have the greatest impact on the adviser, because they were being asked to guarantee a level of income over a period of time. Whilst there is clearly a correlation between the level of assets and the revenue generated, an adviser who had, for example, only £5 million of assets but who generated £3000 of revenue per month from fees and commissions would be, in Mr Hazelton’s words, “a very good fit for us”. So long as the adviser was generating the revenue the company was not so concerned about the asset levels per se.  If an adviser raised questions about paragraph (f) 1, prior to entering into the SLA, Mr Hazelton would tell him or her that they were “…not really too bothered about the asset level.  The thing that really counts is meeting those revenue levels”.</p>

We don’t know whether they’re going to move or not.  And nor does the adviser. So really...we can’t be absolute about this number.  What we want to do is to get the adviser to commit to us that they’re seriously going to undertake this level.”  Discussions may subsequently take place as to the figures agreed and the revenue being generated, with a view to renegotiation or deferment.  </p>

However, whilst it is meant to be taken seriously by the adviser, Raymond James are unlikely to decide to exercise that right where the adviser’s business is nevertheless developing well and she/he is putting in the necessary effort.  His evidence that there had never been a case where the SLA was terminated because of the adviser’s failure to meet the minimum charge levels was unchallenged.</p>

In rejecting this suggestion, Mr Hazelton emphasised that what Raymond James were looking for from these advisers was “not so much the asset levels ….but evidence that people were able to grow their business quickly.”  Some advisers had assets of around £9 million, but it had taken them nine or ten years to build up that level of assets, which was unattractive.  Raymond James were more attracted by those advisers who had been able to build up a business quickly and who had got to a reasonable level of assets.  He emphasised, as did Mr Cherriman, that the £10 million criterion was a guideline figure in this respect, but it was not “an absolute cut off.”</p>

The implied suggestion was that Raymond James were in reality interested only in the asset levels each adviser had and not the time it had taken them to get there.  I do not accept that suggestion.  The purpose of this table was to provide a snapshot of all the  information concerning each adviser gathered together in one place.  It did not contain any references to the views formed about each adviser’s capabilities and potential after meeting them and discussing their background and work.  Mr Hazelton, speaking with some thirty years of recruiting experience, stated, “…recruiting isn’t a science. It is more of an art…you make judgments….I have to look at an individual and say: based on what I know about this individual what do I think that they can do…you build a picture…you have to make a picture as to whether they are entrepreneurial or not…My judgment would be based on having met them, having talked to them, having got a sense of the kind of individual that they are.”  </p>

Even if they had to deal only with new clients.”  Even in the case of those advisers with lower asset levels and revenues, Pieter Burger, Barry Bennett and Stuart Hutton, he was confident from what he knew of them that these, “…were people that we would like to work with because they showed the characteristics of people that could build a business from scratch.” </p>

I deal with the individual Defendants below but, on all the information which Raymond James had obtained about them, I do not consider it can reasonably be said that any one of these six Defendants was unlikely to achieve the requirements of the SLA, based purely on investments from new clients with whom they had not previously dealt, or that Raymond James knew or believed this to be the case.  A number of them had started their careers as financial advisers at Edward Jones from scratch, knowing nothing about the business but knocking on doors, establishing connections within their communities and dealing with large numbers of clients within a relatively short timescale.  After two or three years they had developed a presence and a reputation, which led in turn to other referrals and connections with lawyers, accountants and other “introducers” to higher net worth clients.  </p>

I find that the reason for this advice was simply to avoid the “operational complexity” that would result from having many different Schedules of Fees and Commissions (SOFACs).  The advisers were, however, still free to develop their own charging structure if they wished and the advice given, if rejected, as it was in some cases, was not imposed on anyone.  </p>

This suggestion was in my view misplaced.  The companies referred to were Raymond James, Edward Jones, Towry and Killick &amp; Co, who are not part of the Raymond James group but are minority shareholders only.  Edward Jones was the company the advisers had come from.  Killick &amp; Co. provided a helpful comparison with Edward Jones.  Towry had a wholly different type of investment proposition, so that it made sense to include them for comparison purposes; and Raymond James advisers were operating in the stockbroking market.  </p>

The evidence suggests, rather, that Raymond James were helping advisers to develop charging structures that were attractive to all clients, not just clients who might wish to transfer their assets from Edward Jones.  </p>

Mr Hazelton explained the reasoning behind that advice in this way: “…when clients move assets from one place to another where there’s not much advice to be given then you probably shouldn’t charge the clients for moving those assets.  And we certainly don’t – Raymond James doesn’t levy a charge to the client for transferring those assets.  There’s a cost to us but we absorb that cost because we think it’s fair to them.  So that was a suggestion we put to the advisers.”  I accept that explanation and reject the suggestion being made that Raymond James were seeking to persuade the advisers to use this as a means of encouraging clients to move their assets across. </p>

Since the format and the wording on the form was put together with input from their solicitors, I accept Mr Hazelton’s evidence that his statement may be inaccurate in this respect.  Accepting, in addition, that it might not be “a perfect document”, Mr Hazelton nevertheless regarded it as “an important part of the picture” in that “on its own it doesn’t mean very much but when you put it alongside all of the other things that we had put in place, short of actually going to see every client ourselves to ask them how they’d found out, I don’t think we could have done much more.” </p>

The advisers were then taken through a highly structured, twelve months transition process to help them get their business up and running, including attendance at a Training and Orientation session. The first three to six months of this process were very intensive.  They included help on marketing Raymond James as part of the advisers’ proposition, and the provision of marketing materials for advisers to use with clients if they asked questions.  Some investors want to know, for example, who Raymond James is, how safe their assets are, or where the client cash is, and the materials are designed to enable advisers to answer all these queries and to deal with other, general matters.  Other investors have no interest in any of this information.  These materials are designed to be taken to meetings or to be sent as follow up, where appropriate. </p>

That is the template that the client would complete in full, based on what the client wanted to do, whether they wanted to transfer their assets in specie, or liquidate everything to cash, or choose a combination of the two.

Mr Tolley’s cross-examination was lengthy and searching but, in my judgment, the evidence they gave was consistent and compelling. I reject without hesitation any suggestion that Raymond James deliberately created a false paper trail to conceal their complicity in the solicitation of clients from Edward Jones.  Having regard to the whole of the evidence in this case, the allegations against Raymond James do not withstand scrutiny.  I am not persuaded that either Mr Cherriman or Mr Hazelton, who was the only witness from Raymond James to whom the allegations were put specifically, ever intended that the advisers should encourage as many clients as possible to transfer their investments and business from Edward Jones to Raymond James; or that they either knew the advisers were going to solicit their clients or didn’t care one way or the other, because they believed that responsibility could be allocated to the advisers if there was a problem; or that they deliberately closed their eyes to the obvious.  The evidence, on analysis, demonstrates in my view entirely the opposite. Whilst, as Mr Hazelton realistically agreed, he was willing to accept the benefits afforded by those transfers, Raymond James, like Towry, is a commercial organization.  Failing to turn away business that you genuinely believe has lawfully come your way is an unlikely scenario in the real world.  </p>

In my view Towry significantly underestimated the impact that these closures would have on clients and advisers alike.  The fact that this would end the ability of clients to retain high street access to their advisers in their local communities was not considered by Mr Fisher to be a loss of any real significance.  His comment “I’m not familiar with the concept of clients popping in – why would they?” indicated, in my view, his failure to understand the importance of this facility to both advisers and clients, as was clear from a number of those who gave evidence.  Mr Hazelton’s graphic observation that closing the local offices was like “severing the umbilical cord” was the more accurate analogy.   </p>

Part of his job was to help in the re-allocation of clients to new advisers, where their previous adviser left the company.  This process was overseen by Kerry Nicholls, Regional Manager for Client Services.  It became clear to her in early November that adviser resignations were likely to be higher than anticipated.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The practice initially was to designate each leaver’s clients as “orphaned clients” and to allocate the leaver’s entire client book to another interim adviser immediately.  Towry tried to place a client with an adviser who was nearest to them, in terms of office location, and who had appropriate experience for the level of their investments.  The aim was for a suitable adviser to contact the clients as soon as possible, to address any concerns they had about the acquisition or about their investments.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As Mr Ranson explained, however, the result was often that an interim adviser was allocated up to 400 clients to contact.  Allan Robotham, a Towry wealth adviser in Nottingham, confirmed that in January he was given a list of 300-400 new clients to advise, as a result of the departure of other advisers (not any of the Defendants).  Mr Ranson confirmed that this was a much higher number of reallocations than he had expected (he thought 100 to 150 would be typical), and it was plainly not a permanent solution.  He accepted in cross-examination that, even allowing three appointments per day (which would be excessive), it would take 6 months for the adviser to see every client.  Whilst, as he observed, not every client would decide to realign his investments, the availability of an adviser to give reassurance was not, in my view, dependent upon the value of a client’s assets.  Even clients with relatively low value assets may have regarded contact from an adviser at this time as important to them.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Ranson stated that it soon became clear that the clients would have to be split into smaller groups.  The system devised was therefore that the adviser initially allocated was to discuss clients’ requirements with their regional manager and they would then identify former Edward Jones advisers who were staying on, who could take permanent responsibility for new clients. The location of an adviser’s office would be taken into account, as well as the value of the client’s investments, in making this permanent allocation.  The permanent advisers were all told to contact their new clients as soon as possible and to attempt to visit them in person to review their investments, to reassure them about the acquisition, and to discuss at the same time whether the Towry proposition (the IIM) would be suitable for them.</p>

A number of “Transitional Advisers” were therefore asked to contact clients whose allocated permanent adviser had left, pending the appointment of another, permanent adviser.

At this point Towry Marketing, with Rebecca Warren as manager, took over responsibility for the allocation strategy, as a result of the pressure of work on the Client Service Team.  A letter was created by the marketing department and sent, on 4 March, to 8,624 unallocated clients, giving an update as to the integration process and explaining that details of a new adviser would be given within a month.  It is unclear how many of the 388 clients listed in the Table attached to the Amended Particulars of Claim were included amongst that number.</p>

On the evidence I find that, notwithstanding Towry’s wish to ensure that advisers communicated with clients as soon as possible, following news of the acquisition, the high numbers of advisers leaving, at different times, over the period from November to May, meant that there were delays, and sometime substantial delays in clients being contacted by a new adviser.  As Paul Wright accepted, in general terms the longer the gap in communicating with an “orphaned” client, the more difficult it will be to retain him.  Clients with large investments in particular “are likely to feel less well treated”, creating a risk that they would not stay.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">After these meetings there was an internal discussion about the merits of Mr Bennett’s application.  Mr Cherriman’s initial view had been that they would be turning him down.  Mr Hazelton described his asset and revenue levels, as shown in his FA Performance Summary, as being “a little lower than we were looking for.”  However, having met him and discovered his full background, he assessed him as someone who was likely to be successful with Raymond James.  He had been able to build, successfully, “two books of business”, at Allied Dunbar and then at Edward Jones, and he assessed him as someone who was likely to build a successful business again.  Mr Cherriman described Mr Bennett, accurately in my view having heard him give evidence, as someone who “talks a good game”.  Mr Hazelton regarded him as being “out of kilter” with the other advisers in this sense because of his previous experience and the fact that he had a number of clients who had dealt with him in the past and who, Mr Bennett believed, would want to continue to deal with him.      </p>

He had not generated the revenue that would qualify him for transition assistance from Raymond James and he received a more modest payment (as did Pieter Burger and Stuart Hutton) than those who did qualify (Wayne Hayhurst, Tom Spain and James Chandler), towards his start up and legal costs.

If, however, they both initiated the contact and wanted him to continue to be their adviser, he was able to do so without breaching his contract.   It appears that he sent a formal copy of the legal advice he had received to Mr Hazelton on 16 March and then provided an invoice in order to receive payment for his legal costs.  Mr Hazelton reminded him in writing at this point of the terms of the SLA, in respect of the restrictive covenants, and of the need for him to comply with them and to expect Towry to enforce them.     </p>

In this respect, whilst he knew of Stuart Hutton and whilst Pieter Burger was a colleague and friend, it was pure coincidence that they all ultimately decided to move to an organisation that provided the “closest fit” with the Edward Jones model.  He had never met or spoken to James Chandler, Wayne Hayhurst, Tom Spain or Tracey Simpson before they joined Raymond James.  </p>

In addition, of the 28 households, more than 10 of the individuals held less than £30,000 in investments with Edward Jones and a further 9 held less than £100,000.

He reads the financial press regularly and he stated that he would “never give discretionary management.”  He met Mr Bennett at the Kingsbridge show in September 2009, where Edward Jones had a stall.  He asked Mr Bennett to come and see him so that he could determine whether he wanted to use his services as his advisory stockbroker. At that point he was managing his investments himself.  Having met him and been satisfied as to his expertise and as to the fees and relevant infrastructure at Edward Jones, he decided to invest with that firm.  He got on well with Mr Bennett and considered that they had much in common, particularly an interest in sport, and Mr Bennett had knowledge of things that he did not, namely tax and complex investment vehicles.  In the relatively short time they had known each other before the acquisition they had had a number of “healthy discussions and debates” and he liked to be actively involved in the investment decisions. </p>

I told him  that I was aware of the proprieties but that I was perfectly able to contact him and that I had decided, before this phone call, to continue to use his services  provided he found a suitable new firm.  We agreed he would contact me if and  when that happened.  There was then a gap of a month or two before he told me of Raymond James and we then had a meeting at my home at which I formally agreed to use his services.  He was at pains to stress that this was my decision, which it was, because he was not allowed to solicit his old clients.”    </p>

Whilst Mr Bennett thought that there were other reasons for his decision to transfer his investments, arising out of negative views Mr Bunn had expressed to him about in house, discretionary management of investments, I accept Mr Bunn’s evidence that in fact the sole reason at the time was his wish to stay with Mr Bennett as his adviser, so long as he found appropriate new employment.  He had written to Mr Bennett to this effect on 26 March 2010, when he discovered that legal action was being taken against him.</p>

Strangely, it appears that, since he transferred his investments to Raymond James, Towry have continued to write to him, on a number of occasions, as if he remained a client of theirs, giving him the name of his new adviser and, by letter of 30 November 2010, sending a valuation for his custody and dealing service.</p>

In the phone call he made, on or around Christmas Eve, Mr Bunn had asked Mr Bennett to contact him when he had found new employment.  Mr Bennett’s mobile phone bill for this period indicated that he had made two short calls (lasting only some 40 seconds each) to Mr Bunn on 5 and 6 January and then a longer call (just under 5 minutes) on 22 January.

By way of general observation, the phone bills adduced in evidence in this case do not show any incoming calls, which renders the full picture of telephone activity incomplete and potentially misleading.  Mr Bennett stated that he may well have been returning calls after messages were left for him and I accept on the evidence I heard that this was likely to be the case.  The mobile phone bills of other Defendants were also put to other clients called and, in some cases, their evidence was that a call to them from one of the Defendants was a response to messages that the clients had left themselves, asking him or her to call.  The mobile phone bill evidence was not therefore of any real assistance in the circumstances but, in Mr Bennett’s case, I accept that the longer call on 22 January, which was just after he had signed the SLA, was likely to be a call in which Mr Bennett told Mr Bunn about his success in obtaining a position at Raymond James, in accordance with Mr Bunn’s request to him to do so.  </p>

He told me he was leaving that firm and I decided I wished him to continue as my adviser.”  Mr Bunn’s evidence, which I accept, is that the first sentence was in fact incorrect or, as he described it, “loose phrasing”, because he had contacted Mr Bennett only after he had received the letter from Edward Jones informing him that Mr Bennett had left.  Mr Bunn’s evidence that he had phoned Mr Bennett on 24 December was not challenged.  He rejected the suggestion that Mr Bennett was indicating the answer he should give to this question, as do I.  </p>

The details in some of them were completed by Mr Bennett.  This was the case in respect of all the clients listed in the Table.  Any notes he recorded at these meetings were made on the forms themselves, which have all been disclosed.

Whilst Mr Bunn could not recall it I find that, as part of their discussions, Mr Bennett told him that there would be no charge for the transfer of the accounts to Raymond James.  Like Mr Bunn, I do not consider it correct to describe this conversation between them, as Mr Tolley suggested, as a “presentation” given by Mr Bennett, but there is no dispute that he gave Mr Bunn information, probably together with a booklet, as to the fees and charges that would apply at Raymond James.  </p>

The fact that there’s a massive or small firm behind him doing all of the background work is, of course, important, but…as far as I’m concerned, Barry is my stockbroker and he works for a firm that does all the background work which I find acceptable.”  In his letter of 26 March Mr Bunn stated that, had Mr Bennett not found suitable employment, he would have left Edward Jones/Towry and continued to manage his own investments, as he had done before meeting him.      </p>

This view was strengthened by his evidence that “We’d been through all this only a few months previously or something very similar with Edward Jones”, and that the important thing to him was the personal relationship with the adviser.  In most of the time he had worked as a stockbroker he said that there hadn’t been all these forms and “bumph” now required by the legislation, and that “things were far more relaxed and people worked on a sort of basis of honesty and trust.”       </p>

Such letters were also sent to clients by Pieter Burger and Stuart Hutton.  Mr Bennett agreed that this letter, prepared from a generic template, and any notes he had made on it at the meeting, contained a summary of the discussion he had with the clients when he met them and was a formal record of what was agreed.    </p>

I have referred to this evidence earlier on in this judgment.  Mr Anderson considered this whole range of documentation to indicate that the Defendants were giving advice to the clients, promoting Raymond James to them and justifying the clients’ reasons for wishing to transfer.  He stated that, in his personal opinion, he had seen “considerable evidence of solicitation of the clients and promotion of Raymond James” and referred to being “perfectly satisfied” from these documents that there had been solicitation.  He gave me the benefit of his personal opinion on the strengths of Towry’s case in this respect on a number of occasions. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">He referred expressly in his witness statement to the suitability letters sent by Mr Bennett, after Towry had commenced these proceedings, which he regarded as “striking in their pro forma nature”.  He also considered that they contained information which was inaccurate, incomplete and misleading in a number of respects, that they were “designed to induce clients into transferring their business”, and that they were “a device to transfer to Raymond James.”  I understand his reasoning to be that “a suitability letter is advice and can be nothing else in regulatory terms.” For an execution-only transaction the adviser need not justify suitability but he must do so for an advised transaction.  Sending a suitability letter, such as the one sent to Mr and Mrs Bunn on 6 May, indicated in his view that the adviser gave advice to the clients and thereby solicited them in breach of his contract.  If this were correct it would also amount to a clear breach of the undertaking given by Mr Bennett to the Court in March 2010, on Towry’s application for interim relief.</p>

She is a retired deputy head-teacher.  Ms Hirst regarded Mr Bennett as a friend and stated, “There was never any question of me going to anyone else but Barry for financial advice, I trust him and consider myself a client of his as opposed to whatever firm he happens to be working for…I trust his advice and have got used to him.  He is always straight with me and I am guided by him… I go wherever Barry goes.”  She had a number of different types of investments and would discuss every investment she made with him.  Her portfolio had grown under his guidance and she described herself as very happy with what he did.

In fact she said she did not realise that things had changed until, in about January 2010, she received a statement of account and found a phone message from Sally Burn-Jones, informing her that she was now her adviser.  This, she said, made her “extremely concerned and angry… because Barry has been my adviser for over 10 years and I had no desire whatsoever to change…” She did not return this call because “there was never any question of me remaining at Edward Jones without Barry.”  </p>

Nor is it disputed that charges would have been discussed, although she could not recall what was said.  Her evidence was that she trusted Mr Bennett implicitly over what charges were involved and had “absolute trust” in him that the charges made would be fair and honest.  She had no idea what Towry would have charged her and she had no trust in them.

I rang him after Edward Jones contacted me to change my adviser to Sally Burn-Jones.  This I did not want to do and I stated that I wished to stay with Barry Bennett.”  She strongly denied being encouraged by Mr Bennett to answer the question in this way and I accept her evidence on this point.  I also accept her evidence that she was very angry to suddenly receive statements from Towry, with no previous communication, and to be told that Ms Burn-Jones was her new adviser.  She expressed her views in forthright terms, “I knew nothing about this woman.  I had never met her. I had no wish to meet her.  And I thought it was an insult.” </p>

Ms Burn-Jones was told to speak to as many of these clients as possible, concentrating on those who held the most high value investments.  In two rounds, during December and January, I accept that Ms Burn-Jones made phone calls or left messages for all the clients concerned.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For a number of reasons, however, I do not accept Ms Burn-Jones’ evidence as reliable on this point.  First, there are no notes of any meetings or conversations she had with Mr Bennett’s clients and no other evidence confirming this to be the case.  Secondly, for the reasons already given above when considering Towry’s communication process with clients generally, this was a time of acute pressure for advisers when there must have been many conversations taking place at different times with both her clients and Mr Bennett’s clients.  These conversations were mostly on the phone, Ms Burn-Jones stating that she probably had only five meetings with Mr Bennett’s clients, which in my view makes an accurate assessment of a marked change in attitude by one set of clients inherently improbable.  </p>

It is correct that, on this occasion, Ms Hirst told her she was not interested in Towry and would be transferring her investments to Raymond James.  I am entirely satisfied, however, having heard Ms Hirst’s evidence, that this did not represent any change of attitude by Ms Hirst, whose decision throughout was that she would stay with Mr Bennett wherever he went.  I find that she had never said anything to the contrary, or to indicate initial interest in the IIM service, to Ms Burn-Jones at any stage.    </p>

When she arrived however “he told me he was no longer interested in Towry and that he was transferring his account to Barry Bennett.”  She also named William Skinner as a client who told her “that Barry Bennett had telephoned him”.

He saw Ms Burn-Jones in January, after she rang him to introduce herself.  However, he did not like what she had to offer and he decided to move his assets.  He telephoned Mr Bennett in March and asked him if he had now found employment.  Mr Bennett told him that he was now with Raymond James.

For these reasons I do not accept her evidence, to the same effect, concerning the client Vernon Lewis, from whom I did not hear because he had recently been injured in a fall and could not attend the trial.  Whatever Ms Burn-Jones’ impression may have been, as a result of talking to some of the clients whose adviser had been Mr Bennett, I am not persuaded on the evidence that their lack of interest in the Towry proposition and their decision to transfer their assets from Towry to Raymond James was the result of any change of heart due to persuasion or encouragement of them to do so by Mr Bennett. </p>

I have referred already to his evidence concerning the 28 households on this list. A clear pattern emerges. Between approximately March and June 2010, his evidence is that all these clients sought him out, in various ways, and asked him to continue to be their adviser.  All of them completed a HDYH form to this effect, often identifying the importance of the relationship they had with him as their adviser stating, in one case, that he wanted “continuity of personal contact”. Some clients told him they had had no contact from anyone at Towry, some had been contacted and said they had put Towry off, or that they had declined Towry’s proposal to move into their IIM.  In a number of cases Mr Bennett’s unchallenged evidence was that there were severe delays in completing the transfers once the requests were made.  Delays in transferring the investments were criticised by a number of the clients called in this case.</p>

I acknowledge that all these clients were not called on Mr Bennett’s behalf.  Nor did the other Defendants call all the clients on the Table concerning them, each calling only two clients to give evidence on their behalf.  However, calling all the clients would not have been proportionate, or realistic, in a case involving seven individual Defendants and over three hundred clients in total.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Court must proceed, in the case of each Defendant, on the basis of the evidence that was called.  The suggestion that the clients who were called on behalf of the Defendants were carefully selected goes nowhere if the evidence they gave is found to be credible and reliable, as I find it is in Mr Bennett’s case, having heard their evidence, thoroughly tested in cross-examination, and having regard to the evidence in the case as a whole.  I reject unhesitatingly the suggestion that Mr Bunn or Ms Hirst were partisan, in the sense that their evidence as to what happened was unreliable because it was tainted by a desire to “stand by” Mr Bennett.  Neither witness was seeking in any way to mislead the Court and this suggestion, which was not put to either of them, does not withstand scrutiny.  On the contrary I find that each was giving a full, frank and entirely honest account of their reasons for deciding to request a transfer of their investments.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Nor does there appear to me to be any proper basis for concluding that any other client investor, if called, would not have given evidence consistent with the account given by Mr Bennett in his statement concerning the circumstances in which they decided to transfer.  As Mr Quinn pointed out it was open to Towry to call any client listed in the Table.  Whilst first contact is not determinative of solicitation, how that contact came to be made and the circumstances in which it was made are clearly relevant factors.  On the facts of this case I do not regard it as wholly implausible either that the clients who requested to transfer all sought Mr Bennett out, rather than the other way around, or that they were all anxious for him to continue to act as their adviser.   Further, the hearsay witnesses who were called were not selected by Mr Bennett but, for the reasons I have given, the evidence of Mr Elliott and Mr Skinner did not advance Towry’s case against him. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Much of the cross-examination of Mr Bennett focused on the terms of the suitability letters he sent to clients after the meetings.  Their striking similarity, in particular as to the clients’ reasons for the transfer, which Mr Bennett accepted he had formulated himself to some extent, owes much, in my view, to the template and pro forma nature of the document prepared and the obligation upon the adviser to send such a letter.  On all the evidence before me, however, I find on balance that the decision of the clients previously advised by Mr Bennett to transfer their investments had already been made by the time they arrived at this meeting.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I find also that it was a decision that the clients had made by themselves, without any element of persuasion by Mr Bennett, mainly because of their wish for him to continue to act as their adviser and the importance attached to the continuity of that personal relationship.  Any inaccuracies concerning Towry, or concerning their proposition following the acquisition, which were contained in the reasons for transfer in the suitability letters, as I find, played no part whatsoever in the clients’ decision to transfer.  Mr Bunn’s evidence was unequivocal. None of those reasons influenced his decision in any way, his decision to transfer being made on the basis that he wished to retain Mr Bennett to act as his adviser.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I therefore reject the submission that the evidence in Mr Bennett’s case shows him to have exercised a material degree of persuasion by means of giving presentations to the clients, with a view to those clients transferring their business to Raymond James.  Making particular recommendations, explaining fees and costs, or giving information or advice as to how to give effect to their decision to transfer and move forward, after those clients had already made their decision to stay with Mr Bennett and to do what was necessary to bring that about, does not in my judgment evidence solicitation.  I am not satisfied to the requisite standard that Mr Bennett solicited any client in breach of Clause 16.4.1 of his contract.   </p>

Other clients, from whom I did not hear, also told Mr Burger that no-one had contacted them.  Mr Stone stated that it became clear, by mid to late January, that he would not have time to service all Mr Burger’s clients as well as his own and the majority of them were reallocated at his request.

However, if a client already had an account with him or only had investment needs there was no need to follow the financial planning process.  For a new client wishing, for example, to buy some BP shares or to invest a lump sum he would provide him with the Terms of Business, and the Schedule of Fees.  He would then complete an ISAT (investment strategy) form and, if necessary, a basic personal financial questionnaire, and then the relevant ISA or deal account form.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At the meeting on 24 February, Ms Maltman signed a letter to Towry of that date, requesting that they transfer all her stock and cash in specie to Raymond James.  She was asked if she had understood that she could have continued to hold her assets in exactly the same way on the Edward Jones platform and to continue to receive advice from Mr Burger whilst they were held there.  She had understood this, but she stated that she did not want to, that it was her choice not to and that she “wanted to go with Pieter.”   Mr Quinn pointed out that there was no suggestion in the letter of 17 December that she could have continued to use Mr Burger as her adviser if she left her investments on the Edward Jones/Towry platform.  I have also referred previously to the evidence given in this respect by Mr Hazelton, which I accept, to the effect that Raymond James would not have regarded this course as either practical or appropriate. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This remained Ms Maltman’s position throughout her evidence.  When she was asked if she had understood that she would have ended up incurring a higher cost by transferring her assets, her response was, “I didn’t stop to think about it, because I was going to go with Pieter anyway.”  Further questions as to whether or not she was aware that she was going to be charged transaction costs for the transfer met with the response “I don’t think I bothered about it at that stage.”  She could not remember what he had said about the payment of an annual advisory fee for the future.  </p>

She stated that she had “checked out Towry on the internet” and that what she had read about them “wasn’t very encouraging.”  Further, although she was informed by Towry that she had a new adviser, in fact no-one had ever contacted her.  She was also notified, by letter of 12 February, that the Honiton office had closed permanently and that her file had been transferred to an office in Exeter, about sixteen miles away.  </p>

For various reasons set out in his statement but which it is unnecessary for me to refer to, in particular since Mr Tolley did not have the opportunity to cross-examine this witness, he became angry with the service being offered and provided by Towry at this time and he “started to look around” in about March.

Mr Lobley described “being on the same wavelength” as Mr Burger, whom he knew and trusted.  He described himself as someone who would decide for himself where to place his business and as liking to control his own destiny.  He liked the benefit of a broker’s advice and was “prepared to pay a small fee for that.”  The pro forma, suitability letter sent to him was dated 1 July 2010.  </p>

This witness stated that there were two reasons for transferring his assets to Raymond James, first that Pieter Burger was working for them and they offered the kind of service he wanted, but also, “most importantly they are not Towry.”   Whilst no doubt Mr Tolley would have wished to challenge the basis for his criticisms of Towry, and I make no finding I respect of them, it is clear that Mr Lobley held strong views in this respect.  In his contemporaneous letter of complaint about the service Towry had offered him, dated 17 May 2010, he referred to being “appalled at the all round lack of integrity and inept central management.”  I find that these views played an important part in his decision to transfer his investments away from Towry at this time and that this decision was arrived at without any element of persuasion by Mr Burger.</p>

All of them contacted him and asked him to contact them when he was back in business, or asked him to come and assist them and to continue to look after their money, or told him that they wanted to stay with him.  Some of them had not had any contact at all from Towry.  Others had seen or spoken to a Towry wealth adviser before contacting Mr Burger and did not like or want the service that was being offered to them.  In a couple of cases (Ms Leddra and Ms Mitchell) the clients had already signed paperwork to transfer their funds to the IIM before contacting Mr Burger to say they had changed their mind, asking him to continue to advise them.

Given the pressures that Mr Stone was under at this time, and the large number of client reallocations made, at his request, I am not satisfied on the evidence that the conversations he had, mostly on the telephone, with those clients with whom he had more than one conversation, could justify his conclusion that “it was clear from the tone of the conversations that clients who had previously been very positive about the Towry proposition had been persuaded to continue with their investments with another financial adviser.”  I do accept that some of the clients may initially have expressed interest and then changed their minds, but I am not satisfied that Mr Stone was in a position to say that any persuasion had been applied to them.  </p>

In my view Mr Burger responded thoughtfully and consistently to sustained cross-examination. Many of the observations I made when considering the same issues raised by Towry in Mr Bennett’s case seem to me to apply with equal force in relation to Mr Burger.  Although each case must be, and has been considered separately, the issues raised are common to both cases, and indeed to the cases of all the individual Defendants.  I refer in particular, in this respect, to Mr Anderson’s views as to the terms of the suitability letters, about which Mr Burger was also cross-examined closely, to the contents of the investment documents and to my observations at paragraphs 630 – 636 above, concerning the evidence relating to all the clients listed in the Table.</p>

They were both looking at other organisations, as well as Raymond James.  He had seen Mr Burger once before, at a training course.  He had met Tom Spain whilst travelling to New York, for Edward Jones, and they had spoken to each other occasionally after that, having more regular contact after the acquisition, when they spoke about Towry and about other options, including Raymond James.  He had met Tracey Simpson on a number of occasions but never spoke to her about Towry or his future plans.  He had never met Barry Bennett or Stuart Hutton before they joined Raymond James. </p>

I find that Mr Cherriman went through the same issues that he covered at other meetings.  Mr Chandler stated that there was no discussion about client banks, other than the general information given to them that Raymond James were interested in advisers who had proved that they could build a business of over £10 million.  The next day Mr Chandler was sent an AQ, which he completed on 8 November and emailed back. Tamsin Potter sent him a list of law firms who could provide the relevant legal advice.  It appears that the other advisers at this meeting, apart from Mr Hayhurst, decided to go elsewhere, eventually joining St James’ Place.</p>

The advice he received included guidance on what could and could not be said to clients, and he understood solicitation to be “not just about seeking out clients but...also saying certain things whilst still employed and preparing to compete against your employer for the eventuality you might leave.”  In any discussions with clients before leaving Towry he adhered closely to a “script”, in which he told them he could not say that he would definitely stay with Towry because he did not yet know enough about their investment proposition.  He also stressed that he had restrictive covenants, which he took very seriously, and that, if he did leave, he would be prohibited from contacting them.  He said nothing to suggest that clients should call him if he left. </p>

His brief, handwritten notes relating to this meeting contained a list of subjects headed “fundamentals”, including the words “segmentation”, “packaging and pricing services” and “convert existing clients”, which Mr Tolley drew attention to in cross-examination.  Mr Tolley suggested, referring to that last phrase, that Mr Hazelton was emphasising to the advisers, amongst other things, the importance of them persuading their existing clients to move their business and assets across to Raymond James.    </p>

Mr Hazelton suggested that the advisers may have been asking about the process involved if any Edward Jones clients decided that they wanted their investments to be transferred.  On the other hand, from its appearance and position at the head of the document, it appears more likely to be a list of issues that Mr Hazelton was himself wanting to raise with the advisers in the meeting.  There is, however, nothing in any of the notes that follow it to indicate that existing clients were ever discussed.  </p>

Mr Hazelton agreed that his Performance Summary showed that he had the ability to build a business quickly and that, having met him, he was someone they “definitely wanted”.  He assessed Mr Chandler as someone who was determined but also “quite conservative”, in the sense that he was not the sort of man to take risks.  That was, in my view, a shrewd observation. In various emails sent to Mr Cherriman, before he moved to Raymond James, Mr Chandler asked a number of detailed questions about features of the business model at Raymond James or about the fees and costs, which showed him to be proceeding cautiously and thinking carefully before pursuing his application.  He referred in one such email, sent on 10 December, to being “...a lot more paranoid after dealing with Edward Jones.”</p>

He asked for feedback on his suggestions.  Mr Chandler discussed this with the other advisers and responded on 7 January.  Mr Tolley places reliance on some of the comments made by Mr Chandler in this email, in relation to the case against all three advisers and Raymond James.

If we make it too difficult for ourselves now there will be no conversation to have, the clients could already have been lost….we need a default option or last choice option to keep our existing client bank in the short-term….Please bear in mind that without retaining the bulk of our best clients we do not have much of a business to build on….I am sure we will learn an awful lot of new ideas from you and even probably change our target client, type of business etc. but this is where we are at present and we need as much help retaining our existing clients as possible.”</p>

If they’re a good financial adviser and they’ve built up a great deal of trust with their clients and their clients trust them implicitly, see them as the centre of their community, the person they can go to for their financial advice, then there’s an assumption that there will be clients that will move.  I won’t have read too much into this….” </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Hazelton had a similar reaction, describing the substance of this email in his reply as a “well thought through response”. He considered that it was. The Edward Jones charging structure was completely different from that at Raymond James and, “…we felt that we needed to give them some help and support on how to present our SOFAC…these advisers hadn’t much experience of developing their own charging structure, we gave them some input into that…they had made a decision that they didn’t want to work with Towry.  They knew that they had strong relationships with their clients…we looked at these guys and said: we understand the way they work.  They imbed themselves in their local community. They have very strong relationships with their clients. They’re known locally.  They have a local office. There’s a very strong local representation. If that’s removed from those clients, is there a chance that they will want to deal with their former adviser?  I think there’s a decent chance that they would.”  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The purpose of this series of email exchanges, as Mr Hazelton explained, was to enable the advisers to create an attractive charging structure, and to be skilled in doing so for all clients, not just any clients who might decide that they wanted to transfer their assets from Edward Jones.  I accept that evidence. I also accept Mr Chandler’s evidence that, in his response, he was doing no more than providing feedback on the points being made, and doing so on the basis that the advisers should be able to present an attractive charging structure both to new clients and to clients who had decided for themselves that they wished to retain him as their adviser and to transfer their investments.  I arrive at that conclusion based on all the evidence in this case and, in particular what I find actually happened in relation to the contact that did take place between Mr Chandler and those clients who asked to transfer their assets.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At this point, I accept that Mr Chandler, Mr Hayhurst and Mr Spain, all of whom knew each other, were discussing their options together generally.  Mr Hayhurst’s reference, in an email to Mr Cherriman, to “planning” and “working as a group” was a reference to the joint discussions they were all involved in at this time.  They were also discussing the various fee structures that could arise at Raymond James and I find that, in January, they agreed the SOFAC they would all use.  I find nothing sinister in that, however. As Mr Cherriman observed, “…they were coming from a similar background.  They’d worked at the same organization.  They’d had experience of charging their clients in a certain way. And because of the industry requirements they were going to have to fundamentally change the way that they charged clients on an ongoing basis.  And we had suggested, perhaps, how they could make that transition.” He did not consider it unusual that they had discussed these issues together in this way.  Nor do I.            </p>

In the early days after the acquisition he was giving clients the message that he had been told to, namely that nothing would change.  In an email sent on 2 November to the client, Tony Beharrell, who had raised a query about the acquisition, Mr Chandler had said, about Towry, that “they do seem a very good company and have a good reputation”, and had told him that “as a client I don’t think you will see too much change other than a change of name on the statement at this stage…” His evidence was that this is what he was telling his clients generally at this stage.

They still had, or could easily find his contact details, and he would also bump into clients when shopping or jogging in the area, or in pubs and restaurants.  Whilst he was on garden leave he gave a standard response to any client, in accordance with the legal advice he had received, that he could not tell them what he was going to do at this time.  If they asked him when he could tell them, he said “after 3 February”.  He also told clients that, if they had any questions relating to their investments, they should direct them to the Edward Jones office in Swanland.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Chandler stated that there were various reasons why clients contacted him after he had left.  First, some of them had received no contact at all from Towry between the letters sent out on 23 October and the end of January.  A number of them had not received written notification of Mr Chandler’s departure and were calling the office and being told by the administrator that he had left.  Others had left messages at the office, but no-one was getting back to them.  Later on, some clients saw that the administrator had left and the office had closed.  Some had seen negative coverage about Towry in the media.  Other clients had had meetings, sometimes two or three meetings, with Towry advisers and had decided that the IIM proposition was not for them.  Most of the clients who contacted him were those with over £100,000 invested, with whom he had stronger relationships, and with whom Towry had already been in contact as a priority.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Chandler’s evidence was that all the clients listed in the Table decided that they wanted him to continue to be their adviser and asked him to transfer their assets to Raymond James.  When they had contacted him he would visit them, at their request, explain to them the Raymond James proposition and complete the relevant investment documentation, on which he would make any relevant notes.  Some said they would transfer straightaway and others did so after a second meeting and further completion of forms.  All of them completed the HDYH form.</p>

Again, a number of common themes emerge.  An example of a client who did not like the Towry offering was Mr Adamson, who had met the Towry wealth adviser David Tarbotton at Mr Chandler’s office and was told about the IIM.  Mr Adamson then rang Mr Chandler and told him that he did not want to change advisers again, after taking some years to decide to transfer to him in the first place and being pleased with the portfolio he had created for him.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At Mr Chandler’s request, which he made of all those clients who contacted him, Mr Adamson wrote to him to this effect on 18 February. I reject any suggestion that this was part of a deliberate plan to mislead or to create a cover for what was really solicitation activity on his part.  I find that there was an entirely innocent explanation for this request.  Mr Chandler had been advised that he needed to be able to demonstrate that clients had contacted him, had given him their contact details, had asked to retain his services and had explained how they had been informed about his departure from Edward Jones.  If they called him and left a message, only then would he return a call.  The decision to ask clients to write a letter to them in these circumstances was that of Mr Chandler who adopted a cautious approach to this issue, as to his application to join Raymond James.  It was not the result of any advice given by Raymond James.  Mr Hayhurst also made a similar request of his clients.  A note made by Mr Cherriman at the AQ meeting shows that Mr Chandler or Mr Hayhurst had referred expressly to asking any former clients to write such a letter.  This was part of a general discussion about the difficult situation they could find themselves in and how they could best avoid any suggestion that they had solicited such clients.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Other clients who asked to transfer referred to the excellent, or close relationship they had with Mr Chandler, or cited their wish to have an adviser in the local area, the good performance of their investments, or their dislike of the IIM or of discretionary management in general.  A number were angry, or could not understand how their adviser could just be changed without them having any input into the process.

Subsequently, however, Mr Chandler learned that Towry were refusing to transfer because Mr Covell had changed his mind.

She was suspicious of someone she had never met wanting to speak to her about her investments, which were performing well. She told Mr Chandler that she wanted to retain him as her adviser and wrote to him to that effect on 18 February.

He referred to no particular complaint having being voiced in explanation, or to clients having said that they were making no decisions about their financial investments for the time being.  He named Mr and Mrs Bills as an example, which seems to me to be entirely consistent with Mr Chandler’s evidence that they told him they had listened to what Mr Pykett proposed, but then decided to go elsewhere.  Mr Williamson, whose evidence at trial is addressed below, had also met Mr Pykett and listened to his proposal before deciding that it was not for him and telephoning Mr Pykett to tell him.

Mr Berry made essentially the same point as that made by Ms Burn-Jones and Mr Stone in relation to Mr Bennett and Mr Burger, respectively.  His references to detecting a cooling off of initial enthusiasm for the Towry proposition, without voicing any complaint, seem to me to be subject to the same deficiencies, or at any rate to indicate no more than that some clients were sufficiently interested to listen initially to what Towry had to say but then, after thinking about it, decided that it was not for them.  In cross-examination Mr Berry conceded that he had “attempted to contact” rather than actually contacted all the clients on the list, and that there were in fact only two clients he contacted who had then cancelled meetings with him, a Mr Jenkins and a Ms Hawson.  I do not regard his evidence as supportive of the allegations of wrongful conduct against Mr Chandler.  </p>

They held a mixed portfolio, which they had designed and worked on with him after moving from Rathbones because they were unhappy with its content and balance.   Mr Williamson met Mr Chandler when he knocked on his door in 2005.  They had kept in touch and he would see him about locally because his office was in Swanland where they lived.  The prospect of a local office and a more personal service were the most important reasons behind their decision to move to Edward Jones, rather than to Citi Quilter, who also made them a proposal, and thereafter they had developed a good rapport with Mr Chandler.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On the day that news broke of the acquisition Mr Williamson had been walking past the office and saw Mr Chandler inside.  He described him as being “still in shock” and said that he knew nothing more than the fact of the acquisition by Towry. The letters of 23 October then arrived.  Mr Williamson said that he was immediately suspicious of the phrase “business as usual”.  However, no urgent work was required on his portfolio at the time and he felt that he could sit back and “let the transition happen”.  However, as the weeks sent by he received no communication at all from Towry. There was “complete silence” and Mr Williamson became increasingly disillusioned.  </p>

Mr Chandler told him that he had left and was contemplating his future, but that for contractual reasons he could not say any more.   He did not mention Raymond James and he did not even say whether he was going to remain in the financial advice industry. Mr Williamson asked him to keep him informed.  He then sent Mr Chandler a letter, dated 11 January, in which he said that he was stunned to hear that he had left and was “particularly disappointed that the new management have not even bothered to let me know of your departure and presumably the appointment of a successor.”  He stated, “I feel that we have built up a very positive relationship which we do not readily want to lose. Please keep us informed of your future plans as it may well be that we will decide that ongoing management of our portfolio is taken away from Towry Law.”  In fact Mr Williamson’s evidence was that he had written this letter himself and not as a result of a request from Mr Chandler for him to do so.</p>

At the meeting Mr Pykett explained the IIM and Towry’s proposals for ongoing management of their portfolio.  Mr Williamson stated, “…it became clear to me that it certainly was not “business as usual” as had been promised.”  He considered that Mr Pykett appeared “uncomfortable and embarrassed” about suggesting something so different from the portfolio which had been performing very well only months before.  Mr Williamson stated that he “did not like the proposals one bit.”  </p>

A few days later he telephoned Mr Pykett and informed him that he would not be signing up with Towry and was considering his options.  In doing so he reconsidered the proposal he had received from Citi Quilter and also called Mr Chandler, whose mobile number he still had.  He described being pleasantly surprised to learn that Mr Chandler was setting up a local office again, but this time with Raymond James.  He knew the company well, because of time he had previously spent in the USA, and he had previously held a small portfolio with them and been satisfied with the service and with its performance.</p>

He found it attractive “because I knew the frontline adviser, James, and had worked with him for a while so I trusted him and I knew he had the support of the Raymond James back office which I also knew and trusted.” They were essentially providing a very similar service to that offered by Edward Jones.  He therefore decided to transfer their portfolio to Raymond James.  Some of the relevant investment documents were signed at a second meeting on 30 March.</p>

When Mr Tolley put to him that Mr Chandler had persuaded or encouraged him to move his business and investments from Towry to Raymond James he stated that there had been “absolutely no element of persuasion.” He had to make “a straight decision between James Chandler, Raymond James and other companies…I was not persuaded.”  </p>

Mr Williamson attributed his understanding to the information he had been given by Mr Pykett, but Mr Pykett did not accept this.  As it seems to me this is a dispute that I do not need to resolve. The important point, in my view, is that on the evidence before me I am satisfied that Mr Williamson genuinely held those views, that they were part of his reasoning in deciding to transfer, and that he did not hold them as a result of anything Mr Chandler had said to him.  </p>

His understanding was that this was an interim position, before he “fully signed up” with Raymond James, and he said that he had later signed another form requesting the advisory dealing service, which was what he wanted in the long term.  This is in fact what happened because Mr Williamson signed another form on 25 May 2010, changing to an advisory portfolio account at that time.  I find that it was a deliberate decision to adopt this course.  </p>

The suggestion that this step was deliberately taken in order to make it appear that no advice was being given, and thereby to conceal the fact of solicitation is, however, unsustainable.  Whilst Mr Williamson always wanted an advisory service, at the time he entered into the first, execution-only agreement, his assets were all still on the Towry platform. There was in fact a delay of several months before they were transferred.  Mr Chandler took the view that he was unable to advise on or deal with those assets whilst they were held there and Raymond James’ position was that this would be neither practical nor appropriate.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I find on the evidence that the reason this service was selected at the time was because Mr Chandler was executing only Mr Williamson’s instructions to transfer the assets.  Mr Tolley suggested to Cynthia Poole that it would be more logical, and more usual, if the client really wanted an advisory service, to sign up for such a service and then provide an execution-only instruction to the adviser.  Her response, however, noting that the same explanation had been given by all the Defendants who adopted this course, was that this was a perfectly legitimate and acceptable way of handling the transaction in the circumstances.   I accept that evidence and I reject the suggestion that this method was adopted as some sort of subterfuge or device for concealing the fact that advice was being given by Mr Chandler at a presentation, the aim of which was to persuade Mr Williamson, or indeed any other clients, to transfer.           </p>

Personal service and the identity of the adviser were important factors for her.

She received the letter from Towry in October telling her that nothing would change and, in early December, she went to visit family in Australia. Before she left she had sought some financial advice from Mr Chandler on her investments and a possible house purchase and he had given her advice.

Ms Young pencilled in a date for him to come and see her, but she regarded it as discourteous that Towry had not written to tell her about this change.  She knew nothing of the circumstances surrounding Mr Chandler’s departure and, after much thought, she decided to telephone him.  She told him that she would like to keep him as her financial adviser if he was remaining in the industry.

Her observation that “I wasn’t expecting to be in this situation and have a legal mind looking at it” was a genuine reaction to what she clearly regarded as an exercise in semantics. I reject entirely any suggestion that Ms Young had been prepared to draft this letter in accordance with Mr Chandler’s instructions, and in a way that would have been deliberately misleading.  Shortly before this suggestion was made, and in another context, Mr Tolley had been at pains to assure her that he was not suggesting that she had done anything wrong.  Her response, expressed in robust terms, was telling, “Had I remained with Towry I assume I would have been a valued client….what I resent is the fact that because I have chosen to take my business elsewhere they are implying that I’m open to being solicited, induced or encouraged to transfer my investments.

I find that he took conspicuous care to ensure that he followed the legal advice he was given at all times and the evidence showed him to be a   cautious individual as evidenced, for example, by the detailed queries he was raising with Towry, and then Raymond James concerning the offers made to him, and by his requests to clients to write letters to him about how they had contacted him.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The first time that Mr Hayhurst met Barry Bennett, Pieter Burger and Stuart Hutton was at the training and orientation meeting at Raymond James, following his decision to join that company. He had been through the training at Edward Jones with Tom Spain and since then regarded him as a friend, though he only found out that Mr Spain had joined Raymond James when he too had decided to join them.  Since joining Edward Jones he had become very good friends with James Chandler, who had already been employed there for two years when he joined.  He would ring him for ideas and to run something past him and they spoke frequently.  However, whilst they both discussed their various options, including joining Raymond James, after the acquisition, the decision to join Raymond James was his own, personal decision, as it was for Mr Chandler.  He had known Tracey Simpson since she joined Edward Jones and he would see her at various training events and regional meetings.  They lived near each other and became friends.  The circumstances in which she came to work with him at Raymond James will be addressed below.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Soon after news of the acquisition a colleague, Rafael Bravo-French, told Mr Hayhurst about Raymond James, having approached them himself.  Mr Hayhurst made some enquiries on 26 October and spoke to Mr Hazelton, who emailed him some more information on the same day.  He then attended the meeting with Mr Cherriman on 6 November, together with Mr Chandler and the other advisers.  </p>

Mr Cherriman also advised them to obtain their own legal advice.  Mr Hayhurst was sent an AQ, which he completed on 7 and 8 November and emailed back.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">He then attended the AQ meeting on 17 November, together with Mr Chandler, and I have referred already to what happened at this meeting.  Like Mr Chandler, Mr Hayhurst was an adviser with whom Raymond James were immediately impressed.  His performance summary showed him to be someone who had been able to grow a book of business very quickly.  Both Mr Hazelton and Mr Cherriman believed that he was someone who would be able to do so again.  It was clear that he was a well-respected figure in his local community. Mr Hazelton referred to him asking some searching questions at the meeting and he was aware that Mr Hayhurst was also looking at other firms at that time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In November Mr Hayhurst sought legal advice from Russell Jones &amp; Walker about his contract. The same solicitor had also advised Mr Chandler.  The restrictive covenants were all explained to him.  He was advised as to what he could and could not do and as to how, if he did not stay with Towry, he should deal with any former clients that contacted him.  He was given a “script” of what to say to any former clients whilst he was on garden leave.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Hayhurst was also impressed with Raymond James.

Whilst accepting that there would probably have been references to clients, or to high value clients, or to being approached, Mr Cherriman stated that, if something like this had been said, “alarm bells would have been ringing big style in my head.” </p>

In my view it is not possible to form a sensible view as to what Mr Cherriman was noting as being said at this point.  The notes may also refer to a number of discrete points which were being made over the course of several minutes.  I am not satisfied that Mr Hayhurst  referred at any stage to an approach, or any intention to approach Edward Jones high value clients with a view to encouraging them to transfer their assets from Towry to Raymond James.  Nor do I accept that Mr Cherriman was suggesting that he should.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is correct that Mr Hayhurst had previously raised a concern as to the requirement in the draft SLA (at paragraph (f)(i)) for him to generate at least £10 million of AUC within 12 months, but I find that he was reassured in this respect.  This was a potential point of concern generally for all the advisers and, as set out above when dealing with the evidence of Mr Hazelton, I find that they were reassured both that Raymond James were not concerned about the asset level and that “the thing that really counts is meeting those revenue levels.”  I am not persuaded therefore that the advisers felt under any pressure in this respect. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Further, the reference by Mr Hayhurst, in a request made on 5 February for earlier payment of the second instalment of his transition assistance because of all the upfront costs and “transfers taking perhaps one to two months to come across” was a reference to transfers generally, for any client wanting to move money to Raymond James wherever they may be, and not specifically for Edward Jones clients.  This was certainly how Mr Hazelton understood it, being “how the business works”, and I accept that evidence.     </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In denying the allegations against him Mr Hayhurst emphasised that he knew   himself to be capable of repeating the success he had at Edward Jones.  Whilst he believed that some of his clients would want to stay with him, all his future plans and projections were based on the premise that he would need to start again from scratch.  He did not see this as a problem.  He had become very profitable very quickly at Edward Jones and this time he had much more knowledge and experience.  He was still only 27 and he had his full career ahead of him, which he said that he would not have jeopardised by breaching the covenants which bound him and which he had accepted when he entered into the contract.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, he stated that any client who wanted to approach him would have been able to contact him quite easily, because they would still have his business card and mobile phone number.  He only had one mobile and would always answer a call from an unknown number, or return a missed call.  His mobile phone records show that he made a number of calls to clients on various days between late November and early December, but, as he was still an employee at this time, he was still required to deal with clients’ inquiries.  In any event, as noted previously, the records do not show any incoming calls and are therefore of limited assistance in this respect.  Clients could also find Mr Hayhurst on the internet, or through other family members in the community.  Sometimes he would just bump into them in the local area, at the gym or football ground, or in shops or restaurants. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">When a call, or missed call, to his mobile turned out to be from a former Edward Jones client I find that, before 4 February, he would always stick to the same form of words, i.e. the “script”, in accordance with his legal advice.  He told them that he was no longer their adviser, asked them to call the office number and told them that they would be referred to someone that could help them.  If they asked him about his future plans he told them he could not tell them at that time.  If he was then asked when he could tell them he informed them that his garden leave ended on the 4 February.  Mr Hayhurst stated that the conversation reached this point on many occasions, and that many clients told him they would call him back then because they wanted to know what his plans were.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Hayhurst said that the letter of 17 December, notifying clients that he had left, prompted many clients to call him in this way.  They had been told that Fraser Irvine was their new adviser and that the branch administrator would remain at the Longridge office and deal with any queries.  For a short time the Towry wealth adviser, Kat Mulvihill, moved to that office in mid-January, so as to be able to continue to deal with any queries.  The Longridge office then closed in late January or February and a notice was placed on the door, informing clients that any queries would now be dealt with through the Bracknell office, which was over two hundred miles away.   </p>

He was still based in the Longridge office, though working now for Raymond James, and he described a “flurry of calls and appointments” throughout February and March. When he was contacted in this way, in accordance with his legal advice he stated that he did not give the clients any specific information unless they asked for it.  If they asked him whether he was up and running again he confirmed that he was.  If the client asked him to come and see them he made an appointment to do so.</p>

Some stressed their concern about the closure of the Longbridge office or referred to the strong personal relationship they had with Mr Hayhurst.  A number of them spoke about the bad publicity they had seen concerning Towry.

If the client still wanted to proceed they would complete the relevant forms and open an account.  All of them completed the HDYH form.  When it was suggested to him that he gave a presentation at these meetings with a view to persuading the clients to move their investments to Raymond James he stated, “…if you had heard some of the phone calls that I received from clients and some of the clients that came into the office when we re-opened, you will have understood that there was no persuasion needed in any case….the clients did not need encouraging at all, absolutely none.  They were coming to me and they were encouraging me to take them on. All the persuasion and encouragement was the other way around.” </p>

In 2008 he was with the Halifax and, after meeting Mr Hayhurst, decided to move to Edwards Jones in February 2009.  The fact that Mr Hayhurst was “on the same wavelength” as him and worked locally was very important to him.  He wanted a personal service and regularly called in at the office for an update.  He also liked the fact that Mr Hayhurst had the backing of a large firm.  He therefore had a personal, transparent, broad ranging service with a local adviser in a reputable firm and Mr Hayhurst therefore “ticked all the boxes”. </p>

There was a second meeting on 28 April, when the ISAT form was signed.  Mr Hayhurst referred to Mr Longton as being “impressed” with the new offering and as wanting to sign everything across immediately, but I accept Mr Longton’s evidence that “impressed” was not the right word.  It was more that it was what he was looking for and he stated that it was his idea, not Mr Hayhurst’s, to ask for all his investments to be transferred across in specie to the Raymond James platform “all in one process.”       </p>

I really didn’t want the Towry type fund or Towry type investment.  And I certainly didn’t want to travel to Southport to see somebody who I had to set up a new relationship…I’d made a decision in mid-February to seek another adviser and not retain the services of Towry.”  He referred to seeing advice on some of these blogs that clients who did not want this type of investment should look at the register of advisers, or try and trace their old adviser.  He  followed that advice and telephoned Mr Hayhurst.    </p>

He plainly considered that he had accurately answered a straightforward question as to how it was, on this occasion, that he had heard about Wayne Hayhurst, a Raymond James adviser?

He was impressed both with Mr Hayhurst personally and with the nature of the Edward Jones service.  Before then he and his wife were looking after their investments (individual shares in various companies) themselves.  The fact that there was a local office enabled them to maintain easy access to their adviser and was also an important factor in their decision to choose Edward Jones.</p>

His wife wrote to them on 2 December stating, “I have been very happy with the service from Edward Jones as my investments have been well managed, monitored and advised upon.  I have appreciated being able to discuss these with their representative at face to face meetings in the formal business environment of their offices here in Longridge….I note you say that nothing will change and would be pleased if you would confirm that all the above elements will be provided by Towry Law..”  The reply from Graeme Creevy, dated 15 December, whilst confirming that there would be no changes to her portfolio, unless she felt it appropriate, was silent upon the prospect of Mrs Turner being able to continue to discuss her investments in the Longridge office.  The fact that the office then closed in January led to them taking a very dim view of Towry, referring to a “total lack of credibility.”</p>

Although he agreed that he was not opposed to discretionary fund management in principle, as part of a portfolio, he said he did not want to move into a managed fund.

Mr Turner had made some enquiries with a firm of solicitors in Manchester, on Mr Hayhurst’s behalf, and had sent him a name of a barrister.  Nothing turns on that, in my view, and I find that Mr Turner did not contact him again until February.   </p>

He was asked if he found Mr Hayhurst’s presentation impressive and said, …It was certainly informative. I mean, by the time it had reached this point, I had already decided, in fact shortly after I got the original letters relating to the takeover, that I wouldn’t be keeping my account with Towry.”  He answered the question on the HDYH form by saying “became aware of local branch office” and “internet search”, which he thought was right because he had seen Mr Hayhurst’s website and was also aware that Mr Hayhurst was now back working for Raymond James in the same office in Longridge.  Mr Turner’s own office was just two doors away.  It appears that there was another meeting between them on 8 July when he signed his investment strategy form.   </p>

Mr Tolley suggested to him that the key factor in his decision to transfer to Raymond James was Mr Hayhurst’s recommendation, but he did not accept that.  If Mr Hayhurst had gone to St James’ Place “I wouldn’t be his client now.”  He added that it would not be accurate to say that Mr Hayhurst had made a recommendation for him to move to Raymond James, “…obviously he’s making me aware of the products and services that he can offer with the new company.  And the decision about whether that fulfils my needs is my decision.”</p>

These are the close relationship that they had with Mr Hayhurst and the value they attached to continuing that relationship, the availability of a local office and regular face to face contact with him, the lack of any contact from Towry, or their decision, following discussions with a Towry adviser, that they wanted to stay with Mr Hayhurst.  A number of the clients were personal friends.  The client Joyce Holgate is in fact a client of Tracey Simpson and I accept that Mr Hayhurst had not dealt with her himself.</p>

Kat Mulvihill then became responsible for contacting those clients in February and March.  Mr Irvine stated that he had a number of meetings with clients, at which he had “a strong sense that Mr Hayhurst had already been in contact with them”.  His assessment that there had been contact was undoubtedly correct, although the circumstances of that contact, who initiated it and how it came about, were unknown to him.  In some cases he understood that clients had spoken to the former branch administrator, Val Briggs, who had told them that Mr Hayhurst was going to be setting up on his own.  </p>

I accept Mr Irvine’s evidence about this.  Mr Hayhurst stated that Mr Bamford called him on his mobile in February and asked him to come and see him.

Those meetings she did hold with Mr Hayhurst’s clients she described as initially very productive but her evidence was that, by the last two weeks of March, “the demeanour of those clients had changed completely” and they cancelled follow up meetings on short notice.   </p>

I accept that Mr and Mrs Butterworth may have changed their minds, having heard from her about the Towry proposition, but in this case that evidence does not in my view support a suggestion that they were persuaded to do so by Mr Hayhurst.  Mr Turner’s evidence was that Ms Mulvihill had not been “very forthcoming” with information when they met her.  Other clients to whom she spoke may have formed a similar view, or may just not have liked what Towry were offering.  The client Christine Ashton, called on behalf of Tracey Simpson, stated that although she had been given Ms Mulvihill’s name as her new adviser, in fact she had never heard from her.  In cross-examination Ms Mulvihill accepted that, whilst she would have “tried the phone number”, she may not have spoken to that client.  </p>

She accepted, as I find to be the case, that he was at that stage referring only to obtaining a list of clients who would have to be contacted and reassured about the acquisition, in accordance with Towry’s instructions to all advisers.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, whilst she initially accepted the suggestion that, in November 2009, she had asked Mr Hayhurst to take her with him, wherever he went, she then maintained that he had asked her to go with him to Raymond James.  Since, at this stage, he had not been through the recruitment process and had not been offered any job there I do not accept her evidence that he asked her to go with him. Her reference, unprompted, to knowing that he had “asked Tracey Simpson as well” and her acceptance that, as a joke, she had asked him on Facebook if she could come to his Raymond James Christmas party in 2010, indicated in my view a continuing interest in joining Mr Hayhurst and a continuing irritation that Tracey Simpson was now working with him, but that she was not.  She described herself as being, in November 2009, the most inexperienced adviser and Mr Hayhurst as someone whom she respected, and still does respect “very much”.  I find on balance that she did ask Mr Hayhurst to take her with him, that, as he stated he made it clear to her that, if he did go anywhere, he was not taking anyone with him, and that he had never offered her work or encouraged her to join him.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">From the evidence given by Mr Hayhurst as to the circumstances in which each client listed on the Table came to request him to transfer their investments, once again a number of common themes emerge as to their reasons for doing so, which are wholly consistent with the evidence given by Mr Longton and Mr Turner.  For these two clients, the fees to be charged, or the fee structure described by Mr Hayhurst when he saw them, were of no real significance in their decision to transfer their assets from Towry.  There is no basis upon which I could be satisfied that these were significant factors for any other client.  The strong desire to retain Mr Hayhurst as their adviser, access to a local office, unhappiness at a lack of contact from Towry or with the proposition that had been out to them were all factors which I find led these clients to decide to transfer without any element of persuasion by Mr Hayhurst.  I am not satisfied on the evidence that he solicited any client in breach of his contract.</p>

She was also offered a job with Santander.  Although she was grateful to have Santander’s offer, the job did not really appeal to her because she wanted advisory work in the community, of the kind she had been doing. Once Towry put her on garden leave in December, she decided to accept the Santander offer, to start in mid-January, because she did not want to be “totally out of a job” when her contract ended.

Her clients were allocated to Kat Mulvihill, who began to contact them and advise them of the situation.  Many clients were concerned at this news and called Ms Simpson on her mobile to ask what she was doing and where she was going.

Both of them, she stated, wanted to do things by the book. In her evidence Ms Simpson emphasised the importance to her of this opportunity, at an important time in her life, and the fact that she would not have done anything that might place that opportunity in jeopardy or cause problems for the friend and business associate who had offered it to her.</p>

They knew where she lived and would often contact her at the weekends and they were all appreciative of her interest in their families and hobbies and their plans for the future.  I accept that Ms Simpson believed, when she left, that many of them would be concerned at her departure and I find, on the evidence, that many were.</p>

Ms Simpson had not met them before then.  Since he was busy at the time she had asked them if they were happy for her to deal with them and they agreed.  She then completed all the necessary investment documents in respect of those clients.

Ms Ashton said that Ms Simpson was helping to sort the matter out for her.  She emphatically denied Mr Tolley’s suggestion that Ms Simpson was telling her about her employment plans for the future.

Ms Ashton agreed with the suggestion that, at one of these meetings, Ms Simpson had   presented to her what Raymond James had to offer, that she understood it to be the same that they had with Edward Jones, and that the fees were explained, along with the lack of any fee to be charged for transfer.  She also agreed that it was important to her that Ms Simpson had the back up of a large organisation.  In response to the suggestion that she had found Ms Simpson’s presentation attractive and persuasive, she responded, “I don’t think persuasive is the right word…it was what we wanted, yes.

No-one from Towry telephoned them to tell them what was happening and whether they had been allocated a new adviser.  The local office then closed and Ms Bailey decided to call Ms Simpson on her mobile, to ask her if she was still their adviser or if she could find out who her new adviser was.

Ms Simpson said she could.  When she came to see her on 10 March, she explained that she was now with someone else but, in response to Ms Bailey’s questions, she told her that Raymond James would be essentially the same service.  Ms Bailey’s evidence was that “I just said please get on with it and let’s transfer over to you.” A number of investment documents and the HDYH form, on which Ms Bailey stated that she had contacted Ms Simpson on her mobile because she wanted to continue contact with her, were completed at subsequent meetings, on 16 March and 20 April, in order for the arrangements to proceed for the transfer of their investments. </p>

She responded, “No, I decided, as soon as I knew that Tracey was no longer with Towry, no matter where she was, if she was still in the financial service industry, that’s where we would be.  These documents, obviously, couldn’t all be done on one day, for whatever reason.  But the decision I made was when I knew that Tracey was no longer…with Towry….so there was no doubt in my mind that I would go with Tracey, no matter what company she was with, so long as she could look after us as she had been doing.”    </p>

The evidence Ms Simpson gave as to the circumstances in which the clients listed in the Table came to request a transfer showed a clear and familiar pattern, with a strong wish to retain Ms Simpson’s services and to continue to have access to a local office, combining with dissatisfaction with Towry as the reasons for their decision.  </p>

The client, Joyce Holgate, is someone with whom she organises local charity and fundraising events and another, Barbara Park, is a close personal friend of many years standing.  Whilst I have not heard evidence from these or other clients I am not satisfied that Ms Simpson solicited any clients in breach of her contract.

It is clear that Raymond James regarded Mr Spain very highly from the start and that they saw him as someone who would be successful with them.

Would give away money – wants his legacy – very portable. - drives him – make a clearer path.”  Mr Cherriman referred to being “a bit shocked” to discover, at this meeting, that Mr Spain was an ex-minister of the church, who had been involved in a great deal of charity work, including a project in Africa, which he was interested in being  involved in again in the future.

Cynthia Poole conducted the subsequent AQ meeting with Mr Spain herself, in the absence of Mr Hazelton and Mr Cherriman, on 2 November.  She recalled speaking to Mr Spain on a number of occasions about the clean water project he had undertaken in Africa, of which he was immensely proud, and said that this was what he was referring to in speaking about his legacy.  She thought that the word might be “potable” in any event, referring to the drinking water itself, if not to the systems for carrying it to the villages.  I agree that the handwriting is unclear at this point. Whatever the word is, however, I am entirely satisfied that this discussion had nothing to do with a portable client base, or bringing a base of clients over to Raymond James with him, and everything to do with his clean water project in Africa and the importance, to him personally, of that work.  </p>

Mr Cherriman’s assessment of him as “a quite confident and ambitious individual” and as the kind of person who “wanted to be at 100 million after 2 minutes” was in my view an accurate assessment, having heard his evidence at this trial.

Further, on 25 November, Mr Hazelton made sure that he met Mr Spain himself, so that he could go through the contents of the script with him ensure that he understood his legal obligations and the serious results, for him, if Raymond James discovered that he was in breach of his covenants.  He also emphasised the importance of Mr Spain obtaining his own legal advice, although Mr Spain had already met a solicitor shortly after the meeting on 2 November.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mrs Poole’s evidence was that this was a reference to something she herself had suggested to Mr Spain.  She was referring to the practice, not uncommon when financial advisers are leaving an “employed environment”, of successfully negotiating with their former employer, as part of the terms of their departure, to be able to take a segment of their client base with them, in particular members of their family or close friends.  She explained that, in her experience, employers will often have regard to the practical realities in this situation and agree to these investors going with the adviser.  Mrs Poole gave a number of previous examples of situations where this had occurred.  In this case, however, whilst Mr Spain was initially interested in this possibility, he did not report back to her on any attempts to negotiate and she did not follow it up. The circumstances surrounding the deadline for acceptance of the new contracts and the advisers’ departures were such that, in her view, “it became evident really quickly that it was not an environment conducive to those kind of reasonable negotiations.”  I accept that evidence.</p>

A number of rival organisations had been in touch and, from 5 November onwards, he had meetings with a number of companies, including Positive Solutions, Tenet Group, St James’ Place and Raymond James. He had heard about Raymond James from a friend some two years earlier and was attracted by its obvious similarities with Edward Jones.  He rang them on 27 October and a meeting with Mr Cherriman was arranged for 5 November.  </p>

Mr Cherriman regarded Mr Hutton as “borderline” in terms of the criteria and at that stage, having discussed the matter with Mr Hazelton, they decided not to progress his application.  Mr Cherriman told Mr Hutton that he was concerned about his lack of   experience in the industry and as to whether it was enough for him to be an independent Branch Principal.  At the time Mr Hutton accepted that and left the matter there.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On 9 December, having decided to leave Towry, and shortly before resigning on that date, Mr Hutton emailed Raymond James again, asking if they would reconsider him. They decided to call him in for an AQ meeting and the meeting initially arranged for 18 December was then moved to 5 January. Mr Hutton stated that, during December, he did not contact clients himself, either to tell them he was leaving or that he had left, and he did not mention Raymond James.  However, a number of his clients were contacting him, expressing their concerns, which I set out in detail below, and making it clear that they wished to retain him as their adviser.  Sometimes he bumped into clients socially or when out in the town, when he also told them that he had left.  I accept that evidence.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At the meeting on 5 January Mr Hazelton went through the script with Mr Hutton and emphasised the importance of compliance with his contractual restrictions.  His evidence was that Mr Hutton seemed already well apprised of what he could and could not do. I find that Mr Hutton had already received legal advice on his contract by the time of this meeting and relayed this to Mr Hazelton, who noted it down in his handwritten notes.  Mr Hutton recalled a detailed discussion about his restrictive covenants at this meeting. Raymond James made it clear both that he was to obtain his own legal advice about them and that there would be very serious consequences for him if he breached them, when his contract with Raymond James would be terminated.  It seems that Mr Hutton obtained further legal advice in March, so as to make it clear to Raymond James that he understood his contractual obligations and was taking them very seriously.</p>

Mr Hazelton considered, having met him, that he was someone who had managed to build up a good client base pretty quickly, with relatively little experience, and that having been in business before on his own he would have the relevant experience to run a branch.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Hutton said that it would have been naïve of both him and Raymond James to think that none of his clients would consider moving to him eventually, not least his parents.  He had referred expressly to his hopes in this respect in his AQ, stating, “Although I have over 200 clients in my business that I have signed up over the past few years, I have a very strong core of clients who are the growing strength in my business. These clients are keen to remain with me although fully understand my contractual conditions.” Mr Cherriman regarded this statement on the AQ as an “impassioned plea” by someone who had been rejected first time round and that he did not regard it with either interest or suspicion. I agree that it is likely to have been written with a view to persuading Mr Cherriman of his merits as a candidate, but Mr Hutton did not dispute that this was his genuine belief at the time.  </p>

Some had not been contacted by anyone from Towry, whereas others were contacting Mr Hutton after they had met a Towry representative.  Concern was commonly expressed to him about the acquisition and about his departure.  He told them that Edward Jones would still be able to assist them and that they should contact Paul Brisley in the office with any queries.  If they already had appointments booked to see someone from Towry, he encouraged them to have that meeting. Others expressed concerns to him, or contacted him again, after such a meeting had taken place.  </p>

In many cases there had been a complete lack of communication and clients contacted him in March not having heard anything from Towry since the original letter of 23 October. Clients with life savings were not receiving any correspondence and the local link for managing their anxieties had disappeared.  In some cases there were transaction issues and clients were not receiving their regular income, which they relied upon to pay bills.  For other clients, the initial meeting with Towry had been with someone who was not local and, from mid-February, there was no longer any local office in Winchcombe, where most of Mr Hutton’s former clients lived.  </p>

They had been used to regular and consistent contact, in particular regular face to face contact with a local and easily accessible adviser.  For those in this category, who had received no communication from Towry, alarm bells were more likely to ring.

He stated that he explained his situation very carefully and told them what his contract required him to do, and not to do.  He understood exactly the nature of his obligations under the contract, having taken legal advice, and he stated that he complied with the restrictions in full.  Those clients who did come back to him told him that they wanted him to continue to advise them and asked him to come and see them.  He did so.  Mr Hutton set out in detail in his witness statement the circumstances in which the 25 households, comprising the clients listed in the Table, came to transfer their investments to Raymond James.

He was about to take early retirement from his managerial post with Kraft foods, and they arranged a meeting.  They became clients of Edward Jones and their relationship with Mr Hutton developed into a friendship over the following months.  They came to trust him completely and had complete confidence in him.  Mr Cox said that his first reaction to the news of the acquisition, on receipt of the October letters, was “what was going to happen to Stuart?” He thought he had spoken to Mr Hutton once the acquisition was announced, either when he rang Mr Hutton or bumped into him in the street, when he asked him what he was going to do.  Mr Hutton responded that he did not know and that his options were open. Mr Tolley suggested that Mr Hutton was sounding him out about whether he would move to wherever he decided to move, but Mr Cox denied this.  I accept Mr Cox’s evidence about this and find that, after this brief conversation, he had no further conversation with Mr Hutton until the end of January or early February, as set out below.  </p>

Receiving no reply, he then phoned Mr Hutton at the end of January or beginning of February and left a message asking him to contact him.  Mr Hutton did so and Mr Cox asked him to come round to his home to talk to him.  Mr Hutton’s mobile records show that he made a five minute call to Mr Cox on 27 January, which I find was probably Mr Hutton returning Mr Cox’s call. </p>

If I didn’t go with Mr Hutton then I would manage it myself…my adviser and relationship is totally with Stuart Hutton…I have complete confidence in the ability of Mr Hutton and his honesty and integrity. So the other platforms are irrelevant.” When asked how it came about that his assets came to be transferred, or how he made that decision, his response was, “Because I wanted to be with Stuart Hutton.  His platform was Raymond James.  So, naturally, I will move my assets across to Raymond James.”  He denied that Mr Hutton had ever made any recommendation that he move his assets.  Nor did he accept the suggestion that Mr Hutton had “influenced” him to move them, accepting only that “Mr Hutton, as a person and as my previous adviser, and his open and honest approach, influenced me that I wanted him as my adviser.”  I accept that evidence. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Hillam gave evidence, as one of the hearsay witnesses in this trial, when a rather different picture emerged as to what had happened.  He thought that his first meeting with Mr Johnson was on 17 February.  Mr Johnson explained that Towry could offer two levels of service.  One was a purely dealing service and one was a fully discretionary service.  Mr Hillam referred to the service he had at Edward Jones, when he consulted with his adviser and she gave him various alternatives, of which they would discuss the pros and cons and he would then make a decision as to what investment to buy.  Mr Johnson told him that that was a service Towry would not offer.  Mr Hillam expressed his reservations and said that he would have to make enquiries elsewhere to see if he could find another adviser who could offer that service.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">He then contacted Ms O’Dell, but she told him she had left.  He explained the service he wanted and asked her if she knew of anyone. She sent him Mr Hutton’s contact details.  At that point, about late February, he had contacted Mr Hutton and he was meeting Mr Hutton at the same time as the other meetings with Mr Johnson were being arranged.  There was some confusion as to the dates on which these meetings took place, but nothing turns on that in my view.  The relevant aspect of this evidence is that Mr Johnson’s account, which might suggest that Mr Hillam was about to sign up to the IIM until Mr Hutton persuaded him to transfer instead to Raymond James, is in my view incorrect.  I find that Mr Hillam was not happy that he would no longer be able to get the service he had at Edward Jones; that he sought out another adviser who could provide it; and that he decided for himself to move to Raymond James.  This evidence provides no support for the allegation that Mr Hutton solicited clients to transfer.   </p>

Whilst this evidence is subject to the same deficiencies to which I have already referred in other cases, this account is in fact entirely consistent with Mr Hutton’s own evidence as to what clients were telling him when they contacted him and asked him to go and see them.</p>

Whilst I have not addressed all the points made by Mr Tolley in seeking to sustain that submission, I have had regard to them in arriving at my conclusions.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is correct, as Mr Anderson stated, that, from 4 February onwards, Towry received a large number of similar requests from Raymond James, on behalf of clients whose adviser had previously been one of the individual Defendants, to transfer their investments under management to Raymond James.  Requests for references, in respect of all the Defendants save Ms Simpson, had been received from Raymond James during January and there was already a high index of suspicion regarding solicitation activity, as shown by Mr Donlon’s letter to Mr Bennett dated 25 January.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is, however, unsurprising that the format of these requests was almost identical. The similarities in respect of the transfer documentation completed with the clients and then received by Towry is, as Mr Quinn submitted, equally consistent with the relevant transfer requests having been made without solicitation.  The necessary process for transfer required similar forms to be completed and signed.  The real issue in this case is how, and in what circumstances those forms came to be completed, signed and submitted by those clients and I have set out above my findings in this respect in relation to the individual Defendants.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment it is clear on the evidence in this case that Towry were rocked, both by the numbers of top tier advisers who decided to leave and by the scale of the transfer requests from clients subsequently submitted from a competitor organisation, where six of the seven individual Defendants in this case had been offered positions as Branch Principals.  I accept that, for Towry, such losses were unprecedented. In previous acquisitions, as Mr Fisher stated, Towry had always retained the majority of the acquired advisers.  </p>

Quite apart from Mr Anderson’s riposte that “suing everybody or not suing anyone at all” is not something that Towry have to justify, I accept on the evidence before me that the numbers of transfer requests received from Raymond James were higher than those received from other organisations and that, by July 2010, the majority of the clients being advised by the individual Defendants were former clients of Edward Jones.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment Towry seriously underestimated the importance of these factors in this case. Mr Fisher’s sincere and strongly held beliefs as to the superiority of the Towry model and of the IIM left little room for acceptance that others might take a different view and decide to go elsewhere, without any element of persuasion or encouragement for them to do so. The primary reason for the acquisition, identified by Mr Fisher, had been that it would substantially increase Towry’s total assets under advice. The amount of transfer requests received, within a relatively short period, and the value of the assets being lost to a competitor organisation led in my view to an assumption, which the evidence has shown to be unsustainable, that there must have been solicitation.  Towry’s unwillingness to contemplate any other explanation for what occurred was also illustrated by Paul Wright’s admission, during cross-examination, that he had not even read any of the witness statements of the individual Defendants in this case.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Anderson, who accepted that he had never been a financial adviser himself, is of course entitled to his view that there was “systemic working” through the client bank to transfer assets out; and that such high numbers of transfer requests “…demonstrate to us that there was significant solicitation activity targeted to those client banks over a very short period of time.”  In my judgment, however, the evidence shows that there were other, powerful factors operating in this case, referred to in detail above, which were nothing to do with any wrongful conduct by the Defendants and which I find accounted for the volume of transfer requests received by Towry over the relevant period.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In addition to the strong desire of many clients to retain the services of the person who had been their adviser, and to be able still to visit him or her in a local office and enjoy all the benefits of that local presence in the community, there was clearly a considerable degree of client dissatisfaction with Towry, either because there had been no contact at all from their new adviser, or because such contact as there had been had led them to the view that Towry was not for them.  I am not persuaded on the evidence in this case that there was any deliberate targeting, by any individual Defendant, of clients with larger investments for the purposes of solicitation.  In respect of those clients who held assets of substantial value, the more likely I consider it would be that they would become concerned at any lack of, or delay in contact, or about the prospect of change generally or about the readily accessible, negative publicity concerning the Towry proposition.  The more likely it would be, in my view, for such clients to want urgently to get in touch with the person who had hitherto been advising them and managing their portfolio, so as to ensure that they would continue to do so.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Nor do I regard as probative of solicitation Mr Anderson’s evidence that the individual Defendants had acted, in various ways, in breach of relevant regulatory requirements in their dealings with the clients.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not consider it necessary to deal with these allegations in any detail.  First, the allegations are all denied.  The Defendants did not accept that, in making any necessary notes on the face of the relevant investment documents, rather than in separate notes, or indeed in any other respect relating to those documents, they were acting in breach of any regulatory requirement.  Mr Anderson was not giving expert evidence in this respect but merely expressing his own personal view, with which the Defendants, including the senior managers at Raymond James, clearly did not agree.  In any event, Mr Anderson realistically accepted that there can be a range of explanations for the failure to follow a particular regulation, including for example a misapprehension as to the applicability of the requirement.  He also accepted that different financial services organisations have different methods of compliance with regulations, based on their own interpretation of the requirements, with which he may well disagree, but the fact of which does not seem to me to advance his arguments in this respect.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, a number of the Towry wealth advisers who gave evidence as to their meetings with clients did not themselves provide any records they had taken of such meetings, giving some indication of the lack of consensus as to the requirements of particular regulatory provisions. Thirdly, Mr Tolley made it clear during the course of the hearing that it was no part of his case to accuse any individual of breaches of FSA Rules or to invite me to make any such findings.  Given the complexity of the requirements and the differences of opinion as to what constitutes compliance, I regard that as the right approach to take to this particular allegation.  I do not consider it appropriate, or helpful, to make any such findings in this case on the basis of Mr Anderson’s personal opinion, which is disputed.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In any event, and perhaps most importantly, even if there were such breaches of regulatory requirements by any Defendant, I reject the suggestion that this is evidence from which it could, or should be inferred that the Defendants were soliciting clients and taking steps to conceal that fact.  The specific attack Mr Anderson made, in respect of the execution only service requested by some clients, was in my view sufficiently explained by the evidence that, at that stage and whilst assets remained on the Edward Jones/Towry platform, the adviser was being instructed only to execute transfer, a method of operation which Mrs Poole and Mr Hazelton regarded as legitimate and unobjectionable.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, in a case which was opened on the basis that the allegations of wrongful conduct depended entirely on the inferences I would be invited to draw from the evidence, it is understandable that Mr Tolley adopted a more exploratory approach to cross-examination, concentrating on the contents of contemporaneous documents to test the Defendants’ denials of wrongful conduct.  In my view, and given the way in which Towry’s case on solicitation was articulated by Mr Anderson, no criticism is to be attached to a challenge, which proceeded on the basis of an intensive forensic examination of what particular documents were said to evidence.  In the exploration of this evidence on behalf of Towry it is fair to say that no grain of sand was left unturned.   However, applying the relevant legal principles to the whole of the evidence in this case, thoroughly tested as it was in cross-examination, the interpretation placed by Towry on the various documents relied upon was unsustainable.  </p>

On all the evidence in this trial, however, I find that Towry has not discharged the burden upon them of proving to the necessary civil standard that any client was solicited by the individual Defendants.  There is some merit, in my view, in Mr Quinn’s submission that the focus on the investment documentation and completion of the requests to transfer, at the meetings between the clients and the individual advisers, meant that there was a failure to recognise the significance of earlier events in the factual matrix.  By concentrating more on how the transfer requests were then processed, than on why this was then being done and what it was that had led to the meeting at which those documents were completed and/or signed, Towry focussed on only one part of the picture.</p>

At the same time, the individual Defendants were being approached by rival organisations and recruitment agencies, or making their own inquiries elsewhere and attending potential recruitment meetings, in order to keep their future employment options open. They were also obtaining legal advice, as required by Raymond James, and were understanding the need to proceed very carefully so far as contact with clients was concerned.   It is hardly surprising that, in these circumstances, the individual Defendants were generally cautious about being seen to be in contact with their clients, and were not wanting to represent to them that nothing was going to change, when they considered that would no longer be accurate or honest.</p>

In some cases their complaints had been upheld by the Financial Ombudsman and compensation awarded.  Paul Wright fairly acknowledged in his evidence that there were delays and a substantial number of complaints in this respect, due to the volume of requests and the backlogs that ensued.

I do accept that each Defendant understood that initial contact was relevant and, in my judgment it is a relevant factor in considering in any case whether there has been solicitation.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, having taken their own legal advice and having been advised by Mr Hazelton at some length, at the start of each AQ meeting, on Raymond James’ views as to the scope of their obligations, I am not persuaded that any Defendant either held that erroneous view or that he or she in fact proceeded on that basis.  The belief genuinely held, and openly expressed to Raymond James, that clients would be likely to want to follow them did not equate at all, in this case, to an intention to solicit those clients.  Nor did the wish to ensure that, for all clients, including those clients who did decide to follow them, the fee structure on offer was a reasonable and attractive one.     </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Nor do I consider that any Defendant, in referring to a client’s “free choice” misunderstood the nature and scope of his contractual obligations.  On the evidence the use of that phrase meant, in its correct context, only that the client was exercising an independent decision to transfer, without any encouragement or persuasion to do so by the Defendant.  Mr Anderson’s view that the Defendants, in their meetings with clients, were involved in “solicitation activity” in promoting Raymond James, advising them on the benefits of their business model and on the relevant fee structure and encouraging or recommending transfer was, on an analysis of the whole of the evidence in this case, misplaced.  For a number of the clients who gave evidence, the information being given as to the fee structure, and the lack of any fee being charged for the transfer, was wholly irrelevant to their decision to request a transfer.  For others who did regard this information as relevant, by the time that each Defendant was providing it I find that the decision had already been made that Towry was not for them, that they wished to retain their personal financial adviser to advise them and that they wanted to transfer their assets.</p>

Some clients, for example Mr Cox, stated that they had to start from scratch in terms of giving details of their investments and preferences to the relevant Defendant.

To the extent that some of those details may have been reproduced on the relevant forms by any Defendant from memory, I find that they were not such as to involve a breach of Clause 16.5.1 of their contracts or any breach of confidence at common law.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Far from being reckless, or closing their eyes to the obvious, the evidence demonstrates a high degree of awareness of the need for caution and the taking of a number of steps, after obtaining legal advice, designed to ensure that each Defendant recognised the importance of compliance with the restrictive covenants and that each did in fact comply with them.  Given the prospect that any Defendant found to have acted in breach faced the termination of his position as Branch Principal, the incentive to ensure compliance was strong.  Setting them a target of £10 million of assets under advice within their first year did not detract from this incentive and the general approach for the reasons already set out above.  </p>

This, bold assertion made in the written opening submissions presented on behalf of Towry was tempered by Mr Tolley’s oral indication, at that early stage, that the allegation of conspiracy might be limited to the position as between Raymond James and each of the individual Defendants, rather than being some overarching conspiracy between all of the individual Defendants and between all of them and Raymond James; but that there may have been particular combinations within the grouping of the individual Defendants.  </p>

The fact that advisers working in the same region (Messrs Bennett, Burger and Hutton, for example) were speaking to one another on the telephone at a time of general upheaval and uncertainty is in my view of little assistance.  I have dealt above with the discussions which took place, about the possibility of an agreed SOFAC, between Messrs Hayhurst, Chandler and Spain, and the events which led up to Ms Simpson going to work for Mr Hayhurst, none of which in my view evidences collaboration with any sinister motive.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is a striking feature of the evidence in this case that, within a short time of the acquisition and in circumstances where expressions of interest from Edward Jones advisers were arriving in increasing numbers, Raymond James decided to seek legal advice as to their position.  Mindful of the risk of litigation they sought advice at that early stage.  In my judgment they then followed that advice by taking a series of steps designed to ensure that advisers complied with their contractual obligations.  Advisers were told in unambiguous terms that they must obtain their own legal advice and that a breach of those obligations would result in the termination of their working relationship.  Further legal advice was sought at the time of making the preliminary offer to each Defendant.  Clients who decided to follow any Defendant were required to complete the HDYH form.  I reject any suggestion that this was no more than a cynical ploy, designed to give the misleading impression that any possible solicitation was being checked and monitored.  The design and wording of this form could undoubtedly have been improved, and the arrangements for monitoring their completion tightened, but the evidence of such defects comes nowhere near to establishing the unlawful means conspiracy alleged.</p>

The existence of a right to terminate the Service Level Agreement entered into with each Defendant if it was shown that there had been a breach of the restrictive covenants, and an obligation to indemnify Raymond James in respect of the costs of such a claim as the present one, point away from the existence of a conspiracy of the kind alleged in this case.</p>
