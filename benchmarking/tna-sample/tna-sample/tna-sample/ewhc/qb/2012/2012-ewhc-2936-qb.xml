On 1 January 1947, as a result of nationalisation, the Phurnacite Plant was vested in the National Coal Board (NCB).  From that time until 1973, it was operated by the NCB or the British Coal Corporation.  From 1973 until the production of Phurnacite ceased in 1990, the Plant was operated by National Smokeless Fuel Limited (NSFL), a company which was wholly owned by the second defendant, Coal Products Limited (CPL).  CPL was in turn a subsidiary of the NCB/British Coal Corporation.  </p>

I shall refer to the first and second defendants collectively as ‘the defendants’.

Schedule A of the Group Register consists of claims for non-malignant respiratory disease, namely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic bronchitis (CB).  Schedule B consists of claims for lung cancer, bladder cancer and skin cancer.  Some claimants are registered on both Schedules. It was agreed that there should be a trial of eight lead claims.  I directed that each party should choose one lead claim from Schedule A, together with one case each of lung cancer, bladder cancer and skin cancer from Schedule B.  Where a lead claimant had made a claim in respect of more than one medical condition, I directed that all those claims should be dealt with at the trial of the lead claims.  The eight claims can be summarised thus: </p>

There was a dispute about the extent of the claimants’ exposure to dust, fume and carcinogenic substances and the defendants denied causation in each individual case.

Meanwhile, in 1973, battery 3 was closed down permanently.  By 1980, a decision had been taken to construct a unit for manufacturing Phurnacite by means of the Ancit process which would run initially in conjunction with the existing Disticoke ovens.  During 1982 and 1983, batteries 1 and 7 were re-built and re-commissioned in an attempt to improve carbonisation and to reduce pollution.  In 1983, battery 4 was closed.  </p>

This was followed by the permanent closure of batteries 5, 6 and 7 in 1985, 1989 and 1988 respectively. The Ancit process did not prove successful and a decision was taken not to extend its use.  Instead, NSFL decided to produce Phurnacite by a different process, known as the mild heat treatment process.  After attempts to obtain planning permission for the construction of a mild heat treatment plant at the Aberaman site had failed, the decision was taken to close the Phurnacite Plant.  Production at the Phurnacite Plant ceased with the closure of batteries 1 and 2 in 1990. There then followed a period of one or two years during which some employees were kept on to assist in the final closing down of the Phurnacite Plant prior to demolition. Subsequently, Phurnacite manufacture was transferred to a newly constructed mild heat treatment plant in North East England where it has continued ever since.   </p>

Its main element, carbon, is present in varying proportions in different types of coal.  Low grade bituminous coals contain about 40% carbon, whilst anthracites (coals with the least impurities and the highest calorific value) contain as much as 90% carbon.  Other elements present in coal include hydrogen, sulphur, oxygen and nitrogen.  Coal also contains minerals originating from the host rock in which it was formed, the most important of these minerals being silica.  At the molecular level, coal is formed from large systems of fused aromatic carbon rings with cross linkages of oxygen and sulphur in combination with hydrocarbon structures.  When heated to high temperatures, it has the potential to release volatile polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).  There are many different PAHs, some of which are known to be carcinogenic in humans. </p>

Thus, there is no equivalent of the briquetting plants at a coke oven plant. By contrast, Phurnacite production required the use of pitch as a binding agent.

The level of BSM was used as an indirect or ‘surrogate’ measure to estimate the level of PAHs in the relevant sample.

As to the other witnesses called on behalf of the claimants, I gained the overall impression that Mr Hodges, Mr Lanyon and Mr Harris were doing their best to assist the court by giving as accurate an account of conditions at the Phurnacite Plant as they could.  Although they may have had some understandable lapses of memory, I found their evidence to be generally reliable.  Mr Brian Jones worked as a shift superintendent and then a manager at the Phurnacite Plant from 1971 until its closure.  He was a patently honest witness who had an extraordinarily good knowledge of the Phurnacite Plant.  I found much of his evidence very helpful to my understanding of the case.  He obviously took great pride in his work and in the unique manufacturing process carried on at the Phurnacite Plant.  I am satisfied, however, that his enthusiasm led him at times to adopt a somewhat uncritical view of the conditions in which men at the Phurnacite Plant were required to work.  I did not find Mr Saunders an impressive witness and was not satisfied that his evidence about the conditions encountered by samplers was wholly reliable.  As to those witnesses who did not give oral evidence, I bear in mind that that their evidence has not been tested in cross-examination.  However, I did not observe any obvious signs of exaggeration in their witness statements and they were able to give very detailed accounts of the Phurnacite Plant and of the processes carried on there.   </p>

At that stage, the coal was described as ‘wet’ coal; this did not necessarily mean that the coal was covered with water, although it might be damp if there had been recent rain.  The use of the word ‘wet’ indicated that the coal had not at this stage passed through the dryer in the briquetting plant and that it still contained a relatively high moisture content.  A wagon of coal would be brought to one of the two covered coal tippler areas, each of which was situated near to one of the briquetting plants.  The wagon was positioned and secured on a large plate (or ‘tippler’) which was fitted with railway tracks.  The tippler was then tilted, tipping the wagon sideways and causing the coal to fall through a chute into a concrete hopper, from where it was discharged onto a conveyor leading to the briquetting plant nearby.  </p>

The wet coal bunkers were about 50 feet in height; they were square at the top and narrowed to a conical shape at the bottom.  Each bunker had a grate at the bottom which was used to control the flow of coal out of the bunker.  The bunkers at briquetting plant 1 had a total capacity of approximately 960 tonnes and the capacity of those at briquetting plant 2 was about 2,800 tonnes. </p>

Over time, however, it became increasingly difficult to obtain sufficient quantities of this type of coal.  The other types of coal that were available were of a different volatile content to the dry steam coal and were not as well suited to the manufacture of Phurnacite.  This made the manufacturing process (in particular, the carbonisation of the ovoid briquettes) more difficult and also affected the quality of the finished product.  As a result, it became necessary to mix a number of different types of coal together in order to achieve a blend that resembled the properties of the original Welsh dry steam coal.  This was done by filling the wet coal bunkers with different types of coal and mixing the contents of the various bunkers in the desired proportions as the coal was discharged from the bunkers.  However, that system of mixing did not prove entirely successful and it was decided that a more radical solution was required<span style="font-style:italic">. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:-0.00in;margin-right:0.12in">2.13 As a result, a new system of blending different types of coal for use in the Phurnacite manufacturing process was introduced in 1973/74.  The object of the new system was to achieve a uniform blend of coal with a volatile content similar to that which had originally been used for the manufacture of Phurnacite.  A large open coal blending site was created in an area of the Phurnacite Plant some considerable distance from both the briquetting plants.  The new coal blending site consisted of four (later six) stacks or ‘pads’ of wet coal arranged in long rectangular shapes.  Coal was delivered to the blending site where automatic stackers spread the coal in layers, each layer containing coal from a different source.  When the stacking process was complete, the layered coal was removed from the pad by means of a large machine called a ‘reclaimer’, which was mounted on rails running along each long side of the pad.  As the reclaimer travelled along the pad, a large barrel at its centre rotated, scooping up coal in buckets and depositing it onto a conveyor belt which ran back through the barrel of the reclaimer.  From there the coal was transferred by means of a series of conveyors (the ‘wet coal conveyors’ or ‘blended coal conveyors’) across the river and the railway to one of the two briquetting plants.  At the briquetting plants, the coal was fed into one of the wet coal bunkers.   </p>

The dust blew about and was the subject of complaints by local residents.  Dust was also emitted as a result of the action of the reclaimer.  In February 1976, a system for spraying wagons with water prior to tipping was said to be “well advanced” and there were plans for the reclaimer to be partially enclosed<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="7">

The coal was delivered to the briquetting plants by means of overhead conveyors which were covered on the top and sides.  A walkway or gantry ran alongside each conveyor.  Except for certain sections (i.e. those above the railway and the river) the floors of the walkways were not solid.  As a result, dust, breeze and small pieces of coal fell through the walkways and were deposited on the ground below.  The conveyors had continuous moving belts which carried the coal from one end of the conveyor to the other end before passing over rollers and making their return run on the underside of the conveyor.  Spillages occurred when coal became stuck to the conveyor belt and was then dislodged from the underside of the conveyor as the belt made its return run.  There were also spillages at transfer points. In 1975, the Alkali Inspectorate carried out a survey of atmospheric pollution at the Phurnacite Plant<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="9">

In 1977, modifications to the conveyors were carried out and belt cleaners were installed.    </p>

Once the coal blending site was in use, recycled dust and breeze were added to the wet coal stored at the coal blending site, rather than at the coal tipplers.

Each pitch handling area had a shed and a pit, known as a ‘pitch bay’, where pitch in solid form was delivered in open wagons.  The wagons containing the pitch were lowered into the pitch bay so that the pitch could be discharged.  The solid pitch had to be broken up in the wagons by men using picks and pneumatic tools, then shovelled out of the wagons and down a chute into a crusher or ‘pitch cracker’ which reduced it to small pieces.  All these operations produced large quantities of pitch dust. The job of the ‘pitch men’ was physically hard and involved repeated dermal exposure to pitch, together with inhalation of pitch dust.  </p>

As they left work, the men would seek to protect themselves against the sun by putting towels over their faces.  Some of the men developed pitch warts.  It was largely because of the effects of pitch on the pitch men that a sauna was installed at the Phurnacite Plant in about 1971.  Because of the working conditions in the pitch handling areas, the regular pitch men were amongst the best paid workers at the Phurnacite Plant and worked shorter shifts than men employed in other jobs.  In addition to the regular pitch men, men working overtime at the Phurnacite Plant and those employed as general labourers (or ‘spare men’) were frequently required to work in the pitch bay and a number of the lead claimants had done so.   </p>

Mr Foster, an assistant manager at the Phurnacite Plant in the early 1970s, accepted in oral evidence that the working conditions of men employed in the pitch bays were “pretty dreadful”.  I agree with that assessment.  Those working conditions continued until 1975 when the pitch handling area at briquetting plant 1 closed.  The introduction of mechanical shovels in briquetting plant 2 that same year must have effected some improvement there but it is clear that concerns about the conditions persisted until the introduction of liquid pitch in mid-1977.

The wet coal would sometimes become stuck inside the bunkers (or frozen in cold weather) and would require ‘poking’ with long metal bars in order to dislodge it.  This problem persisted for many years and gave rise to dust.  In 1977, vibrating devices were fitted to the wet coal bunkers in briquetting plant 1 in order to address the problem and similar devices were on order for the wet coal bunkers in briquetting plant 2. I have assumed that the latter were installed a short time later.  </p>

Immediately adjacent to each dryer was a furnace in which gases were heated before being forced under pressure into the base of the dryer.  Within each dryer were a number of circular metal plates set at angles.  Coal was fed into the dryer through a chute leading from the top of the wet coal elevator into the top of the dryer.  As the coal fell down through the dryer, it was circulated round the plates, thus ensuring that it was exposed to the hot gases for a long enough period to remove most of its moisture content.  The resulting water was then evaporated off.  Once the coal reached the bottom of the dryer it was discharged via a worm feeder onto a conveyor.  After passing through the dryer, the character of the coal changed.  It became more abrasive and gave off a fine dust. It was clear from the evidence that considerably more dust was emitted on the ‘dry’ side of the briquetting process than on the ‘wet’ side and that the dust on the ‘dry’ side was much finer than the dust on the ‘wet’ side.   </p>

The worm feeders at the bottom of the dryers had a number of slides in their bases which could be opened to allow the dry coal to drop onto the selected conveyor.  It was common for dust to escape through these slides and to hang in the air around the conveyor.   </p>

As a result, in 1956, two electrostatic precipitator stacks (ESPs) were installed to deal with the dust from the dryers in briquetting plant 1.  There were three dryers but only two ESPs were installed so that, when maintenance was carried out on one of the ESPs, a single ESP had to deal with the dust from all three dryers.

Estimates as to how frequently the tripping out occurred varied as between the various witnesses but I am satisfied that, in the 1960s and the early-mid 1970s, it happened on average at least once a day, probably more, and that it was a major source of the dust which was deposited in and around the Phurnacite Plant.

In February 1976, it was reported that the average annual emissions from all the ESPs had been reduced to about 156 tonnes – still a sizeable amount.  However, the problems at briquetting plant 2 continued and, in July 1976, an investigation found that, when the dust from three dryers was handled by only two ESPs, dust emission rates increased fivefold and, when two dryers were served by one ESP, there was a thirteenfold increase in emissions.  Further testing in March 1977 revealed that emissions from the ESPs had reduced. However, when one ESP was processing the dust from two dryers, the emissions still exceeded the levels set by the Alkali Inspectorate.  In December 1978, a report by the Technical Department of NSFL observed that, under normal operating conditions, the emissions from the ESPs at briquetting plant 1 were “just acceptable” but, when the need to carry out maintenance work on one or more of the ESPs reduced the number of ESPs in use, the emissions became “unacceptable”.  </p>

In November 1980, the Alkali Inspector wrote to Mr Howson, managing director of NSFL, insisting that, since only half the ESPs at the Phurnacite Plant were in operation, no more than one dryer should be used.  Mr Howson would not accept that restriction and sent a letter to the Alkali Inspectorate, informing them of that fact.  Problems continued until, in 1981, steps were taken to refurbish the ESPs at briquetting plant 1 and to install continuous electronic monitoring in an attempt to reduce the incidence of ‘trip outs’.

In March 1982, the Alkali Inspector visited the Phurnacite Plant at a time when a single ESP was dealing with the emissions from more than one dryer.  He observed a “heavy black continuous emission of coal dust to atmosphere”.  He wrote to the NCB threatening prosecution and issued an Improvement Notice.  The NCB appealed the Notice which was then modified.  They then complied with the modified Notice and, by June 1983, there was a noticeable reduction in emissions.  Mr Dawes, manager of the Phurnacite Plant between 1980 and 1984, said that, at times during that period, the ESPs would fail once or twice a day.

The lower part of each bunker was below pug floor level and tapered into a conical shape towards the bottom.  There was an inspection door in the side of each bunker which could be accessed from the pug floor.  Coal was stored in the dry coal bunkers until it was required for the next stage of the manufacturing process.  From time to time, ‘blowouts’ or ‘surges’ occurred in the dry coal bunkers when the coal that had built up around the sides of a bunker suddenly collapsed and escaped from the bottom of the bunker.  When this happened, the amount of dust emitted from the bunker would be so great that men working in the dryer house or on the conveyor that carried coal away from the bottom of the dry coal bunkers (the ‘measuring belt’) would have to vacate the building until the dust had settled and the atmosphere had cleared a little.  It was then necessary for the men to clean up the dust, using brushes and shovels and/or a vacuum cleaner.  Some of the witnesses suggested that a ‘surge’ in one of the dry coal bunkers would occur as often as once a shift.  I am satisfied that it was a frequent occurrence before about the mid1970s.  After that time, vibrators were fitted to the dry coal bunkers which appear to have solved the problem of ‘surges’.  ‘Surges’ were also caused when the coal feed to the dryers was interrupted, causing recycled dust alone to be fed into the dryers and from there into the dry coal bunkers.

The area around the measuring belt was often known as the ‘back end’.  The measuring belt weighed the coal so as to ensure that the correct amount of coal went into the pug.  Before the introduction of liquid pitch, solid pitch was added to the dry coal on the measuring belt so as to achieve the correct proportions of coal and pitch.  The measuring belt was open and dust was given off from the dry coal and the pitch.  The measuring belt then took the dry coal (together with the solid pitch, when used) through a cage known as a ‘disintegrator’ or ‘pulveriser’, which revolved at high speed, crushing the coal (and the solid pitch, when used) into tiny pieces.  Problems occurred if the coal and pitch did not feed correctly onto the measuring belt.  In that event, it was possible for coal to be fed into the disintegrator without any pitch or for pitch alone to be fed into the disintegrator.  </p>

After the introduction of liquid pitch, the steam inside the pug kept the pitch in a liquid state during the coating process.  At the bottom of the pug, the mixture of coal and pitch, which by that time had a plastic, dough-like consistency, was discharged at a temperature of about 100ºC into an enclosed worm feeder which carried it on to the press.   </p>

In that event, the pug would have to be cooled down before men were able to go inside it and remove the solid coal and pitch mixture using pneumatic tools.  This operation would produce large quantities of dust containing pitch.

In 1966, there were complaints about dust accumulating around the pug outlets and becoming “an increasing nuisance” when it was blown all over the Phurnacite Plant in windy weather.  It was suggested that Drummond washers might be fitted to the pug outlets.  In 1967, it was reported that the accumulation of dust on the roof of the briquetting building was at least six inches deep and was blowing back onto the pug floor and into the coal tippler area.  A modification to the pug outlets was being considered.  By early 1973, there were still no scrubbers fitted to the pug outlets on briquetting plant 1.  It was estimated that approximately 620 tonnes of dust per annum were being emitted from the three pugs there.  A short time afterwards, Roberts scrubbers were fitted to the pug outlets and these reduced the amount of dust emitted.  Nevertheless, the problem continued to some extent and, in September 1973, there was a complaint about a build-up of dust on the roof of the briquetting plant at briquetting plant 1 which needed clearing.   </p>

From time to time, the contents of the reject bunker were loaded into wagons and taken either to the disintegrator (which appears to have been the system in the early days of the Phurnacite Plant) or (when the quantity of rejected material made that system impracticable) to the coal tippler areas where they were tipped into the wet coal bunkers for re-introduction into the Phurnacite manufacturing process.  Later, the rejected material was carried back to the disintegrators by means of conveyors.  Mr Foster suggested that, at some time, waste material from the press screens was recycled straight back into the press. </p>

In early 1960, a dust collection unit was installed and was said to have improved conditions “tremendously”.  The trommel was fitted with bag filters to collect the dust produced by the screening process.  These bags required manual ‘rapping’ to knock the dust down into the bags.  In addition, they had to be emptied regularly.  Despite the reported improvement following installation of the dust collection unit, a film of fine dust was seen in trommel house 2 at the time of an inspection in January 1961 and, when an inspection door in the trommel was opened, the vibration caused a cloud of dust to fall out of the trommel.  </p>

It was suggested that one solution might be to replace the unit with an automatic system.  By April 1972, a new dust collection system was being trialled at trommel house 2.  This was intended to reduce the amount of fine dust being carried with the raw ovoids to the shuttle car floors of the batteries.

The dust collection system was unable to cope with the increase in dust levels as a result of which a new system was installed in 1976.  This system consisted of a 50-tonne split bunker in which the dust and breeze could be collected and stored prior to re-introduction into the Phurnacite manufacturing process.

The construction of the conveyors inside the briquetting plants changed several times during the period for which the Phurnacite Plant was in operation.  It is not easy to discern exactly which conveyors and elevators were enclosed at any given period and which were open.  It seems that, in briquetting plant 1, most of the conveyors and elevators carrying both wet and dry coal (or dry coal and pitch) were enclosed, rather than open.  However, a document from October 1970 referred to the fact that briquetting plant 2 had an open belt conveying system for wet coal, as a result of which conditions were worse at briquetting plant 2 than at briquetting plant 1.  I have already referred to the conveyors on the pug floor of briquetting plant 2 which were not fully enclosed until 1973.

With conveyors that had a continuously rolling belt, dust and debris fell from the return run of the belt.  Conveyors were sometimes overloaded, as a result of which spillages occurred.

In his opinion, “the dirtiest part was the briquetting area, where drifts of precipitator coal dust were always present”.  Mr Foster, who held a management position at the Phurnacite Plant in the early 1970s, agreed that the dust was worst in the briquetting buildings, although he said that it was a nuisance throughout the Phurnacite Plant, even in the offices.  Mr Holdroyd, who occupied a management post at the Phurnacite Plant in the 1980s, recalled seeing a layer of black dust on a cup of tea on the table in the briquetting plant foreman’s office.  (The office was located in a shed inside one of the briquetting buildings.)

Dr Choo Yin, who visited the Phurnacite Plant frequently from 1979 onwards, said that “conditions in the press hall were very hot and dusty, a mixture of coal and pitch dust … very fine coal dust particles coated in tar/pitch, most of it respirable in size”.  Mr Dubash, manager of the Phurnacite Plant in the late 1960s/early 1970s, recalled that men working in the briquetting buildings would have blackened faces by the end of the shift.    </p>

Before the coal was dried, any dust given off had the usual appearance of coal dust.  After drying, however, the dust changed in character.  It was then extremely fine, became airborne very easily and would readily pass through workers’ clothes and come into contact with their skin.  After the mixture had passed through the pug, any dust that was emitted from the raw ovoids was coarser and more abrasive than the dust emitted from the coal and pitch mixture before it entered the pug.   </p>

I am satisfied that some of that dust would have re-entered nearby buildings and added to the dust levels there.  The remainder of the dust emitted from the pug outlets would have been dispersed.  Much of it would eventually have been deposited on the ground and on other surfaces in and around the Phurnacite Plant, from where it would have been liable to be disturbed by the wind.

The conveyors covered a considerable distance and there were multiple transfer points.  Initially, the raw ovoid conveyors were uncovered.  Walkways ran alongside the conveyors and the men used those walkways as a convenient means of getting from the briquetting plants and trommel houses up to the shuttle car floors at the top of the batteries.  The walkways were also used by the fitters and other tradesmen whose job it was to repair and maintain the conveyors.  There were gaps in the surface of the walkways and there were no collection trays under the conveyor belts.  Dust from the raw ovoids would fall from the conveyor belts and from the walkways and was then blown about the Plant.  At some time, wipers were fitted to the ends of the conveyor belts in order to remove excess dust and breeze which might otherwise be spilled on the belts’ return run.  In August 1966<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">29</span>, it was reported at a meeting of the Phurnacite Plant Consultative Committee that almost all the wipers on the conveyor belts required renewal and that, because of the poor condition of the wipers, a considerable amount of breeze was being dropped under the conveyors.  Mr Middle described how, when carrying out work at a workbench positioned under one of the raw ovoid conveyors, the metal plate he was working on rapidly became covered with dust falling from the conveyor above him.

The Introduction to the CRE report acknowledged that the transfer points on the raw ovoid conveyors were “obvious sources of pollution” and that, when they were in operation, the air round them was “darkened”.  Since many of the transfer points were situated high above ground floor level, the fine particles of dust emitted at them were liable to become windborne and to disperse within and beyond the boundaries of the Phurnacite Plant.  It was recognised that, as well as being a nuisance, the dust from the raw ovoids was a hazard to health.  The object of the work carried out by the CRE was to establish the existing dust emission levels and to test the efficiency of a water spray dust suppression system that had been designed to deal with the problem of dust emissions from the conveyor transfer points. </p>

The sampling revealed that the average rate of dust emission from the various transfer points was 91g per transfer point per minute.  The rates of dust emission varied as between the transfer points.  The highest rates (between 160 g and 230 g per minute) occurred above the outgoing belt carrying the raw ovoids to the shuttle car floor of battery 5.  It was noted that, at that transfer point, the raw ovoids were dropped vertically from one belt onto another through a distance of 56 inches, longer than the drop at any other transfer point.  The authors of the CRE report calculated that, at the existing rate of emission, the total amount of dust emitted from the raw ovoid conveyors in a year was 550 tonnes.  Their experiments led them to conclude that the best means of suppressing the emissions was by water sprays.  They calculated that water sprays would reduce the amount of dust emitted by about 85%. Consideration was subsequently given to the installation of water sprays at transfer points and to the possibility of covering transfer points.

However, it was soon recognised that simple water sprays would have a detrimental effect on the quality of the raw ovoids and would not be wholly successful in suppressing dust.  Instead, an irrigated cyclone was installed for testing purposes.  This had the effect of removing 98% of the dust created at the transfer point where it was situated, whilst causing no operational problems and requiring little maintenance.  It was recognised that, if irrigation cyclones were to be installed at all transfer points, there would have to be a system of disposing of the slurry of dust mixed with water that would be produced.  It was envisaged that this could be done by extending the existing system of disposal of the slurry produced by the Roberts scrubbers fitted to the pug outlets at the two briquetting plants, and  by incorporating a new scheme for water clarification.  </p>

The Board were expressing doubts about the likely efficacy of the irrigated cyclone system and the problems of devising a water clarification scheme that would be acceptable to the Water Authority.

A system of water sprays would be cheaper than the irrigated cyclone system but was unlikely to meet the requirements of the Alkali Inspectorate. He suggested that a conventional system of dust extraction would be difficult to design and maintain and would involve complex arrangements for the collection and disposal of the dust which would accumulate at transfer points.

The report recommended the provision of a water clarification scheme sufficient to deal with all the dust generated by the Phurnacite manufacturing process.  By May 1979, two alternative schemes for water clarification were being examined.  In the event, neither the water clarification scheme nor the irrigation cyclone system was ever implemented.  Mr Foster attributed this to the local Water Authority who, he said, wanted some form of mechanical separation of the contamination from the water before it went into the lagoons.

In September 1980, the District Alkali Inspector followed up those complaints by serving 14 Improvement Notices requiring action on the part of the Phurnacite Plant management.  One such requirement was for the installation of hoods and enclosures to the raw ovoid equipment in order to contain the dust emitted at transfer points and at the bunker tops.

The five blocks of ovens on each battery were charged in sequence so that adjacent blocks were not being charged or discharged at the same time.  The carbonisation process took about four hours and, since the batteries operated 24 hours a day, the operation of charging and discharging was repeated continuously throughout each shift.  In 1971, it was calculated that, on average, the contents of one oven at the Phurnacite Plant were discharged every 70 seconds throughout the day, so that 1,224 ovens were charged and discharged every 24 hours.   </p>

The dust fell through the screen and was then collected in hoppers which required regular emptying.  This was done by transferring the dry dust manually into a barrow and tipping it into a bunker.  From there it was taken back to the briquetting plant coal tipplers (later the coal blending site) for re-introduction into the Phurnacite manufacturing process.  In October 1970, it was estimated that 130 tonnes of dust per week were recovered from the oven floor hoppers at the six batteries then in operation.

Whilst they were being charged, the raw ovoids that entered the ovens first would begin to carbonise and would give off smoke and fume containing particulate material.  During charging, each block of ovens was connected to a smoke main, the purpose of which was to draw off the smoke and fume under suction and to prevent them from being emitted through the charge holes during charging.  However, the smoke main did not always work effectively, largely due to the inadequate depth of the ‘bucket seals’ which were intended to isolate the ovens from the smoke main.  As a result, large amounts of smoke and yellow fumes were given off during charging.  In 1971, a report prepared for the Environmental Control Committee <authorialNote class="footnote" marker="41">
		<p class="footnotedescription"> CB2/100 </p>
	      </authorialNote>described the dense yellow fumes given off during charging at batteries 1, 3, 4 and 5 as “unacceptable both from the point of view of the working conditions and environmental pollution”.

In the early-mid 1960s, there was a problem with some of the oven lids which were too small, causing leakage around the outer edge of the lids.  Sometimes, inadequate cleaning of the oven lids or of the frames on which they rested would prevent the lids from fitting tightly.  In addition, oven lids would become warped and the seals around the lids were prone to perishing.  In July 1971, an inspection carried out on behalf of the Environmental Control Committee<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="44">

	      </authorialNote> observed “considerable gaseous discharges from some of the oven doors”, although this was not evident at the time of a further inspection a week later.  Because of the problems of leaking oven lids, it was the practice for the men working on the oven tops to use the (uncarbonised) dust and debris which had been spilled during the charging of the ovens as a sealant for the oven lids.  They would sweep the material over the oven tops and around the oven lids.  During carbonisation, this material would become hard and would form a seal.  However, the heat from the ovens would cause the material to carbonise and to emit smoke and fumes.  This was a problem in the early 1960s, when an instruction was given to use carbonised breeze (which would not have given off the same level of fumes as the uncarbonised material) as a sealant.  However, the practice of using uncarbonised material persisted.  Even when the men working on the oven tops used carbonised breeze, the breeze tended to become contaminated with raw ovoid dust and debris which had been spilled on the oven tops during charging so that fume and gases would still be given off.  Mr Jasper, safety and environmental chemist at the Phurnacite Plant between 1982 and 1990, described how, on occasion, there would be mounds of coal dust smouldering on the oven tops.  He said that a ‘coal tar fog’ pervaded the oven tops and the ‘oven sides’, i.e. the area on the quenching car floor near to the doors of the ovens. </p>

After 1977, some ovens were re-built, but not all.

In 1978, the same investigating team identified the John Zink burners as a significant source of solid particulate emission due to incomplete combustion<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="54">

Probably the most important was the change in the type of coal used in the manufacture of Phurnacite.  The original purpose of the Phurnacite process had been to use surplus (and, therefore, cheap) duff from local collieries.  Over time, the supply of Welsh dry steam coal diminished and alternatives had to be found.  Attempts were made to mix blends of different coals (particularly anthracite) to mimic the properties of the dry steam coal that had originally been used.  These attempts met with limited success.  When the blending did not work well, the quality of the Phurnacite briquettes produced was adversely affected and the problem of clustering increased.

Mr John Lanyon, who was a spare man on the batteries from 1968 until about 1974, regarded poking as “a rough, hard job … the worst job of all on the batteries”.  He recalled that the time taken to poke an oven would vary depending on the mixture of coal being used.  It could take 20 minutes or it could take “hours or even all shift”.  Eventually, it was agreed that poking should attract an additional payment, the condition for payment being that it had taken at least an hour to poke a block of eight ovens.  Mr Howard Silvanus worked on the oven floor in the 1970s.  His evidence was that it was sometimes necessary to poke for an hour or so.  On other occasions, it was less difficult but he said that “sometimes it was murder”.  </p>

However, other factors also played a part.  Incomplete carbonisation due to inadequate and/or uneven temperatures during carbonisation was recognised to be a contributory cause of clustering.  Damage to the brickwork inside the ovens and problems with the gas supply to the ovens resulted in heat being lost and ovoids being carbonised at temperatures which were less than optimum.  These problems increased as the batteries became older.  On occasions, in an attempt to increase production, a conscious decision would be taken by members of the management staff to carbonise ovoids for less than the usual four-hour period.   </p>

They were also exposed to large quantities of dust and grit produced by the charging and discharging of the ovens and the charging of the raw ovoid bunkers above the ovens, together with the dust which accumulated on the oven tops.  When the John Zink burners did not work properly, untreated fumes and gases were discharged into the atmosphere and would re-enter the batteries if the wind was blowing in a certain direction.  The open sides of the batteries meant that dust, grit, fumes and gases were blown about the oven and shuttle car floors.  If the wind was blowing in the wrong direction, it must have been impossible to avoid exposure to them.  Sweeping up spillages of dust and debris from the oven tops would have caused further dust to enter the atmosphere.   </p>

It had two floors, although the upper floor covered only about half the area of the lower floor.  Access to the upper floor was by means of a door reached by a set of external steps.  On the upper floor there were two gas turbines (only one of which would be working at any one time) and a pump known as a smoke exhauster.  These pieces of equipment were used to extract smoke and gases from the ovens before and during the carbonisation process and to clean the extracted gases so as to enable them to be re-used in the Phurnacite manufacturing process.   </p>

During the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, the lower floor of exhauster house 1 housed two tar pumps, two ammonia pumps and three re-circulation pumps.  By the late 1970s, only the tar pumps remained.  There were two ammonia pumps housed in a small building near the ammonia plant and two re-circulation pumps (or ‘oven liquor pumps’, as they came to be known) situated outside the exhauster house building in the open air.

When the raw ovoids were being dropped into the ovens, a considerable amount of smoke and yellow sulphurous fumes were produced.  As a block of ovens was being charged, the gas off-take would be opened and the smoke exhauster in the exhauster house would be switched on.  The smoke exhauster would then draw the smoke and fumes from the ovens along the smoke main to a liquor wash tower where they were sprayed with water to remove the impurities contained in them.  The water and impurities were then run off into tanks known as ‘drag tanks’, whilst the cleaned smoke was discharged into the atmosphere by the smoke exhauster through a high funnel in the roof of exhauster house 1. </p>

The carbonisation process would produce fumes and gases, including vapourised tar from the pitch contained in the ovoids.  Those fumes and gases were removed from the ovens by suction, using the gas turbines in the exhauster house, and then flowed through the elephants and the smoke box where they were sprayed with hot liquor.  The spraying would cause much of the vapourised tar, together with ammonia, naphthalene and other impurities, to fall out and to mix with the liquor.  The gases that remained, together with the liquor, would then be carried away from the batteries in a ‘foul’ gas main pipe.  From there, the liquor would drop out into the drag tanks, whilst the gases would pass into the gas collection main and then through de-tarrers, coolers and a naphthalene washer.  The clean gases would then pass into the gas turbines and, after undergoing a further purification process, would be stored in gas holders ready for re-use as fuel for heating the ovens.  </p>

Their contents could be inspected by means of sliding open sections in the top of the tanks.  A heavy residue of impurities would collect in the bottom of the drag tanks and would be removed daily by a scraper chain.  Tar would settle above the residue of impurities, with the liquor on top.  As the drag tank filled up, the liquor contained in it would flow out through outlet pipes in the side walls of the tanks.  The liquor would pass into the first of three recirculation tanks, each of which would fill up in turn as the liquor in the previous one reached the level of the outlet pipes.  Meanwhile, tar would be accumulating in the drag tanks.  When it reached a certain level, it would be run off into a tar separation tank (also known as a settling tank).  The tar separation tank would also contain tar collected from other sources, including the de-tarrers.  The drag tanks, the tar separation tank and the recirculation tanks were heated so that their contents remained in a liquid state.  The tar would settle in the bottom of the tar separation tank from where it was pumped by the tar pumps in the exhauster house into tar storage tanks for use in the boilers or for onward transmission to a refining plant.  The hot liquor from the recirculation tanks was either pumped by the re-circulation pumps back to the batteries for re-use or pumped by the ammonia pumps to the ammonia plant or an ammonia storage tank.  </p>

There were stripping tanks containing hot steam pipes through which oil produced in the course of the gas purification process was passed.  Heating the oil separated out the impurities contained in it.  The clean oil was then stored for re-use, whilst the residue (a mixture of benzene and toluene known as ‘benzole’) ran into ‘tank 19’, the tank used to store waste products.  Naphthalene removed by the naphthalene washer also went into ‘tank 19’, together with waste materials collected from other processes.  Those materials included tar which would be pumped out of ‘tank 19’ into one of the re-circulation tanks using the tar pumps in the exhauster house.  ‘Tank 19’ was a large metal tank which was sunk into the ground, with its top at ground level, and encased within a concrete sump.  Its contents could be inspected via a hatch in the top of the tank.  By the 1970s, another ground tank (which I shall refer to as the “ground (waste) tank”) had been installed to take waste products.  </p>

When tar was pumped out of the tar storage tanks, a clay-like residue would be left in the bottom of each tank.  A gang of men would be detailed to clean out the tank and to remove the residue, a task which could take days – or even weeks – at a time.  The men were provided with wellington boots, overalls and gloves, but not respirators. Two men at a time would enter the tanks through a small hole cut in the side and would shovel the tar residue out of the opening whilst other men transferred it to a dumper truck.  The fumes within the tank were very strong and, after about half an hour, it would be necessary for the men to change roles.  Because of the unpleasant nature of the job, a bonus was paid to those men who carried it out.  The same process was followed when the other tanks were cleaned out.  </p>

The exhausterman was responsible for operating the smoke exhauster and the gas turbine pumps.  He would have to liaise closely with the men working on the oven floor in order to ascertain when to open and close the gas off-take valve of the smoke exhauster and when to operate the gas turbine to remove the gases produced during carbonisation.  The operation of the controls was a continuous process and required the exhausterman to remain in the exhauster house for the whole of his shift, apart from designated breaks when the pumpsman would cover for him.

The main problem in exhauster house 1 was said to be the fume caused by leaks from the joints of pumps.  The pumps were in constant use and sustained a good deal of wear and tear.  They would develop leaks which would be repaired using gland packing.  The packing would soon work loose, causing liquid to drip from the joints.  It was not always possible to get a fitter to come immediately to repair a leak so the pumpsman would attempt to carry out running repairs but these would work only temporarily.  As a result, hot tar (and, in the 1950s and 1960s, hot ammonia, liquor and other impurities as well) would be deposited on the floor of the exhauster house.  The evidence was that these hot liquids gave off unpleasant fumes.  The fumes emanating from the tar pumps were described as particularly offensive, especially when the pumps were being used to pump tar from ‘tank 19’.  </p>

Spillages would sometimes occur when drip trays were moved and would splash onto the pumpsman and the floor.  Tar would be transferred onto the pumpsman’s hands and gloves and the pump controls would become covered in tar.

He said that the benzole gave off unpleasant fumes and a pungent smell.  He said that benzole was also used to clean tools and even to clean tar from the pumpsman’s hands.  For much of his time in exhauster house 1, there were no washing facilities and no hot water.  The only available washing facilities were situated in the shower block, a considerable distance away.  I accept Mr Richards’ evidence about the use of benzole during the 1950s and 1960s.  There is some supporting evidence from Mr Middle, another lead claimant.  In the absence of any other solvent, it is understandable that the men used whatever was to hand in order to remove tar deposits.  Washing facilities were installed in exhauster house 1 in about 1965 and, from that time, a suitable cleanser was provided so that it was no longer necessary for the men to use benzole for cleaning their hands.

The dust came, not from the processes carried on in the exhauster house itself, but from the other plant and equipment in the area, in particular the ESPs, trommel house 1 (which was situated close by) and the various conveyors nearby.  Dust would enter the exhauster house through the doors and windows.  The evidence was that the level of dust was such that the exhausterman would have to sweep the upper floor of the exhauster house and clean dust from the equipment there at least once a shift.  His cleaning activities would cause dust to fall onto the lower floor of the exhauster house.  At no time was there any system of extraction or forced ventilation in exhauster house 1.  Mr Lanyon accepted that dust levels in the exhauster house were always less than in the briquetting plants but nevertheless said that, on a windy day, the dust in the exhauster house would be “terrible”.  This was in contrast to the evidence of Mr Brian Jones, who had never worked in the by-products plant but visited there in the course of his duties as a shift superintendent.

This latter task would involve running a small amount of liquid out of each tank into a container.  The contents of the tanks were heated and the evidence was that the pumpsman would be exposed to unpleasant fumes whilst performing these tasks.  The witnesses said that the fumes from ‘tank 19’ were particularly pungent.  Mr Richards recalled that, when looking inside ‘tank 19’, he would often use a mirror in order to avoid having to lean over the inspection hatch and breathe in the fumes.  It seems that, throughout the period from the 1950s to the 1980s, the metal top and sides of ‘tank 19’ were in poor condition, with holes through which material leaked from the tank into the gap between the sides of the tank and the concrete sump surrounding it.  It would often be necessary to siphon the material that had escaped from ‘tank 19’ back into it.  ‘Tank 19’ filled up quickly and therefore required frequent checking.  It sometimes had to be pumped out two or three times a shift.  It was situated near to the door of exhauster house 1 and fumes from it would waft inside the building.    </p>

Their evidence was that, in the 1970s and 1980s, the pumpsman’s duties included the regular opening and steam cleaning of all the pipes and drains leading to ‘tank 19’, the ground (waste) tank and the de-tarrers.  Some of the drains were situated on the lower floor of the exhauster house, whilst others were outside.  Sometimes, when a drain pipe was being unblocked, tar would shoot out of the pipe being steamed onto the floor of the exhauster house or the ground outside and the pumpsman would have to clean it up.  On occasion a drain became blocked with tar or naphthalene and steam would be applied in order to clear the blockage.  The pump columns also had to be steam cleaned to prevent tar and pitch from solidifying inside.  Sometimes, tanks required cleaning with a steam lance.  Mr Silvanus said that the condition of the tanks deteriorated over the time he worked as a pumpsman.  They were not cleaned out as frequently as they should have been, as a result of which solid tar built up in the bottom of some of the tanks and blockages occurred.

A large tar storage pump was used for this purpose.  It was situated in a building known as the small pump house (later the ‘exhauster pump house’), which was no more than about ten feet square and was situated near to the tar storage tank.  In the 1950s and early 1960s, rail tankers were used to transport tar.  The pumpsman would have to stand on top of each tanker as it was being filled and watch as the tar was pumped out of the tar storage tank into an access hole in the top of the tanker.  The tar storage tank was heated so as to keep the tar in a liquid state.  The access holes in the tankers were significantly larger than the pipes through which the tar was pumped and the hot tar gave off fumes which escaped out of the access holes.  The task of filling each tanker would take about half an hour and, during an average week, a pumpsman would fill two or three tankers a day.  The evidence was that, because of the fumes, this was a most unpleasant job.   </p>

Mr Richards’ evidence was that, from that time, he would operate the pump from inside the small pump house, whilst the tanker driver watched the level of tar in the tanker.  Thus, he was no longer exposed to tar fumes from the tankers as they were being filled.  However, there were problems with tar leaking in the small pump house and tar fumes were constantly present in the atmosphere.  Furthermore, the pipes used to fill the tankers had to be steamed out daily, causing further tar fumes to be given off.  </p>

The dust gathered on surfaces in the exhauster houses and had to be swept up on a daily basis.  That task would have generated yet further dust exposure.  I am satisfied, however, that, even at its worst, the dust in the exhauster houses  was far less heavy than in other parts of the Phurnacite Plant, especially the briquetting buildings.  It was no doubt for that reason that the conditions in the exhauster houses were the subject of only a few references in the contemporaneous documents.

If there was no single type of coal available that would fulfil the necessary criteria, it was necessary for a number of different types of coal to be blended together to achieve the required result.  The defendants instituted a system of monitoring the properties of the coal delivered by their suppliers by analysing coal samples on a daily basis.  Testing of Phurnacite ovoids (both raw and carbonised) was carried out daily as part of the defendants’ quality control system.  Tests were also carried out on liquid samples taken from the by-products plant, the pitch bay, the boiler house, the river and other sites at the Plant.  The tests were carried out in part to ensure that the manufacturing process was working satisfactorily and in part to monitor the effects of pollution from the Phurnacite Plant on the local air quality and water supply.  The sampling team consisted of three coal samplers, one plant sampler, two Phurnacite samplers and an effluent officer.  They were responsible for obtaining the various samples and preparing them for onward transmission to the Plant laboratory.  </p>

Until 1973/1974, when the new coal blending site was created, preparation of coal samples was carried out in two small cabins, each situated near to the coal tippler area of one of the briquetting plants.  Once the coal blending site came into operation, the coal tippler area and sample room for briquetting plant 1 were no longer used.  Mr Saunders suggested that the coal tippler area and sample room for briquetting plant 2 continued to be used for some time after 1973.  Mr Harris (a witness in the case of the lead claimant, Mr Robson) said that they were used only when there were interruptions to the process carried out at the coal blending site.  I prefer Mr Harris’ evidence on this point and I am satisfied that, after 1973, most of the coal samplers’ activities would have been conducted in the sample room situated on the ground floor of the wagon tippler control room which was adjacent to the coal blending site (“the coal blending site sample room”).  Since Mr Griffiths’ employment as a sampler began in 1975, he would have spent most of his time working in the coal blending site sample room.   </p>

It was later replaced by a new main sample room situated near to the plant offices and administration block.  Extraction fans were installed in the new main sample room.  Mr Saunders could not say when the location of the main sample room changed, although it must have been prior to September 1980 since the new main sample room is shown on the site plan of the Phurnacite Plant dating from that time.

As the coal passed along the conveyor taking it to the blending rollers, the coal sampler would take scoopfuls of coal from different parts of the consignment.

The object of this exercise was to obtain a representative sample of coal for analysis.

He would then pour the dried coal into a crushing machine which ground it into a very fine flour-like dust.  The crushed coal dust was fed automatically into a container situated under the crushing machine.  The coal sampler would then empty the contents of the container into a sample bottle and label the bottle.

He described how, if a coal sampler did not fit the container to the crushing machine firmly enough, a large quantity of very fine dust would escape when the crushed coal was discharged from the drying machine.

It is clear that the work of a coal sampler involved one significant source of dust, i.e. the process of tipping 1,200g of dried coal from one tray to another.  That task was performed 15-20 times a shift.  I find that there were also occasional incidents when the container attached to the crushing machine became accidentally displaced.  I also accept that some dust was caused by the transfer of the fine dust from the container into sample bottles.  Given the absence of extraction facilities and the confined space within the coal sample rooms, I can well understand that the dust produced by these operations would have remained in the air for some time before settling.  The dust would have accumulated on the floor and other surfaces of the sample room during the working day.  If this was not cleaned up, it would inevitably have been disturbed as the coal sampler moved around in the course of his work.  The cleaning up of the accumulated dust would have caused further exposure to dust.  However, I regard Mr Saunders’ suggestion that the exposure to dust in the coal blending site sample room would have been 75% of that which would have been encountered in one of the briquetting plants as something of an over-estimate. </p>

I accept that there may have been some exposure to recycled pitch dust on the odd occasion.  However, I consider that this would have been very infrequent since the purpose of coal sampling was to ascertain the properties of the coal being delivered by suppliers.  It therefore seems unlikely that samples would have been taken from coal which had already been contaminated by recycled material.  There would, I accept, have been a greater potential for exposure to pitch dust before 1973/1974, when the coal sample rooms near the coal tippler areas were in daily use.  It is clear from the evidence that recycled dust was tipped at the coal tippler area and that this gave rise to significant emissions of coal and pitch dust.

The NCB had established its own standard of ‘approved conditions’ governing what was considered to be an acceptable level of coal dust in mines.  Conditions were ‘approved’ in collieries (other than anthracite collieries) if they complied with the relevant standard of ‘permissible dustiness’ which was not more than 850 particles of respirable size per cubic centimetre (ppcc).  A particle of ‘respirable size’ is a particle measuring between one and five microns. </p>

However, the standard became more widespread and came to govern the NCB’s notion of what constituted ‘safe’ exposure and what did not.  The system of ‘approved conditions’ was much criticised by Turner J (as he then was) in the British Coal Respiratory Disease Litigation (BCRDL) lead actions.  He observed that the NCB appeared to have become “mesmerised” or “corrupted” by the notion that it was only if a coal face was not ‘approved’ that anything needed to be done to reduce the level of dust concentration.  When the NCB first carried out sampling at the Phurnacite Plant, it was with the risk of pneumoconiosis in mind and the standard they applied was that of ‘approved conditions’.  </p>

Furthermore, it appears that, until the mid-late 1970s, there were no TLVs governing occupational exposure to dust or particulates emitted at premises such as the Phurnacite Plant.

However, their advice was that, where that type of dust was emitted, a higher standard of dust control than that required for “ordinary” coal dust would be expected.  They pointed out that, in premises where pitch-bound briquettes were being manufactured, the Patent Fuel Manufacture (Health and Welfare) Special Regulations 1946 would be applicable.  </p>

In 1967, the American Conference of Government Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) introduced an occupational limit (the ‘ACGIH TLV’) for exposure to CTPVs.  The ACGIH TLV required that the amount of BSM in the CTPVs should not exceed an eight-hour time-weighted average of 0.2 mgm<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">-3</span>of air.  The ACGIH TLV was subsequently adopted as an established Federal standard in the USA and coke oven operators were required to comply with that standard.   </p>

This was a Committee composed of representatives from the NCB, the British Steel Corporation (BSC) and the Factory Inspectorate.  At the first meeting of the Committee in April 1973, the CAOE accepted the ACGIH TLV as an interim exposure standard pending further investigation into the risks posed by emissions from coke ovens.  </p>

In the 1950s and 1960s, a unit known as a “thermal precipitator” was used for static sampling at the Phurnacite Plant.  This unit could take only short term measurements of respirable dust.  Particles of dust measuring between one and five microns (µ) were measured by collecting them on a glass and physically counting them using a microscope.  Initially the results were reported in ppcc.  The accuracy of readings taken by means of thermal precipitators has been the subject of controversy.  There was a tendency for particles captured by the precipitator to overlap and thus to be missed when counting took place.  Investigations have suggested that dust readings taken by thermal precipitators could be under-estimated by a factor of as much as two. </p>

They were fitted with an elutriator which separated out all the non-respirable particles of dust and allowed the particles of smaller diameter (the respirable dust) to pass through to a final collection filter which was then weighed.

What it cannot do is to provide accurate information about the exposure of a worker employed in the area during the course of a shift.  Static sampling takes no account of the worker’s movements during the course of a shift, of varying levels of exposure according to his position or of any absence from the working area, for example during breaks.

The unit used for personal sampling at the Phurnacite Plant was the Casella Model C (Casella) sampler.  The basic Casella sampler collected total dust only.  An extra cyclone fitment was available by which the respirable particles of dust could be separated out for later measuring.  At the end of the shift, it was possible to calculate in mgm<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">-3</span> the average concentration of total dust (and, when the cyclone fitment was used, the average concentration of respirable dust also) to which the wearer had been exposed in the course of his shift.    </p>

Dr Choo Yin said that he was aware of the potential risk to workers who were exposed to carcinogenic substances.  If he saw a man in a working position, or undertaking a task, where he was liable to be exposed to excessive dust or fume, he would advise him to change his position or his working method so as to minimise his exposure.  For example, if he saw a man sweeping up dust, he would advise him to use a vacuum cleaner.  He was not involved in the analysis of the samples or in the calculation of exposure levels.  He said that, sometimes, it was clear from the atypical size and quality of dust particles on a sampler filter that the dust had not come from the atmosphere.  This might occur if an operative had leaned forward causing the sampler head to come into contact with a dusty surface.  It might be the result of interference with the sampling unit by the man wearing it.  He said that, if there appeared to be “something not quite right” about a sample, he and his colleagues would note the circumstances on their paper record and would discard the sample.

It cannot have been because the early sampling had proved reassuring.  On the contrary, it had shown that in some areas at least, the concentrations of dust and, in particular BSM, gave rise to a health hazard, as well as making working conditions very unpleasant. </p>

	      </authorialNote>, the Phurnacite Plant Works Consultative Committee were addressed by Mr Smith, NCB’s chief scientist for Wales, who reported on the results of recent personal sampling at the Plant.  He informed the Committee that the average dust levels for the pitch bays, briquetting plant 1 and briquetting plant 2 were, respectively, 6 mgm<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">-3</span>, 15 mgm<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">-3</span> and 18 mgm<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">-3</span>.

The average BSM concentration on the shuttle car floor was 15 mgm<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">-3</span>.  It was hoped that the recent “modernisation” (i.e. the installation of remote controls) would reduce the exposure of the shuttle car operator.  The “norm” for the quenching car and ramp floors was said to be 5 mgm<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">-3</span>, with a few higher readings.  Mr Smith observed that the BSM measurements were “very erratic”.  He said that the TLV of 0.2 mgm<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">-3</span> was “not very practical” for the Phurnacite Plant.  It had been devised for use in coke ovens where pitch was not used.  Since the constituents of pitch were soluble in benzene, it was, he said, not surprising that BSM concentrations at the Phurnacite Plant exceeded the TLV. </p>

Sampling in the pitch bays ceased in mid-1977, with the introduction of liquid pitch in briquetting plant 2.  No sampling results are recorded for the shuttle car floor in 1978 or 1979.

The purpose of the sampling was to determine the concentrations of dust (both respirable and total), BSM and BaP in the atmosphere at various locations where men were employed on cleaning duties.  Static samplers were positioned above one of the conveyor belts and sampling was carried out whilst men were cleaning up spillages in the pits below the conveyor belt, whilst men were shovelling spillages through a hole in the wall at ground floor level near the belt and whilst men were cleaning a blockage from beneath one of the presses in the vicinity of the belt.  As well as two static samplers, two personal samplers were placed in positions near to the static samplers.  One personal sampler was used to measure total dust and the other personal sampler measured respirable dust. </p>

Thereafter, although the evidence suggests that personal sampling continued, no results are available for the whole of the period until the production of the Phurnacite ceased in 1990.

Before 1975, sampling (both personal and static) was sporadic.  There are no results of any sampling in the 1940s, and only three sets of results of static sampling from the 1950s and 1960s.  No personal sampling was conducted until 1971.  Even when a regular programme of personal sampling began, it was usually performed only once (at the most twice) a year in each area, raising question marks about how representative the results are.  Until the mid-1980s the programme of personal sampling did not include the measurement of respirable dust.  The evidence of Dr Choo Yin was that it was only from the mid-1980s that an additional cyclone fitment was used in conjunction with the Casella samplers in order to measure respirable, as well as total, dust.  However, no results survive of any sampling conducted between March 1983 and the cessation of production at the Phurnacite Plant in 1990.   </p>

Subsequently, Professor Jones produced a Supplemental Report (his first Supplemental Report), responding to matters contained in Professor Syred’s Generic and Supplemental Reports (in particular, his comparison between the carbonisation process at the Phurnacite Plant and the Söderberg process), and also with other topics, including the issue of ‘background’ exposure levels. </p>

Professor Jones provided a further Supplemental Report (his second Supplemental Report), in which he set out revised calculations of the exposure levels of the lead claimants and addressed topics such as the exposure levels of peripatetic workers, and whether the calculations of exposure levels should be adjusted to take account of overtime hours worked.

He sought to support that finding by constructing various ‘models’, based on a number of assumptions.  The defendants argued, and I accept, that some of those assumptions were arbitrary and/or unrealistic.  For example:   </p>

He concluded that particles measuring 5 microns or less had a residence time in air of more than 90 (rather than 900) seconds, whilst particles measuring 20 microns would remain in the air for only 5 (rather than 50) seconds.  The error was pointed out by Professor Jones in his first Supplemental Report, and was immediately accepted by Professor Syred.  What I found surprising was not the fact that the arithmetical error was made, but that the results of his calculations had not struck Professor Syred as odd or wrong until the error was pointed out to him.

He assumed, for the purposes of his calculation, that dust emissions occurred from one point in the dryer house of briquetting plant 1, one and a half points in the dryer house of briquetting plant 2, one point each in the briquetting buildings of both briquetting plants and one point in press house 5 of briquetting plant 2.  He further assumed that the amount of dust emitted at each point was the same as the average dust emission from each transfer point on the raw ovoid conveyor, i.e. 91 grammes per minute.  I find it quite impossible to understand how that assumption could be valid, since the nature of the material being handled in the dryer houses and in the briquetting plant prior to pressing was quite different from that being carried by the raw ovoid conveyors.  Moreover, the processes carried out in the briquetting buildings produced dust from a large number of sources, not just one or two points.  The total amount of dust emitted may have been more or less than that generated by the raw ovoid conveyors.   </p>

		<p class="footnotedescription"> Syred1/59-66 </p>
	      </authorialNote>.  There was no evidence to support this assumption and in oral evidence Professor Syred accepted that the number of air changes was very low.  However, he considered that it was realistic because of the evidence about poor ventilation in the briquetting plants.  When making the same calculation for press house 5, however, he changed that assumption to 10 air changes per hour, explaining that the press house 5 was of much newer construction (it was opened in 1970) than the other briquetting buildings and would have had much better ventilation.  Again, there was no evidence to support Professor Syred’s figure of 10 air changes per hour.  The defendants pointed out that, if Professor Syred had made the same assumption of four air changes per hour for press house 5 as in his previous calculations, the result would have been that there would have been more respirable dust than total dust.   </p>

The various calculations and assumptions that I have referred to did not form part of Professor Syred’s estimates of exposure levels in the individual lead cases.  He based those estimates on the actual data available from personal and static monitoring carried out at the Phurnacite Plant.

Instead, Mr Stear answered by explaining that the fact that no sampling had been undertaken did not mean that the defendants had not been carrying out “investigations”.  He suggested that they had not been “resting on their laurels and doing nothing”.  They had been making improvements during that time.  He suggested that the decision not to carry out sampling might have been part of a “structured programme” or an issue of “resource commitment” to other sites.  These suggestions were matters of pure speculation on his part and were of no assistance to me.

He considered that the evidence suggested that conditions in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s had been as bad – if not worse – than during the 1970s and early 1980s.  He pointed out that the sampling results for the 1980s did not show any reduction in exposure levels.  If anything, exposure levels appeared to be rising in the early 1980s.  Therefore there was no basis for assuming that exposure levels became lower after 1983.  He considered that the fairest approach was to assume that the exposure levels remained constant throughout the life of the Phurnacite Plant.

The data for 1971 and 1972 consisted of two sampling results each for the shuttle car floor, the oven tops and the quenching car floor, and one result each for the pitch bays and the ramps.  Mr Stear used those data to calculate the average concentrations of total dust and BSM in each of the relevant areas of the batteries.

	      </authorialNote>.  He explained that he had calculated the average exposure levels for the two periods separately in order to reflect the fact that the concentrations of total dust and BSM appeared to be lower during the earlier period than in the later period.  He attributed the apparent increase in the personal exposure levels of workers on the batteries between the period from 1971 to 1972 and the period from 1975 until 1983 to the worsening problem of ovoids clustering in the ovens, necessitating frequent and lengthy periods of poking.  He estimated that the exposure of operatives working on the oven tops would have been about 7.5 times higher when the ovens were being charged and discharged than at other times.  When poking out clusters of carbonised ovoids from the ovens, their exposure would have been particularly high.  He concluded from the available evidence that the problem of clustering became particularly serious from about the mid-1970s and, from that time, led to higher exposure levels for process operatives working on the shuttle car floor, oven tops, quenching car floor and ramp floor.  </p>

He suggested that the evidence showed that clustering of ovoids during the carbonising process first became a real problem some time during the 1960s.  If that were so, exposure levels on the batteries during the 1940s, 1950s and early to mid 1960s might well have been lower than those recorded for 1971 and 1972.   </p>

On the batteries, however, concentrations on the quenching car and ramps were consistently lower than those for the oven tops and shuttle car floor.  He noted that there was some evidence that concentrations were higher in briquetting plant 2 than in briquetting plant 1, although the difference was not large.  There were, he said, some results that appeared to be “enormously high”.

There was a very limited amount of data available for the period 1971-1972 and I accept Professor Jones’ view that the data were insufficient to justify a conclusion that the working conditions during that period were significantly different from the conditions that existed from 1975 onwards.  It is clear from the evidence that the clustering of ovoids was a problem throughout the life of the Phurnacite Plant and had been a feature of the working conditions on the oven tops and the quenching car floor well before 1975.   </p>

This approach generally accords with the evidence of the witnesses about the conditions throughout the buildings in the briquetting plants.  Professor Jones’ decision to use average levels of exposure for the oven and shuttle car floors and for the quenching car floors and ramps was also appropriate in my view. </p>

Mr Stear, however, excluded one set of results for the shuttle car floor on the ground that he considered the results to be “aberrant”.  I do not consider that his decision to exclude those figures was justified.  It is plain from Dr Choo Yin’s evidence that those responsible for carrying out the sampling would discard what they considered to be suspect results.  The fact that the results in question were not discarded would suggest that they were not considered to be aberrant at the time.  Furthermore, this was not the only occasion when dust levels on the shuttle car floor were found to be high.  On two occasions in 1972, dust levels of 103 mgm<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">-3</span> were measured by a static sampler placed in the position occupied by the shuttle car operator.  These high dust levels were attributed at the time to the effects of the wind on the movement of the dust particles.  It may be that the prevailing weather conditions also caused the results which Mr Stear considered to be aberrant.  However, the shuttle car operator would have had to contend with the effects of weather conditions on a daily basis, together with any additional exposure to dust that they might cause.  It is not surprising that dust levels on the shuttle car floor were high, bearing in mind the huge amounts of dust emitted at the raw ovoid conveyor transfer points, many of which were at shuttle car floor level and the large quantities of dust produced by the processes being conducted on the oven and shuttle car floors.  </p>

I have no doubt that, in doing so, he had the men’s welfare in mind. But his actions would of course have had the effect of reducing the exposure levels of the men being sampled from what they would have been had the men been performing their work in their customary fashion. Dr Choo Yin also said that his impression was that there would usually have been some tidying of the workplace before he and his sampling team arrived.  That being the case, I consider that the results of the personal sampling set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Table 6.4 </span>– and therefore Professor Jones’ calculations, which are based on those results –  are likely to underestimate the actual exposure of the men working at the Phurnacite Plant.  </p>

These assumptions did not form part of his calculations of individual exposure levels.  In his first Supplemental Report, Professor Jones considered Professor Syred’s assumptions.  Professor Jones noted that his own original Generic Report and his Reports in the individual lead cases had made no allowance for any exposure to dust, BSM and BaP that might have arisen in areas of the Phurnacite Plant other than the areas for which sampling results were included in <span style="font-style:italic">Table 6.4</span>.

	    <p style="margin-left:-0.00in;margin-right:0.03in">3.102 Professor Jones elected to fill this gap by undertaking a computer modelling exercise (his ‘modelling dispersion exercise’) to calculate the concentrations of respirable dust, BSM and BaP resulting from emissions of dust and fume into the atmosphere at various areas of the Phurnacite Plant.  For this purpose, Professor Jones used a recognised software package developed in collaboration with the UK Environment Agency.  The calculations carried out for the purpose of the model took into account variables such as meteorological conditions, the effects of terrain on dispersion, the height of exhaust stacks, efflux velocity, the temperature of emitted gases and the effects of buildings around emission points.  A computer model of the Phurnacite Plant was set up, identifying emission points and using data on actual emissions taken from the defendants’ documents.  Professor Jones concluded from those documents that emissions from the pug vents had reduced very substantially from about 1974.  He therefore calculated two separate sets of exposure data to show the effects of this reduction.  The exposure levels resulting from the modelling dispersion exercise are set out in the Tables at Appendix 2 of this judgment.  </p>

The addition of ‘background’ exposure levels to his assessments of exposure levels was, of course, favourable to the claimants and Professor Jones’ decision to carry out this work was an example of the fairness with which he approached his role as an expert witness.  </p>

Nor is it feasible for me to make any assessment of its validity.  However, the claimants were content to accept the ‘background’ levels of exposure calculated by means of the modelling dispersion exercise.  Mr Stear also accepted the ‘background’ levels and subsequently revised his own calculations to take account of ‘background’ exposure.  </p>

The dust would have come from many sources, the main sources being the ESPs, the raw ovoid conveyors and, until the mid-1970s, the pug outlets.  Much of the dust would have contained pitch.  Some of that dust would have blown into the buildings at the Phurnacite Plant.  Some would have settled on the ground and on roofs and other surfaces from where it would have been liable to be distributed by cleaning operations or by the wind.  There would therefore have been some potential for exposure to dust containing pitch all over the Phurnacite Plant.  I have already referred to Mr Foster’s evidence that dust was a nuisance, even in the offices. </p>

It has in effect been accepted by all the experts and I am content to adopt it as the basis for assessing exposure in areas of the Phurnacite Plant other than those for which sampling results are contained in <span style="font-style:italic">Table 6.4</span>.    </p>

This was because the men working in the exhauster houses had a considerable amount of exposure to tar, 50-60% of which would consist of pitch.  Professor Syred referred in particular to the evidence that the pumpsmen had used steam cleaning equipment to remove tar deposits.  He said that the application of high pressure steam to tar causes fine particles of dust and other materials contained in the tar to be dislodged and dispersed into the atmosphere.  As a result, the levels of BSM and BaP to which the pumpsmen were exposed are likely to have been high.   </p>

He considered that the main exposure in the exhauster houses and elsewhere in the by-products plants would have been to hydrocarbons with low boiling points and high velocity at lower temperatures.  He said that, although the pumpsmen would have been exposed to what they described as ‘fumes’, those ‘fumes’ would in fact have been vapourised hydrocarbons.  The vapours would have had a strong odour and may well have produced the various effects (e.g. coughing and spluttering and difficulty breathing) described by the witnesses.  Professor Jones said that benzene would have been the main constituent of the vapours; toluene, naphthalene and xylene would probably have been present as well.  He referred to data from a survey of benzene concentrations in coke works which suggested that, even in by-products plants which (unlike the Phurnacite Plant) had separate benzole processing plants, few workers had exposure to benzene in excess of the exposure limits advised by the HSE.  Professor Jones considered that the exposure of the pumpsmen at the Phurnacite Plant to benzene was likely to be, on average, no more than a few parts per million.   </p>

In the coal blending site sample room, the coal sampler would have been dealing mainly with newly delivered coal which would have been uncontaminated by pitch from recycled ovoids or pitch dust.  Since the purpose of coal sampling was to analyse newly delivered coal, it is unlikely that samples would generally have been taken from coal that was already contaminated by recycled material.  I accept that there might have been some exposure to dust containing pitch when a coal sampler was working in the coal sample room near the tippler area at briquetting plant 2.

All three samplers were set up to measure both total and respirable dust and were mounted close together.  As usual with static samplers, the intakes on the MRE were horizontal, whilst the intake on the Casella was inverted in order to simulate the position of the human nostrils.  The study revealed that the MRE sampler consistently measured larger total dust concentrations than the Casella personal sampler.  Respirable dust concentrations were similar for the two samplers but, because the total dust levels measured by the Casella sampler were lower, respirable dust formed a much higher percentage of the total dust levels for that sampler.  The implication of the results reported in the IOM document was that, had measurements of total and respirable dust been made at the Phurnacite Plant using Casella personal samplers, a higher ratio of respirable to total dust would have been obtained for Casella samplers than for static samplers operating side by side with them.  Professor Syred calculated that the respirable dust levels measured by a Casella personal sampler would have been 1.84 times the levels that were in fact measured by the MRE static samplers used at the Phurnacite Plant.

He observed that the briquetting plants handled the constituents of Phurnacite briquettes in a number of different forms, from coal and pitch dust to the raw ovoids.  The proportion of respirable dust emitted at each different stage of the manufacturing process would vary.  For that reason, and because of the paucity of available data relating to respirable dust concentrations in the briquetting plants, he did not regard it as appropriate to attempt to estimate what proportion of the total dust measured during personal sampling in the briquetting plants would have been respirable.

At one point in his evidence, he appeared to suggest that, during his meeting with Professor Syred, he had merely “gone along” with Professor Syred’s view so as to achieve an agreed answer on the issue of respirable dust.  That assertion was plainly untenable given the contents of his Generic Report.  In fact, he had obviously changed his view after the Joint Meeting.  Why he persisted in refusing to accept that fact, I do not know.  His change of mind may well have occurred for good reason and would not in itself have been a ground for criticism.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:-0.00in;margin-right:0.03in">4.14 In his Generic Report, Professor Jones attempted to calculate exposure levels to respirable dust in various areas of the Phurnacite Plant.  He used, first, the results of the static sampling carried out in 1951, 1954 and 1964.  Those results contained measurements (in ppcc) for respirable (but not total) dust.  For the purpose of the calculation, Professor Jones converted the sampling results from ppcc into gravimetric units (mgm<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">-3</span>).  He described this as a “rough” conversion, using an MNI of 17.7 which, he said, was a typical value for coal preparation plants.  He acknowledged that he could not be certain that the MNI was appropriate for use at the Phurnacite Plant.  He was adamant, however, that any overlap of particles on the thermal precipitator that might have affected the accuracy of the particle count would have been corrected by the MNI.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:-0.00in;margin-right:0.03in">4.15 Professor Jones also used the small number of sampling results from the period 1971-1982 for which both respirable and total dust concentrations were available.  He took a simple average of the respirable fractions.  That resulted in an average respirable fraction of 21% for the briquetting plants and 16% for the oven tops.  The calculations were not set out in Professor Jones’ Generic Report and it was not entirely clear how he had reached his figures.  When first asked about this in his oral evidence, he could not recall precisely what data he had used or how he had made his calculations.  He examined the data again overnight during his oral evidence.  On re-considering the data, Professor Jones realised that he had failed to take into account the results of sampling in the briquetting plant in November 1972.  If included, those results would have increased the respirable fraction in the briquetting plant to 22.8% (before any ‘correction’ to reflect the difference between the results measured by a static and a personal sampler).  If he had also added in the measurements taken over one of the conveyor belts in February 1979<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="142">

He concluded, as have I, that many of the assumptions underlying Professor Syred’s modelling exercise were arbitrary, and in some cases unrealistic, and that little or no reliance could be placed on the results.  He considered that actual measurements of the proportion of respirable dust present at the Phurnacite Plant provided a more reliable basis for determining exposure levels to respirable dust than results obtained by modelling.  However, he acknowledged that the data were very sparse and that his estimates based upon that data may therefore be very unreliable.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:-0.00in;margin-right:0.03in">4.17 As to his calculation of the respirable dust fractions on the batteries, Professor Jones frankly acknowledged that it had been incorrect.  He had failed to take into account some of the available data.  Using all the data now available to him, he calculated respirable fractions of 14.3% for the oven tops, 1.2% for the shuttle car floor (on the basis of one result only) and 22% for the quenching car floor.  The fact that the respirable fraction for the quenching car floor was more than that for the oven tops appeared counter-intuitive and Professor Jones agreed that it was “strange”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:-0.00in;margin-right:0.03in">4.18 Professor Jones went on to consider the IOM document on which Professor Syred had relied.  He accepted that it was appropriate to increase measurements of respirable dust taken by means of a MRE static sampler by a factor of about 1.84 (he calculated the relevant figure at 1.82) in order to reflect the proportion of respirable dust that would have been measured if a Casella personal sampler, rather than a MRE static sampler, had been used. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:-0.00in;margin-right:0.03in">4.19 Professor Jones emphasised that there were a number of ways in which the respirable fraction could be calculated.  He had adopted the same approach as Professor Syred, namely taking the ratio of each sampling result, then averaging the ratios.  An alternative method would have been to take the ratio of the average total dust against the average respirable dust from all the sampling results.  That would have resulted in significantly lower respirable fractions.  He said that it would only be appropriate to use that method if one could be sure that the exposures were representative.  A third method would have been to plot the sampling results on a graph and obtain an average respirable fraction in that way. However, he acknowledged that this was not a satisfactory way of proceeding on such limited data.  Overall, Professor Jones considered that the method which he and Professor Syred had adopted was probably the most appropriate.  However, he concluded that, given the very limited data available, and the various different methods of analysing them, the results could be widely varying. </p>

It is unfortunate also that the results of the static sampling for respirable dust (which, according to Dr Choo Yin, was carried out in conjunction with personal sampling at least from the time of his arrival at the Phurnacite Plant in 1979 until the introduction of personal sampling for respirable dust in the mid-1980s) are no longer available.

	    <p style="margin-left:-0.00in;margin-right:0.03in">4.21 The calculations based on that data undertaken by both Professor Syred and Professor Jones were subject to a number of uncertainties.  They were based on very few sampling results.  That of itself renders any conclusion very unreliable.  A single abnormally high or low sampling result would have had a disproportionate effect on the results of the calculations.  In addition, Professor Jones had included results from the sampling conducted in the 1950s and 1960s.  There are doubts about the accuracy of the results produced by the types of static sampler used in the sampling exercises conducted at that time.  Even if Professor Jones was right in saying that the use of the MNI would have corrected any possible inaccuracy caused by particle overlap in the thermal precipitator, the accuracy of the conversion from ppcc to gravimetric units would depend on the use of the appropriate MNI.  I do not know whether the use of an MNI appropriate to a coal preparation plant is valid in the context of the conditions at the Phurnacite Plant.  If it is not, then the conversion process would be flawed.  It is debatable whether it is preferable to exclude the data from the 1950s and 1960s on the ground that they may be unreliable or to include them on the basis that, despite their possible unreliability, they do at least increase the total amount of data available. </p>

There was also considerable uncertainty as to how the respirable fraction of dust should be calculated.  Indeed it was clear from the way Professor Jones’ evidence on this topic developed that the exercise presented so many difficulties that I could have no real confidence in the reliability of any calculations made.  Having said that, however, I am satisfied from the witness evidence that there was a high proportion of respirable dust in the buildings at the two briquetting plants.  The material being handled in many areas of the buildings consisted of fine dry dust.  I find the evidence of Dr Choo Yin, who referred to the presence in the press hall of “very fine coal dust particles coated in tar/pitch, most of it respirable in size”, particularly significant.  Despite the problems with Professor Syred’s evidence, it may well be that his estimate that 50% of the dust in the briquetting buildings was of respirable size was reasonably accurate. </p>

I am satisfied that personal samplers were issued only to operatives working on specific processes (e.g. moving pitch, operating the press or pug, working on the shuttle car, oven tops or quenching car, cleaning out a pit), rather than to peripatetic workers, who would move between different tasks and/or areas during the course of their work, or to supervisory staff, who would not always be taking an active part in the relevant processes.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:-0.00in;margin-right:0.03in">4.25 When assessing the appropriate levels of exposure for peripatetic employees and supervisory staff, three distinct and different issues arise.  The first issue is what division of the individual’s shift is appropriate, as between his various duties and the different areas in which he might work and therefore the different exposure levels he might have?  For example, a process operative may spend all his shift (except for specified breaks) operating a machine in a dusty working area, whilst a supervisor may spend 20% of his time doing paperwork in the office/canteen, 20% of his time walking between various locations, and only 60% of his time in the same dusty working area as the process operative.  It was broadly accepted by all three experts that the two men in that example would have different levels of exposure and that some reduction in exposure levels should be assumed during the periods for which the supervisor was away from the dusty working area.  The same would go for a fitter, whose average working day might be divided between one or more dusty working areas and a less dusty environment, such as a workshop.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0.00in;margin-right:0.03in">4.26 The second issue is whether, during the periods for which the supervisor, fitter or other peripatetic worker is working in a dusty area, his exposure levels will be the same as those of the process operatives working in the same area?  The three experts disagreed on this issue.  Professor Syred’s position was that there were no adequate data which would allow him to calculate the exposure levels of workers carrying out peripatetic jobs or working in a supervisory capacity.  He therefore made his assessments of individual exposure levels on the basis that, during the periods for which they were exposed to dust and/or fume in working areas, no distinction should be drawn between the exposure levels of workers carrying out peripatetic jobs or working in a supervisory capacity and the exposure levels of process operatives working in the same areas.  </p>

However, in the revised calculations of the exposure levels of the individual lead claimants contained in his second Supplemental Report, Professor Jones explained that, when he had made his original calculations, he had not been sure whether the personal sampling results in <span style="font-style:italic">Table 6.4</span> included the results of sampling of peripatetic employees or those with supervisory roles.  If they had, the average exposure levels resulting from the sampling would have taken account of the lesser exposure of men who were not process operatives.  Having heard the evidence of Dr Choo Yin and re-considered the matter, he had concluded that the likelihood was that the wearing of personal samplers had been confined to process operatives.  Thus, he considered it appropriate to treat the exposure of peripatetic employees and supervisory staff differently from that of process operatives.  He concluded that they would, in general, have had less exposure than process operatives working in the same areas. Professor Jones was subject to some criticism from the claimants for his change of mind on this issue.  However, I found his reasons for revising his views entirely understandable.  It seemed to me that, in his original Reports, he had given the claimants the benefit of the doubt.  It was only when he was satisfied of the likelihood that the personal sampling had been confined to process operatives that he considered it appropriate to make any reduction to reflect the lesser exposure of peripatetic employees and supervisory staff.  </p>

He considered it reasonable to assume that fitters would, on balance, have had the same exposure as process operatives.  His reasoning was that, whilst they may have had less exposure from operating plant and machinery, they would have had periods of much greater exposure when opening up conveyors and other dusty plant and machinery and when cleaning surfaces before starting work.

Process foremen would not have been responsible for charging the ovens or cracking open oven lids on a regular basis.  Unless they were carrying out the task of poking an oven (which I accept did happen on occasion), they would usually have been able to remove themselves from the immediate vicinity of the fumes emitted during poking operations.  They would not have been responsible regularly, if at all, for opening oven doors and releasing the cooked ovoids into the quenching car.  When visiting the shuttle car floor, they would not have been personally engaged in charging the shuttle car bunkers with raw ovoids.  Nevertheless, I am satisfied that the job of a process foreman was very much a ‘hands on’ troubleshooting role which required him to be present wherever and whenever a problem affecting the carbonising process (of which the clustering of ovoids in the ovens was a common example) arose.  If a process foreman carried out his duties conscientiously, he would inevitably have spent a large proportion of his time in the vicinity of the ovens whilst carbonisation, charging and discharging was taking place and would have been exposed to significant amounts of dust and fume.  Conditions on the batteries, which I have described in Section 2 of this judgment, were not such that it would have been possible to avoid the dust and fume emitted there. </p>

I am satisfied that Mr Stear’s assessment of 25% of the exposure levels of a process operative working in the same area is a significant underestimate.  Nor do I accept that a shift superintendent would have had as much exposure to dust as the foreman responsible for the same area.  I consider that a foreman would be more likely to remain in one position for some time, supervising the work in hand or giving practical assistance.

For the claimants in respect of whom no records were available, he used the average weekly number of hours’ overtime calculated by reference to the four claimants whose records have survived.

The venture met with considerable success and, during the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s, manufacturing capacity at the Phurnacite Plant was continually expanded.  However, that expansion was not accompanied by the installation of suitable infrastructure to deal with the dust, fume and effluent emitted from the Phurnacite Plant.  It is clear that, at least from the early 1950s, there were serious concerns about the atmospheric and other pollution caused by the Phurnacite manufacturing process.  Those concerns caused the Alkali Inspectorate and the local district council to press the NCB to take remedial measures.  This pressure was maintained and increased over a period of more than three decades until the cessation of Phurnacite production in 1990.  </p>

During the hearing, it was suggested on behalf of the claimants that the NCB/NSFL should have done more to secure adequate supplies of suitable coal.  It was argued that economics had played a significant part in the NCB’s decision to use local coal supplies, rather than looking further afield (even abroad) for the right type of coal.  I do not consider that I am equipped to express a view about those criticisms.  I did not hear detailed evidence on the topic of coal supply and did not find Professor Syred’s assertion (based on internet research conducted whilst he was giving evidence) that the NCB could readily have obtained supplies of suitable coal from France particularly compelling.  I shall proceed on the basis that, for whatever reason, the Phurnacite Plant experienced increasing problems with production and pollution because much of the coal used in the manufacture of Phurnacite was not really suitable for that purpose.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:-0.00in;margin-right:0.03in">5.6 The overwhelming impression I have gained from the documents is that the major measures to reduce emissions of dust and fume at the Phurnacite Plant were undertaken directly in response to pressure from outside agencies, in particular the Alkali Inspectorate.  In the late 1950s, it was pressure from the Alkali Inspectorate that led to the installation of the ESPs to deal with the dust produced by the dryers and to the plans (albeit apparently not implemented until about a decade later) to install venturi stacks on the batteries.  In the mid-1970s, action by the Alkali Inspectorate resulted in the refurbishment of the ESPs, the introduction and extension of the ‘Spruce’ system of quenching, the installation of a new dust collection system in trommel house 2 and of hydraulically operated pug doors, together with many other anti-pollution measures.  Intervention by the Factory Inspectorate (including the threat of an Improvement Notice) led to the change from solid to liquid pitch in briquetting plant 2 in 1977.  Pressure from the Factory Inspectorate and the issuing of an Improvement Notice also led to the provision in early 1981 of Racal airstream helmets (together with instructions to wear them) for men working on the oven tops.  In the mid-1980s, the issuing by the Factory Inspectorate of an Improvement Notice at last ended the long standing practice of using uncarbonised dust and breeze to seal oven lids.  </p>

I have referred in Section 2 to some of the requirements imposed by the Alkali Inspectorate at that time.  In a letter written to a third party in September 1981, the District Alkali Inspector confirmed that, in his opinion:  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:-0.00in;margin-right:0.03in">5.8 It is clear that, in many instances, NSFL accepted the criticisms made by the Alkali Inspectorate and took steps to remedy them.  As time went on, however, they came to regard some of the demands made by the Alkali Inspectorate as unreasonable.  Mr Foster explained that, provided that a change recommended by the Alkali Inspectorate would not adversely affect production and appeared sensible and economically viable, NSFL would be prepared to implement it.  However, they would not comply with demands made by the Alkali Inspectorate which they regarded as unreasonable, unlikely to be effective and/or likely to be economically damaging; examples of such demands were that NSFL should take a battery out of production or operate it at half capacity.  He said that, by the 1980s, the attitude of the senior management within NSFL had hardened.  Their view was that, as long as the Phurnacite Plant was operating within the legal limit for industrial emissions and was safe from prosecution, they were fulfilling their obligations and need not do more.   </p>

There is also evidence of action being taken to deal with complaints raised by members of the workforce at the Phurnacite Plant.  The Minutes of meetings of the Phurnacite Plant Consultative Committee contain many examples of criticisms about working conditions being raised and being dealt with by changes to working practices and equipment.  The problems at the Phurnacite Plant were discussed regularly at meetings of other NSFL and NCB Committees and were well known to the NCB/NSFL management.  I have no doubt that there were some men employed by the NCB/NSFL over the years – including members of the Phurnacite Plant management staff – who did their best to effect improvements in the working conditions at the Phurnacite Plant.  </p>

This attitude is illustrated by their delay in completing the process of changing from solid to liquid pitch, by their apparent inability to identify a suitable alternative material for the sealing of ovens and to enforce its use, and by their delay in introducing and enforcing the use of RPE.  It is also exemplified by their failure to take appropriate action to respond to the levels of exposure to BSM and BaP revealed by the personal sampling carried out during the periods 1971-1972 and 1975-1983, despite the fact that those levels cannot (or should not) have provided any reassurance that their workers were being properly protected and in many instances were worryingly high.  Levels of exposure to dust frequently exceeded the relevant TLV and most of the sampling results revealed BSM in excess of the ACGIH TLV of 0.2 mgm<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">-3</span>.  </p>

He noted, apparently without comment, that the average dust levels in the briquetting plants were significantly in excess of the recommended level of 10 mgm<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">-3</span>.  He observed that the levels of BSM found were “very erratic” and well in excess (an average of 17 mgm<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">-3 </span>on the oven tops and 15 mgm<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">-3</span> on the shuttle car floor) of the “target figure” of 0.2 mgm<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">-3</span>.  He observed that the target figure was “not very practical” for the Phurnacite Plant since the tests had been devised for coke ovens which did not use pitch.  He did not express any concern that the figures might indicate that workers were being exposed to potentially harmful levels of carcinogenic material or any indication that steps should be taken to protect them.  He merely commented that the target figure “would probably be amended in the future”.  That incident illustrates the attitude of the NCB/ NSFL management at the time.  </p>

The amount of dust and other waste material generated by the Phurnacite manufacturing process was such that sophisticated equipment such as the cyclones and ESPs that removed dust from the dryers had difficulty in coping with it.  The age and design of the Phurnacite Plant, the nature of the materials used in the Phurnacite manufacturing process and the failure to maintain a regular programme of rebuilding ovens all added to the problems.  Having read and heard the evidence about the dust, dirt, heat and fume to which men working at the Plant were exposed and having viewed the photographs, it is clear to me that, despite the various measures that were taken, the working conditions at the Phurnacite Plant remained very poor throughout the period of its operation.   </p>

Dr Rogan’s paper of 1952 referred to the fact that it was “fairly certain” that the fume emitted by coke ovens contained “cancer-producing substances”, including BaP.  He advised that, in view of the risks, exposure to fumes during the charging of ovens “should be reduced to the minimum” when new plant was designed.  He reported that the NCB were carrying out research into “the cancer problem among NCB coke oven workers”.  That research continued for several years thereafter.  </p>

They were plainly aware of the concerns about the possible link between coke oven emissions and various types of cancer and about the research which was being conducted.  That research related to coke plants, where pitch was not used as a binding agent.  It should have been evident to the NCB/NSFL that the use of significant quantities of pitch in the Phurnacite manufacturing process might give rise to an even greater risk of injury than that presented by coke ovens.  Thus, I find that the claimants have succeeded in establishing that, throughout the period between 1947 and 1990, the NCB/NSFL exposed their workers to dust and fume that were “likely to be injurious”.    </p>

I did not understand the defendants to be seriously disputing that fact.

Mr Clothier objected, pointing out, as is the fact, that there is nothing in the pleadings to that intent and that to introduce it now would be to open up a new field of inquiry and evidence.  I agreed with him.  Nor can I see that it would avail the plaintiff. The words “or offensive”, being disjunctive and in contradistinction to “injurious”, suggest that though there might be an injuria it is difficult to see what damnum there could be calling for compensation.  It is, in my opinion, a purely penal provision to ensure reasonable welfare or amenity conditions of working.  Mr Cox did not pursue the argument or his application to amend – rightly in my opinion.” </p>

They therefore accepted that, to use Mr Walker’s words, they were “unable to surmount the high hurdle of showing that it was impracticable” to reduce their workers’ exposure to dust and fume.  That was a realistic concession.  It is quite clear from the description I have given of working conditions at the Phurnacite Plant that far more could have been done to reduce or to eliminate sources of dust and fume and to protect the defendants’ workforce.

I find also that, in exhauster house 1, there would have been times (in particular, during cleaning operations), when the dust would have been of a “substantial quantity” and “likely to be offensive”.  The pungent fumes and volatilised substances produced by steam cleaning would also have been “likely to be offensive” and the latter would have been “likely to be injurious”.  Professor Jones’ ‘background’ levels, estimated by reference to his modelling dispersion exercise, reveal significant levels of BSM in both exhauster houses (twice the ACGIH TLV in exhauster house 1 and five times the ACGIH TLV in exhauster house 2).  As I have already observed, I consider that his estimated exposure levels for exhauster house 1 under-estimate the levels of exposure for men employed in exhauster house 1.   </p>

Professor Jones’ ‘exposure matrices’ suggest an average external exposure level to BSM of more than twice the TLV and to BaP of not much below the level on the quenching car floor/ramps.  There can be no doubt that there was a great deal of dust containing pitch deposited around the Phurnacite Plant and that the dust would have been blown about in the atmosphere and would at times have been offensive to men working in the outside areas.  </p>

I was referred to the decision of Irwin J in <span style="font-style:italic">Anderson</span>.  Mr Anderson worked at a power station for a short period in the late 1940s.  He was employed in the accounts department and was never involved in any of the industrial processes carried on at the power station.  The boilers and much of the pipework at the power station were insulated with asbestos lagging material.  The material was regularly removed and renewed, involving operations such as mixing, stripping, sawing and sweeping asbestos.  Those operations produced large quantities of asbestos dust to which Mr Anderson was exposed as he walked around inside the power station.  Years later, he developed a mesothelioma which it was conceded had been caused by exposure to asbestos at the power station.  It was held that, although it could not be established that Mr Anderson had been close to any specific operation involving asbestos so that he was exposed to significantly higher levels of asbestos than the general atmosphere in the power station, he was entitled to rely on the breaches of section 47 of the 1937 Act that had undoubtedly occurred and had caused asbestos to enter the general atmosphere.   </p>

It seems to me, however, that the position in this litigation is very different to that in <span style="font-style:italic">Anderson</span>.  The exposure with which I am concerned here occurred outside the “workrooms” of the Phurnacite Plant, in the open air.  The purpose of section 47 of the 1937 Act and section 63 of the 1961 Act was to ensure that dust and fume were removed from all workrooms. At least in the early years when the statutory provisions were in force, the only available means of removing dust and fume from inside workrooms would have been to vent the dust and fume to the open air.  This would no doubt have changed over the years as the available extraction equipment became more sophisticated.  However I heard no evidence about that.  I note also that the provisions of the 1946 Regulations, which remained in force until October 1989, specifically provided for the venting of dust containing pitch to the open air.  It seems to me difficult in those circumstances to say that the defendants were in breach of their duties under the 1937 or 1961 Acts and/or the Regulations for doing that.    </p>

It also decided that safety is a relative concept which must be judged according to the general knowledge and standards of the times, by reference to what might reasonably have been foreseen by a reasonable and prudent employer.  It confirmed that the primary burden is on the claimant to prove that his workplace was unsafe.  If he is able to do that, the onus is then on the defendant to prove that he took all reasonably practicable measures to make and keep the workplace safe.  For the purposes of section 5 of the 1959 Act and section 29(1) of the 1961 Act, the test is that of “reasonable practicability”, which involves weighing the nature and potential consequences of a risk against the measures needed to meet it.  </p>

The defendants did not seek to argue otherwise.  Nor did they raise the defence of reasonable practicability.  There were obvious ways for them to avoid such contact.  The earlier introduction of liquid pitch or an effective system of mechanical shovelling of pitch would have eliminated or reduced the exposure of men working in the pitch bay and (if liquid pitch had been introduced earlier) would also have reduced the exposure of men working in those areas of the briquetting plant up to the point in the process when the liquid pitch was added.  The provision of impermeable gloves and overalls would have had the same effect for men working at a later stage of the process.  I am satisfied that, from the time when the Factories Act 1959 came into force until October 1989, when the COSHH Regulations came into operation, the defendants were in breach of section 5 of the 1959 Act and section 29(1) of the 1961 Act.

He attributed the lower levels of exposure at the Avenue Works to better housekeeping and the provision of better seals on the oven lids/doors, together with a different system of charging the ovens (sequential charging) from the system in operation at the Phurnacite Plant.  He said that the Avenue Works still had exposure levels in excess of the ACGIH TLV.  However, those exposure levels “represented the best they could achieve”.

Regulations 6, 8, 10 and 11 imposed absolute duties and it was therefore not open to the defendants to contend that it had not been practicable to eliminate all exposure to dust from those sources.  Moreover, the measures that were taken should have been more effective.  For, example, there should have been more and better designed ESPs, together with more effective extraction in the briquetting plants.  Many of the measures which were eventually taken to improve conditions could have been taken much earlier.  For example, the provision of liquid pitch at an earlier time would have eliminated the need for the pitch men to break up solid pitch and would also have improved conditions for men working in the briquetting buildings.   </p>

The dust from the ESPs was recycled purely as a means for disposing of it. It did not add value to the finished Phurnacite product.  The claimants suggested that it should have been possible to dispose of the dust in some other way, thus avoiding the many problems involved with storing, collecting and transporting the dust and re-introducing it into the Phurnacite manufacturing process.  As for the remainder of the dust and breeze, measures should have been taken to devise a proper system for recycling them without the escape of dust.  A system should have been devised for disposing of the large quantities of dust produced at various points on the raw ovoid conveyors. </p>

Better maintenance of the ovens (including doors and lids) and a properly scheduled programme of rebuilding of the ovens would have reduced leakages of fume and gas.  The elimination of the practices of overfilling ovens and of using uncarbonised material to seal oven lids would have reduced emissions.  Increased carbonising times would have had the same effect.  Better maintenance of the elephants and the gas off-takes would have prevented leaks from those sources.  The building of more quenching towers and/or the use on all the batteries of a system such as the ‘Spruce’ system would have reduced the amount of dust and grit given off during quenching.  </p>

He said that, otherwise, there was no general use of respirators at patent fuel plants, nor was there intended to be any such use, since dust sampling had indicated that working conditions at such plants were “not dangerous” (by which he meant that there was no risk of pneumoconiosis).  Dr Rogan<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="173">

There is no evidence that a different type of RPE was in fact provided for workers at the Phurnacite Plant until some considerable time later.  Indeed, Martindale masks appear to have been in more general use at the Phurnacite Plant from the mid-late 1960s.  They continued to be supplied for the use of men working at the Phurnacite Plant until production of Phurnacite ceased in 1990.

(It seems likely that he was referring to the ‘Baxter Pneu-seal’ respirators, which became available in 1974.) Mr Foster said that, when the respirators were introduced, it was left to the individual worker to decide whether to wear any RPE and, if so, whether to wear a filter mask or a Martindale or paper mask.  It is clear that the filter masks were not widely used.  It seems that many workers found the Martindale masks comfortable and easy to use and would choose to wear them in preference to a filter mask.  The evidence of most of the witnesses was that, before 1980/1981, they had never worn any RPE except for a Martindale or paper mask.  Many men employed in areas where exposure to dust and fume was highest (e.g. the oven tops) did not wear any RPE at all.  </p>

	      </authorialNote>, a meeting of the CPL management considered the various types of RPE that were on the market.  The Factory Inspectorate were advocating one of two types of powered respirator that were currently available, i.e. the Martindale powered respirator or a similar model made by Siebe Gorman.  It was believed that both types of respirator would probably offer 100% protection if properly maintained.  However, there were concerns on the part of the CPL management that the powered respirators would be unsuitable for use on the oven tops.  It was decided that nonpowered ‘half mask’ respirators were “more likely to be acceptable” to the men who would have to wear them.  It was recognised that the half mask respirators would provide less protection than powered respirators and that they could not be worn for long periods (probably no more than an hour at a time at most).  Nevertheless, a decision was taken to introduce half mask respirators at one plant in the first instance as a “pilot scheme”.  It is clear from the documentary evidence dating from early 1973<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="182">

	      </authorialNote> that the NCB/NSFL management were strongly opposed to the introduction of powered respirators.  Meanwhile, mention was made at the meeting of a prototype ‘airstream’ helmet which was currently being developed by a company named SMRE.  The airstream helmet was fitted with a face visor, which would supply filtered air to the wearer’s breathing zone.  It was suggested that the NCB Coal Products Division Board might wish to support the development of this type of helmet for use at their carbonisation plants. </p>

The ‘Baxter Pneu-seal’ and ‘Martindale Y’ respirators were on the NCB’s list of ‘approved’ respirators.  It was intended that all unapproved masks should be withdrawn from the stores when the new respirators were provided although it is clear that, at least at the Phurnacite Plant, this was never done.

The idea was that members of the consultative councils would pass the information down to each plant’s Consultative Committee and that in that way the information would be transmitted to individual workers.  At a meeting of members of the medical staff of the NCB Medical Service in November 1974, Dr Archibald, assistant chief medical officer for the NCB Coal Products Division, expressed concern at the continued reluctance of the NCB to divulge to its workforce “all the information available on the dangers associated with coke oven top work”.  He was obviously concerned that he should not be compromised by any misleading or incomplete information that might be presented in the course of the ‘presentations’, at which he had been invited to be present.  At the same meeting, he expressed the view that the NCB had afforded the issue of RPE “a low priority” as a result of which implementation of the decision to provide respirators had been slow.  </p>

In February 1976, the NCB’s Joint Working Party on the Environment at the Carbonisation Works was told that the NCB were having discussions with Racal Amplivox (who had taken over from SMRE development of the airstream helmet) about the requirements of men working on coke and Phurnacite ovens.  Representatives from Racal Amplivox (Racal) had already visited a BSC coke oven to observe the working conditions there.

Trials at three plants (which did not include the Phurnacite Plant) had included the personal sampling of exposure levels of men wearing the helmets.  The results were promising in that they showed that an exposure level to BSM of less than the TLV of 0.2 mgm<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">-3</span> was achievable if the visor was positioned over the worker’s face (i.e. in the ‘down position) for 75% of the shift.

There were a number of complaints about the helmets, including the fact that the visors tended to become covered with dust and to suffer abrasion damage when attempts were made to rub off the dust.  At that time, it was decided to ask the manufacturers to attempt to resolve the problems with the helmet; meanwhile, it was considered premature to make a decision to introduce the Racal airstream helmets into operational use.

Mr Launder, divisional chief scientist of NCB Coal Products Division, commented on the high cost of purchasing, maintaining and replacing the helmets.

That trial went well.  Personal sampling of exposure levels showed that wearing a helmet resulted in considerable reductions in exposure to dust, BSM and BaP and the workers appeared ready to accept them.  Ten of the 50 Racal airstream helmets were sent to the Phurnacite Plant in June 1977 for testing.

Nevertheless, it was recognised that NSFL would come under considerable pressure from the Factory Inspectorate if steps were not taken to introduce the helmets.  In Wales, NSFL was said to be “under intolerable pressure” to supply the helmets to their workers.  There were undoubtedly “tremendous advantages” to be gained from wearing the helmets and it was natural that men who benefited from wearing helmets wanted to have a helmet personally allocated for their use.

In the 1950s, there were NCB–approved respirators which, although not as effective as the models that were subsequently developed, would nevertheless have afforded significant protection against dust and fume.  Such respirators could have been worn without undue discomfort in the briquetting buildings and other parts of the Phurnacite Plant and their use should have been enforced.  Even if they had been uncomfortable to wear throughout a shift on the oven tops, they could have been worn at times of maximum exposure, e.g. when poking or charging the ovens.  Until production at the Phurnacite Plant ceased in 1990, the defendants continued to provide workers at the Phurnacite Plant with the gauze Martindale masks which, as Dr Rogan had pointed out more than 20 years earlier, were ineffective in protecting the wearer against anything but nuisance dust.   </p>

This is despite the fact that they must have realised that the need for adequate respiratory protection was urgent, especially since they were having little or no success in reducing the level of dust and fume emissions from the batteries and other parts of the Phurnacite Plant and the problem of the clustering of ovoids (and the consequent need for poking) was increasing.  </p>

I accept that the Racal airstream helmet as first designed required some modification and that there were inevitably ‘teething problems’ when it was first introduced.  However, those considerations should not have prevented its earlier introduction and, in the meantime, interim measures should have been taken to ensure that their workers had at least some protection.

At some time, probably in the 1960s, the NCB began to supply sets of blue overalls to be worn when working.  In the mid1970s, these were replaced by orange overalls, together with sets of underwear, and arrangements were made by NSFL for them to be laundered weekly.  The men usually had three sets of overalls, with one being worn, one spare and one at the laundry.  The overalls were eventually laundered through the Plant on a weekly basis.  It is clear from the evidence that the claimants’ work clothes, and later their overalls, became contaminated with pitch, coal, dust and other substances which sometimes soaked through to the skin beneath. </p>

The defendants did not adduce any evidence about the levels of exposure to which workers at the Phurnacite Plant would inevitably have been exposed, whatever protective measures had been put in place.  They relied solely on the evidence of Mr Stear about conditions at the Avenue Works, to which I have already referred.  That evidence was an extremely flimsy basis on which to found an argument that there was an irreducible minimum exposure at all, let alone an irreducible minimum exposure of 25% or 33%.  I have no detailed information about conditions at the Avenue Works or about the measures that had been taken to reduce or prevent emissions of dust and fume there.  However, the Avenue Works were under the same ownership as the Phurnacite Plant and, having regard to my findings about the poor working conditions at the Phurnacite Plant, I consider it highly unlikely that the conditions at the Avenue Works were exemplary.  I do not consider that the sampling results from the Avenue Works afford any guide to what might have been an irreducible minimum of dust and fume at the Phurnacite Plant.

I bear in mind that, in cases such as <span style="font-style:italic">Allen</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Thompson</span>, judges have been encouraged to make the best estimate they can of the non-tortious element of exposure, using a ‘broad brush’ approach.

In the circumstances, I do not consider it appropriate to make a finding that there was a minimum exposure level of exposure at the Phurnacite Plant that was unavoidable.   <br/></p>

If the evidence demonstrates that ‘but for’ the contribution of the tortious cause the injury would probably not have occurred the claimant will (obviously) have discharged the burden.

That case involved claims by ten lead claimants from a group of over 1,000 claimants (mainly former servicemen) who alleged that they had suffered various types of cancer as a result of exposure to ionising radiation in the course of a series of atmospheric tests of thermonuclear devices in the Pacific Ocean region in the 1950s.

Until 2006, the prescription criteria provided that an award of industrial injuries disablement benefit for asbestos-related lung cancer was dependent on the presence of asbestosis or diffuse pleural thickening, as well as lung cancer.  During the 1980s, there were a number of common law claims for asbestos-related lung cancer in which an issue arose as to whether, in a case where the claimant had been exposed to asbestos but had not developed asbestosis or diffuse pleural thickening, his lung cancer had been caused by asbestos exposure.  All the claims save one failed because the claimant had not been able to show evidence of asbestosis or diffuse pleural thickening.  </p>

Cigarette smoking is, of course, a common cause of lung cancer.  The epidemiological evidence was that asbestos and cigarette smoke have a multiplicative effect on risk, such that, when both factors are present, the risk of contracting lung cancer is 50 times greater than the risk that would be present in a non-smoker who is not exposed to asbestos.   </p>

This principle applies only where the disease or condition is ‘divisible’ so that an increased dose of the harmful agent worsens the disease.  As is well known, in <span style="font-style:italic">Bonnington</span>, the claim succeeded because the tortious exposure to silica dust had materially aggravated (to an unknown degree) the pneumoconiosis which the claimant might well have developed in any event as the result of non-tortious exposure to the same type of dust.  The tort did not increase the risk of harm; it increased the actual harm.  Similarly in <span style="font-style:italic">Bailey</span>, the tort (a failure of medical care) increased the claimant’s physical weakness.  She would have been quite weak in any event as the result of a condition she had developed naturally.  No one could say how great a contribution each had made to the overall weakness save that each was material.  It was the overall weakness which led to the claimant’s failure to protect her airway when she vomited with the result that she inhaled her vomit and suffered a cardiac arrest and brain damage.  In those cases, the pneumoconiosis and the weakness were divisible conditions.  Cancer is an indivisible condition; one either gets it or one does not.

Lord Phillips observed (at paragraph 83) that a relative risk of just over two (i.e. just ‘doubling of risk’) is a “tenuous basis” for concluding that the statistically probable cause of a disease is also the probable biological cause.  The balance of probabilities would be a very fine one and the epidemiological data may not be reliable.  However, there may be other features of the case, such as characteristics of the claimant, which will also be a factor in causation.  Lord Rodger expressed similar reservations.  However, he emphasised that he did not intend to discourage the use of epidemiological evidence or to depreciate its value in cases where a claimant has to prove his case on the balance of probabilities.  He said at paragraph 163:  </p>

It is true that the type of injury suffered by the claimant in <span style="font-style:italic">Bonnington</span> was in fact divisible.  However, it was not treated as such by the parties or the court; they approached the injury as though it was an indivisible injury.  Similarly, the Court of Appeal in the <span style="font-style:italic">Atomic Veterans </span>case regarded the ‘injury’ in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Bailey</span> as having been the claimant’s weakened state which had led to her cardiac arrest and brain damage.  They regarded that injury as divisible.  Yet, it seems to me that the ‘injury’ in <span style="font-style:italic">Bailey</span> was in reality the claimant’s brain damage, which was indivisible. The defendant’s negligence had made an unquantifiable contribution to the weakness that had led to the development of that brain damage.

Each cell contains genetic information in the form of DNA.  In order to proliferate and form tumours, cells must first undergo a number of changes to their physiology.  Dr Rudd identified those changes as self sufficiency in growth signals; insensitivity to signals which inhibit growth, evasion of programmed cell death; limitless potential to replicate; ability to stimulate angiogenesis (i.e. new blood vessel formation) and ability to invade tissues and metastasise to distant parts of the body.  </p>

Mutations arise spontaneously all the time in the course of the normal cell division which is necessary to maintain the integrity of the tissues of the body.  They can be caused by random errors in DNA replication during cell division and also as a result of naturally occurring environmental agents such as ultraviolet radiation (UVR) in sunlight and ionising radiation.  They can also be caused by endogenous genotoxins, i.e. chemicals produced by the body which are capable of causing mutations.  The frequency of random mutations increases with age.  Some mutations render the cell incapable of multiplying and cause it to die without passing on the mutation.  Mutations which survive are usually dealt with by the natural mechanism of DNA repair which can act to repair the damage to the cell or to eliminate the damaged cell.  If that repair mechanism fails and the affected cell goes on to replicate in the usual way, it will pass the mutation on to its ‘progeny’ which will in turn pass it on to the next generation of cells.   </p>

It is believed that cancers arise by means of a process consisting of between four and seven independent ‘events’.  Each ‘event’ involves one or more mutations which result in changes to the cell such as activation of oncogenes or the de-activation of tumour suppressor genes which are involved in cell cycle control, cell signalling and </p>

Mutations cause damage to many cells over the years but cells which do not acquire the ‘full house’ of changes necessary to cause cancer do not cause the body any serious harm.  Eventually, however, a single cell may acquire the ‘full house’ and is transformed into a malignant cell which has the potential to proliferate and cause a tumour.  However, even then, the development of a tumour is by no means inevitable.  Most malignant cells (and their progeny) are eliminated by the body’s natural defence mechanisms.  Some malignant cells become dormant.  In order to enable a tumour to form, a malignant cell will have to acquire the ability to initiate angiogenesis, producing blood vessels to supply the tumour with essential nutrients.  Not all malignant cells acquire the ability to do this.  It is only when the tumour has grown large enough for angiogenesis to become established that the eventual emergence of a clinically evident tumour becomes inevitable.   </p>

There are many other chemical agents which can act indirectly (e.g. by interfering with DNA repair mechanisms), thereby increasing the frequency of survival of cells which have undergone mutations naturally or as a result of the action of other carcinogens.  Agents which contribute to carcinogenesis, but are not capable of producing the genetic changes necessary to cause cancer when acting alone, are referred to as ‘promoters’.

Those risks will not of course be identical to the risks associated with exposure to emissions at the Phurnacite Plant.  However, they are the closest match available.  The experts agreed that the epidemiological studies from the USA (in particular the studies by Lloyd <span style="font-style:italic">et al </span>and Redmond <span style="font-style:italic">et al)</span> showed clear evidence of an increase in the risk of lung cancer amongst coke oven plant workers.  They also agreed that there was a dose response relationship for exposure by inhalation to either BSM or BaP.  As I have explained previously, BaP and BSM are not the only carcinogenic agents contained in dust and fume produced at coke plants or at the Phurnacite Plant.  They are used as indicators of the presence of carcinogenic materials.  The fact that various epidemiological studies have measured the amount of exposure to BaP or BSM and have revealed evidence of a relationship between one or both of those substances and the risk of lung cancer does not imply that the risk is all attributable to BaP or BSM.  Other carcinogenic substances may also have had an effect.  Similarly, tobacco smoke contains many carcinogenic materials.  Although TSNs and PAHs are considered to be the most significant of those materials, the possibility exists that other carcinogenic substances contained in tobacco smoke could play a part in the development of lung cancer.   </p>

By contrast, however, the use of pitch at the Phurnacite Plant meant that workers in parts of the Plant other than the oven tops will have been exposed to dust and fume containing PAHs.

The most obvious such risk would be smoking.  Smoking is the major cause of lung cancer in the industrialised world.  The authors of the meta-analysis considered that the fact that most of the studies they reviewed were not controlled for smoking was unlikely to cause major bias since previous studies had shown that, when comparing one group of manual workers with another, smoking rates as between those who had and had not been exposed to the substance giving rise to the risk were unlikely to differ much.  The effect of this is that, if an individual has had exposure to BaP in excess of the agreed figure of 270 μgm<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">3</span>, it would imply that, on the balance of probabilities, a lung cancer would not have occurred without the BaP exposure, regardless of past smoking history. </p>

This can happen in a variety of ways.  It may cause the DNA within a cell to be damaged by mutation.  The damaged cell may then go on to produce one or more generations of damaged cells.  It may contribute to the production of a secondary carcinogen which will go on to cause damage to a cell.  The carcinogen may cause the ultimate change which converts a non-malignant tumour into a malignant tumour.  It may interfere with the body’s repair mechanisms.

If a heavy smoker dies of lung cancer with no other known risk factors, his death will be attributed to smoking.  It may be that, in fact, his lung cancer was caused by inhaling general pollution or by some other carcinogen to which, unknown to his medical advisers, he had been exposed.

Some might have been caused by a secondary carcinogen to which the primary carcinogens had contributed.  Some may have been caused by factors unrelated to the carcinogens.  He accepted that, even when an individual had been exposed to carcinogens, it was “theoretically possible” that none of the mutations which had produced an individual malignant cell had been caused by those carcinogens.

This approach was, he said, appropriate even where different carcinogens were involved.  He said that where, as with the claimants in this litigation, the major carcinogen from both smoking and occupational exposure is the same (i.e. PAHs), it is even more plausible that both exposures should have contributed to the process. </p>

It is, he said, possible for a cancer to develop without any apparent ‘cause’, in the sense of an external agent.  Even if a carcinogen had been involved in the process of tumour formation, its involvement may have been at a very early stage and may have had only a small effect on the risk of a tumour developing.

He conceded that the effect could not be quantified.  However, susceptibility was, he said, a factor that should be taken into consideration.  He said that it tended to support his view that an estimated risk factor of less than double the risk might reasonably be regarded as sufficient to establish causation.  If the individual who has developed a cancer can be assumed to be of more than average susceptibility, a smaller amount of the occupational carcinogen (i.e. an amount which would ordinarily give rise to a risk factor of less than double) will have been required to cause the cancer in that individual, when compared with the average individual.    </p>

The contribution may have taken a number of different forms during the period (often many years) for which the multi-stage process was in operation.  Mr Allan pointed out that the agreed medical evidence is that the effect of the two carcinogens is likely to have been multiplicative, or nearly multiplicative.  There is also dermal exposure to take into account. </p>

For any particular individual, the cancer may have arisen as a result of the action of an occupational carcinogen in some combination with that of environmental exogenous agents and/or endogenous factors, or through the action of environmental and endogenous factors alone.

Having regard to the evidence about the mechanism of the carcinogenic process, I question whether the term “cumulative” can really be applied to the part played by the claimants’ occupational exposure to carcinogens when taken in conjunction with their exposure to the carcinogens contained in cigarette smoke and with the other factors that might have played a part in the development of their cancers.  In respect of a cancer suffered by any individual claimant, the occupational carcinogen might or might not have contributed and, if it did contribute, it might have played a very minor or an extremely major role. Moreover, other factors – smoking-related, environmental and endogenous – might have been the sole cause of the cancer, might have played no part in its development or might have played a more minor or a more major role than the individual’s occupational exposure to carcinogens.  To describe the action of an individual claimant’s occupational exposure to carcinogens as one of a number of “cumulative causes” of his cancer does not seem to me accurately to represent its role.

It is true that the claimants would have been exposed to PAHs from both sources.  However, cigarette smoke contains many other carcinogens, including TSNs which, according to Dr Flaks, are probably the most potent carcinogens contained in cigarette smoke. (I note that, in <span style="font-style:italic">Novartis</span>, it was alleged that the claimant had been exposed to aromatic amines in the course of his work and that his occupational exposure, together with the amines (TSNs) to which he had been exposed as a result of his smoking, had caused his bladder cancer.).  The dust and fume to which the claimants were exposed at the Phurnacite Plant will also have contained other carcinogens in addition to PAHs.  Therefore, it seems to me that it would be unwise to place significant reliance on the fact that some of the carcinogens were common to both the claimants’ occupational exposure and their smoking.  As Professor Jones pointed out, the fact that their combined effects on risk are multiplicative or nearly so, strongly suggests that different carcinogens were at work.  If the carcinogens from both sources had been identical, one would have expected their effects on risk to have been additive, rather than multiplicative.    </p>

For example, I would have to decide whether it was reasonable to find that, where there had been occupational exposure to carcinogens which gave rise to, say, a 15% increase in the risk of developing lung cancer, the occupational carcinogens had made a ‘material contribution’ to the claimant’s cancer.

It would mean that, in any case of cancer where a claimant could establish tortious exposure to a carcinogen that was ‘material’ (according to whatever measure of materiality the court chose to adopt) the claimant would succeed in establishing causation and would be entitled to 100% damages.  Whilst I have some sympathy with the predicament of claimants who may have difficulty in establishing a link between occupational exposure to carcinogens and the development of their cancers, I cannot accept that such a result would be fair to potential defendants who would be required to pay full damages in many cases in which occupational exposure had played a small part or, perhaps, no part at all.   </p>

However, Mr Bishop declined to express a view on causation, on the ground that it (and, in particular, the relevant epidemiology) was outwith his expertise as a consultant urological surgeon.

They will probably have a general knowledge about new developments and types of treatments gleaned from the medical media, without having examined the original published material.  Their knowledge may be sufficient for their own day-to-day professional practice but plainly would not equip them to give expert evidence on a topic (such as causation) that required a good understanding of the relevant epidemiology.

Clinicians in this category will often have the expertise necessary to give evidence based on the relevant epidemiological evidence.

I gained the impression that he had not read the relevant papers with any degree of care (if at all) until a late stage in these proceedings, probably just before the Joint Meeting with Professor Jones.  I have no doubt that his knowledge of the literature is sufficient to enable him properly to advise his patients on the types of treatment available to them, the likely outcomes and matters of that kind.  However, issues such as whether or not bladder cancer can be caused by exposure to the type of substances present in the dust and fume emitted at the Phurnacite Plant or whether a man who gave up smoking years before still has an increased risk of bladder cancer are more complex and less relevant in day-to-day practice.  I was not confident that Mr Pettersson had a sufficiently good knowledge of the relevant literature to be able to express an authoritative opinion on its various strengths and weaknesses.

The numbers of deaths were small and the results were not statistically significant.

The measure conventionally used is a 95% ‘confidence interval’, i.e. a range of values within which there is a 95% probability that the result has not occurred by chance.  However, even when a result does not reach that high level of probability, the possibility that it occurred by chance may be small.

A steel shell lined with carbon constitutes the negative electrode or cathode.  The positive electrode or anode is a mixture of coke and either petroleum pitch or coal tar pitch, which is suspended over the electrolytic bath.  In the Söderberg process of aluminium smelting, the coke and pitch mixture is fed as a paste into the anode compartment.  In the electrolytic bath, the alumina is dissolved in molten cryolite which reduces its melting point so as to enable the electrolytic cell to be operated effectively at temperatures around 950°C (a similar temperature to that used for the carbonisation of Phurnacite).  During the electrolysis process, the alumina is reduced to molten aluminium and deposited at the cathode where it is siphoned off.

As Professor Jones observed, this is a very high relative risk and, if it were carried through to the coke production industry, one would have expected to see some increased mortality from bladder cancer in the coke production studies.

The individuals had all worked at the relevant plants for more than a year during a 30-year period starting in January 1950.  The study identified an increased risk of bladder cancer, especially amongst men who had worked on the Söderberg process.  A strong association between the risk of developing bladder cancer and cumulative exposure to CTPVs (measured as BSM or BaP) was observed.  The authors found that BaP cumulative exposure was a better indicator of risk than BSM cumulative exposure.  However, they made clear that it should not necessarily be assumed that either BaP or PAHs in general were the causal agent.  They suggested that it was possible that the operative substances might be aromatic amines such as 2-naphthylamine, which are known to cause bladder cancer in humans and which are emitted during the Söderberg process.

He accepted that, if coal tar (rather than petroleum) pitch was used in the Söderberg process, pitch would have been a common factor.

During the Phurnacite carbonisation process, the only materials present were coal and pitch, heated largely in the absence of air.  In the Söderberg process, molten cryolite, alumina and aluminium were also present and the oxidation and reduction reactions were significantly more complex than the Phurnacite carbonisation process.  In addition, the Söderberg process involves the gradual heating of the anode paste which sinks to the bottom of the anode compartment, emitting volatiles as it gains heat.  More paste is then poured in and heats up quickly, giving rise to further emissions.  Professor Jones suggested that this was very different from the process at the Phurnacite Plant, where the ovoids were carbonised in a sealed oven, and emissions occurred only at the point when the oven was opened, by which time most of the CTPVs would have been burned off.  </p>

An excess risk for lung cancer was observed amongst men who had had heavy exposure to dust and fume in carbonising plants.  There was a small increased risk from bladder cancer although it did not quite reach statistical significance.  The 1972 study added a further four years’ data to the previous study.  The new data provided confirmation that exposure to the products of coal carbonisation could give rise to lung cancer and, according to the authors, “left little doubt” that the risk of bladder cancer was also increased.  The authors noted that the fumes emitted during coal carbonisation at gas works contained significant quantities of the known carcinogens, 2-naphthylamine and 1naphthylamine, which would have been inhaled by the men working there and absorbed as a result of contact between tar and their skin.  They suggested that individuals who developed bladder cancer were likely to have had “unusually heavy exposure”.

A similar link has also been demonstrated between the coke production industry and lung cancer.  The similarities between the processes carried out in those industries and the carbonisation of Phurnacite make it probable that exposure to dust and fume containing PAHs produced by Phurnacite carbonisation (which are known to give rise to an excess risk of causing lung cancer) are also capable of causing bladder cancer.

They argued that there were so many differences between the Söderberg process and the Phurnacite carbonisation process that it was impossible to conclude on a balance of probabilities that, because the Söderberg process gave rise to an excess incidence of bladder cancer, this would also be the case for the Phurnacite carbonisation process.   </p>

Mr Pettersson did not give evidence about this issue.

A claimant such as Mr Jenkins, who spent only about 17 months working on the batteries (and only part of that time on the oven tops) would not come into that category.  Mr Jenkins spent most of his time at the Phurnacite Plant working in the by-products plant.  Mr Richards is in a different position.  He worked in the by-products plant for about 8½ years.

They also agreed that, upon cessation of smoking, the risk decreases.  What was not agreed, however, was whether, many years after an individual has ceased smoking, he remains at an increased risk of bladder cancer as a result of his past smoking history.  This is significant in the cases of Mr Jenkins and Mr Richards, since both men gave up smoking a long time before their first bladder cancer developed.  I have found that Mr Jenkins gave up smoking about 36 years before his first tumour appeared, having smoked for 20 years, and that Mr Richards gave up about 38 years before his first episode of bladder cancer, having smoked for 16 years. </p>

They also agreed that, after 15-20 years of non-smoking, the increased risk due to smoking had reduced to such an extent that it was negligible.  However, they were both “inclined to the view” that the relationship between tobacco smoke and industrial carcinogens was likely to be complex and that, as a result, the “normal” reduction in cancer risk after ceasing to smoke might be disturbed.  Thus, where there had been occupational exposure to a carcinogen, a previous history of smoking might still have played a part in the development of a bladder cancer which appeared as many as 15 years or more after cessation of smoking and/or  exposure to the carcinogenic substance. </p>

However, the combined number of bladder cases was large, enabling the authors to separate out the effects of the number of cigarettes smoked and the duration of smoking of both current and ex-smokers.  He considered that the Brennan paper was the most informative study available dealing with the effects of smoking cessation on the risk of bladder cancer.  Professor Jones explained the apparent anomalies in <span style="font-style:italic">Table VI</span> as the effects of chance.  He pointed out that the wide confidence intervals used in <span style="font-style:italic">Table VI </span>were an indication that a high degree of statistical fluctuation in the results was to be expected.  He considered that, taken overall, the results showed that the risk of bladder cancer reduced significantly from about four years after stopping smoking, after which it began to decline more gradually as the number of years’ cessation of smoking increased.  He considered that the rate of decline towards the end of the 25-year period covered by the study suggested that the increased risk caused by smoking would never disappear entirely.  </p>

Taken at face value, they suggest that a man (such as Mr Richards) who had smoked for 16 years, would have a relative risk factor of 1.68 compared with a lifelong non-smoker if he had given up smoking 25 years previously.  Presumably his relative risk factor would have reduced somewhat by the time he had given up for 38 years.

Dr August is a consultant dermatologist.  As he made clear, his focus is on the treatment of his patients, not on understanding how their skin conditions came about.  I have no doubt that he is very skilled in the diagnosis and treatment of skin cancer.  However, he is not – and does not claim to be – an expert in the field of epidemiology and this inevitably affected his ability to speak authoritatively about issues of causation. </p>

Over the past few years, with the increasing tendency to specialisation and the decline in the use of radiotherapy, the proportion of his time spent treating skin cancer has reduced to about 5%.

In the UK, BCCs are about three or four times more common than SCCs.  There is some evidence that the gap between BCCs and SCCs is narrowing and that the number of BCCs and SCCs may almost reach parity in countries with high levels of sun exposure.   </p>

The overall risk of metastasis from SCC is, however, relatively low and survival rates from SCC are high.  By contrast, BCC spreads only very locally and is rarely if ever fatal.  It can however, be disfiguring if not diagnosed and treated appropriately.  Both SCC and BCC are found more frequently in men than women and the incidence of both types of cancer increases with age.    </p>

Dr Flaks suggested that the distinction was largely an artificial one, based on histopathological appearances rather than on the genesis of the tumour.  Dr Falk did not agree.  His evidence was that BCC and SCC are generally believed to be clinically distinct tumours.  They have different appearances and behave in a different way, particularly in relation to growth and spread.  He accepted that, even when histology is carried out, there can be difficulty in distinguishing between the two types of tumour.  However, more subtle changes within the cells, detectible only by electron microscopy studies and immunohistochemical techniques which are now available, show that the tumours are quite distinct.   </p>

UVR is a known mutagen which is capable of inducing DNA damage that can lead to a subsequent cancer.  It is also known to alter the skin’s immune response, rendering the skin more susceptible to tumour formation.  It seems likely that UVR is both an initiator and promoter of carcinogenesis.  The incidence of both BCC and SCC rises with exposure to sunlight.  However, whereas the increased risk of BCC appears to reach a plateau after a certain level of exposure to sunlight, there is a proportionately greater effect of increasing solar exposure on SCC risk.  Incidents of sunburn give rise to a disproportionate risk of BCC.  </p>

Type II individuals have light brown hair and pinkish skin which has the ability to develop some tan and is vulnerable to intense sunlight.  Type III individuals have darker hair and skin and are less prone to sunburn, with correspondingly less vulnerability to UVR.

Until the last two decades, histological examination of skin lesions was not routinely practised in all parts of the UK and many lesions were removed without a firm diagnosis of either SCC or BCC being made.  Even when histological examination was undertaken, it was not always possible to distinguish between BCC and SCC without more sophisticated techniques, which were not available until recently.  </p>

In 2002, however, the IIAC advised the Secretary of State that the prescription should be revised so as to identify the relevant prescribed disease as “primary carcinoma of the skin”, i.e. to include BCC, as well as SCC.

Historically, cases of BCC have not been well documented, partly because of the difficulty of distinguishing between SCC and BCC.  Other factors may also have played a part.  England has a system whereby new cases of cancer are recorded at one of a number of cancer registries situated in different areas of the country.  The information collected by the registries is used for compiling statistics and for other purposes related to public health.  GPs pass information about diagnosed cases of cancer to local authorities who supply the information for their area to the appropriate registry.

In 2010, the South Wales Public Health Observatory published a study of the reporting of NMSC over the threeyear period 2004-2006.  The authors compared the recorded age-standardised incidence rates of NMSC according to the information held by the various local authorities.  No distinction was made between SCC and BCC.  The range was extremely wide – from five cases to 260 cases per 100,000 people.  The authors identified those local authorities with rates of up to 50 cases per 100,000 people.  They considered that there was obvious under-reporting of NMSC in the areas covered by those authorities, which were situated mainly in the Thames Valley and the South East.  </p>

Data from the West Midlands and South West areas, which were judged to have the best quality data about NMSC, were used to establish the ratio.  In the South West, 36 of the 45 local authorities had a ratio of seven cases of NMSC to ten cases of malignant melanoma.  Similar results were obtained in the West Midlands.  That ratio was used to calculate the ‘true’ number of new NMSC cases in those areas which had been identified as under-reporting.  This exercise suggested that 9,043-14,625 (i.e. 20%-25%) cases of NMSC per annum had gone unrecorded in those areas.  A comparison of the rates of BCC and SCC for the West Midlands and South West suggested a ratio of between three and five cases of BCC to one case of SCC.  This in turn suggested that, of those cases that had gone unreported, 6,782-12,139 were BCC cases and 2,260-3,656 were cases of SCC.  </p>

It may be that, in some areas, GPs were failing to diagnose cases of skin cancer.  It may be that they were diagnosing cases but failing to report them.

After that adjustment, the 1998 incidence figure was 129.9 individuals per 100,000 population per annum for men and women together with NMSC.

In the decade from 1988 to 1998, there was an increase in public awareness of the dangers of sun exposure and of the prevalence of skin cancer which might well have led to a greater degree of reporting.

Dr August took up the reference in his individual Reports in the cases of Mr Middle and Mr David Jones (he did not produce a Generic Report) and reproduced the brief details of the 1998 study given by Dr Flaks.  I do not get the impression that Dr August had read the 1998 study at that time (and he seemed unaware that it had been updated) although, by the time he gave oral evidence, he agreed that it was “the only decent plank” for his proposition that pitch and tar were capable of causing BCC.  In his Generic Report, Dr Falk referred to the updated study and discussed its contents in some detail, raising a number of the points that he subsequently made in his oral evidence.   </p>

The subjects had all, over a period of 50 years between 1946 and 1996, been diagnosed as suffering from tar-induced dermatosis. Germany has a scheme for recognising and compensating for occupationally-related diseases similar to that in the UK.  Malignant skin tumours (including both SCC and BCC) and their preliminary stages (including tar-induced dermatosis) have for a long time been prescribed diseases for the purposes of the German system.  The 1998 study was intended, <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>, to explore what kind of tarinduced skin tumours had been diagnosed in the subjects, which regions of the body were mainly affected by the tumours and how long the latent period was from exposure to the development of the tumours.  It is to be noted that the authors of the Letzel and Drexler study were not seeking to discover whether or not BCC was an occupationally-related condition.  They accepted without question that it was. </p>

It must be noted that those were the numbers of actual lesions observed, not the number of subjects with skin lesions.  151 of the subjects developed one or more SCCs and 98 subjects developed one or more BCCs.  Some subjects had both BCCs and SCCs.  In all, 207 (34.2%) out of the 606 subjects developed at least one SCC or one BCC.  The ratio of SCCs to BCCs was 1.7 SCCs to one BCC, i.e. different from the usual pattern of more BCCs than SCCs.  </p>

The number of SCCs per patient was between 0 and 41 and the number of BCCs per patient was between 0 and 20.  The ratio of SCCs to BCCs was 1.32 SCCs to one BCC.  The authors of the 1998 study had observed that the ratio of BCCs to SCCs in Germany was then known to be about ten to one.

SCCs were, however, found in some unusual sites.  They were observed more frequently than usual on the upper lip and the forearms.  Twenty SCCs were found on the scrotum; no BCCs were observed at that site.   </p>

The location of BCCs was similar to that of the general population, i.e. on areas of skin exposed to the sun.  However, there was a slight difference.  The authors reported that, in the general population, BCCs are rarely found on the outer surface of the auricle of the ear whereas, in the updated study, 7% of BCCs amongst the subjects were found in that position.   </p>

Most of the NMSCs observed had been subjected to histological examination, presumably for the purpose of claiming compensation under the Government scheme.  Thus, the accuracy of the diagnosis of the type of NMSC is likely to have been reasonably reliable in most cases.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:-0.00in;margin-right:0.03in">10.42 The Letzel and Drexler study did, however, have two obvious defects, which were acknowledged by its authors.  First, the study involved early intervention which may have affected the results.  The subjects’ skin was inspected regularly for lesions.  As a result, any lesions that formed were removed very early.  This could potentially have resulted in the identification of more lesions than would have been found in a normal population where observation would depend on individual patients seeking medical advice.  The fact that pre-cancerous lesions were excised promptly will have prevented some NMSC from progressing as they might have been permitted to do in other circumstances.  This would have had the effect of reducing the number of SCCs which developed, but not the number of BCCs, since the latter do not have a precancerous phase.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0.00in;margin-right:0.03in">10.43 The second obvious defect in the Letzel and Drexler study was that, because the authors were unable to identify a suitable control group, no comparison could be made between the incidence of the different types of skin tumour amongst the cohort of subjects with the incidence amongst members of the local population who had not been exposed to tar but otherwise possessed similar characteristics.  In addition, the total number of workers at the tar refinery was not known.  The authors of the updated study accepted that these factors meant that the information in the study could not be used as a basis for reaching conclusions about the incidence of SCC or BCC.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:-0.00in;margin-right:0.03in">10.44 The claimants’ case was that, despite the defects in the Letzel and Drexler study, the number of cases of BCC identified in that study could be explained only by the effect of exposure to tar-related products.  Dr August had calculated that the annual incidence of BCC found in the Letzel and Drexler study was about 5.13 times more than would have been expected if the incidence of BCC in Germany were similar to that found in the South Wales study.  He recognised that the lack of controls was a weakness of the Letzel and Drexler study but could see no reason why the risk of BCC in Germany should not be similar to that found in South Wales.  He observed that the findings of the Letzel and Drexler study suggested that the risk of BCC amongst persons exposed to pitch was significantly increased.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0.00in;margin-right:0.03in">10.45 Dr Falk accepted that it was biologically plausible that there might be an increased incidence of BCC - as well as an increased incidence of SCC - related to exposure to pitch and tar.  That view was based on indirect evidence derived from the effects of other agents, in particular immunosuppression and the initiator/promoter action of UVR-induced damage, both of which are known to cause an increased risk of both SCC and BCC.  He emphasised, however, that such indirect evidence was different from saying that a direct link has been proven.  He did not accept that there was any reliable epidemiological evidence which supported an increased incidence.  In particular, he did not accept that the Letzel and Drexler study provided such evidence.  He agreed that the number of cases of BCC observed in the study was greater than might have been expected and he acknowledged that its findings raised the possibility that a relationship between pitch exposure and BCC existed.  However, he said that, without further investigation by means of a properly designed case controlled study, it was impossible to confirm or refute that possibility.   </p>

There may have been special factors in the local population which gave rise to a generally increased incidence of BCC.  In the absence of controls, this could not be determined.  It was not valid to compare a group of German tar refinery workers (the Letzel and Drexler study) with the population of West Glamorgan (the South Wales study).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.83in;margin-right:0.03in">In the Letzel and Drexler study, diagnoses of skin cancer did not depend on self-reporting by patients.  The subjects’ skin was inspected regularly and any abnormalities were dealt with promptly.  Early histological examination is likely to lead to a greater incidence of diagnosis of skin tumours.  Dr Falk said that, in normal circumstances, there is likely to be a significant degree of under-reporting of BCCs.  They can be very slow growing and, in normal circumstances, may not be reported to a doctor for many years, if ever.  The usual age at which patients first report a BCC is between 60 and 80 years.  A person of that age may regard a lesion on his/her skin as part of the ageing process and may not report it.  He/she may have other, more disabling, medical conditions and may die before his/her BCC has become sufficiently troublesome to cause him/her to consult a doctor about it.  Even if a BCC is reported to a GP, it may be removed without any histological examination being undertaken, and therefore without any reliable diagnosis having been made.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.84in;margin-right:0.03in">Dr Falk also said that epidemiological studies investigating the incidence of NMSC which are based on information collected about cases of skin cancer can, by definition, take no account of cases that are not reported to GPs, or those which are reported to GPs but are not then reported by them to the appropriate public body.  Dr Falk said that the South Wales study had been entirely dependent on data originating from clinicians who had treated patients with NMSC.  There will inevitably have been a degree of under-reporting, particularly of BCC. </p>

Whatever its extent, however, there was bound to be a significant difference in incidence between a population whose skin was examined regularly and a population who had to report any skin abnormalities themselves.  Dr Falk said that this factor alone was likely to lead to a finding of higher numbers of skin cancers amongst the German tar refinery workers than within the local population or any other population that might be comparable.   </p>

Dr Falk said that, if the BCCs observed in the Letzel and Drexler study had been caused by exposure to tar products, he would have expected them to appear at sites of the body not generally associated with BCC.  SCCs caused by occupational exposure are frequently found on the scrotum.  In the absence of known occupational exposure, SCCs are not normally found at that site.  The Letzel and Drexler study noted that, at some of the subjects, SCCs and keratoacanthomas had been observed at sites (the upper lip and forearm) not usually associated with such lesions.  By contrast, the BCCs had been confined to sites at which they occur in the general population, save for a small number observed on the subjects’ </p>

Dr Falk accepted that, if there were a synergistic effect between exposure to tar and exposure to UVR which gave rise to BCC, that would account for the coincidence between the distribution of BCCs in the Letzel and Drexler study and their distribution in the general population.  He agreed that the coincidence of distribution could also be explained if there had been heavy exposure to tar at the relevant sites, but little exposure to sunlight.  </p>

In the updated study, the average age at which SCCs developed was younger (55 years) than the age range amongst the general population (60 to 80 years).

In the Letzel and Drexler study, however, the ratio was reversed.  If there had not been early intervention, the ratio would have been weighted towards SCC even more markedly since early intervention will have prevented some SCCs from developing at all.  </p>

Nor did he accept that there was any significant degree of underreporting of BCCs generally.  He believed that the vast majority of the BCCs suffered by the subjects of the Letzel and Drexler study would have been reported by them to their doctors in any event.  He said that BCCs do not resolve spontaneously.  If they are left untreated, they will almost invariably progress and will destroy the tissue around them.  They cannot therefore be ignored.  The only effect of regular examinations would have been to bring forward the diagnoses by a short time.  Dr August did accept however that there might still be some under-reporting by GPs of BCCs which they had diagnosed and removed.   </p>

I have scrutinised it carefully, together with the experts’ evidence about it.  In doing so, I have borne in mind the need, emphasised by members of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Sienkiewicz</span>, to ensure that, if conclusions are to be founded on epidemiological evidence, that evidence provides a sound basis for those conclusions. </p>

That, however, is in effect what the claimants are seeking to do in this case.  They invite me to draw conclusions from a comparison of the incidence of BCC amongst a group of tar workers in Germany between 1946 and 2002 with the incidence of BCC amongst the population of West Glamorgan during two six-month periods in 1988 and 1998.  I accept Dr Falk’s evidence that the exercise is not a valid one.  It may or may not be that the incidence of BCC in the general population in Germany is, as the claimants suggest, very similar to that in South Wales.  I have heard no evidence on the point.  In particular, I have no knowledge at all of conditions in the area of Germany in which the relevant tar refinery was situated or of any special factors that may have affected the incidence of BCC there.  (For example, the local population may be abnormally fair-skinned.)  I note that, according to the 1998 study, the ratio of BCC to SCC in Germany was said, in 1998, to be ten BCCs to one SCC.  That is significantly different from the ratio quoted for the UK (three or four BCCs to one SCC).  It may be that the incidence of BCC in Germany is different from that in the UK for some specific reason.  I have no evidence about the matter.  </p>

First, it seemed to me that he was using the total number of BCCs identified (218) in the 1998 study, rather than the number of individuals who had developed BCCs (98).  The incidence of BCC in the South Wales study was calculated on the latter basis.  Thus he was not comparing like with like. </p>

Again, that was not comparing like with like.  The crude incidence figure of 230 cases of BCC in men out of a population of 100,000 per annum found in West Glamorgan in 1998 was much larger than the standardised incidence rate for men, which was calculated at 128 cases per annum.  We do not know what the standardised incidence rate for the German tar workers would have been.   </p>

	      </authorialNote>.  Dr August quoted that incidence as 0.1% between the ages of 40 and 49 and 0.2% between 50 and 59 years.  Once again, I am not confident that this is a valid comparison.  I have been unable to ascertain from the short extract I have seen whether the textbook is referring to the incidence of individuals developing BCC or the incidence of the development of tumours. I am not sure why Dr August confined his comparison to persons under the age of 60 when the average age at which BCC develops is 63, I have no information about the age of the data contained in the textbook.  Dr Falk’s evidence was that they were “not recent”.  Since there has been a significant recent increase in the incidence of BCC (which the textbook estimates at 50% over the past two decades), the age of the data is important. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:-0.00in;margin-right:0.03in">10.54 I did not regard Dr August’s failure to accept that the early intervention which occurred in the Letzel and Drexler study would have had an effect on the apparent incidence of BCC as realistic.  That failure was linked to his reluctance to acknowledge that there was or ever had been any significant degree of underreporting of BCC by patients.  In his practice, Dr August will have seen patients whose BCC has reached the point where they have considered it necessary to seek medical advice and have been referred to him.  He will not see, or know of the existence of, patients who have not reported their condition to a doctor because it is not causing them problems and they do not regard it as significant.  I accept Dr Falk’s evidence on this matter.  The Australian study to which he referred (albeit the data are now 20 years old) provided a striking illustration of the extent of under-reporting of both BCC and SCC in a relatively risk-aware population.  Without the appropriate epidemiological evidence, there is no way of quantifying the degree of underreporting.  However, I am satisfied that it is significant and that the fact that the subjects of the Letzel and Drexler study underwent regular skin examinations would have had the effect of increasing the number of BCC cases from that which would have been diagnosed in any event. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:-0.00in;margin-right:0.03in">10.55 Dr Falk examined the Letzel and Drexler study for differences in the pattern of BCC incidence that would distinguish it from the pattern observed in the general population.  Such differences might provide support for the hypothesis that the apparently increased BCC incidence amongst the subjects of the study was caused by occupational exposure, rather than the effects of UVR or some other non-occupational factor.  I accept his evidence that, had occupational exposure been the explanation, one would have expected there to be a difference in the age at which BCC first developed.  I regard it as significant that the average age at which SCC was diagnosed amongst the subjects of the Letzel and Drexler study was younger than the age for diagnosis amongst the general population.  By contrast, the average age for the diagnosis of BCC remained unchanged.  I am less persuaded by the fact that the sites where BCC developed on the subjects’ bodies were largely similar to those where they develop in the general population.  I accept that that might be accounted for by other factors.  Nor did I understand why Dr Falk would necessarily have expected the usual BCC to SCC ratio to be maintained if occupational exposure had caused the increased incidence in the number of cases of BCC.  After all, SCC and BCC are known to behave differently and a reversal in the ratio between them has been observed amongst transplant patients who are at a higher risk of both SCC and BCC.  It is, however, noteworthy that the authors of the 1998 study considered that the reversal of the ratio made the induction of BCC by tar seem “less important”. </p>

The problem is that I have seen no evidence as to why this is so.  It may be, as Dr Falk suggested, that BCC (as well as SCC) was originally prescribed in Germany because of the difficulties in distinguishing between BCC and SCC.  However, that would not account for its continued prescription and cannot be the reason for the relatively recent decision to include BCC within the disease prescribed in the UK.  It may be that the latter occurred because reliance was placed on the Letzel and Drexler study.  Dr Falk was plainly puzzled by the definition introduced in the UK in 2003; he observed that it did not even distinguish between NMSC and melanoma.  In the absence of evidence about the basis on which BCC was included within the list of prescribed diseases in both Germany and the UK, it does not seem to me that I can properly infer that this was done for reasons solidly based on reliable epidemiological evidence.  If such evidence existed, I would have expected the experts to have referred me to it.   </p>

I accept that, as Dr Falk has fairly said, such a relationship is plausible and that it is quite possible that it exists.  However, possibility – even strong possibility – is not sufficient for these purposes.  It follows therefore that the claims of former employees at the Phurnacite Plant who have developed BCC must fail.  </p>

The evidence of an association between SCC and exposure to pitch and tar-related products is very strong.  In relation to claimants with claims for SCC, it will be necessary to assess their history of exposure to pitch and tar-related products, together with any other risk factors such as their exposure to UVR, their skin type, the condition of their skin, and the opinions of the medical experts.  It will then be necessary to consider, in cases of SCC where there has been a significant amount of dermal exposure to pitch and/or tar-related products, whether the evidence supports a finding that, on the balance of probabilities, that exposure has caused the claimant’s SCC.   </p>

A key physiological measure that is used to diagnose and assess the severity of COPD is the ‘forced expiratory volume in one second’, abbreviated as FEV<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">1</span>.  This is the volume of air that an individual can expel from fully inflated lungs, using maximum effort, in one second.  A related measure is the ‘forced ventilatory capacity’ (FVC).

The FEV<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">1</span> is thus reduced, whilst the FVC either remains the same or is reduced to a lesser extent than the FEV<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">1</span>.

In each of the individual cases, he apportioned the causation of the individual’s respiratory disease between smoking and occupational exposure to dust and fume.  He allowed one unit per annum for occupational exposure, half a unit for each year of light (less than 15 cigarettes a day) smoking, one unit  for each year of average (15-25 cigarettes a day) smoking and one and a half units for each year of heavy (more than 25 cigarettes a day) smoking.   </p>

I have already referred<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"> </span>at Section 4 of this judgment to the paucity of evidence about the proportion of respirable dust contained within the total dust emitted in various areas of the Phurnacite Plant and to the considerable difficulties of determining that proportion with any degree of certainty.

But the test itself is an entirely impersonal standard: not whether the claimant himself would have considered the injury sufficiently serious to justify proceedings but whether he would "reasonably" have done so. You ask what the claimant knew about the injury he had suffered, you add any knowledge about the injury which may be imputed to him under section 14(3) and you then ask whether a reasonable person with that knowledge would have considered the injury sufficiently serious to justify his instituting proceedings for damages against a defendant who did not dispute liability and was able to satisfy a judgment”.   </p>

He pointed out that otherwise the limitation period could be indefinitely extended.  Until three years after the date of knowledge was found to have passed, the plaintiff had an absolute right to sue.  This could be unjust to defendants who, contrary to the policy of the Act, would be vexed with stale claims.  On the other hand, tightening up the requirements of constructive knowledge need not involve injustice to a [claimant] because the discretion under section 33 gave the court power to allow him to sue when it was equitable to do so.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.76in;margin-right:0.93in">“It is well established that a claimant can bring only one action for personal injuries arising from a particular tort whenever those injuries arise: see Brunsden v Humphrey [1884] 14 QBD 141 per Bowen LJ at 148, affirmed by Lord Hoffmann in Rothwell v Chemical &amp; Insulating Co Ltd [2008] 1 AC 281 at 291E.  It follows that once a claimant has a cause of action and has knowledge of it (that is he has knowledge of a significant injury and that it is capable of being attributed to the relevant acts or omissions), time begins to run against him.  He must then bring his claim in respect of all the consequences of that tort, relying, if he believes that there might be later medical developments, on a claim for provisional damages under section 32A of the Senior Courts Act 1981.  If he brings his claim and it proceeds to judgment, it would seem that there is nothing he can do if he develops a further condition as a result of the same tort unless that condition is covered in the provisional damages order.  Paradoxically, if the claimant delays bringing his claim in respect of the first significant injury and waits until he has developed a second condition, he will be able to claim in respect of both if he can persuade the court to exercise its section 33 discretion in his favour.” </p>

So, in a case where the claimant's state of mind is more accurately described as one of belief rather than knowledge, it seems to us that what matters is whether his state of belief is such as to make it reasonable to expect him to begin to investigate further.  In general that assessment will have to be made by reference to the things that he has said and done. For example, if he says that, at such and such a time, he had a firm belief that his illness had been caused by radiation, it would obviously be reasonable to expect him to begin investigating.  If he said that he had a firm belief that his illness could have been caused by radiation, that would also, we think, be enough.  In cases in which there is no such direct evidence, it would be relevant to consider how he acted.  For example, if a claimant applied for a war pension alleging that his condition had been caused by radiation at the tests, it seems to us that it would be difficult to avoid the conclusion that his belief in the causal connection was sufficient to make it reasonable that he should investigate the possibility that he had a viable common law claim. </p>

With great respect, we do not think that the belief needs to be objectively reasonable. We think that what matters is the claimant's subjective state of mind. If a claimant comes to believe that there is a causal connection between his condition and the matters complained of, it will matter not from where he has derived that belief, even it were from an incompetent expert adviser or from a newspaper article which was not based on sound research.  If the belief were of such strength that it was reasonable to expect him to start investigating his claim, it would amount to knowledge within section 14.” </p>

That research prompted the start of the 1987 IOM study of mortality at the Phurnacite Plant which I have discussed in Sections 8 and 9 of this judgment.  Work on the study began in 1967 and, in November 1968, all industrial workers at the Phurnacite Plant who had been employed there on 1 January 1967 were invited to participate in the study. Work on the study continued until 1983.  The work was based mainly on documentary records, but participants in the study were invited to take part in a survey of respiratory symptoms in November 1968.  About 78% of those who had been invited to participate in the study did so.  The researchers involved in the study visited the Phurnacite Plant from time to time to discuss their preliminary and final findings with members of management and Union representatives.  The final results of the study were published in 1987.  Although they showed more deaths from lung, stomach and bladder cancer than would have been expected, the numbers were small and the results did not reach statistical significance.   </p>

Those concerns were reflected in articles in local and national media, dating from 1970 onwards.  It is clear that the concerns were not confined to the nuisance caused by the emissions.  They also extended to concerns about the risks to health.  In the early 1970s, the concerns appeared to focus on the possibility of the emissions causing non-malignant respiratory disease such as CB.  A newspaper article from February 1972 referred to the ongoing monitoring of the lung function of children at a nearby school and also to the 1987 IOM study which was then in its early stages.  In the event, the monitoring exercise did not disclose any excess incidence of lung function problems.   </p>

Again the health hazard referred to in the article was non-malignant respiratory disease.  However, researchers at Swansea University in 1981 conducted a series of video-recorded interviews with three workers at the Phurnacite Plant (two of them Union officials) as part of the “Phurnacite Project”.  </p>

It may be that the workers had been involved in, or received information about, the ongoing IOM study and were aware of the nature of the risks being investigated.

Because Mr Evans’ employment at the Phurnacite Plant had ceased in January 1984, the documents disclosed in his case were restricted to those which had come into existence before the end of 1983.

On 4 October 1996, they issued a writ on behalf of Mrs Linda Kirwan, a former cleaner at the Phurnacite Plant, claiming damages for personal injuries allegedly suffered as a result of her employment at the Phurnacite Plant between 1976 and 1986.  The writ was served on the second defendant, CPL, in February 1997.    </p>

The first category (of whom Mrs Kirwan was said to be one) consisted of former employees at the Phurnacite Plant who had developed medical conditions allegedly caused by exposure to “chemical waste” there.  The second and third categories related to local residents who had been exposed to emissions from the Plant and to children who had suffered burns as a result of chemical residues left at the site after the Plant had been demolished.  SLP told Nabarro Nathanson that the writ in Mrs Kirwan’s case had been served “to protect the limitation of actions”.  They proposed that, in view of the fact that she was one of a number of claimants, the case should proceed by way of generic proceedings, with a general extension of time being given for service of the Statement of Claim in Mrs Kirwan’s case.  A few weeks later, SLP wrote a further letter to Nabarro, informing them that Mrs Kirwan wished to discontinue her claim and suggesting that the parties should have a discussion about how to progress the remaining claims.   </p>

They had agreed to provide details of their clients and to discuss a possible cost sharing agreement.  It was hoped that the addition of the Randalls cases might be sufficient to satisfy the cost-benefit ratio.  However, Randalls had not provided the required information and the legal aid certificates previously granted to SLP’s clients had therefore been discharged.  The Parliamentary Secretary suggested that consideration might be given to pursuing the claims under conditional fee agreements (CFAs).  It is not known whether the NUM support for the Randalls claimants had extended to the provision of any funding.

Some time later, Robertsons informed the defendants that they were not proceeding with the claims.  In February 2001, Charles Crookes and Jones, a firm of solicitors from Caerphilly, informed the defendants that two of the former Robertsons claims had been transferred to them.  It is not known whether any funding was available for those claims but they were not pursued at that time. Raleys, a firm of NUM solicitors, were instructed in one potential claim by the widow of a former Phurnacite Plant worker who had died of stomach cancer but they advised against pursuing the claim.  Another firm of solicitors, Thompsons, had investigated a number of claims for respiratory disease suffered by former Phurnacite workers.  They carried out investigations, including inspecting documents and instructing engineering and medical experts.  In about 2006, they decided not to pursue the claims further.  In oral evidence, Mr Dray said that, in addition to the claims identified by the claimants, he believed that five or six potential Phurnacite claims had been notified to the British Coal Corporation in or about 1996, although no proceedings had been issued in any of those cases. </p>

In November 1995, Turner J (as he then was) was appointed to manage the claims, which became known as the BCRDL.  The trial of the lead cases in the BCRDL took place between October 1996 and January 1998 and the Claims Handling Agreement (CHA) was finally agreed in September 1999.    </p>

During that period, a number of claims for nonmalignant respiratory disease were registered in the BCRDL on behalf of men who had worked at the Phurnacite Plant.  Some of those men had spent some time working underground and some time employed at the Phurnacite Plant.  Others had never worked underground and were seeking to claim solely in respect of their employment at the Phurnacite Plant.  The terms of the CHA did not require the defendants to compensate men who were alleging that their respiratory disease had been caused solely by their exposure at the Phurnacite Plant.  Such claims were in general ‘parked’ within the BCRDL, pending a decision as to whether and how they should be dealt with.  Some of the claims were settled under the BCRDL despite the fact that the claimants had not worked underground.  This happened either because of an error or in circumstances where, because the BCRDL was at one point proceeding very slowly, the defendants elected to make interim bereavement awards to workers’ widows without investigating their claims.  However, the majority of claims which involved employment at the Phurnacite Plant alone remained ‘parked’ in the BCRDL until the commencement of the current litigation.  Hugh James were instructed in some of those claims.   </p>

They were aware from their previous experience of group litigation against these defendants that, because of the large number of potential Phurnacite claims, any individual claim action would be resisted and would in all probability proceed to a full contested trial.  They were aware (as has indeed proved to be the case) that the process of investigation and trial of even a single claim would require extensive resources.  By contrast, the damages in most of the cases were likely to be modest.  Hugh James did not consider that the claims would be financially viable, whether as unitary actions or group litigation, making it highly unlikely that either the LSC or a Union would fund the claims.  That view altered only when Hugh James began to receive instructions from a large number of individuals with potentially valuable claims for cancer allegedly caused by occupational exposure at the Phurnacite Plant.    </p>

In 2004, solicitors from Hugh James met members of PJAG, which had by that time replaced PAG.  Following that meeting, Hugh James received instructions in a number of potential claims by former Phurnacite workers for cancer, as well as for non-malignant respiratory disease.  I was told that, shortly after the meeting, Hugh James first began to examine the generic issues surrounding the possible connection between exposure to dust and fume at the Phurnacite Plant and the development of cancer.  They opened the first individual file for a cancer claim by a former Phurnacite worker in January 2005.  Between January and July 2005, they received instructions on behalf of 137 former employees of the Phurnacite Plant who had potential cancer claims.  The schedules of costs disclosed by the claimants for the purpose of the costs capping hearings confirm that work on the Phurnacite claims began in earnest in 2005.  Between 2001 and the beginning of 2005, Hugh James had spent only a total of 64 hours carrying out work on generic Phurnacite issues.  In 2005, they did over 100 hours’ work and the time spent increased markedly in the years that followed. </p>

By February 2007, the initial investigations had been completed and Hugh James began to take steps to obtain funding for the proposed litigation.  In March 2007, a case plan was submitted to the LSC in support of an application for legal aid funding.  In April 2007, discussions began with ‘after-the-event’ (ATE) insurers. Meanwhile, Hugh James notified the defendants’ solicitors of the proposed litigation and proceedings were issued in four cancer claims (including two of the lead claims involving Mr Carhart and Mr Jenkins) where the primary limitation period was about to expire.

Hugh James requested Capita not to strike out the Phurnacite claims. In April 2008, they informed Nabarro that preparations were under way for a group action which would include claims for non-malignant respiratory disease.  In July 2008, it was agreed that those BCRDL claims that related solely to employment at the Phurnacite Plant should be identified and placed on a Schedule which should then be put before the court for directions as to their future conduct.

The Access to Justice Act 1999 (the 1999 Act), which came into force in 2000,  had the effect of taking most personal injury claims out of the scope for legal aid.  Such claims were thereafter to be funded by CFAs.  The 1999 Act provided that successful CFA-funded claimants could recover from their unsuccessful opponent the ‘additional liabilities’ that had previously been irrecoverable.  </p>

Those negotiations were complicated by the fact that, in their response to the letter of claim, dated 4 December 2008, the defendants raised an issue as to whether they were the correct defendants.  The position was not clarified finally until a court hearing in May 2009.  The GLO was made on 22 July 2009.  Also in July 2009, the defendants agreed that, for Phurnacite claims alleging respiratory disease alone or alleging both respiratory disease and cancer, the date of registration in the BCRDL should be deemed to be date of issue of proceedings for the purposes of this litigation.  Thereafter, the negotiations with insurers were concluded and an ATE insurance policy was issued on 3 August 2009.  </p>

That history was not encouraging from the point of view of a potential claimant.  All but one of the claims had foundered before, or shortly after, the commencement of proceedings.  In a number of cases, legal aid had been granted initially on a limited basis but had then been withdrawn.  It is not clear whether any of the claims had received financial backing from a Union but, if they had, the financial support did not extend to funding of the commencement of proceedings.  Even after the introduction of CFAs in 1995, no firm of solicitors had been prepared to pursue a Phurnacite claim on a CFA.  The only claim that had been pursued to a conclusion was that of Mr Evans.  That was an entirely different type of claim and had plainly been suitable to be pursued as a unitary action with the benefit of legal aid. </p>

The claimants contended that, in reality, it would not have been feasible to proceed with a unitary claim, whether for non-malignant respiratory disease or cancer, earlier than the late 2000s.  Such a claim could have been expected to be strongly contested and would, being a ‘test’ case, have involved the expenditure of huge resources for which funding would not have been available. </p>

Mr Harris and Mr Brian Jones gave evidence for the claimants; both had held managerial and/or supervisory roles at the Phurnacite Plant.  Mr Dray said that the defendants had not identified Mr Harris.  He said that they had identified Mr Brian Jones but had decided not to interview him on the ground that he and Mr Baylis (a witness identified by the defendants) “were likely to give exactly the same sort of evidence”. Also, by the time the defendants became aware of Mr Brian Jones’ existence, the defendants were aware that he had been interviewed by the claimants’ solicitors.  Mr Baylis had been employed at the Phurnacite Plant as a shift manager for only a short period between 1974 and May 1977.  Between 1963 and 1974, he had visited the Phurnacite Plant from time to time in the course of his job of providing technical support for coal products processing plants.  After May 1977, he worked as assistant manager, and afterwards manager, of the Homefire works in Coventry.  By contrast, Mr Brian Jones had been employed at the Phurnacite Plant for over 20 years and had an extraordinary knowledge of the Phurnacite Plant’s history and processes.  </p>

Witnesses who were traced and interviewed were asked whether they could provide details of other potential witnesses.  It was suggested to Mr Dray that, since all the surviving former supervisors and managers at the Phurnacite Plant would have been members of employment pension schemes, one way of reaching potential witnesses would have been to ask the administrators of those schemes to send out letters asking for anyone who believed they could help to come forward.

However, I am satisfied that it was only some time after the publication of the study, in about 1990, that there was a general awareness amongst workers at the Phurnacite Plant and the local community that, where a worker had developed a cancer of the lung, there was a real possibility that it was attributable to his employment at the Phurnacite Plant.  The evidence relating to the risk of bladder cancer was rather more equivocal but there is no doubt that some Phurnacite workers and their families were aware of the possible link between bladder cancer and occupational exposure at the Phurnacite Plant. </p>

Some of the individual claims may have passed through the hands of one or more firms of solicitors before eventually reaching Hugh James.  It is clear that, before Hugh James put in place the funding arrangements for the current litigation, no other firm of solicitors had succeeded in obtaining the funding necessary to advance claims on behalf of former Phurnacite Plant workers, whether by way of a group or a unitary action.  (The case of Mr Evans, commenced in 1993 and conducted with the benefit of legal aid funding, was quite different in character, as demonstrated by the fact that it was settled by the defendants).  Union backing on the scale necessary properly to investigate and pursue such an action was not forthcoming.  Legal aid was unavailable or available only to a very limited extent. And, before 2000, CFAs were not financially viable in large actions, because of the non-recoverability of ‘additional liabilities’. </p>

In 2000, the LSC discharged the legal aid certificates previously granted to 17 potential claimants on the basis that the relatively low value of the claims, when compared with the high costs of investigating and pursing them, did not satisfy the relevant cost-benefit ratio.  The same type of cost-benefit analysis would inevitably have been carried out by any prudent solicitor when deciding whether to enter into a CFA, and by any potential ATE insurer.  </p>

In effect, therefore, they came to the same conclusion as the LSC had done in the SLP claims.  Hugh James have considerable experience of group litigation, in particular group litigation against these defendants.  They were aware that the Phurnacite claims would be defended, in all probability to a contested trial and they made their assessment of the viability of the claims with that in mind.  Their view about the viability of the claims only changed in 2005, when the number of claims and their potential value increased significantly.   </p>

Such an assessment was necessary in order to enable the claimants’ legal advisers to decide whether to enter into CFAs, for the purposes of obtaining ATE insurance and also in order to have any prospect of obtaining funding from the LSC and/or any other source.  In the event, the investigations took more than three years and a letter before claim was not sent to the defendants until September 2008. </p>

That work was bound to take some considerable time.  Further time was spent trying to obtain the necessary funding.  It may be, as Mr Morgan candidly acknowledged, that some aspects of the investigatory work could have been accomplished quicker than they were.

The claimants urged me to use the evidence about funding difficulties in another way also.  They contended that I should consider the position as to funding that would have existed if an individual claimant had instructed a solicitor at or shortly after the time that he/she acquired ‘knowledge’ for the purposes of the 1980 Act.  Thus, if I were to find that a claimant had developed COPD and had the requisite knowledge by 1990 but did not consult a solicitor, the claimants said that I should go on to consider whether it would have been feasible for that claimant to have pursued a claim at that time.  The claimants suggested that I should conclude in that example that, in 1990, it would not have been realistic for a claimant to have pursued a unitary claim for damages for COPD allegedly caused by occupational exposure at the Phurnacite Plant.  In 1990, it had not yet been established that coal dust could cause COPD; that was not established until 1998, when judgment was given in the lead BCRDL cases.  Indeed, the contention that coal dust could cause COPD had been rejected only the year before in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Tanner v National Coal Board</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="286">
		<p class="footnotedescription"> Unreported 20 December 1989 </p>
	      </authorialNote><span style="font-style:italic">.</span>  The claimants argued that the prospects of success and the likely costs of the action would have been such that the claimant would not have been able to proceed at that time.  He/she would not have been able to pursue his/her claim to trial until the late 2000s when the number and potential value of the Phurnacite claims was sufficient to make them viable.  Thus, the claimants argued, the defendants have not been prejudiced by the claimant’s failure to act earlier.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:-0.00in;margin-right:0.03in">12.86 Whilst I have some sympathy with the submission made by the claimants, I do not feel able to accept it.  If a claimant did actually consult a solicitor and was advised that he/she could not proceed by reason of a lack of funding, then that would plainly be a relevant factor in considering the reasons for delay.  However, I consider that it is a step too far to speculate about what might or might not have happened in the entirely hypothetical situation that a claimant who did not in fact consult solicitors had done so.  The course of events that would have followed if the claimant had consulted solicitors after acquiring knowledge would have depended on a whole range of factors, many of which may not now be capable of being ascertained.  If the court were to attempt to reconstruct events in this way, it would be necessary for the parties to adduce detailed evidence about the circumstances at the relevant time, the type(s) of funding that may or may not have been available and what the likely course of events would have been.  This would impose an additional burden on the parties and the court and would add to the complexity of decision-making in limitation cases.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:-0.00in;margin-right:0.03in">12.91 I am not persuaded that the defendants have taken all the steps that they might have done to identify and trace potential witnesses.  The attempts made by them to identify and trace witnesses were very superficial.  They did not employ the obvious expedient of attempting to communicate with former supervisory and management staff through the relevant pension schemes.  Furthermore, even when they became aware of the availability of a potential witness of management grade such as Mr Brian Jones, with his lengthy period of service at the Phurnacite Plant and his considerable knowledge of the processes carried on there, they elected not to interview him.  That decision was not consistent with a real intention to gather as much evidence as possible about working conditions at the Phurnacite Plant.  In the event, the defendants chose to rely on the evidence of only five of the nine witnesses from whom they had obtained witness statements.  Thus, even when the defendants had been able to trace and interview witnesses, they judged that it was not in their interests to rely on them.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:-0.00in;margin-right:0.03in">12.92 A great deal of evidence was available about working conditions at the Phurnacite Plant, from both the witnesses and the mass of contemporaneous documentation.  There were 30 lay witnesses, whose evidence is summarised at Section 2 of this judgment.  Many of them had an excellent recollection of the processes carried out at the Phurnacite Plant and were able to give highly detailed accounts about the working conditions there.  In general, those accounts were very consistent with each other.  The disclosed documents contain many accounts of sources of dust and fume emissions identified in the course of Plant inspections, pollution surveys, correspondence from the Alkali Inspector and the like.  There is overall consistency between the conditions described by the witnesses and the information contained in the documents.  Such is the consistency of the overall picture that I am driven to the conclusion that, whenever the defendants had begun their search for witnesses and however thorough that search had been, it is in the highest degree improbable that they would have identified a witness or witnesses who would have given evidence about the working conditions at the Phurnacite Plant such as to change the outcome of the issues to be determined in this litigation. </p>

Dr Choo Yin seemed to think the paper records were kept in the Plant laboratory for some time at least.  However, it is not known whether the records were retained for more than a short period and, if so, when they were discarded or lost.

It seems unlikely that they were still in existence in 1997, when proceedings were commenced in Mr Albert Evans’ case.  If they had been, one would have expected them to have been preserved in accordance with the usual practice described by Mr Dray.  If they were not in existence in 1997, the most likely time for them to have gone astray was at the time the Phurnacite Plant was closed down, shortly after 1990.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:-0.00in;margin-right:0.03in">12.100 Is it likely that the missing sampling results would have assisted the defendants in their defence of the claims?  First of all, the results would only have assisted them in cases where the claimant had been employed after 1983 in an area where personal sampling was carried out.  Second, the results would only have assisted the defendants if they had shown average exposure levels which were lower than those recorded for the period up to 1983.  None of the experts suggested that it was likely that exposure levels would have decreased during the 1980s.  Descriptions of the working conditions given by witnesses who worked at the Phurnacite Plant during the 1980s did not suggest that there was any material improvement in those conditions during that period.  In all the circumstances, I consider it highly unlikely that the defendants would have been assisted had the additional sampling results been available.  Indeed, they may well have been in a worse position.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:-0.00in;margin-right:0.03in">12.101 In general, there was a wealth of documentation describing conditions at the Phurnacite Plant.  It is true that the number of documents dating from the 1940s and the early 1950s was small by comparison with the volume of documentation which was available for the later years.  That may in part have been a reflection of the fact that, in earlier years, fewer Committees were in existence and less paper was generated.  However, it is likely that some documents from that period have been lost.  It is not possible to say when that occurred.  It may have been many years ago.  Nevertheless, I am quite satisfied that the documents which were available, coupled with the witness evidence, were sufficient to give a generally accurate picture of the working conditions at the Phurnacite Plant throughout the period for which it was in operation.  I regard it as highly unlikely that, if the missing documents had been available, they would have materially affected the overall effect of the existing evidence.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:-0.00in;margin-right:0.03in">12.102 As to the documents relating to the preparations made by the defendants for the introduction of the COSHH Regulations 1988, these are of limited relevance in this litigation.  The Regulations came into operation only in October 1989, very shortly before production at the Phurnacite Plant ceased.  In any event, the important factor, when deciding whether there was a breach of any of the COSHH Regulations must be the evidence about the conditions in which the defendants’ employees were required to work, rather than evidence about the preparations made by the defendants for the introduction of the Regulations.    </p>

It will also be necessary in the individual cases to consider the extent to which the claimant acted promptly and reasonably once he/she acquired the relevant knowledge and to examine the steps, if any, taken by the claimant to obtain medical, legal or other advice and the nature of any such advice he/she may have received, before carrying out the balancing exercise necessary in order to reach a conclusion as to whether it would be fair and just to permit the action to proceed.   <br/></p>

It is agreed that there should be apportionment to exclude from compensation that part of his COPD and CB, if proved, which can properly be attributed to his smoking.  The defendants also contend that there should be apportionment to reflect any exposure to dust and fume which would inevitably have occurred without breach of duty on the defendants’ part (i.e. the ‘irreducible minimum’).   </p>

He worked mainly on batteries 1 and 5, with some overtime in the briquetting plants.  He was a process foreman from 1970 until 1985.  He knew Mr Carhart well. He made a witness statement in February 2011; unfortunately, by the time of the trial, he was unfit to give oral evidence.  Mr Brian Jones was employed by the defendants from 1971 until after the cessation of Phurnacite production at the Plant in 1990.  He was a shift superintendent between 1971 and 1984.  Thereafter he worked in various management capacities.  He made a lengthy witness statement for the purpose of these proceedings (mainly in connection with the claim of Mr Robson); he also gave oral evidence.  He worked closely with Mr Carhart between 1971 and 1977 and it is clear from his evidence that he regarded Mr Carhart as a highly conscientious and experienced employee. Also relevant to Mr Carhart’s claim was the evidence of Mr Richards, another of the lead claimants, who was a process foreman for some time. He provided a detailed witness statement and gave oral evidence.    </p>

In his witness statement, he described working initially for about 18 months as a yard labourer.  He related how he had to work in the pitch bay, clearing up the pitch pits and using power tools to break up solid pitch residues.  He described spending four or five days at a time cleaning out naphthalene residue from storage tanks.  Mr Pugh recalled Mr Carhart cleaning out tar tanks, although this may have been a little later in his career.  It is clear from a document completed by Mr Carhart in 1971 that he also worked as a crane assistant at some time between 1948 and 1950.  </p>

It seems to me highly likely that the information given by him in 1971 was more accurate than the different accounts of his work history contained in other documents which came into existence later.

Between 1970 and 1977, Mr Carhart and Mr Pugh were both performing the same job although they worked on different shifts.  From 1966 to 1981, Mr Richards was a process foreman, also on batteries 1, 2 and 3.  From 1966 until 1977, Mr Richards and Mr Carhart were doing the same job, again on different shifts.   </p>

They were able to give average times only since every day’s work was different and the process foreman’s programme would depend entirely on what problems arose during his shift and in what area the problems occurred.  However, it was common ground between the witnesses that most problems occurred on the oven floor, as a result of which a process foreman would spend more time there than in the other working areas.  On occasion, he might spend virtually a whole shift dealing with problems on the oven floor whilst, at other times, he might be required to spend a significant amount of time dealing with issues which arose elsewhere in the carbonisation plant.  </p>

Mr Brian Jones estimated that Mr Carhart would have spent up to 70% of his time on the oven floor and 20% on the quenching car floor, with the remaining 10% of his time split between the ramps, the screen house and the by-products plant.  Neither Mr Pugh nor Mr Brian Jones made any mention of time spent on administration.  Mr Richards estimated that, over an eight-hour shift, he spent an average of three to four hours on the oven floor, 30-45 minutes on the quenching car floor and in the screen house, 10-15 minutes on the shuttle car floor and 15 minutes on the ramps.  The remaining hour would be spent doing administrative tasks in the foreman’s office/canteen.  In oral evidence, Mr Richards suggested that he would sometimes spend as long as one and a half hours in the office/canteen at lunchtime, eating his meal and completing his paperwork. </p>

It may be that, in giving their estimates of the percentage of time spent in the various working areas, they were referring only to the time actually spent performing active duties and were leaving the administrative part of the process foreman’s job out of account.  Be that as it may, I find that, as Mr Richards’ evidence made clear, a proportion of Mr Carhart’s usual eight-hour shift (and of any overtime he worked) must have been spent on administrative work of various kinds.  No two process foremen will have organised their working day in precisely the same way and I find that Mr Carhart probably did not devote as much time to administrative duties as did Mr Richards.  Nevertheless, I am satisfied that he must have spent an average of at least one and a half hours of his shift (i.e. about 20%)  away from the working areas of the batteries, doing administrative work in the foreman’s office/canteen, conferring with colleagues and walking between the two batteries or between the batteries and the office/canteen.  Of the remaining 80% of his time, I find that 65% was spent on the oven floor, 10% on the quenching car floor and 5% split between the screen house, the ramps and the shuttle car floor.   </p>

However, the evidence of Mr Carhart himself was that he wore a helmet with an air supply and visor (which, from the description, must have been a Racal airstream helmet) when working as a process foreman and chief heater foreman on the oven tops.  I accept his evidence on this point although I find (and the defendants appear to accept) that he did not start to wear the helmet until somewhat later than he believed, i.e. until about 1981.  I have concluded in Section 5 of my generic judgment that, even after the Racal airstream helmets were provided, the defendants continued to be in breach of duty in respect of work on the oven tops although, since Mr Carhart wore a Racal airstream helmet, he would have been exposed to only about 10% of the fumes to which he would have been exposed when he was not wearing RPE.   </p>

In addition, Mr Stear assumed much lower levels of exposure on the batteries before 1975 than after that date.

This was not an exercise that I could have performed myself and it was undertaken by Professor Jones with the consent of the parties.  I asked him to provide more detail of his workings than he had given previously in the event that it was necessary for me to make any adjustments to his calculations consequent upon any further findings that I might make.  Both parties have had the opportunity to comment on the additional material from Professor Jones and have done so.

His exposure to dust during his previous short period of employment at the Phurnacite Plant may have made some contribution to his condition.  However I am satisfied that the contribution would have been so minor as not to be material and I make no deduction in respect of it.   </p>

The claims questionnaire signed by Mr Carhart in September 2000 stated that he had suffered from a productive cough whilst still at work (although his answer also suggested that he had been working underground which was never the case).  I note, however, that Mr Carhart himself described in the witness statement made in support of his BCRDL claim how he had consulted his GP in 2000 complaining of a persistent  cough.  He suggested that his chest problems had started in the mid to late 1990s.  He made no mention of a more long standing problem.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Carhart’s GP records contain no handwritten or computerised records dating from before 1987, i.e. they commence after he ceased work at the Phurnacite Plant.  As a result, it is not possible to see whether there were any occasions whilst he was working at the Phurnacite Plant when he attended his GP complaining of symptoms suggestive of CB.  Certainly, there is nothing in the later medical records that would suggest that he had suffered from a regular productive cough during his employment there.  In the circumstances, I am not persuaded on a balance of probabilities that Mr Carhart suffered from CB at the time of, or by reason of, his employment at the Phurnacite Plant.  </p>

As a plate layer in the mid-1960s, he was responsible for instructing Mr Davies in some aspects of his work.  From 1975, Mr Turner was a maintenance foreman.  He was appointed chief maintenance foreman in about 1982.  He was responsible for supervising members of the painting gang, including Mr Davies.  Mr Turner made a detailed witness statement in March 2011, but  died before the start of the trial.  As might be expected of such a senior employee, Mr Turner’s witness statement demonstrated an excellent knowledge of the workings of the Phurnacite Plant and the conditions there.  I consider that his evidence about Mr Davies’ employment was generally reliable.  Mr Hodges worked at the Phurnacite Plant between about 1972 until 1990.  For the first eight years or so, he was employed on the batteries.  From 1980 to 1987 he worked as a painter in the same gang as Mr Davies.  They would frequently, although not always, work on the same job.  Mr Hodges gave oral evidence.  The fact that he worked alongside Mr Davies for seven years meant that he had a particularly good understanding of Mr Davies’ daily working conditions.   </p>

He began work as a general labourer or ‘spare man’. In her witness statement, Mrs Davies’ said that his first job was on the ovens.  However, the defendants’ records show that Mr Davies was trained as a back end man and a pug man.  If that is right, Mr Davies must have undergone training in one of the briquetting plants.  Mr Hodges’ evidence was that it was unlikely that Mr Davies would initially have worked as a spare man on the batteries, only to transfer later to the briquetting plants.  Mr Turner said the same.  I therefore consider it probable that Mrs Davies’ recollection was faulty and that Mr Davies spent the first five years of his employment working in one of the briquetting plants.  His job changed in the mid-1960s, I have assumed that this occurred in 1965. </p>

In the defendants’ documents, he is consistently described as having been a “rough brush painter”.  Mrs Davies also described him as a “rough brush painter” in her witness statement, although she may merely have adopted the term which she had been told appeared in the defendants’ documents.  Both Mr Hodges and Mr Turner were adamant that Mr Davies was not a rough brush painter. Rough brush painters were in effect labourers who did a little unskilled painting.  Mr Hodges and Mr Turner said that Mr Davies was a member of the “painting gang”, who carried out skilled painting work, together with the necessary preparatory work, and undertook no labouring duties.  I am satisfied that, whatever his title might have been, Mr Davies carried out the duties described by Mr Hodges and Mr Turner. </p>

On each battery there were girders, situated about 10-12 feet above the oven floor and just below the shuttle car floor.  Some of the girders bore painted signs, identifying the weight that could be safely lifted using the girders.  Due to the amount of dust, grit and fume on the oven floor, the girders corroded so rapidly that the signs had to be re-painted monthly.  The painters would use ladders to gain access to the girders.  Each girder would be covered with a thick layer (Mr Hodges estimated two inches) of dust which the painters would have to remove before cleaning the girder with a wire brush and re-painting the sign.   </p>

There were also metal handrails running down the flights of steps in the batteries.  These metal handrails corroded rapidly and required re-painting regularly.  Mr Turner’s evidence, which I accept, was that it would take three or four months to complete the process of cleaning, preparing and painting the handrails on the oven floors of all the batteries.  That would still leave the handrails in other parts of the batteries to be done.  I accept Mr Turner’s evidence that all the handrails on each of the batteries were re-painted every two years.  However, I find that it is probable that certain handrails, which were subject to particularly bad corrosion, would be re-painted more frequently.  That would account for Mr Hodges’ evidence that they were re-painted every six to eight months.  Insofar as Mr Hodges’ oral evidence suggested that the task of painting handrails took far less time than he had suggested in his witness statement, I am satisfied that this must have been based on a misunderstanding, possibly between a “battery” (or block) of ovens and a battery building.  It is quite clear from the photographs that the task of painting the handrails would have taken a considerable amount of time.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">Whilst the painters were working on the oven floor of the batteries, the processes of charging, discharging and (when necessary) poking clustered ovoids out of the ovens would continue as usual and the painters would be exposed to dust and fume from those processes.  They would also be exposed to dust and fume in the atmosphere from all the other sources I identified in Section 2 of my generic judgment.  They would not work in the immediate vicinity of an oven that was being discharged and would stand at the end of the battery to avoid the steam produced when the quenching of ovoids was going on.  They would also try to avoid working next to an oven that was being charged.  However, all these processes were going on continually on the oven floor and it would have been completely impracticable for the painters to arrange their work so as to avoid exposure to dust and fume.  I accept Mr Hodges’ evidence that, at times, they would be working only a few feet from men who were poking the ovens.  In windy conditions, dust and fume would have been blown about and they may have inhaled dust and fume even if they were working some distance away from their source.  I note that Mr Hodges had previously worked on the oven floor of a battery.  His evidence was that a painter’s exposure on the oven floor was not as intense as that of a process operative working on the ovens.  In cross-examination, he agreed with Mr Walker that a painter’s exposure would be “a small fraction” of the exposure of the process operatives carrying out work in the Phurnacite Plant; however, he went on to say that, when working in the briquetting plants, a painter’s exposure would have been the same as that of the process operatives working there. </p>

Whilst working on the shuttle car floor, he would have been exposed to dust emitted at the transfer points of the raw ovoid conveyors and from the charging of the raw ovoid bunkers.  I find that, on the shuttle car floor, his exposure would have been much closer to that of the process operatives employed there than when he was working on the oven floor.  However, I take account of the fact that he would not have been charging the raw ovoid bunkers himself and that part of the work of painting handrails at shuttle car floor level was performed in the open air.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">In the briquetting plants, the painters had to paint various kinds of metalwork, including girders.  All the metalwork was covered by an accumulation of dust which had to be removed before the metalwork could be painted.  This would be done by brushing the dust off the metalwork and shovelling it away.  The painters also had to paint metal cages, trays and other metalwork situated under the conveyors.  These tasks, which could take days to complete, involved working in confined areas where a great deal of fine dust had accumulated.  That dust had to be removed before painting could begin.  Mr Hodges described how, when he had been working in the briquetting plants, his overalls would be black and he would resemble a miner who had worked a shift underground.  On occasion, the painters would have to work inside the ESPs, which Mr Hodges described as particularly dusty and unpleasant.  As a painter, Mr Davies would also have spent some time working in exhauster houses 1 and 2, the screen houses and also, probably, the trommel houses.  Although his exposure in some of those areas would probably not have been as heavy as in the briquetting buildings, I consider that it would be fair to treat it as such since, when working inside the ESPs or in confined areas under conveyors, his exposure is likely to have been significantly greater than that generally encountered by process operatives working in the briquetting plants.  His exposure in the exhauster and boiler houses would have been less severe.   </p>

Thus he assumed that, when working on the oven floor of the batteries, Mr Davies would have had the same levels of exposure as the men responsible for charging and poking the ovens. Professor Jones initially adopted the same approach but, for the reasons I explained at Section 4, he later revised his calculations to assume that Mr Davies would have experienced 30% of the exposure levels of the process operatives working around him.  Professor Jones made no distinction between Mr Davies’ work on the batteries and in the briquetting plants, but applied the 30% to all the places where he had worked.  He did however concede that, if I were to accept that Mr Davies sometimes worked only a few feet from where ovens were being poked, his exposure levels on the oven floor might well have been more than 30% of the levels experienced by the men regularly employed on the ovens.    </p>

I have described how there were considerable amounts of dust throughout the buildings in the briquetting plants.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">The significant disparities between the experts’ assessments are to a large extent explained by their differing assumptions about Mr Davies’ pattern of work during his employment as a painter and about the extent of his exposure to dust and fume during that time when compared with that of a process operative.  In addition, Professor Syred assumed that, for 15% of his time as a painter, Mr Davies was performing cleaning duties with very high exposure levels comparable to those measured by static samplers in February 1979.  I have included the element of cleaning duties within my assessment of the relative exposure levels of Mr Davies, as a painter, and of the process operatives employed in the areas where he worked from time to time.  It is this factor that has led me to conclude that his exposure in the briquetting plants is likely to have been similar to that of a process operative employed there.  </p>

Therefore, once I had reached some provisional conclusions about my findings of fact in Mr Davies’ case, I invited Professor Jones to rework his calculations on the basis of those provisional conclusions.  This was not an exercise that I could have performed myself and it was undertaken by Professor Jones with the consent of the parties.  I asked him to provide more detail of his workings than he had given previously in the event that it was necessary for me to make any adjustments to his calculations consequent upon any further findings that I might make.  Both parties have had the opportunity to comment on the additional material from Professor Jones and have done so.  Save for his calculations in respect of respirable dust (which are not relevant to the causation of lung cancer and which in any event, having regard to my conclusions at Sections 4 and 11 of my generic judgment, I do not adopt), no criticism of his methodology was raised over and above that which has been discussed in my generic judgment.   </p>

I have considered whether, given the size of that margin, I can be satisfied that the claimant has indeed succeeded in establishing the causation of Mr Davies’ lung cancer on a balance of probabilities.  I have come to the conclusion that I can. In reaching that conclusion, I take into the account all the evidence I have heard about Mr Davies’ work and the conditions in the briquetting plants and the batteries where he was employed.

By early 2005, Mrs Davies had contacted solicitors with a view to making a claim in respect of her late husband’s death.  On 18 August 2005, she signed a witness statement in support of a claim.  In it she said that she had not thought that Mr Davies’ illness and death could be related to his work until other people had begun to suggest to her that it might be so.  She stated that, during his employment at the Phurnacite Plant, Mr Davies had been exposed to “many toxic substances”. However, she was unable to provide any details of his exposure.  In the early part of 2005, Mrs Davies completed a questionnaire which was then forwarded to Hugh James to enable them to consider making a claim on her behalf. It seems probable therefore that she first instructed Hugh James at or about the beginning of January 2005.

It is quite clear from the evidence I have seen and heard that these matters were widely discussed amongst the local community and were the subject of a great deal of publicity.  The Phurnacite Plant had been a major employer in the area for more than four decades and the possibility that workers there might have been exposed to harmful substances must have been a source of interest and concern to the whole community.  The claimant mentioned in her witness statement that a large number of Mr Davies’ former work colleagues had died before her father and that attending their funerals made her father “quite depressed”.  I am satisfied that the claimant would have been aware of the concerns that the deaths (or some of them) had been caused by the working conditions at the Phurnacite Plant.  It is just not credible that she would have been oblivious to the fears and concerns of the community in which she lived.

It is possible, if the claimant was particularly unwell at the time when her mother was considering whether or not to consult solicitors, that Mrs Davies did not bother her with the matter then.  However, if that had happened, I have no doubt that Mrs Davies would have told the claimant what she had done within a short time thereafter.  The commencement of a claim would have been a major step for Mrs Davies to take and I regard it as inconceivable that she would not have informed the claimant of it as soon as possible.  After that, I would have expected the matter to be discussed from time to time, at least when some new development (e.g. the receipt of a draft witness statement) occurred.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Davies’ illness, diagnosis and death were very sudden and I accept that his widow and daughter may well have initially blamed his cancer on a family history of the disease.  I consider it probable that neither the claimant nor Mrs Davies suspected that Mr Davies’ illness and death might have been attributable to his work at the Phurnacite Plant until a short time before Mrs Davies contacted Hugh James and filled in the questionnaire, i.e. in early 2005.  If Mrs Davies had been aware that Mr Davies’ employment might have caused his death, I can see no reason why she would not have acted sooner.  Thus, the primary limitation period would have expired at about the beginning of 2008.  In the event, proceedings were not commenced until March 2010, when the claim was entered on the Phurnacite GLO Register and the claim is therefore <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> statute-barred. </p>

The period of delay before the commencement of proceedings was, in the context of this litigation, relatively short.  The defendants contend that there was no good reason for the delay and that it has had a particularly serious effect since Mr Davies’ employment at the Phurnacite Plant started over 50 years ago and it is more than 25 years since it ended.  </p>

I have found that the claimant and her mother did not suspect that his illness might have been caused by his exposure to dust and fume at work until early 2005.  The claimant’s mother approached Hugh James in January 2005; the claim was one of a large number received by Hugh James in the first half of 2005.  In the event, proceedings were not commenced until March 2010, when the claim was entered on the GLO Register.  I set out in Section 12 of my generic judgment the steps that Hugh James took to progress the Phurnacite claims from 2005 onwards and the difficulties that they faced in investigating the claims and obtaining funding.  I do not find that any of the period of delay between the date when the claimant acquired the relevant knowledge and the date of the commencement of proceedings arose as a result of fault on the part of the claimant or her solicitors.   </p>

In Mr Davies’ case, the defendants rely on the fact that there is no witness evidence from management staff that directly bears on his employment between the start of his employment in 1959 and 1975, when Mr Turner began work as a maintenance foreman and assumed responsibility for supervising Mr Davies and the other painters.  Mr Hodges’ evidence covered only the period from 1980 until the end of Mr Davies’ employment in 1987.  </p>

I have found (in the defendants’ favour) that he did not work on the batteries during that period.  The defendants’ records suggest that it is probable that Mr Davies worked in one of the briquetting plants for the first five years of his employment at the Phurnacite Plant.  Since Professor Jones (whose approach I have accepted) has used a single exposure level for all process operatives who worked in briquetting plants 1 and 2 prior to 1974, the fact that Mr Davies’ precise movements within the briquetting plant cannot be ascertained makes no difference to his calculation.  Accordingly, I find that no specific prejudice arises there. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">From 1975 onwards, there was very detailed evidence from Mr Turner and Mr Hodges about the work of a member of the painting gang.  It is true that their evidence did not extend back to Mr Davies’ earlier years as a painter.  However, there is no reason to believe that the work of a painter underwent any material change over the years.  Certainly, no significant change was reported during the 12-year period from 1975 until 1987.  It seems unlikely that there would have been any significant alteration in the working conditions during the preceding 14 years – apart, possibly, from the nature of the products used, with which I am not concerned. Mr Davies’ exposure to dust and fume would have been dependent on the working conditions in the various areas where he worked.  There is plenty of evidence about those conditions covering the whole period of Mr Davies’ employment.   </p>

Mr Turner died on 19 June 2011, very shortly before the trial started.  Even if matters had proceeded more rapidly and he had still been alive at the time of the trial, it is highly improbable that evidence given by Mr Turner in cross-examination would have changed materially the overall effect of the evidence about Mr Davies’ working conditions.  The description of Mr Davies’ working conditions set out in Mr Turner’s witness statement was very similar to that given by Mr Hodges.  The major points of disagreement between them related to the division of Mr Davies’ time as between the batteries and the briquetting plants and as to the extent of the painters’ exposure when working on the batteries when compared with that of the process operatives working there.  On both those matters, my findings coincide more closely with the evidence of Mr Hodges’ (who gave oral evidence) than with that of Mr Turner (who did not).  Thus, I do not consider that the defendants were significantly prejudiced by Mr Turner’s unavailability. </p>

The CQ was completed in manuscript.  It is clear from its appearance that at least two different people had played a part in writing the answers.  In answer to a question in the CQ as to whether Mr Griffiths had ever smoked, a tick had been inserted to indicate that he had never done so.  That was untrue.  In oral evidence, Mrs Griffiths denied that she had completed the CQ and said that she did not know who had done so.  However, she signed the CQ and it is probable that the information contained in the CQ came at least partly from her.  I consider that it is highly unlikely that, at the time she signed the document, she was unaware of the false information that was contained in it.  This causes me to approach the evidence contained within her witness statement with a considerable degree of caution as to its reliability.  </p>

I therefore find that, given his previous experience as a fitter, Mr Griffiths is likely to have been transferred to work as a shift fitter no later than about three months after his arrival at the Phurnacite Plant.  I have therefore assumed that, from 1 July 1970, Mr Griffiths worked as a fitter.   </p>

He described how Mr Griffiths had told him that he would have to clear conveyors that were blocked and that he would become covered with fine coal and pitch dust.  He would often be working in confined spaces and at speed.  He would work all over the Phurnacite Plant, although Mr Saunders got the impression that most breakdowns occurred in the briquetting plants.  In particular, Mr Griffiths would carry out repairs to machinery in the dryer houses, in the pitch bays and on the presses and the pugs.  He would often be called upon to repair the raw ovoid conveyors on the shuttle car floor.   </p>

I note the contents of a Memorandum prepared by the NCB in 1991 for the purposes of Mr Griffiths’ claim for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).  The Memorandum explained that there had been a tendency in the past for some fitters to become specialised in working on briquetting plant equipment and therefore to spend more time there than elsewhere at the Phurnacite Plant.  It seems to me likely that Mr Griffiths fell into that category.  I consider that the appropriate division of time would be 60% in the briquetting plants, 10% on the batteries, 5% in the pitch bay and 25% in the workshops or areas with similar exposure levels.   </p>

The defendants’ documents show that Mr Griffiths had been trained in both coal sampling and plant sampling.  Mr Saunders’ evidence was that Mr Griffiths was mainly employed on coal sampling, although he would undertake plant sampling when working overtime or covering for the absence of other members of the sampling team.  Although Mr Griffiths might also have done some Phurnacite and effluent sampling, Mr Saunders could not confirm this and I have ignored any possible exposure from these activities.  I have described the work of a coal sampler and a plant sampler at Section 2 of my generic judgment.  That description is based on the evidence of Mr Saunders.  He would see Mr Griffiths every day when Mr Griffiths visited the main sample room to collect his equipment.  On the occasions when Mr Griffiths was engaged in plant sampling, he would prepare his samples in the main sample room and Mr Saunders would see him then.   </p>

He suggested in his witness statement that, whilst other workers at the Phurnacite Plant wore the gauze Martindale masks, such masks would not have been available for the use of men working in the coal sample rooms.  In fact, it is clear that, had he wished to use a Martindale mask, Mr Griffiths could have obtained one.  In oral evidence, Mr Saunders conceded that it was possible that Mr Griffiths may have worn a Martindale mask at times when working in the coal sample rooms.  However, such a mask would not have afforded him protection against anything but nuisance dust and the defendants do not contend that any deduction in the exposure levels calculated for Mr Griffiths should be made in respect of RPE.   </p>

There is no reason to believe that those records do not reflect the position throughout his employment at the Phurnacite Plant.  However, I do not consider that overtime should be taken into account when assessing Mr Griffiths’ exposure levels to PAHs for the reasons set out at Section 4 of my generic judgment.

He took the same view as Professor Syred.  He accepted that the plant and machinery on which fitters worked would not be operating so would not be actually producing dust at the time the fitters’ work was being carried out.  In that respect, the fitters’ exposure would be less than that of a process operative.  However, a fitter would receive additional exposure as a result of disturbing accumulated dust when opening up machinery or cleaning dust from surfaces on which he needed to work.  Professor Jones considered that it was reasonable to assume that, whilst in a working area, a fitter’s exposure would on balance be the same as that of a process operative.

Therefore, once I had reached some provisional conclusions about my findings of fact in Mr Griffiths’ case, I invited Professor Jones to re-work his calculations on the basis of those provisional conclusions.  This was not an exercise that I could have performed myself and it was undertaken by Professor Jones with the consent of the parties.  I asked him to provide more detail of his workings than he had given previously in the event that it was necessary for me to make any adjustments to his calculations consequent upon any further findings I might make.  Both parties have had the opportunity to comment on the additional material from Professor Jones and have done so.  Save for his calculations in respect of respirable dust (which are not relevant to the causation of lung cancer and which in any event, having regard to my conclusions at Sections 4 and 11 of my generic judgment, I do not adopt), no criticism of his methodology was raised over and above that which has been discussed in my generic judgment.   </p>

I accept Professor Jones’ figures as the best available estimates of Mr Griffiths’ exposure levels during the period of his employment at the Phurnacite Plant although, as I have mentioned, I consider that they are likely, if anything, to over-estimate that exposure.  The figure for total dust includes a small amount of dust exposure whilst Mr Griffiths was in the open areas of the Phurnacite Plant.

He told a consultant physician that he had “a little cough but no sputum”.  A right post-pneumonic effusion was diagnosed, with nodulation of the lung fields due to early CWP.  The effusion cleared within a few weeks and, during his followup appointments at hospital, he made no complaints of long standing CB.

Mr Griffiths was complaining of a cold and a productive cough.  In September 1989, he was complaining of shortness of breath on exertion.  Five days later, he was coughing up blood and dark brown sputum.  He continued to complain of severe respiratory symptoms.  In January 1992, he was complaining of shortness of breath on exertion for the past six weeks and phlegm in his throat.  A chest x-ray was reported to show pleural thickening and calcification, probably due to previous tuberculosis, although the possibility of asbestos-related disease was raised.  In May 1992, he was complaining of a cough with thick sputum and was referred to Dr Brian Davies, a consultant respiratory physician.  A letter written by Dr Davies to Mr Griffiths’ GP on 4 June 1992 made no mention of any history of CB, referring only to a six-month history of significant breathlessness.  Lung function tests showed evidence of a restrictive respiratory condition.  Mr Griffiths was obese and he was advised to lose weight.  By August 1992, pulmonary fibrosis had been diagnosed and steroid therapy was being considered.   </p>

His breathlessness had worsened over the previous year and a chest x-ray showed a “ground glass” increase in density with bilateral pleural thickening.  He derived little benefit from the steroid therapy which was discontinued after a few weeks.  He was discharged from any further follow-up in October 1993.

A bronchodilator was prescribed, together with steroid therapy.  There were further attendances on his GP in 1999 and early 2000 with shortness of breath.  In March and July 2000, he was again noted to have “COPD”.  His respiratory problems worsened from August 2000.

His evidence, which I accept, was that Mr Griffiths had not suffered from pulmonary fibrosis, asbestosis or any symptoms relating to COPD.  The lung function tests which he had undergone in 1992 had showed no sign of COPD.  Any emphysema that had been present at post-mortem was, he said, of insufficient extent to cause symptoms.  He attributed Mr Griffiths’ longstanding breathlessness to multiple causes unconnected with his work at the Phurnacite Plant.  He considered that the x-ray appearances that had been attributed to fibrosis/asbestosis had resulted from a previous tubercular infection which (not unusually) had gone undetected.    </p>

Indeed, at times in his cross-examination of the claimant, Mr Walker appeared to be accepting that Mr Griffiths had suffered worsening symptoms whilst working at the Phurnacite Plant.  This was possibly for tactical reasons related to the defendants’ case on limitation.  Be that as it may, however, it seems to me that I must examine the evidence for myself and reach my own conclusion as to whether the claimant’s assertions can properly be relied upon.  As I have said, the claimant’s oral evidence was plainly unreliable.

She made no mention of his episode of pneumonia in 1948 or of the diagnosis of CWP that was made later that same year.  These are surprising omissions.  I would have expected her to remember that her husband had been diagnosed with CWP at such a relatively young age.  The claimant said that Mr Griffiths had had no chest problems during his time as an aircraft fitter, although, in the 1950s, she began to notice that he became short of breath sooner than she did.  She said that, when he started work at the Phurnacite Plant in 1970, he still had “an occasional cough” and his chest “sounded a bit wheezy”, but these problems did not affect his daily life. </p>

At first this happened gradually.  However, in the early 1980s, his chest appeared to get much worse.  He had more regular bouts of coughing, when he would cough up black phlegm.  His breathing became much more laboured and he appeared to have difficulty catching his breath.  The claimant said that, because of these problems, Mr Griffiths’ work as a shift fitter became too strenuous for him and he took a job as a sampler instead.  She said that, by the time he left the Phurnacite Plant, Mr Griffiths’ chest was “noticeably worse” than it had been before he started work there.  He had a persistent tickly cough and was finding it increasingly difficult to breathe.  He had an obvious wheeze and became short of breath easily.

The medical records contain only one isolated reference to “bronchitis” during Mr Griffiths’ employment as an aircraft fitter.  There are no references in his GP records to attendances in connection with chest problems between 1970 (when he was referred to a consultant with what appeared to be an episode of pneumonia) and July 1987, i.e. about four years after ceasing work at the Phurnacite Plant (when he was complaining of a cough and sputum).  </p>

However, there are a number of entries from the early 1970s, including the period from late 1974 to February 1975, when Mr Griffiths transferred to work as a sampler.  These entries disclose no respiratory problems.  In particular, there are no references to Mr Griffiths suffering from a productive cough.  Mr Griffiths was a frequent attender at his GP surgery with a variety of minor – as well as major – ailments.  I would have expected that, if he had had a chronic problem with a cough and sputum, it would have been evident from his medical records. Moreover, Mr Griffiths’ move to work as a sampler occurred in 1975.  It could not therefore have been caused by deterioration in his respiratory symptoms that, according to the claimant’s account, occurred in the 1980s.  These discrepancies, together with other features of the claimant’s evidence relating to the limitation issues, and the contents of the CQ, cause me to conclude that the claimant cannot be regarded as a reliable witness.   </p>

Those symptoms culminated in his lung cancer and consequent death.  It seems probable that, in the 1990s and thereafter, he did suffer from CB, probably related to his smoking.  What is far less clear is that he suffered from CB during the course of his employment underground and/or at the Phurnacite Plant.  There was a series of complaints about colds and catarrh and one complaint of “bronchitis” during the period from 1956 to 1958.  However, that was at a time when Mr Griffiths was working as an aircraft fitter and therefore had no significant exposure to dust or fume.   </p>

The complaint of a cough and stabbing pains in his chest in July 1970 was clearly the result of an acute episode.  It is significant in my view that, at that time, Mr Griffiths said that he was not producing sputum.  It is significant also that he does not appear to have suggested to any of the doctors who treated him during the late 1980s or 1990s that he had a history of a persistent productive cough extending back over decades.   </p>

I accept that, during Mr Griffiths’ time as a miner (and possibly also on occasion when he was working at the Phurnacite Plant), he would have coughed up black sputum as she described after a particularly dusty day at work.  However, looking at the evidence as a whole, I cannot be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that, at the time when he was working at the Phurnacite Plant, Mr Griffiths suffered from CB, as defined by the Medical Research Council, or from an exacerbation of CB.  </p>

I accept that estimate, save that I consider it probable that Mr Jenkins spent rather less time in the pitch bay than Mr Silvanus suggested.

I have therefore assumed that he ceased work as a spare man (and began to have the exposure levels of a pumpsman) on 13 October 1979, although he probably continued to be paid as a spare man (rather than as a pumpsman) until the beginning of March 1980.  </p>

Mr Silvanus’ evidence was that the pumpsmen were not provided with any form of RPE.  Mr Lanyon said that they would wear the gauze Martindale masks on occasion when they were carrying out work which produced particularly intense fumes.  He said that, on average, he would wear a Martindale mask for about one hour each day.  However, the masks were of little use since they were designed to protect against nuisance dust rather than fumes.  Mr Lanyon had also worn a Racal airstream helmet when working as a pumpsman.  This was at a time when the helmets were on trial at the Phurnacite Plant.  They were not issued to pumpsmen as a general rule.  Mr Lanyon said that he had never heard of the 3M mask.  I am satisfied on the evidence that Mr Jenkins was never issued with or used appropriate RPE and indeed the defendants do not contend that any deduction in the exposure levels calculated for Mr Jenkins should be made in respect of RPE.   </p>

Some overtime records for Mr Jenkins have survived. They show that, during a 12-week period in 1986, his overtime hours amounted to about 23% of his basic weekly hours.  However, I do not consider that overtime should be taken into account when assessing Mr Jenkins’ exposure levels to PAHs for the reasons set out at Section 4 of my generic judgment.   </p>

He was a heavy smoker, smoking as many as 60 cigarettes a day for at least part of that time.  The medical experts agreed that smoking increases the risk of developing bladder cancer.  However, they disagreed about whether, and if so to what extent, a man like Mr Jenkins, who had given up smoking many years previously, would still have been at an increased risk of developing bladder cancer as a result of his smoking history.

As a result, it is impossible to say with accuracy when he started and finished at the Phurnacite Plant and on which dates he moved from job to job. Before working at the Phurnacite Plant, he had been employed as a skilled fitter.  At the time he started work at the Phurnacite Plant, there were no fitting jobs available.  He therefore spent between one and two years working on the oven floor of battery 5.  During his time there, he was engaged mainly as a charging car operator and was responsible for charging the ovens, opening the oven lids at the conclusion of the carbonisation process and poking the ovens when necessary. </p>

He was deployed wherever repairs to moving machinery were required. He estimated that he spent about half of his time in the briquetting buildings where many of the mechanical problems occurred.  He carried out repair and maintenance work on the disintegrators and the pugs.  He often had to work inside the pugs and would be covered in dust containing pitch.  He would also carry out repairs to the presses and would come into contact with pitch there.  In addition, he would carry out repairs to conveyors and elevators covered in pitch and pitch dust.  The elevators in the pitch handling areas broke down very frequently and Mr Jones would have to break up and remove the build-up of pitch that had caused the breakdown. </p>

The sub-ground floor housed the drive belts for the elevators and other machinery in the briquetting plants. Huge quantities of dust accumulated in this area, having fallen from the floors above.  The dust would be disturbed by Mr Jones as he moved around and started up the drive belts.  On occasion he also had to work inside the ESPs.  Mr Jones would also work on the oven floor, removing and cleaning the nozzles of the oil sprayers, repairing pipes and assisting in the replacing of elephants. </p>

I have assumed that he was employed in the workshops for 20% of his time.  As to the remainder of his time, I consider that a split of 70% of his time at average exposure levels for the briquetting plants and 10% of his time at average exposure levels for the pitch bay would be reasonable. </p>

Professor Syred assumed that, for 30% of Mr Jones’ time, whilst he was carrying out work on the disintegrators, the pugs, the presses and in the pitch handling area, his exposure levels would have been equivalent to the very high exposure levels measured in February 1979<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="294">

Whilst I accept that it is quite possible that Mr Jones was exposed to very high levels of pitch dust at times during his employment as a fitter, I share Professor Jones’ view that it is not realistic to assume that he encountered these levels for as much as 30% of his working time.  Professor Syred also assumed that Mr Jones spent the whole of his time working on machinery in various parts of the Phurnacite Plant whereas it is clear from the evidence that he spent part of his working time in the fitters’ workshops where exposure levels were lower than in the briquetting plants or on the batteries.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Jones’ evidence was that, throughout his time as a fitter, he would often be exposed to even more dust than process operatives working in the briquetting plant and elsewhere at the Phurnacite Plant.  He said that fitters often had to work in inaccessible places where accumulations of dust would have gathered over a long period of time.  Even though the equipment he was repairing would not have been operating whilst he was working on it, other plant and machinery in the vicinity would have been working normally and he would have been exposed to dust and/or fume from those sources. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">As I have said, Mr Stear did not make an assessment of Mr Jones’ exposure levels.  However, in his Supplemental Report, he indicated (in connection with the case of Mr Robson) that he estimated that a shift fitter would have had 75% of the exposure of a process operative working in the same area.  Professor Jones disagreed.  He accepted that the plant and machinery on which fitters worked would not be operating.  In that respect, their exposure would be less than that of a process operative carrying out his normal work.  However, a fitter would receive additional exposure as a result of disturbing accumulated dust when opening up machinery or cleaning dust from the surfaces on which he needed to work.  Professor Jones considered that it was reasonable to assume that, whilst in a working area, a fitter’s exposure would on balance be the same as that of a process operative.  I accept Professor Jones’ evidence on this matter.  Indeed, I consider that Professor Jones’ figures are a better guide to the level of dust, BSM and BaP inhaled by Mr Jones during his employment at the Phurnacite Plant than the assessment performed by Professor Syred.   </p>

He did not feel comfortable in the sun and knew from experiences in childhood that his skin burned easily.  When relaxing on deck, he would ensure that he sat in the shade and, when he knew that he was going to be exposed to sunlight, he would cover up his body as far as possible.

His time at sea took him to very hot countries  where, as I have found, there would have been occasions when his back, trunk and face would have been exposed to full sun.  Dr August himself expressed the view that one of Mr Jones’ previous BCCs had probably been caused by exposure to sunlight and that he might develop  one or more BCCs in the future, also as a result of exposure to UVR.

During this time he was employed mainly as a charging car operator, with the occasional shift as a quenching car attendant.  He also worked on occasion in the pitch bay, breaking up solid pitch and shovelling it into the pitch bays. When he undertook such work, pitch would be deposited on his hair, moustache, face, hands and arms and it would get inside his clothes. </p>

I have previously given an account of the conditions on the oven floors of the batteries.  Mr Middle described how the fumes from the ovens would contain particles of dust and how that dust, together with the dust on the oven tops, would be blown around and would cover his face.  He would often get particles of dust in his eyes, which would   have to be removed.  When he first worked on the oven floor, he would wear his own clothes, usually a pair of old jeans and a shirt.  At some time during this period, overalls were provided by the defendants.  Even then, dust would go down the top of his overalls and would come into contact with the skin of his upper body. </p>

I have assumed that he started this work at the beginning of January 1966.  For the first three years or so, he was a rigger’s labourer.  Thereafter, he became a rigger, a job that later became known as a rigger/plater. When large structures (e.g. electrical motors, girders, pipes and press rolls) had to be removed or replaced, the riggers were responsible for slinging them and lifting them into the required position, before fixing them.  The riggers would also lift into position and fix metal plates of all sizes which had been manufactured at the Phurnacite Plant by specialist platers. Plates were used in structures such as conveyors, elevators, scrapers, chutes, bunkers, pugs and dryers. They frequently became corroded or damaged and required replacement. The riggers often worked with fitters on the repair and maintenance of plant and equipment. The rigger’s labourers assisted the riggers and worked in essentially the same conditions as them. </p>

The equipment on which he was working would be covered with fine dust containing pitch.  The pitch would often solidify and cause blockages and breakdowns.  There would be accumulations of dust containing pitch inside the elevators and conveyors and in the pits beneath.  Sometimes the equipment would have been cleaned before the riggers arrived.  However, often when they were called to deal with a breakdown, no prior cleaning had been done.  Often, when dust had accumulated inside or underneath an elevator or conveyor, it would not be possible to reach the dust without dismantling part of the structure.  In those circumstances, the riggers would have to clean up the dust before starting work.   </p>

Mr Middle would also have to carry out work on the pitch crusher and pitch elevators which were situated at the sub-ground floor level of the briquetting plants.  These jobs involved chipping off solid pitch which was stuck to the equipment.  The whole area was contaminated with pitch dust and Mr Middle would get the dust on the exposed areas of his skin, in his hair and inside his overalls.  He would carry out similar work on other elevators which were contaminated with coal dust or with a mixture of coal and pitch dust.  The pits under some of the elevators were 15 feet deep.  Often they would contain so much dust that, before entering a pit, Mr Middle would use a stick to ascertain the depth of the dust contained in it. </p>

He would also work on the batteries, replacing equipment (e.g. elephants, boxes, gas mains and pipes) on the oven floor.

However, the gloves available in the Phurnacite Plant were not suitable for the intricate work which he had to carry out as a rigger’s labourer or rigger and he was therefore unable to wear them when so employed.  Mr Middle applied barrier cream to areas of exposed skin at the start of each shift.  However, the dust would stick to the cream and, as the shift progressed and he became hot, the cream would wear off.  There was usually no opportunity during the working day to wash and re-apply the barrier cream.  He wore overalls from the time they first became available but they did not prevent dust from coming into contact with the skin of his upper body.  </p>

If he was performing a heavy job, he had difficulty breathing when wearing a mask and the masks also became uncomfortable in hot and/or confined spaces, as a result of which he was sometimes unable to use them.  His evidence was that, from 1981, the wearing of Racal airstream helmets became compulsory when carrying out maintenance work on the oven floor and, from that time, Mr Middle would wear one when carrying out that type of work. </p>

I confined my request in Mr Middle’s case to the levels of total dust, although Professor Jones also provided his calculations of respirable dust.  The re-working was not an exercise that I could have performed myself and it was undertaken by Professor Jones with the consent of the parties.  I asked Professor Jones to provide more detail of his workings than he had given previously in the event that it was necessary for me to make any adjustments to his calculations consequent upon any further findings that I might make.  Both parties have had the opportunity to comment on the additional material from Professor Jones and have done so.

He reported it to the medical officer at the Phurnacite Plant, who referred him to his GP.  He was then referred to hospital where the lump was removed under local anaesthetic.  He required three or four stitches in the wound.  Mr Middle was told that the lump had been a pitch wart.  He made a claim for industrial injuries benefit and, having been examined by a Medical Board, received a ‘one-off’ payment of about £50.  He was aware of the procedure for making a claim because other Phurnacite employees he knew had made similar claims in the past.  Mr Middle said that he knew that the wart had been caused by exposure to pitch at work.  He knew also that it was important for a pitch wart to be removed because it could become cancerous.  He believed that, once the wart had been removed, it was the end of the matter.  He had no further problems for over five years. </p>

He underwent surgery to remove the lump which was probably another pitch wart although no histological examination appears to have been carried out.  On this occasion, Mr Middle had 17 stitches in the wound and required about a fortnight off work after the surgery.  A histology report revealed that no cancer cells had been seen.  Again, he claimed industrial injuries benefit and was awarded the sum of £175.  Once again, he believed that, the pitch wart having been removed, all was well.  It seems (although Mr Middle did not remember the incident) that he had a further wart on his eyelid in April 1987 which was removed by cauterisation. </p>

The distribution of his BCCs – in the facial area and on his upper body – would be consistent with his exposure to pitch dust as described by him.

I find it very surprising that, throughout the whole of his time at the Phurnacite Plant – a period of over 30 years – he appears never to have complained to his GP of symptoms that, if his evidence is accurate, were very severe and were affecting his sleep.  Mr Middle was a reasonably frequent attender at his GP’s surgery and, if he had been experiencing the symptoms of which he now complains, I would have expected him to have sought medical advice.  In oral evidence, Mr Middle suggested, first, that his symptoms of cough and sputum had started late in his employment at the Phurnacite Plant.  He then described what appeared to be intermittent incidents when he had coughed up black phlegm or bits of tar. These incidents may have been very unpleasant but, unless they happened on a regular basis, they would not fulfil the criteria for CB.  Furthermore, the fact that Dr Rudd has difficulty in reconciling Mr Middle’s current complaints of copious sputum production with a diagnosis of CB suggests that there may be an element of exaggeration in Mr Middle’s evidence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">I cannot be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that Mr Middle suffered symptoms of CB whilst he was working at the Phurnacite Plant or that he currently has CB resulting from his occupational exposure there. In reaching that conclusion, I do not overlook the note in the hospital records made in June 2003, stating that Mr Middle had suffered from a cough and sputum for a long time.  By 2003, he had been away from dust and fume at the Phurnacite Plant for more than 13 years.  The phrase “a long time” could mean a number of months or a number of years. It does not necessarily mean that Mr Middle had been suffering from the symptoms for more than 13 years. Mr Middle reported that the symptoms were “getting worse”.  If they were as bad as he claims when he was at the Phurnacite Plant, and were caused by his exposure to dust there, it is difficult to see how they could have deteriorated 12 years afterwards. </p>

Overall, he displayed a good knowledge of the processes and working conditions at the Phurnacite Plant.  However, he had some lapses of memory, most notably about the fact that he had made a claim for vibration white finger (VWF) in 2000.  That claim was later withdrawn and he appeared genuinely to have forgotten ever having made it.  He was also confused about the claim he had made for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).  I am satisfied also that, on occasion, Mr Richards somewhat exaggerated his account of the working conditions at the Phurnacite Plant.  In his witness statement, for example, he claimed that men working on the oven tops were usually “up to their ankles in dust”.  In his oral evidence, he accepted that he had exaggerated the amount of dust that was present.  I have therefore approached Mr Richards’ evidence with a degree of caution.     </p>

At the Phurnacite Plant, he worked for about two years on the construction of roads and plant, mainly driving a dumper truck.  In addition, he spent a period of about six weeks breaking up solid pitch in the pitch bay, using picks and sledgehammers.  He also assisted with cleaning out the tar tanks outside exhauster house 1.  This involved climbing into the tanks, cutting up the tar residue with shovels and throwing it outside the tanks.  A steam lance would be used to remove any remaining tar deposits and to clean the men’s shovels.  It was a thoroughly dirty and unpleasant job with a lot of exposure to tar fumes. </p>

Having considered that evidence, together with the evidence of Mr Pugh and Mr Brian Jones, I find that, on average, Mr Richards would have spent about 25% of his shift away from the working areas of the batteries, doing administrative tasks in the office/canteen, conferring with colleagues and walking between batteries or between the batteries and the office/canteen.  Of the remaining 75% of his time, I find that 60% was spent on the oven floor, 10% on the quenching car floor and 5% split between the screens, the ramps and the shuttle car floor. </p>

They would carry out tasks such as cleaning under the conveyor belts and under the ramps, clearing around the tanks on the tank farm, clearing frozen coal from wagons, and cleaning out the tar tanks.  Mr Richards would spend his shift walking around the Phurnacite Plant, ensuring that the work was being done properly and assisting when necessary.  He estimated that he would spend about an hour of each shift in the area of the conveyor belts situated below the batteries.  He would also spend about half an hour of each shift in the briquetting plants. </p>

The evidence of Mr Carhart, also a process foreman, was that he wore a Racal airstream helmet when they became available.  Mr Richards never wore any kind of RPE and his employment in the batteries ceased at about the time the Racal helmets were introduced.  3M masks would have been available to him after about 1980 but their use was not enforced by management for yard foremen.

However, it is clear from the evidence that, for much of his time at the Phurnacite Plant, he worked a considerable amount of overtime.  Indeed, his evidence was that he declined the opportunity of promotion to shift supervisor (at a higher salary than that of a process foreman) on the ground that, since overtime would not be available, he would lose financially if he were promoted.  I do not consider that overtime should be taken into account when assessing Mr Richards’ exposure levels to PAHs for the reasons set out at Section 4 of my generic judgment.  I am however satisfied that it is appropriate to take overtime into account when assessing his dust exposure for the purposes of his claims for COPD and CB. </p>

For the rest of the time, Mr Stear assumed low levels of exposure which would not have contributed greatly to Mr Richards’ overall exposure.  Mr Stear later revised his calculations to allow six weeks’ exposure at levels encountered in the pitch bay, together with four weeks’ exposure in the tar tanks.  For this latter period, he used figures for the levels of dust, BSM and BaP encountered by men working on the cleaning of pits in the briquetting plants, discounted by 30% to reflect the fact that Mr Richards would not have been working in a tar tank throughout the whole of a shift.  For the remainder of Mr Richards’ time as a member of the Capital Gang, Mr Stear adopted the ‘background’ exposure levels taken from Professor Jones’ modelling dispersion exercise. </p>

He did not think that it was open to him to become involved with the Action Group because he had been a foreman and belonged to a different Union from the men who were organising the Action Group. In about November 2009, he met a colleague who told him that former employees were making claims for cancer and respiratory disease.  He referred Mr Richards to an article in the local newspaper, which identified Hugh James as the firm of solicitors involved in bringing the claims.  Mr Richards contacted Hugh James and his name was entered onto the Phurnacite GLO Register on 15 March 2010.  He said that, at that time, he was told that he could make claim in respect of his respiratory disease as well as his bladder cancer and he did so.

Not only did that demonstrate that he was able and willing, if he chose, to institute a claim against his former employers, but it had also afforded him an opportunity to seek the advice of the solicitors dealing with his claims about the possibility of claiming for his respiratory disease.  However, the process of making claims within the NIHL and VWF schemes was very straightforward.  The schemes were well advertised and Mr Richards would no doubt have heard that some of his former colleagues were making claims under them.  He may well have been encouraged to make a claim by former colleagues.  He must have received that sort of encouragement with regard to his VWF claim since he was not suffering from the condition.  I consider it unlikely, in the course of either of his claims, that he would have had a face to face meeting with a solicitor.  Even if he did, it would not necessarily have occurred to him that he should seek advice about his respiratory disease.  </p>

The claims he made for NIHL and VWF do not affect my view since those claims were made in the context of existing organised schemes in which claimants were required to participate to a minimal extent.  The fact that Mr Richards participated in those schemes does not mean that he was aware that it might be open to him to bring a claim at common law.  His respiratory symptoms were mild and, even if he had known that a claim might be possible, he might have decided that it was not worth exploring the possibility.  However when, in 2000, he developed a more serious problem that he believed might be attributable to his work, one would have expected him, if he knew that a claim was possible, at least to seek the advice of his Union.  The fact that he did not do so strongly suggests that he was unaware that it would or might be open to him to make a claim.  Thus, the delay, although lengthy, cannot in my view be considered to be in any way culpable.   </p>

If he had delayed taking action until near the end of the primary limitation period it might have been too late for that to be done before production ceased.  I have considered carefully whether that factor, in conjunction with the fact that other witnesses and additional documentation might also have been available then, has adversely affected the cogency of the evidence available to the defendants or their ability to defend themselves in the action.  </p>

In the event, I have not based my findings in relation to the apportionment of Mr Richards’ non-malignant respiratory disease on measurements of respirable dust.  When assessing the extent of Mr Richards’ respiratory disability that is attributable to occupational exposure, I have chosen to adopt the ‘broad brush’ approach advocated by Dr Rudd, an approach with which Professor Jones agreed in principle, at least with regard to exposure on the oven floor.  Moreover, even if further measurements of respirable dust had been taken in the late 1980s, there would still have been the problem of estimating Mr Richards’ exposure levels to respirable dust over the previous 30 years of his employment.  It is highly likely that the ‘broad brush’ approach would still have been the best way of assessing his exposure for the purposes of COPD.  </p>

However, a detailed work history (presumably compiled by him) was included in a solicitors’ letter claiming damages on his behalf for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) against the British Coal Corporation in March 1992. That work history stated that he worked at the Phurnacite Plant continuously between 1952 and 1980, a period of about 28 years.

The claimant made a witness statement in March 2011 and gave oral evidence about his father’s respiratory problems, the nature and extent of his disability, his smoking history and matters relating to limitation.  The evidence about Mr Robson’s working conditions came primarily from Mr Glanville Harris and Mr Brian Jones although they were only able to talk about conditions after 1971.  Mr Harris was employed at the Phurnacite Plant between 1971 and 1982, first as deputy works chemist, then as a shift superintendent and finally as ovens assistant manager.  He went on to hold the positions of deputy manager, then manager, of the Cwm Coke Works and subsequently held a senior post at CPL’s Head Office.  When Mr Harris joined the Phurnacite Plant, Mr Robson was a shift superintendent.  Mr Harris got to know him slightly then.  Between 1974 and 1975, the two men carried out the job of shift superintendent on different shifts.  Mr Brian Jones worked as a shift superintendent with Mr Robson from 1974 until 1980.  Having performed the job of shift superintendent themselves, both Mr Harris and Mr Brian Jones were in an excellent position to describe Mr Robson’s working conditions.  </p>

The “drives” could refer to the drive belts for the conveyors and other machinery in the briquetting plants.  Alternatively, it could be a reference to “dryers”.  In either event, I find that Mr Robson was working in one of the briquetting plants during this period.

I consider it reasonable to assume that, during this period, Mr Robson spent 25% of his time in the fitter’s workshop and other areas with a similar amount of ‘background’ exposure and the remainder of his time in the briquetting plants.  For the reasons I have already referred to in my judgment in the case of Mr David Jones, I consider that, whilst in the briquetting plants, a fitter would on average be exposed to similar levels of dust as a process operative working in the same area.   </p>

The evidence of both Mr Brian Jones and Mr Harris was that, despite Mr Robson’s responsibility for the batteries, most of his time would have been spent in the briquetting plants.  It was there that most of the mechanical problems occurred.  As from 1971, Mr Robson was responsible only for the briquetting plants, including the shuttle floors of the batteries.  He would continue to visit the oven floors of the batteries on occasion in order to liaise with the shift superintendent there and would visit more often when the shift superintendent was absent for any reason.

This was not an exercise that I could have performed myself and it was undertaken by Professor Jones with the consent of the parties.  I asked him to provide more detail of his workings than he had given previously in the event that it was necessary for me to make any adjustments to his calculations consequent upon any further findings that I might make.  Both parties have had the opportunity to comment on the additional material from Professor Jones and have done so.  Save for his calculations in respect of respirable dust (which, having regard to my conclusions at Sections 4 and 11 of my generic judgment, I do not adopt), no criticism of his methodology was raised over and above that which has been discussed in my generic judgment.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">Professor Jones’ re-worked calculations are attached to this individual judgment at Appendix A.  Briefly summarised, his estimate of Mr Robson’s total dust exposure during his employment at the Phurnacite Plant is 365.3mgym<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">-3</span>.  This figure includes a small amount of dust exposure during periods when Mr Robson was in the open areas of the Phurnacite Plant or the offices/canteen. I have found that the defendants were not in breach of duty during those periods. However, since that exposure will not affect the outcome of the case, I have not re-calculated Professor Jones’ figures to exclude it. I have excluded that dust exposure when calculating Mr Robson’s occupational exposure units. The figure makes no deduction for any ‘irreducible minimum’ for the reasons I have discussed in Section 5 of my generic judgment.    </p>

He had undergone surgery for a hernia in late 1982 and was reported to be concerned about his chest symptoms when he saw a consultant in March 1983.  In the claims questionnaire (CQ) completed for the purposes of his BCRDL claim, the claimant stated that his father had stopped smoking in approximately 1980.  Until that time, he had been smoking 20 cigarettes a day.  In evidence, he said that so far as he was aware his father had given up smoking “quite a few years before he died”.  In 1996, when Mr Robson changed GPs, he was noted on the new GP’s records to be a non-smoker.  A note in April 1997 recorded that he had given up smoking about 12 years previously, at the time of his hernia repair.  All this evidence would point to the conclusion that Mr Robson had ceased smoking in 1983 at about the age of 67 years.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">However, Dr Rudd referred to a measurement of Mr Robson’s carboxyhaemaglobin level taken in June 1997 which he said made it “highly likely” that Mr Robson was a smoker at that time.  The measurement constituted objective evidence and was therefore likely to be reliable.  Moreover, Dr Rudd did not consider that the undoubted deterioration of Mr Robson’s respiratory disability in the 1980s and 1990s was consistent with the cessation of his occupational exposure to dust in 1980 and of his smoking habit in 1983.  He considered that the deterioration could only be explained by the fact that Mr Robson had continued smoking well beyond 1983.  He therefore concluded that Mr Robson had smoked until 1997, i.e. for a total period of 63 years.  Dr Rudd’s evidence on that point was accepted by both parties and I too accept it.   </p>

The claimant moved away from his parents’ home in 1969 and remembered that his father’s symptoms had started before then. He described his father having fits of coughing during which he would bring up phlegm.  These episodes became more frequent and lengthy as time went on.  They disturbed his sleep.

After his retirement, his condition deteriorated and he required assistance with some everyday tasks.  For about ten years from 1982, he and his wife used to spend three months in Cyprus each winter, which improved his condition.

There is no dispute that COPD caused Mr Robson’s death.  Dr Rudd considered that, the pathological basis of Mr Richards’ COPD was predominately emphysema.

Mr Robson had a significant level of occupational exposure to dust whilst he was working at the Phurnacite Plant and he developed symptoms of COPD and CB during his period of employment there.  The evidence of the only medical witness to give evidence in Mr Robson’s case was that his occupational exposure made a material contribution to the development of both conditions.

The scheme was well advertised and Mr Robson would no doubt have heard that some of his former colleagues were making claims under it.  He may well have been encouraged to make a claim by his Union or former colleagues.  I consider it unlikely that, in the course of his NIHL, he would have had a face to face meeting with a solicitor.

If he had been aware that a claim was or might be possible, one would have expected him at least to seek the advice of his Union about the matter at that stage.  The fact that Mr Robson made a claim for his relatively minor noise-induced deafness and did not make a claim for his respiratory disease strongly suggests that he was unaware that it would or might be open to him do so.  Certainly, it does not seem that he discussed the possibility with his family.  The claimant did not become aware until 2003 that a claim was possible.  By that time of course his father was dead.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">I consider it probable that the claimant’s assumption is right and that Mr Robson was unaware that he could make a claim.  The claim he made for NIHL does not affect my view since that claim was made in the context of an existing organised scheme in which claimants were required to participate to a minimal extent.  The fact that Mr Robson participated in that scheme does not mean that he was aware that it might be open to him to bring a claim at common law.  The delay, although lengthy, cannot in my view be considered to be culpable. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">I have already discussed the generic issues relating to the cogency of the evidence.  In Mr Robson’s case, no training records are available.  That might have presented very real difficulties in ascertaining his work history   at the Phurnacite Plant.  However, there is the work history set out in March 1992 letter, which makes it reasonably clear where Mr Robson would have been working in his early years at the Plant.  Although there were no witnesses with direct knowledge about Mr Robson’s work between 1952 and 1971, I have receieved a considerable amount of evidence about conditions in the briquetting plants during that period.   </p>

Both Mr Harris and Mr Brian Jones gave oral evidence and the defendants’ counsel was able to cross-examine them.  As a result, I am satisfied that I have a reasonably accurate picture of Mr Robson’s working conditions throughout his time at the Phurnacite Plant. </p>

I have considered carefully whether that factor, in conjunction with the fact that other witnesses and additional documentation might also have been available then, has adversely affected the cogency of the evidence available to the defendants or their ability to defend themselves in the action. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">Given all the evidence I have heard about the conditions at the Phurnacite Plant – and, in particular, about conditions in the briquetting plants where Mr Robson mainly worked – I do not consider that the additional evidence is likely materially to have assisted the defendants in their defence of the action for the reasons set out in Section 12 of my generic judgment.  In the event, I have not based my findings in relation to causation upon measurements of respirable dust.  Instead, I have chosen to adopt the ‘broad brush’ approach advocated by Dr Rudd, an approach with which Professor Jones agreed in principle, at least with regard to exposure on the oven floor.  Even if further measurements of respirable dust had been taken in the 1970s or 1980s, there would still have been the problem of estimating Mr Robson’s exposure levels to respirable dust over the previous 20 or 30 years of his employment.  It is highly likely that the ‘broad brush’ approach would still have been the best way of assessing his exposure for the purposes of COPD.  </p>
