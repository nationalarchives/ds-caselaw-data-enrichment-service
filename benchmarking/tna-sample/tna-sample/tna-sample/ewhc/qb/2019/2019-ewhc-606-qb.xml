These have contracts of employment with the Defendant which are different to the contracts of the subpostmasters. Some of the Claimants therefore have a different status to the subpostmasters generally. However, it is the contracts with sub-postmasters that are relevant to this Common Issues trial. The Defendant, as is well known, operates the network of over 11,000 Post Office branches throughout the UK. The Defendant used to be called Post Office Counters Ltd, and changed its name in 2002 to simply Post Office Ltd. It refers to itself as “Post Office”, without the use of the definite article, and I was told (although none of the witnesses seemed particularly clear about this) that this may be for copyright reasons. In some of the documents, it referred to itself as POCL when it was called Post Office Counters Ltd. I shall refer to it in this judgment as the Post Office. It is state owned. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">All of the Claimants (regardless of their precise individual status, and whether they were individually either sub-postmasters or Crown Office employees) at the material times were responsible for running branch Post Offices. “Material times” obviously means different periods for each claimant, as the dates upon which they became subpostmasters or Crown Office employees differ between them, as do the dates upon which they ceased to have that status. The Post Office has been independent of Royal Mail Group since 2012, when the Postal Services Act 2011 came into force. The Post Office is not responsible for delivering mail. It does however provide postal based and other services to the general public. The range of services it offers has developed and changed over time. A customer of today probably expects far more of his or her local Post Office than would have been the case 30 years ago. As an example, it is no longer possible to purchase a vehicle license (what used to be a paper “car tax disc”) at a Post Office, or cash a Giro for payment of state benefit, but one can change foreign currency, purchase tickets to play the National Lottery, as well as perform other financial transactions. Post Office branches, often in rural areas, are the hub of the community in terms of these and other services. Sub-postmasters would, and do, often run the Post Office within a shop or other small business. The sub-postmaster would receive compensation from the Post Office for running the branch. This would be dependent upon the amount of business performed at the branch. The Post Office provides a large number of services for other companies through the post office branches. These other companies are called the Post Office’s “clients”. For example, Camelot (which runs the National Lottery) makes its games available, through lottery scratch cards and bi-weekly lotteries, to the customers who will buy such products in a post office branch. Camelot is a client of the Post Office.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In about 1999/2000, the Post Office introduced a new computerised system for the accounting function both in the branches, and between the branches and itself. This was (and still is) called Horizon, or the Horizon system. Nowadays, it is an online system, having become a different system called Horizon Online in 2010. In 2000 and for some years afterwards, it operated down a telephone line, called the Official Branch Telephone Line. The requirement upon the sub-postmasters to provide this was stated in the following terms “The Official Branch Telephone Line must be provided by BT in order that Post Office Ltd may use the line for the Post Office Ltd Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line [ADSL] service.” Private use of this line by the sub-postmasters was permitted, but only if this did not conflict with its use as the ADSL service. If it did conflict, the private use was to cease. Horizon was an electronic point of sale and accounting system, and was adopted by the Post Office for all its branches. It was a computerised system with both hardware and software, as well as comprising communications equipment in the branches and central data centres.  </p>

There is no doubt that digital technology, and the capacity and use of microprocessors and IT systems generally, has increased exponentially over the last 20 years or so. Back in the year 2000, almost a lifetime ago in terms of computer technology, I have no doubt that Horizon was seen as a cutting-edge development and it moved branch accounting for the Post Office into the computer age. It was operated through a dedicated Horizon terminal installed at the branch, and indeed most branches would have more than one such terminal.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">However, regardless of the intention of those behind the design, adoption and installation of Horizon, this Group Litigation has at its core the Post Office’s use of the Horizon system and the way that system itself operated. All of the Claimants were users of the Horizon system, and indeed they were required to use the Horizon system by the Post Office. There was no “opt in” or “opt out” alternative, and to be fair to the Post Office, if a large entity is going to move into the digital age, it would have made no sense to have done so piecemeal. However, the Claimants’ case is that the Horizon system contained, or must have contained, a large number of software coding errors, bugs and defects, and as a result of this threw up apparent shortfalls and discrepancies in the accounting of different branches. Alleged shortfalls in the Claimants’ financial accounting with the Post Office are said, on the Claimants’ case, to have been caused by these problems with the way the Horizon system operated, the training that was provided to use it, and also a general failure of the Horizon helpline. These shortfalls and discrepancies, it is said by the Claimants, originated after Horizon started being used. Horizon was designed and installed by ICL, and then in about 2002 ICL was acquired by Fujitsu Ltd, a very well-known IT company. Neither ICL nor Fujitsu is a party to these proceedings.  </p>

At the time, these accounting shortfalls that came to the notice of the Post Office were pursued as exactly that – shortfalls - with the relevant Claimants. The Post Office’s stance both then, and now, was and is that the Claimants were responsible for these shortfalls, and that the shortfalls represented actual amounts of money missing from the Claimants’ accounting. An alternative way of putting what may amount to the same point, but using the approach of the pleadings, is that the Post Office maintains it is for individual sub-postmasters to prove that the shortfalls were <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> their individual responsibility, and failing proof of that by an individual sub-post-master, then the shortfalls were their individual responsibility and the sub-postmaster in question would have to pay the relevant sum to the Post Office and face the consequences. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I have said in each of my written judgments in this case before, and in a number of interlocutory hearings as well, that this is bitterly contested litigation. The parties are poles apart in their approach to the issues, and in their approach to the litigation generally. When shortfalls occurred, the Post Office demanded (and I use that word advisedly) that each individual sub-postmaster pay the sums in question. This stance was consistent with what remains the Post Office’s general position, which is that if Horizon shows a shortfall of X pounds, that shortfall of X pounds must have been caused by the sub-postmaster, either through mistake or dishonesty. Some shortfalls started in the hundreds of pounds, and moved into the thousands, and then tens of thousands, of pounds over a few months. Some Claimants paid these amounts to the Post Office out of their own resources, even though they did not believe or accept that there was anything deficient in their accounting. Some of the shortfalls were only for modest sums. Some Claimants were lucky enough to find accounting irregularities in their favour. Others were convicted in the criminal courts of false accounting, fraud, theft or other offences, and some were imprisoned. The Post Office’s position in this litigation is not quite that it is impossible for Horizon ever to generate any errors, but rather that the system is what is called “robust” and can be relied upon. Further consideration of that will occur in the Horizon Issues trial. It should be noted that the Post Office itself is the prosecuting authority for prosecutions of sub-postmasters. These Claimants claim malicious prosecution against the Defendant, and also claim that there was a “cover up” at the Post Office over the shortcomings in Horizon. Some Claimants were made bankrupt. There are claims for damages for financial loss, personal injury, deceit, duress, unconscionable dealing, harassment and unjust enrichment brought against the Post Office. There is currently a Criminal Cases Review Commission (“CCRC”) review underway in respect of the convictions of a significant number of the Claimants. These are being dealt with together by the CCRC and are, effectively, awaiting the outcome of the technical aspects of this litigation. This is a High Court civil action and has no jurisdiction or involvement in such criminal matters.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">This litigation has, from the date of the GLO onwards, required extensive case management at a great many stages of its turbulent life. The making of a GLO was agreed in principle by the Post Office, who maintain that there was a not insignificant number of sub-postmasters who knowingly submitted false accounts using the Horizon system, that the cases of every individual claimant in the litigation were substantially different on the facts, and there was no common theme that connected them. Prior to the first CMC before me on 19 October 2017, the Post Office initially sought to have no substantive trial(s) listed at all, with a further CMC to be held one year later in late 2018, to fix what would be the first trial date sometime during 2019. I described that then, and still consider this to be, “a 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Century timetable”. Modern litigation has to be progressed in accordance with the Civil Procedure Rules, and Group Litigation in accordance with CPR Part 19. The whole ethos is to achieve efficient and cost-effective resolution of disputes. This Group Litigation simply cannot be allowed to drag on for years and years. It should also be remembered that the court does not make Group Litigation Orders lightly. Such an order can only be made with the express approval of the President of the Queen’s Bench Division. It is, to my mind, fanciful to imagine that such an order would be made unless there were reasonable grounds to conclude that there are common themes connecting all the different Claimants and their claims against the Post Office.  </p>

I do not consider that I have set, at any stage, an over-ambitious or exceptionally brisk timetable for the substantive hearings. In October 2017 I set down the first trial, to determine what are called “the Common Issues”, for November 2018, which was the earliest time that the parties told me they could be ready for such a trial. I also set down the next trial, for “the Horizon Issues”, for March 2019, at the same time. In early 2018 I informed the parties that the third trial would be likely to be held in the early summer of 2019, and this would most likely be the full trial of at least some of the Lead Claimants’ cases. The Post Office resisted Round 3 of the litigation (as it came to be called colloquially) being heard in 2019 at all, because it was said that this was too ambitious and would be unlikely to assist in resolving more than a few individual cases. The Post Office also regularly observes that resolution of issues would be unlikely to have wider application to other Claimants. It was necessary to move Round 3 to later in 2019, and that will now be taking place in November 2019, to deal with a number of other issues including limitation.  </p>

A good example of this is the fact that for these Common Issues, the Post Office submitted in paragraph 24 of its Opening Submissions that the six Lead Claimants’ cases should not be treated as representative of the other Claimants. I cannot accept that such an approach would be in the interests of anyone. In my judgment, it would be wholly counterproductive to the way that this Group Litigation </p>

Even on that intended timetable, some Claimants may be waiting far longer than is ideal to have their claims fully resolved either in their favour, or against them. Some of the Claimants are retired; some are elderly; some have (as I have said) criminal convictions under review by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. Nobody involved in this litigation is getting any younger as time passes.

In a sense, that sentence could be said to sum up a large area of the dispute between the parties. Is the Post Office entitled to rely upon such an inference concerning the technical functionality of the Horizon system? The full and final resolution of that question will have to wait for a later trial. However, the Post Office also accuses the Claimants of a “kitchen sink” approach to the many different contractual issues, and submits that the Claimants must be hoping that by casting their net particularly wide on an enormous number (for example) of implied terms, they might actually end up with something to which they </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The Post Office, in many instances with some vigour, pursued the shortfalls with different Claimants as accounting discrepancies for which those Claimants were contractually and legally responsible. The Claimants denied responsibility for them, and in all the Lead Cases, their evidence is that they did their best to investigate them but could not do so because of the way that Horizon operated, and because of the way that the Post Office behaved. The Lead Claimants all gave evidence that they had sought the assistance of the Post Office in getting to the bottom of the shortfalls. Not only did they not receive such assistance, Mr Bates as an example (who had prior experience in IT matters) asked for further training and was told he was not entitled to any.  </p>

In Mrs Stubbs’ case, notwithstanding her 27 years’ experience, service and prior record (both as assistant to her husband, who was originally the subpostmaster, and as sub-postmistress herself after he died), she found herself suspended and locked out of her Post Office. The Claimants also believe that the Post Office, over time, came to know about these difficulties with the Horizon system, but did not address them, did not publicise these problems, and actually expressly told them that there was nothing wrong with the Horizon system and that they were the only SPMs who were experiencing such difficulties.  </p>

Nor should this judgment be taken to be making any findings in fact concerning any particular allegations of breach by the Post Office. This judgment is concerned with the Common Issues. However, this cannot be done in complete hermetic isolation from any facts at all. The Post Office adopted a curious position so far as the Lead Claimants’ evidence of fact is concerned. Having failed to have that evidence struck out, and not having sought to appeal that order, Mr Cavender QC cross-examined on a great many aspects of it. The Post Office made submissions that some of the Lead Claimants were positively lying to the court (for instance Mr Abdulla), and were mistaken in fact as to contract documents provided prior to contract formation (for instance Mr Bates). However, at the same time, the Post Office urged me not to make findings as to credit. This appeared, on close examination during oral submissions, to amount to adopting a hybrid approach to witnesses, and an approach with which I am not familiar (nor can I find any authority). The Post Office was entitled to challenge the credit of the Lead Claimants, if it so chose, and it did. However, the Post Office seemed to want findings on that only if they were in the Post Office’s favour. This is a peculiarly one-way approach by any litigant.

Over the years, and prior to the issue of proceedings by the Claimants there was an action group formed, called Justice For Sub Postmasters Alliance (“JFSA”). Mr Bates was centrally involved in this. Encouraged by some Members of Parliament, an independent inquiry was set up by the Defendant using a specialist company called Second Sight Services Ltd (“Second Sight”) that ran from 2012 until 2015, when it was terminated by the Post Office for reasons that are currently unclear. Evidence was given to a Parliamentary Select Committee by the Chief Executive of the Post Office in February 2015. This was in relation to the Mediation Scheme funded by the Post Office that had run for a while jointly under the auspices of the Post Office, Second Sight and JFSA. That publicly funded scheme ended without resolving the issues between the Post Office and sub-postmasters involved, and was roundly criticised in an adjournment debate in the House of Commons. There have been various reports and documentaries in the media, including a BBC Panorama documentary entitled “Trouble at the Post Office” in August 2015. </p>

This transcript was then compiled into refined form by, usually, about 5.30pm each day, and that document would then be e mailed by the provider to the parties and the court in both PDF and Word form.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Another point with which I have to deal is what Mr Cavender QC for the Post Office described in Opening as a “challenge to the court”. He submitted that “one of the challenges to the court might be how it approaches that situation where its sympathies on one side might be in a certain sub-postmaster group in one direction and with a more commercial group in another”. It ought not to be necessary to state that no judge makes decisions based on personal sympathy. It also ought not to be necessary to recite that every party, and every witness, comes to the court at a substantive trial with a clean slate, regardless of the procedural history of the proceedings. This litigation is being tried by a judge and not a jury, but even juries are told (and are assumed) to make their decisions objectively and to put no personal emotion into the decisionmaking process. The Post Office may have made these submissions because, on an objective analysis, it fears objective scrutiny of its behaviour, or it may have made them for other reasons. Of the six Lead Claimants, three were chosen by the Post Office and three were chosen by those acting for the Claimants. Mrs Stubbs had a particular experience with the Post Office, and this was described by Mr Cavender as being “at one end of the spectrum”. He did not identify what that spectrum was, but I assume he meant her experience was an extreme one. Given she was presented with a document to sign in the branch post office the very day after her husband had died, when she was also asked to increase the opening hours of her branch, the Post Office may well be right. The Post Office cannot find the document she signed that day. I certainly hope none of the other Claimants had documents presented to them in such circumstances. I will deal with Mrs Stubbs’ individual circumstances in Part C which deals with the evidence of the Lead Claimants.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I would however add only this. Although the parties cannot agree on very much, they are agreed that the Post Office is an important national institution that provides a crucial service to society. They are agreed that in some rural communities, for example, the Post Office is the only way that individuals and businesses can access cash, banking services and financial services. The Post Office has explained that due to the size of its network, and the nature of the business transacted, it has to have “a very high degree of control” over what sub-postmasters do and how they do it. Because of the way that the parties approach the litigation, each of them prays these features in aid of why their answers to the Common Issues are to be preferred.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The first Common Issue, as will be seen, is whether the contracts between the Claimants and the Post Office are what is called “relational contracts”. This <span style="font-style:italic">might</span> prove to be one of the most important issues in the litigation, although whether that is correct or not cannot be prejudged at this stage. In my judgment, it is certainly one of the most important issues. Even if I do find that it is a relational contract, inevitably the parties are not agreed on what the effect of such a finding would be. But there is no separate set of legal rules for how the Post Office is entitled to contract with its sub-postmasters, simply because it is the Post Office, and vice versa.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">It would, in my judgment, be entirely wrong to start consideration of an issue such as whether the contracts are relational, by taking account of a risk said to lurk in the background that if the answer in this litigation is unfavourable to the Post Office, then the Post Office would no longer be able “to control” its network of branches, or that its business would as a result of such a finding come under “existential threat”. Commercial common sense comes into matters of contractual construction. Contractual arrangements involve apportionment of risk and reward between the different contracting parties. They also involve, by definition, parties agreeing to an arrangement between themselves in a particular way. The Post Office accuses the Claimants of seeking entirely “to rewrite the bargain that was struck”. Given at least some of those bargains were struck by sub-postmasters after others amongst the cohorts of Claimants say that they had brought to the attention of the Post Office itself their views concerning the functionality of Horizon, assertions about what bargains were in law struck, may well be heavily affected by the decision on whether these were relational contracts. It is also true (and the parties are agreed) that cash is used in the majority (or at least a great many) of the transactions performed in Post Office branches, and that sub-postmasters deal with that cash, and occupy a position of trust. There is an obvious element of trust involved in dealing with such transactions, and I consider that this is an important component of the parties’ relationship. However, the fact that trust is involved is not alone and in itself an answer to the different Common Issues. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">There are two different types of contracts that are under consideration. The first is the Sub-postmaster Contract, or SPMC. This was then modified in 2006 and became known as the Modified SPMC. The second is the Network Transformation Contract, or NTC. This model of contract became used after something called the Network Transformation Programme (“NTP”) which was initiated by the Post Office in 2011, firstly in pilot form. In general terms, the NTP involved rationalisation of the Post Office branch network. Some branches were closed and the incumbent subpostmasters and mistresses were paid compensation. These were called “compulsory exiters” and the compensation, which was 26 months’ remuneration, was paid from something called the Discretionary Fund. A significant number of SPMs – I am told about 2,700 - remained on the terms that governed their appointment before the NTP, and there are a great number whose terms of appointment are the terms in the NTC. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">New sub-postmasters were engaged on the terms in the NTC. There are two types of post office established under the NTP. One type was called “Main”, and these were larger branches. The other type was called “Local”, and these were smaller, more local post offices. There are no issues in this litigation, and no Claimants, governed by the Main NTC. There are many governed by the Local NTC. I will therefore use the description NTC to mean the terms of the NTC for Local Post Offices. There is also a contract called a Temporary Sub-postmaster Contract, although the terms of that did not feature to an appreciable degree in the evidence. In order to attempt to keep this judgment to a reasonable length, I have extracted many of the conditions in both the SPMC and the NTC into Appendices 1 and 2 respectively. I also only deal with the Modified SPMC (as opposed to the SPMC) where necessary. This should not be interpreted as not taking account of the full extent of all the clauses in all the contracts as required. Equally, a vast number of authorities were cited in argument, approximately 144 in total. I have read them all, but I only deal in this judgment with those I have found necessary to determine the Common Issues. For the clauses within each of the SPMC and the NTC, I shall use Section 1 Clause 1 for such a term within the SPMC; and Part 1 Paragraph 1 for a term within the NTC, to try to help avoid confusion. </p>

In closing submissions, the Post Office sought to persuade me that none of the evidence that I had refused to strike out was relevant to any of the Common Issues. The Post Office seemed to adopt an extraordinarily narrow approach to relevance, generally along the lines that any evidence that is unfavourable to the Post Office is not relevant. The Post Office adduced a significant quantity of evidence of its own to demonstrate (as it saw it) that (for example) Horizon training was perfectly well designed and adequate; on the other hand, it sought to keep out specific evidence by Lead Claimants of their own individual experiences of the training they had received.  </p>

He said he was “completely satisfied” that the document was “privileged for the dual purpose of being prepared for the dominant purpose of litigation and for the purpose of getting legal advice.” He submitted that “the question is to decide, in a dual purpose document, which parts are part of the privilege part and which parts can fairly fall outside it.  The privilege part is entitled to have a title, and it does.” This rather missed the fact that the title was the title of the whole document, including the title of the non-privileged part. It must be common ground that part of the working group’s activities were not privileged, as parts of the report were not privileged. It is difficult to see how the title of the Working Group itself could be privileged, given some of its workings, and part of its own report, were accepted as not being privileged. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">However, the assertion of privilege effectively brought this to an end. Legal professional privilege is conveniently referred to as being potentially of two types, namely legal advice privilege, and litigation privilege. The ethos that underpins this is equally applicable to both limbs, namely that any person is entitled to consult their lawyer in confidence. Where such privilege exists (and is not waived or abrogated) it is paramount and absolute.

However, that is the approach that the Post Office has taken and so I have put the name of X (which was shown on the electronic trial bundle document title anyway, which is why I described this at the time as a storm in a teacup) out of my mind. Other redactions are not quite so easily explained, and in my judgment demonstrate a culture of secrecy in the Post Office. I deal with this further at [120] below. </p>

Although I have read and considered all of the authorities and the arguments, I will not deal with each and every one of them in this judgment, which is likely to be far longer than ideal in any event.

This is called “footfall”. Also, customers of the retail business, whether that is (for example) a newsagents, small convenience shop or haberdashers, may decide to use the Post Office whilst doing non-Post Office related shopping. The SPM will therefore usually own, or at least lease, the retail premises, but operate the Post Office from within those premises.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">It can also be seen that the relevance of the Branch Trading Statement, which expressly forms part of Common Issues 13 (and also arises implicitly in respect of Common Issue 12(c)), is challenged by the Post Office, namely those numbered 32 and 36 above. This is part of how an individual SPM stated an account to the Post Office in order to move (what was called “roll over”) into the next Trading Period. The mechanics of how this was done and the choices of the SPM if he or she wished to dispute any shortfall, discrepancy or Transaction Correction (“TC”) issued on Horizon, is undoubtedly a part of the factual background to resolution of the Common Issues. This is not, in my judgment, to use post-contractual matters of fact to construe the terms of the contract. Indeed, when Mr Bates and Mrs Stubbs contracted with the Post Office, Horizon had not even been introduced. The whole of Horizon was postcontractual in that sense, for at least those two Lead Claimants. The Branch Trading Statement and how it was produced are undoubtedly of relevance to Common Issues 12 and 13.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The Post Office wished entirely to exclude, and made this very clear in closing, any evidence of how Horizon was actually operated in fact. The court had heard evidence and the Lead Claimants were cross examined on what they had in fact done, and how they could or did act when their problems arose. However, the Post Office submitted that none of that evidence was relevant to <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> of the Common Issues. I reject that, and in my judgment such evidence is plainly relevant to Common Issue 13.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">This can be tested in the following way. Common Issue 13 is to be answered for all the Lead Claimants at least (putting to one side the issue of Group Litigation and Common Issues being for the utility of resolving the whole litigation for all Claimants). Horizon did not exist when Mr Bates contracted with the Post Office; it was introduced in late 2000. It did however exist for Mr Sabir, and all the other Lead Claimants who came after him. I do not consider Common Issue 13 can properly be considered at all for Mr Bates without considering what he did in fact do, or the options that he in fact had, in respect of the Branch Trading Statement that was part of the Horizon regime. However, even if I am wrong about that, Horizon formed part of the factual matrix for all SPMs contracting after the year it was introduced in 2000. Further, I consider the same approach applies to each of the other Lead Claimants, even though (at its extreme for Mrs Dar and Mrs Stockdale) they contracted on the terms of the NTC and the Horizon system had been well in use by then, and had been for many years. I will therefore address, in outline terms only (as I am not in this judgment making any findings as to breach) the evidence of each of the Lead Claimants concerning how their shortfalls arose and how this affected what they did, and what they were told to do (on their evidence) by the Helpline. This is because it is relevant to the status of the Branch Trading Statement. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Because of the way that the Branch Trading Statement was produced, and my views as above which were expressed to the parties, I invited them at the closing submissions stage to agree at a high level (in a flow chart form if that could be done, using text alone if not) the different steps available to an SPM at the end of a trading period if a Transaction Correction (“TC”) were generated, and if there were a discrepancy shown on Horizon when a Branch Trading Statement was required. They did so, titling these Flowchart 1 and Flowchart 2 respectively, and additionally including some agreed notes. These documents are Appendix 3 and Appendix 4 to this judgment. This may have resolved some of the factual disputes between the parties that had existed during the cross-examination of the witnesses, but whether it has or not, I propose to deal with that evidence in any event.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Finally, before turning to the individual witnesses, the Post Office adopted a curious position on the credit of some witnesses. There were issues of fact between some of the Lead Claimants and the Post Office on matters that went to the Common Issues. For example, for Mr Bates it was in issue whether he actually received a copy of the SPMC before he took over the branch. For Mr Abdulla, the sequence of buttons and commands which would be pressed by him as a SPM at the end of a Trading Period to generate a Branch Trading Statement was also the subject of contested facts. Although the Post Office made submissions as to these witnesses’ credit – for example Mr Abdulla was said to have “lied frequently and brazenly” (in paragraph 592 of the Post Office’s Closing Submissions) and some of his evidence was said to be “new and obviously untrue” (paragraph 593) the Post Office in Closing Submissions initially invited me not to make findings on credit.  </p>

Some of the Common Issues are pure questions of construction. Some require an understanding of the Horizon and Post Office accounting process, such as Common Issue 13. Some, so far as they concern individual Lead Claimants such as Mr Bates, include issues of fact such as to whether he actually received a full copy of the SPMC. Where such issues of fact arise, I will deal with them. I will make no findings going to breach or causation, as they are not part of the Common Issues. </p>

The original version is a 1994 document, although based on a 1991 document (the date of document D2.1/1 in the trial bundle). Subsequent amendments were made to the 1994 document by the Post Office over time. There were also later versions produced in 2006. This document also existed in two different forms, termed the Standard SPMC and the Modified SPMC. It was the Modified SPMC that was the later version.  The Post Office has described the main difference between the Standard and Modified versions as being to the remuneration of the SPMs. The SPMC being used at the times relevant to Mr Bates and Mrs Stubbs was the 1994 Standard SPMC; other claimant SPMs would have contracted on its terms during the period prior to 2006. The version relevant to Mr Sabir is the 2006 Standard SPMC, and the version relevant to Mr Abdulla is the 2006 Modified SPMC. The way in which these contracts were amended was very difficult to follow. The list of amendments (the Claimants refer to them as variations) which were issued by the Post Office were not made within the body of the document, they were listed at the front. Also, each separate section (and in the 1994 Standard SPMC, prior to any amendments, there were 23 such sections from Section 1 “Contract and Status” to Section 23 “Counter Automation”) had within that section a number of appendices. Given the number of amendments made over the years, these became extraordinarily numerous. In the 2006 Standard SPMC, before one even reached the provisions of Section 1, there were over 40 pages of amendments listed at the front of the document. The 1994 SPMC was 113 pages long. The 2006 Modified SPMC was 109 pages long.  </p>

It was not contentious between the parties that the Post Office was most careful to ensure that its SPMs were not seen as employees. Mr Green put to a number of the Post Office witnesses that this was a “sensitive subject”, and those to whom the point was put, agreed with that. SPMs were therefore not made redundant as part of the Network Transformation Programme or NTP. They were however entitled, if they so wished, to accept compensation and to decide no longer to operate their Post Office branch on the same terms as before, namely under the SPMC.

If the transaction is considered as a whole, the purchase monies included property; business assets such as goodwill, stock and fittings of or for the non-Post Office business; and business assets such as goodwill and fixtures and fittings of and for the Post Office. The Post Office stock did not belong to Mr Savage, so he could not sell that to Mr Bates. Mr Bates told me that the business had the potential to grow, although the existing figures were what he described as “acceptable”. The presence of the branch Post Office was an important factor, and the remuneration from the Post Office (which he was told about by Mr Savage) was an important consideration for him. This was in the order of approximately £36,000 in 1993 and 1994, rose to £44,000 in 1995 and then fell in 1996 to £39,000. This was shown in Mr Savage’s accounts as “Post Office salary”. Mr Bates also took comfort from the fact that there was a large measure of security from running a branch Post Office.  </p>

However, the way in which the presence of a Post Office could assist in an associated retail business was appreciated by the incoming SPMs, and the existence of income from being a SPM was attractive. They were however required, as a component of everyday commercial life, to purchase (whether including a leasehold or freehold interest) the existing business, if they were taking over an existing Post Office.

Firstly, Mr Savage did not provide Mr Bates with a copy of, or show him, Mr Savage’s contract with the Post Office. There is no reason why he should have done so, or why Mr Bates should have expected this. I deal below with the particular facts of Mr Bates in terms of the way that the Post Office did (in terms of Mr Bates) and would (in terms of SPMs generally) behave concerning the SPMC, based on the evidence in this trial.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The other feature is that Mr Savage kept a tin in the safe for what he called “unders and overs”. This was to deal with any shortages or “overs” in the cash accounting. Although Mr Bates thought this odd, it would undoubtedly (both on its own, and together with the examples given in interview by the Post Office with which I deal below) have given the impression to any reasonably diligent incoming SPM that such shortages would be of the order of the petty cash variety, in other words modest sums. One year of Mr Savage’s accounts, namely 1993, had an entry “Post Office shortages” in the sum of £208. 1994 had no such entry, and neither did the years 1995 </p>

	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">or 1996. The Post Office seemed to set great store in the cross examination of Mr Bates as to what the entry for £208 in that year represented. Mr Bates said that this was a “quite a small amount in there for a busy office and a busy business”. Another way of expressing this – although these are my terms – is that shortfalls in accounting of this order were modest. In terms of percentage of the remuneration coming from the Post Office, the “shortage” in the account for one year was about 0.5% of that year’s Post Office income of £36,341. It only showed in one year of the accounts, and the fact that Mr Savage could deal with the shortages by using a tin supports that any such items would be limited to a couple of hundred pounds over the course of a year at most, and more usually of a petty cash variety.  </p>

Also, the Post Office would only, for the first year, pay an incoming SPM 75% of what would ordinarily, otherwise be paid. The 25% deduction was not deferred or paid in other ways; it was simply the practice of the Post Office to deduct or keep that 25% in the first year. The rationale or economic justification for this is not entirely clear, but it was effectively a payment from the SPM to the Post Office (in Mr Bates’ case, of approximately £9,500) to become a SPM. The ARS 44 below states it was to “reflect uncertainty and risk to” the Post Office. It is not entirely clear what that “uncertainty and risk” would be, but the money was deducted for the first year only. </p>

Whether he did or not, there is an issue in the litigation generally because according to Mr Bates, a significant number of Claimants are in the same position as he is regarding not having had a copy of the SPMC prior to contracting with the Post Office. Regardless of the exact number of Claimants who are affected by this, the parties are agreed that I should deal with the contractual consequences on either basis. In other words, even if I find Mr Bates did have a copy and contracted on those terms on 31 March 1998, I should set out what the situation would be if he did not, and vice versa.  </p>

Neither of those SPMs seem to have been told this, however. It was just expected by the Post Office that this was how an incoming SPM should obtain and consider this important document, and these details, in advance of Letter of Appointment being sent out. The rationale for this seems to have been one of administrative ease for the Post Office. It seems to have been considered that the easiest way for the incoming SPM to look at the terms of the SPMC was to leave it to the SPMs to sort out between themselves. However, there is no evidence that an outgoing SPM either knew or was told that that this was one of the things they were supposed to do; further, they may have lost or mislaid their copy (even if they had retained it); still further, they may have been in post for some years and hence may well have had an older version than the then-current one. Yet further, there was no step in the process whereby the Post Office either checked this had happened, or even addressed its mind to the incoming SPM being given notice of the terms of the SPMC at all. Such an approach would have been extraordinarily lackadaisical in my judgment in any event, but when it is combined with the lack of any written direction to the incoming SPM that this was expected or required, it goes beyond lackadaisical to being wholly inadequate. </p>

The length of time since the events in question was also relied upon by the Post Office as supporting this challenge to the accuracy of his evidence. The Post Office also submitted that Mr Bates could not differentiate between his evidence of fact (which he must have come to believe over the years as being true) and his motivation as a campaigner against the Post Office. I reject that criticism of his evidence. Mr Bates seemed to me to give his evidence honestly and carefully, and if he could not remember some details, he would accept this. The Post Office also made two points that, it was submitted, undermined Mr Bates’ claim that no copy of the SPMC was sent to Mr Bates.  </p>

Also, it was said Mr Bates was “a details man” and would have noted there was no document headed “standard Subpostmasters Contract” or “standard Subpostmasters Contract for services at scale payment offices” enclosed, and he could have asked for another copy had it not been included. It was also said that in later correspondence in August 1998 he must have had a copy because he referred to some of its terms as “wordy” and “tucked away” and that only made sense if he had received the actual SPMC.

Even if he did, this post-dated contract formation. I find that the contract was formed on 31 March 1998 on the terms of what was enclosed with the Letter of Appointment. A reasonably diligent person in receipt of the documents that Mr Bates says he received with the Letter of Appointment could quite easily have mistaken the reference to the “standard Subpostmasters Contract” as being either the 2 page document entitled “CRAIG Y DON – CONDITIONS OF APPOINTMENT”, or the 4 page document entitled “CONDITIONS OF APPOINTMENT FOR CRAIG Y DON </p>

It also stated that enclosed were “two copies of a list of the main conditions attached to your appointment.” It asked Mr Bates to “confirm [his] acceptance of these conditions by signing one copy”. It did not make any reference to a fourth document, either by title, or by saying there was another important document enclosed, or by saying there was a fourth document included in the package. The Post Office put to Mr Bates that the letter made clear he should have received three documents, and he explained that he had. Two copies of what Mr Cavender referred to as the “main conditions” – the 4 page document, one of which Mr Bates had to sign and return – and another document which was 2 pages long. There is nothing to suggest that any reader of the letter would expect to find four documents in the envelope. Mr Bates therefore had no knowledge that there was another document the Post Office intended to include, which, given his evidence it was missing, he was on notice existed and which he should have requested specifically if it were not included. For the Post Office’s case on this to have had any basis in reality, there would have to be something in the letter or the accompanying documents that suggested there should be four documents in the envelope.  </p>

The Post Office, by what appears to have been a combination of historical evolution of the appointment of SPMs and the lackadaisical approach to formation of contractual relations to which I have referred, has found itself in the position whereby its own Letter of Appointment did not expressly refer to the SPMC at all, either by title, or by inclusion in the number of documents which that letter said were enclosed. Nor did the Letter of Appointment even use the normal approach of many business letters and state “Enclosures:” or even “Enc:” followed by the documents that were supposed to be included. I find that the 2 page document was enclosed in the envelope with the Letter of Appointment as Mr Bates explained to me, and even though the Post Office maintains that if this were done (which I find it was) this was in error, there was nothing in the documentation to bring that error (if error it was) to the attention of Mr Bates. I also find that the SPMC itself was not sent to Mr Bates.  </p>

I have carefully considered all the Post Office evidence on this subject (although I deal with the Post Office witnesses later in this judgment) and my conclusion is that I am not being unfair to the Post Office at all by describing it as haphazard. Indeed, any of these synonyms would apply equally well. Given communication and notification of terms is an important element for contract formation in this jurisdiction, the method being used at that time by the Post Office was simply not fit for purpose.

Firstly it is the liability I am accepting by default in agreeing to put money in if the system shows short, while there is no report writer package to assist me track transactions. Secondly is the concern that the system does not actually log what the weeks' shortage or over was or how it was arrived at anywhere on the documentation we print out and keep. Although at one point the information does appear on the screen, that information is lost the moment we 'roll over'. At least with the current way we are finishing our balance we can track from week to week our position and know where the office stands at any one time. </p>

During that time Mr Bates wrote letters addressed to specific individuals who he had been told were dealing with the matter, and these did not even gain a simple acknowledgement.

The Post Office’s response, eventually, at least so far as Mr Bates was concerned, was to write off the amount that could not be explained in this instance only, but to say that this was effectively a one-off solution and move on as though nothing was amiss.  </p>

If the Post Office did in reality do what Mr Bates suggests they did – namely bury their heads in the sand, press on regardless, and chase numerous SPMs for shortfalls and discrepancies caused by the Horizon system – then that would be behaviour of an extraordinary kind, and given the criminal implications for some SPMs, may be extraordinarily serious. On the other hand, Mr Bates’ shortfall in December 2000 may, upon investigation by the Post Office, have been put down to early difficulties by SPMs in operating or understanding the new system and writing off the amount may have been decided upon as a pragmatic solution in the circumstances. I make no findings either way at this stage of the proceedings in this judgment. </p>

No litigant is obliged to accept the factual evidence against it, and is entitled to test and challenge that evidence when it is in dispute, and that is what the Post Office did. Mr Bates’ evidence that he did not receive a copy of the SPMC with the Letter of Appointment was described as implausible, and his assertion in this respect was said to be wholly unconvincing. Because he was a details man (he had once complained of a modest under-delivery of stamps) it was said he would surely have noticed the SPMC was not in the same envelope. He was subjected to a sustained attack. Other terms used by the Post Office to describe his evidence were risible, meaningless, nonsensical and weak. It was said he was giving evidence that was plainly wrong, but had convinced himself of the truth of his own account after years of campaigning.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">One specific example of this attack upon him as having a campaigning approach related to non-receipt of the SPMC. Mr Bates’ evidence was that his experience was not out of the ordinary, and there was a large number of SPMs who fell into the same category. He said approaching half of those who had participated in the Second Sight Mediation Scheme (before the Post Office withdrew from it) had the same problem. He had been on the Working Group and they had been given regular updates. It was put to him that this “was just not right”. His answer was rather precise, and he is no doubt a man with a considerable grasp of detail. He said from memory that about 62 of the 137 or 139 SPMs still involved in that scheme by its end had not received the full SPMC. Although this was initially challenged by the Post Office as being mere campaigning on his part, it was (after some research) accepted that 62 of the number of participants (which was either 137/138 or 150) had ticked a box that said “Issues with contract”, which may amount to the same thing.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I reject the criticisms made by the Post Office of Mr Bates and his evidence. I find that his evidence was careful, and he was an honest, thorough and reliable witness. Where he could not remember he would say so, and he would accept sensible points put to him if they were factually correct. Many of them were not, for example the number of SPMs in the Second Sight scheme who had problems with their contract. He is undoubtedly committed to resolving this dispute, and given the length of time he has been involved, he must have a degree of stamina and endurance that most people would not possess. The Post Office subjectively might view him as unreasonable or stubborn, as he simply refuses to let this matter drop, and has obviously over the years involved himself in the campaign to resolve these issues. Mr Bates has, from about December 2000 onwards, proved himself to be a considerable irritant to the Post Office so far as the Horizon affair is concerned. He was an irritant to them in 2001 when he simply refused, point blank, to pay the £1,000 odd demanded of him (that sum ultimately being written off by the Post Office the following year). He had undoubtedly continued to be an irritant to the Post Office from then on, both from the establishment of the JFSA onwards. He is persistent and no doubt possesses what might be termed staying power. There was nothing unreasonable or stubborn in his evidence before me, and none of the pejorative terms deployed by the Post Office to describe his evidence are justified, in my judgment. The Post Office must have decided to attack him because the whole case of the Post Office requires an assumption or acceptance that the predominant, or only, cause of shortfalls is fault (or worse) on the part of SPMs. The case by the Post Office is that careful and/or diligent and/or honest SPMs and/or their assistants do not experience shortfalls. Therefore, so far as the Post Office is concerned, in each branch where such shortfalls occurred, either the Claimants and/or their assistants must have at least some, and potentially all, of those characteristics. If it were otherwise, the Post Office edifice would run the risk of collapse.  </p>

So far as Mr Bates is concerned, I found his evidence before me reliable and I accept it. That is not to say that, when his case comes to be fully tried out, his evidence on all the other issues still to come will be wholly accepted, or that the Post Office will not be entitled to challenge his credit in all respects as their advisers see fit. I will judge all those other issues on all the evidence before me on those issues. In particular, the Post Office cross-examined Mr Bates upon the estimate of his loss of earnings in his Amended Schedule of Information. This subject did not form part of the Common Issues, and had not formed part of Mr Bates’ evidence in chief. Although, as a result of the questions put by the Post Office and the answers given by Mr Bates, this subject technically formed part of the evidence in this trial, I make no findings in respect of that topic which will be dealt with in a later trial. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Mrs Pamela Stubbs’ branch was Barkham, Wokingham in Berkshire. She had been a teacher in Twickenham, and her husband Martin was an Assistant Bank Manager. In 1986 Mr Stubbs took early retirement from the bank where he worked, and the two of them decided to look into obtaining a Post Office branch. They purchased the branch in Barkham in February 1987 for £185,000, which included a general store (which was the associated retail business) and residential accommodation, as well as the Post Office. Mr Stubbs was the SPM there for 13 years, and for 12 years of that period Mrs Stubbs worked as an assistant to him in the branch. There was also another assistant who worked two days per week. Mrs Stubbs is now retired. She was a district councillor prior to her cessation as a SPM, which occurred in the circumstances which I describe below. She became the SPM at Barkham from 4 August 1999 in circumstances described below, and was in that role until 8 June 2010. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Stubbs died on 3 August 1999, and prior to that from September 1998 he had been ill in hospital. Mrs Stubbs, together with the assistant, ran the branch together during that period, although Mr Stubbs remained the SPM. Weekly stock and cash balances were done by Mrs Stubbs and her assistant in the same manner as Mr Stubbs had done. Mr Stubbs had used Capture, the same system that Mr Savage (who sold his business to Mr Bates) had used. There was an audit by the Post Office in April 1998 and this had shown a shortfall of £13.69 and a surplus of 21p. Mrs Stubbs’ evidence was that “disparities of this nature happened on occasion”; she also told me that her husband was meticulous. His time at the bank was such that balances were done every day, and if a single teller was a single penny out, the whole banking floor would have to remain until the shortfall was reconciled. Rather than keeping a tin for “unders and overs” – which was Mr Bates’ evidence concerning his predecessor – the Stubbs used an envelope in the safe for any “overs”, although given Mr Stubbs’ experience he (and also Mrs Stubbs) tried to avoid such disparities at all. During the illness of Mr Stubbs, Mrs Stubbs was to all intents and purposes running the branch herself.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">There are issues between the parties about the terms upon which Mrs Stubbs was appointed to be the SPM at Barkham. The Post Office has no record of Mr Stubbs being appointed at Barkham in 1987. The Post Office put to Mrs Stubbs in crossexamination that she must have had access to her husband’s copy of the SPMC, which approach suffers from three major difficulties, in my judgment. Firstly, it assumes that the outgoing SPM at Barkham in 1987 complied with the unwritten, and potentially misunderstood and ad hoc procedure I have explained already, whereby the Post Office could simply assume that the outgoing SPM would comply with the unexpressed desire of the Post Office to do this in any event in respect of Mr Stubbs when <span style="font-style:italic">he</span> became the SPM. Without that, there would no reason to suppose that a copy of the SPMC was provided to Mr Stubbs, explained or referred to in his appointment, or that one would necessarily be in the branch at all. There is no evidence to suggest that Mr Stubbs had a copy of the SPMC in the first place. Secondly, it assumes that Mrs Stubbs would and should (and could) be expected to have familiarised herself with the contents of the SPMC simply because her husband may have had it some years earlier, and thereby it must have been available to her. Not only is there no evidence that she did or that it was, but her specific and direct evidence was directly to the contrary. She said she had never seen it prior to her leaving her branch, and I </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">accept that. I also find that had it been in the branch she would have seen it. Thirdly, in what I consider to be an outdated attitude in the 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> century, the Post Office attempts to fix a married lady with imputed knowledge of detailed terms and conditions simply because of something attributed to her husband. This is a surprising approach in itself, but particularly so given there is no evidence of whether her husband had notice of the detailed terms and conditions in any event.  </p>

Her husband died on 3 August 1999, and the following day she opened the branch, as her assistant had offered to work that day to avoid her having to close it due to her bereavement. A number of people called to see Mrs Stubbs, including Mr Colin Woolbridge, the Post Office area manager. He did this to be supportive. She had an informal discussion with him about continuing with the branch and becoming the SPM herself. He did not discuss any legal details with her, nor did he refer to any potential entitlement she may have to “Death in Service” benefits due to her husband’s death. He did not refer to her responsibility for losses. He suggested increasing the opening hours, which she politely declined, as she wished to continue what was the traditional half day closing on Wednesdays. She remembers signing a single document that day, and believes that it was one which provided her bank details, as she recalled the Post Office did commence paying her, but with incorrect PAYE deductions as though she were an employee. This latter point took some months to rectify. There was no deduction of 25% during the first 12 months of her service, the only deductions from the amount she was expecting were the incorrect PAYE ones.  </p>

The Post Office has no copy of any documents signed by her husband in any event, so the terms upon which he was engaged are somewhat unclear, and the Post Office does not have any copy of the document she signed on 4 August 1999 either. The Post Office relies upon a letter dated 23 September 1999 said to be from Mr Woolbridge to Mrs Stubbs to justify its case that her date of contract was 23 September 1999.

It is unclear to me how someone can be expected to ask for a copy of something that they do not know exists. I am aware that there are many SPMs across the country, and some of them will have been in post for many years, but documents signifying their acceptance of terms and the contracts upon which they are engaged should not simply become “lost” because they are a number of years ago. I reject this explanation. Further, on the evidence that emerged before me in this trial concerning the SPMC, the procedure adopted by the Post Office was far from organised or even, I have to say, particularly competent. Even the letter of 23 September 1999 upon which the Post Office relies refers to events that simply did not happen. Mrs Stubbs did not submit an application, and there was no transfer of cash and stock to her on 4 August 1999. Even if she had received the letter of 23 September 1999 – and I find that she did not – that sought express notification of acceptance by asking “would you kindly confirm your acceptance of these conditions by signing one copy and returning it” and Mrs Stubbs did not do this.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I accept Mrs Stubbs’ evidence, and I find that the only document she was given or signed on 4 August 1999 was a single sheet document in respect of her bank details. There was no reference to her on 4 August 1999 orally, or in any document provided to her, of other more detailed terms that were to come later, or that were said at the time by Mr Woolbridge to govern her appointment. It is unnecessary to consider Mr Woolbridge’s motives in acting as I have found he did on 4 August 1999, and it would not be fair to him to do so without further evidence, including from him if that were to occur. He may have acted as he did out of a desire to keep the paperwork for Mrs Stubbs to an absolute minimum given her husband had died the day before, or it may have been lack of administrative competence, or any number of other possible explanations. I am surprised that he thought it appropriate to ask someone whose husband had died the very day before, to increase their opening hours, but he may have been under instructions to do this. The date of the letter with his name on, which I have found was not received by Mrs Stubbs – in addition to her evidence on this, there is no version available actually signed by him either – does not much help the </p>

I find that the contract between Mrs Stubbs and the Post Office was formed on 4 August 1999, when Mr Woolbridge (who plainly had the authority to bind the Post Office in this respect, as shown from the fact that the letter of 23 September 1999 was to come from him) agreed on behalf of the Post Office that she would become the SPM at the Barkham Sub Post Office, and would be paid for doing so. She was not told she would be an agent of the Post Office. She was aware of her responsibility for losses. I am surprised that, if Mrs Stubbs was entitled to any Death in Service benefits, these were not explained to her, but it may be that is or is not contentious, and this is or is not explored further in a later trial.  </p>

Mrs Stubbs was therefore, on my findings, appointed without knowledge on her part of the actual terms of the SPMC or its existence. I deal with the significance in terms of her contractual terms below. Her annual level of remuneration was approximately £30,000 depending upon the volume of business. </p>

Information that fed into the balance of her branch accounts was inputted by the Post Office (she does not know whether automatically or manually) and to use her expression, “she could not see data relating to back office processes, such as changes to local suspense accounts and other transactions or entries put in by the Post Office”. She lost the ability to go back and check transactions to see if or where any mistakes had occurred. Cash remittances were accounted for somewhere at the Post Office by entries that she would not have seen. Other changes were the trading period became 4 weekly rather than weekly, and the trading statement (which is the Branch Trading Statement referred to in the Common Issues) simply had totals and not itemised information, so that it was not possible to identify any underlying mistakes in the figures that may have arisen. </p>

It took place in a pub in Sonning, Berkshire. She had two assistants at the time and they each had half a day’s training. There were about 12 to 15 other SPMs at the training, which comprised how to work through example customer transactions. The training did include balancing, but did not include shortfalls, how to get to the root cause of them, or how they should be disputed. She was told she should contact the Helpline for any help or advice on any issues experienced at the branch. She was disappointed with the quality of the training and did not request any more. It was not explained to her that she was responsible for training her assistants, although she did so in an “on the job” manner. </p>

On one day alone there were 36 power outages. Fluctuating shortfalls and gains started to occur and overall there was an unexplained loss of £1,000. Mrs Stubbs paid these to the Post Office out of her own funds. Disclosure in these proceedings has led to some internal e mails from this period becoming available in the following terms.

This was when Mrs Stubbs made a decision to carry out extensive works to the branch as it was in poor condition and required overdue renovations. She was approaching retirement age and wanted to sell the property, and considered she would gain a better return if she did these works first. She wanted the branch and shop to remain open, so disregarded the prospect of selling the site purely for development. She promised her customers she would remain open during the works and therefore arranged with the Post Office that they would provide a single counter position portacabin (although she had wanted a double counter position). She was proposing to spend £125,000 on the works to the branch (excluding other works </p>

She paid for the Post Office equipment to be moved to the portacabin, and the weekly charge for that was £125 plus VAT. The Horizon equipment was removed from the existing branch counter and relocated in the portacabin, but as this had only one position the other terminal was stored. In the Activity Schedule sent by Craig Knowles the Post Office Network Change Adviser to Mrs Stubbs on 14 September 2009, this was to be done by a Post Office contractor called Romec NPG.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Mrs Stubbs has, since leaving the Post Office, involved her Member of Parliament, The Right Honourable Sir John Redwood, who is now a backbench MP but has previously been a cabinet minister in the Government of Prime Minister John Major. At the very least, the Post Office maintains – or at least it did, when she was crossexamined – that it performed “an investigation”. Mrs Stubbs says she has never seen the outcome of any investigation into these matters; and her MP who intervened on her behalf, whom Mrs Stubbs said was promised “a full investigation” by the Post Office, has never been provided with any results either. It might be thought that if there were any proper investigation which actually reported on this, it could and should have been put to Mrs Stubbs, but if what was put to Mrs Stubbs in this trial is said by the Post Office to amount to such an investigation, then it is telling. The “investigation” appears, on the material deployed in this Common Issues trial, to have consisted of nothing more than Fujitsu asserting that there was “nothing wrong with the kit”. That is not, in my judgment, an investigation under any normal understanding or meaning of that word in society generally. The Post Office’s way of dealing with this wholly ignores the provision in the SPMC and a SPM’s liability for losses in that document (which on the Post Office’s case is what applied).  There was simply a blanket assertion by the Post Office that she had to pay these sums. The suggestion that there was any investigation is not made out on the documents produced and put to her during her evidence.  </p>

These include the sum of £9,033 which was the subject of the email of Mr Kellett of 11 February 2010 saying it was “on hold”. The temporary SPM who replaced her in the immediate term told her that the Post Office had instructed him to destroy all paperwork that was in the Branch that related to her appointment. The reason for that instruction to destroy documents is wholly unclear, and in my judgment, I cannot conceive of any justifiable reason to destroy such documents.  </p>

She operated this branch together with her husband for 12 years, and discrepancies were, if they occurred at all, measured in single pounds or even pennies. She operated this branch as the SPM for over ten years, and the only times there were discrepancies of a higher order were when there were electrical power issues in 2000 which personnel at the Post Office concluded were caused by Horizon. She was not told this, and made up the shortfall herself. She then operated for another nine years perfectly satisfactorily, until the move to the portacabin. From November 2009 losses appeared. Not only did losses then continue, they appeared in sizeable amounts and accumulated to staggering levels. Over the Christmas and New Year period, when the branch had been closed for some days, they jumped up to over £9,000, when she knew that this amount of cash unaccounted for simply could not be possible. She obtained all the information she could, including from Horizon, and prepared hand written accounts to investigate. She could not get to the bottom of it, and in the period during 2010 until she resigned (having been told she had to do so in order to market her branch) these losses climbed higher and higher.  </p>

I was able to review the data printable from the Horizon system, but I could not interrogate it without access to the data that Post Office held or had access to. When you are looking for a reason for an error, you need to have all the information. I explained to Post Office on a number of occasions that I needed to be able to compare the data held on my Horizon system, with the data held at Fujistu / Post Office's head office. However, as I mention above, it was not until I saw some limited ARQ data, that I realised it contained some entries that were not accessible or viewable by a Subpostmaster. There is simply nothing you can do if you do not have sight of the other end of the transactions - particularly if the person who does is requiring you to find and prove the cause of the problem. The transaction logs gave me no more information than was showing on the Horizon system so I was unable to investigate further.” </p>

None of the Post Office personnel involved at the time with Mrs Stubbs, who attempted to obtain some input or explanation from Fujitsu were called as witnesses, so it is not possible to know what their full involvement was, the extent of their knowledge of the background matters, how many other SPMs they knew of may have had similar issues, nor the degree to which they considered Mrs Stubbs’ good record of over two decades (including her involvement when her husband was alive) to be relevant. I make it quite clear that I do not speculate on any of that. Nor is it possible to know what the outcome of the trial of the Horizon Issues will be later this year. Mrs Stubbs ran the branch perfectly satisfactorily for many years, with the exception of the periods that coincided with the electricity supply problems in 2000, and the move into the portacabin in 2009.

I reject that criticism of Mr Sabir. There were occasions when he did not fully understand a question, and he would sometimes ask for it to be repeated, or state that he did not understand it. This was not in any way his fault, nor do I consider it to be a device. His vocabulary is simply not as comprehensive as that of Leading Counsel for the Post Office. It is easy to forget that most people do not use language, and are not exposed to language, in the same way as those who spend their professional life in court. Further, commercial practitioners spend an enormous amount of time reading and construing detailed commercial instruments, and drafting detailed submissions. Their sentence structure and use of language is sophisticated, and not the same as those whose use of vocabulary is more everyday in nature. One phrase Mr Sabir had difficulty with was when asked if he was “commercially naïve”. There are many people, for whom English is their only language, who might not understand that expression, although it is regularly used in commercial cases. </p>

They were also told – in Appendix 2 - to read it before Appendix 1, which included the branch specific conditions, was signed and sent back. However, this improvement, such as it was, on the evidence before me, still did not amount to requiring an incoming SPM to sign the actual SPMC itself and therefore clearly acknowledge it had been received. Mr Sabir does not know if he received it, and the Post Office cannot produce a signed copy. This is because the Post Office never expected to receive a signed SPMC back from a SPM. It was not part of the procedure for it to be signed. </p>

None of the actual terms of the SPMC were brought to his specific attention with the exception of the notice period for resignation. Therefore, the answer to Common Issue 5 in his case depends upon the nature of the terms themselves, how and if they were incorporated, as well as considerations of reasonableness if they were.

It was however useful. Nobody in the classroom at the end of the training could, as he put it, “balance was OK when we came to do the final thing”. This means that nobody in that session could balance correctly at the end of the training. Certainly Mr Sabir could not. He also had training in the branch, but again he did not consider this enough, and the trainer just stood behind and observed. During the first week he was in the branch, on balance day the branch stayed open late until 9.00pm due to the National Lottery, but the trainer left at lunchtime (selfevidently well before the end of the day) and said to him “just follow the procedure and do it”. Mr Sabir’s evidence on this, which I accept, matches the other evidence from other Lead Claimants about in-branch training. Whatever the intentions of those who designed such training, which one supposes was to supplement and build on the classroom training, in practice for these Lead Claimants it was rather different. It is characterised by the trainers observing rather than training, and also by early departures from the branch itself by the trainers. I do however make those comments without making findings on anything to do with breach, causation or loss. </p>

On branch transfer day, which was 8 September 2006 for Cottingley, the auditors came in to do a closing balance. Documents were not explained to him by the auditors, and he was neither offered nor asked for more time to read any of them. He was given no explanation of them and was just provided documents to sign, which he did. The auditors did everything, counting, balancing, including counting stamps and tickets. Mr Sabir was satisfied that they were “on his side” and doing everything for his benefit, but he was not involved in performing the audit.

His branch was subject to a fraud whereby a customer deposited some funds and falsified an entry in the paying-in book, by persuading or hoodwinking his assistant to stamp the next page in the book, and using this with his bank to claim he had deposited £2,548 that had not (in reality) been credited by him. The Post Office simply told Mr Sabir that he would have to pay this money. He felt he had no support or assistance in trying to challenge this with the customer’s bank. </p>

As most people will know, these are purchased by those interested in games of chance, and panels on the cards are “scratched” off. If the symbols revealed are of the same type or of a particular combination, the purchaser wins a prize of varying value depending upon the symbols. Mr Sabir found that he repeatedly had discrepancies, with Horizon showing what he described as “an apparent surplus of stock” in his accounts. He eventually found that although his assistant should have been clicking “stock in” on the Horizon terminal when scratch cards were activated, she had been clicking “stock out” instead. This meant that Horizon was recording a different number of scratch cards than were actually present in the branch.  </p>

He could not correct the entries himself and so he sought help from the Helpline.

He had reported this himself to the Post Office and had a reference number for this, and also expressly asked for and was awaiting help. That help simply never came. The auditors confirmed that was this discrepancy, which is just a different way of saying that they discovered that what he had already notified the Post Office was true.

An element of this case that arises in the Common Issues is the accounting performed by the SPMs, and this is included within Common Issues 11, 12 and 13. In order, for example, to commence a new Trading Period an account has to be closed off for the existing period. If there were a Transaction Correction a SPM would eventually reach a point in the flow chart where to proceed the SPM would have to select a box that stated “Accept Now”. This would have to be done in order to move into the next Trading Period. Appendix 3 to this judgment shows that a dispute to such a Transaction Correction, if it were disputed, could be raised by telephoning the Helpline (“NBSC” in the appendix). However, this would occur <span style="font-style:italic">after </span>clicking “Accept Now”, which effectively means that disputed items would still form part of the Branch Trading Statement, which is what the Post Office maintains is the agent’s account.  </p>

Thereafter, the SPM prints from Horizon a “stock unit balance snapshot” which allows the SPM to check the stock/cash which is in the branch against the stock/cash which Horizon states should be in the branch. This process is called balancing the stock units. Transaction Corrections were brought in, in 2005. Prior to that they were called Error Notices, but there was only limited evidence about these, and they were not dealt with in the Horizon system in the same way. The Common Issues trial concentrated upon Transaction Corrections. </p>

The options are therefore “making good” or “settle centrally”.  </p>

It was put to him (as it had to be, given it was the Post Office’s case) that he had misaccounted for his stock because the number of scratch cards he was stating he had, was a different number to the ones he actually had in his branch. Given that this was rather Mr Sabir’s point, the degree to which the Post Office concentrated upon it was surprising.

Both these letters mis-stated the contractual obligation upon SPMs under the SPMC. A letter of 10 January 2010 told him that “you are contractually obliged to make good any losses incurred during your term of office for up to six years after your last day of service (Limitations Act 1980)”. The period under the Limitation Act is correct. The claim that he had to make good “<span style="text-decoration:underline">any losses</span> incurred during your term of office” is simply wrong in fact and law, and does not even represent the Post Office’s own case on liability in the Common Issues trial for losses in the SPMC. The letter before action of 1 March 2010 stated that “under the contract for services you are responsible for all losses occurring as a result of the acts or omissions of yourself or your assistants.” This, again, is wrong, and this letter specifically threatens legal action as the next step.   </p>

This Act provides that that any witness or any person who is in legal proceedings, that are not criminal proceedings, is entitled to refuse to answer a question if they think that to do so would tend to expose them to proceedings for a criminal offence or recovery of a penalty. It is more a statement and reminder of a person’s legal rights rather than a warning in the strict sense of the word, but I satisfied myself that Mr Abdulla fully understood. He could, if he chose, invoke this privilege against self-incrimination by declining to answer a question put to him during his cross-examination by Mr Cavender. The reason for making it clear to Mr Abdulla that he had this right was because of the extent of his evidence, and the points which the Post Office wished to challenge. The Post Office had interviewed him in 2009 about serious matters, leading to his suspension and termination. These were namely misuse of Post Office funds and false accounting. Both of these are criminal offences, potentially having been committed by Mr Abdulla (on the Post Office’s case), and he was cross-examined about the interview. Mr Abdulla did however answer all the questions put to him, and did not decline to answer any, even though he was entitled to do so and understood this. </p>

From 2000 he had been a medical sales representative for two different companies until he became an SPM. He had been successful in this field, but had been previously made redundant, and considered his existing career as a sales representative not to be stable. There was discussion about potential redundancies at his second medical sales employer in 2006, and he did not want to go through that experience a second time. He was familiar with basic sales and marketing software, as well as Word and Excel, which are Microsoft Office programs (or as they are now sometimes called, applications). His parents had run a Post Office in the early to mid-1990s and had been successful. They had experienced no problems in doing so, and had made a good income, nor had they encountered difficulties dealing with the Post Office. He described himself during that period as ambitious, self-confident and motivated, which I consider are qualities often found in successful sales people. He obviously must have felt he could succeed in running his own business, and he wished to do so.  </p>

If settled centrally, Appendix 3 also makes it clear that “(1) A credit or debit entry for value of the TC is made in the SPM's branch account; and (2) A corresponding debit or credit is made in the SPM's customer account with Post Office.” Raising a dispute is entirely separate, and is something that each of the final three boxes on Appendix 3 shows is done by telephoning the NBSC Helpline and lodging a dispute. It is not done on the Horizon terminal at all, and importantly, that point is only reached <span style="font-style:italic">after</span> the SPM has clicked “Accept Now”. Further – and this is something that I address in more detail when dealing with the evidence of Mrs Van Den Bogerd, the most senior Post Office witness who appeared before me – it is <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> the case, on the evidence before me, that telephoning the NBSC Helpline to lodge a dispute suspended the debt collection process. All the agreed wording in Appendix 3 states is that this “should suspend collection until the dispute is resolved.” In terms of what in fact happened to these Lead Claimants, the actuality is rather different. It is also made clear in the first box including text in Appendix 4 that “the process in Flowchart 1 is followed until all TCs are either made good, or settled centrally to the SPMR’s customer account”. Each of these choices – making good, or settling centrally – can only be reached after clicking “Accept Now”.  </p>

He expressed interest to the Post Office formally, and this was acknowledged by a letter from the Post Office dated 6 September 2006 explaining </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">that he had to make a formal application, which he did later in 2006. In yet another example of the Post Office’s shoddy document management at the time, the Post Office in disclosure in this litigation produced a letter telling Mr Abdulla he was successful in his application, that is dated 7 April 2005. That is plainly and obviously wrong. It is also not the first document in these proceedings related to important matters that has a date on it that defies explanation. It is at least 17 months too early, even compared to the timeline from other Post Office documents, well over a year before Mr Abdulla even received the brochure, and 19 months before the Post Office even invited Mr Abdulla for an interview. Not only that, but the letter of 6 September 2006 acknowledging his expression of interest is supposed to be 4 pages long, but only pages 1 of 4, and 2 of 4, are available. The other two pages, 3 of 4 and 4 of 4, are missing. Again, there is no cogent explanation for this. I do not understand how half of a letter can go missing, particularly when it is dated from only 2006. </p>

He was going to introduce a retail side to the business, basically a convenience store. As it was a leasehold property it was also agreed that the annual rental would be £14,500 for a 12 year term. The estimated remuneration from the Post Office, provided in the letter of 6 September 2006, was £106,000 approximately. Mr Abdulla was funding the purchase with two interest free family loans and a 10 year loan from Barclay’s Bank. </p>

This was assessed as medium risk by the Post Office in terms of the financial viability of Mr Abdulla taking over the branch. In the Post Office’s calculation of the financial viability of the proposal, under “Other Cash Impacts”, there is a figure of £1,500 for “Provision for Losses”. Mr Abdulla does not believe he included this in his business plan, although neither he nor the Post Office any longer has a copy of that business plan. Whether he did or not, the Post Office obviously considered it was sensible to include a figure for losses in this amount, which is less than 1½% of the annual remuneration. Mr Abdulla did not receive a copy of this calculation by the Post Office. Nor was he told by the Post Office that this figure should be provided for, or was required.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Turning to Mr Abdulla’s operation of the branch, I have already identified his account of how even disputed Transaction Corrections had to be dealt with, at some stage prior to the next Branch Trading Period, by clicking a button “Accept Now”. He would contact the Helpline about 6 or 7 times a month, and was shocked at the inadequate support. He would often experience apparent shortfalls on the days when he would perform balances, but could rarely get through to the Helpline on these occasions. He thought the advisers were ill informed and would often give the impression of reading off a script. Even his area manager could not help, and he was told by his area manager that he should just pay the shortfalls and wait to see if a Transaction Correction was issued in his favour.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Apparent shortfalls began appearing in his accounts soon after the branch transfer and continued regularly. He could not resolve these through the Helpline. In these proceedings he has considered information available in disclosure that he did not then have available for the period March 2009 to April 2009. This shows 94 Transaction Corrections during this period. Some columns on the spreadsheet of the Post Office report of all these (to assist the parties, at bundle reference {E4/92/1}) contains some text which Mr Abdulla believes were what were or would be shown on the Horizon terminal. Many of the entries relate to the National Lottery, either sales or prizes. Many of them relate to cheques which were said to have been lost. If the receiving bank (which usually appears to be the Alliance &amp; Leicester) said it had not received the same number and amount of cheques Mr Abdulla sent from the branch, the difference would be claimed from him by the Post Office. He considers that the Post Office would always accept what the bank said and debit him for the amount. Some of these amounts were sizeable. Some have no text at all. Some say “evidence to follow” or that the evidence will follow in the post. Some say “the evidence has been posted today and should arrive in the next few days. Although telephone disputes are not allowed, if you have a query about this transaction correction you can contact” and then a telephone number is given. The statement “telephone disputes are not allowed” is directly different to what the Post Office explained to me should have been done if a TC were challenged, which is by telephone. It is also different to what Appendices 3 and 4 to this judgment, which are agreed, shows.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">There is one particular example where the amount that is plainly intended to be a credit (which requires a negative or minus sign before the figure) for £1,033 has been entered without that, which means it would be treated as a debit. This relates to a National Lottery cheque on 14 May 2008. If it has been entered as a debit rather than a credit, the financial impact upon the branch would be £2,066. None of this detail was available to Mr Abdulla at the time, and it is only due to these proceedings that he has even seen the report. Another example is three successive Transaction Corrections for £1092 regarding the National Lottery, each debiting Mr Abdulla with an identical amount but for different periods. He believes the same one has been entered more than once in error. If these points are correct – and specific findings on items such as this on any individual case must wait until a later trial – the effect is obvious, and highly detrimental to Mr Abdulla.  </p>

The Post Office knew this, and he explained that he thought auditing the branch whilst he was away was wrong. A shortfall of £4,905 was found and he was immediately suspended and locked out, not being allowed to enter the branch. This suspension led to his termination. The auditor on that occasion in fact accepted a TC in the branch without his knowledge and whilst he was evidently not present.  </p>

The word “under” in “understated” was changed by handwriting to read “over” so that it became “overstated”. The whole phrase therefore read, if one considers that text with the change, that “the mutilated notes were overstated by the same amount.” The complaint therefore appears to be that mutilated notes were overstated by the amount of the cheque, namely £2,500. Given the largest denomination banknote is £50, this means at the very least (if they were all £50 notes) that 50 notes were wrongly stated to be mutilated. </p>

The Post Office relied upon this to demonstrate a high degree of expertise on his part in dealing with IT, and hence with Horizon. He explained it was just a title, and did not mean he was an IT expert. He was responsible for making sure colleagues in his previous sales job collected information and logged it correctly on the Voyager system then being used in that company, for relaying information to the head office. I accept his evidence on this point. In any event, there is nothing to suggest that the Voyager system is even approximately similar to the Horizon system, and everything to suggest it is wholly different, given it was used for pharmaceutical and medical sales. The Post Office attempted to elevate this subject to a level far above the importance it merited. Secondly, Mr Abdulla’s believed that the auditor present on branch transfer day, Christine Stevens, was the same person who was his area manager, Christine Adams, but she had changed her surname when she became married. The Post Office’s case is that these are two entirely different people, and they relied upon this as further demonstration of his unreliability. Neither of the Christines appeared before me, but this is a point of utter superficiality and of no relevance whatsoever. Mr Abdulla’s mistaken belief in this respect goes nowhere, and it is an understandable mistake in the circumstances.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Abdulla described his whole experience with the Post Office as traumatic, which, given how he appeared in the witness box, for him it obviously was. He said that the termination had caused him not only a significant financial impact, but also affected his health significantly. He evidently felt an extremely strong sense of personal grievance. This seemed to become increasing pronounced the longer he was crossexamined, and led to his answers becoming somewhat longer and of less assistance. His evidence increasingly became statements of his position, rather than answers to questions, and somewhat lengthy statements of position at that. Some of the questions inadvertently encouraged these expositions from Mr Abdulla. It was necessary, from time to time, to try and keep Mr Abdulla on track in terms of answering Mr Cavender’s questions. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In my judgment, Mr Abdulla was trying to assist and give clear answers, but he increasingly could not keep himself within the confines of the actual questions on many occasions. When he did, his evidence was persuasive and useful, but these times were matched by times when his point of view simply spilled over.  After one particularly lengthy answer, for example, he told me he was trying to paint a picture. This way of answering questions meant that he was not a wholly satisfactory witness, as he did need to be kept on track rather more than was ideal. </p>

I make no criticism of the way that Mr Cavender put this to Mr Abdulla, as it is an inherent part of the Post Office’s case that Horizon is what is called “robust”, that shortfalls experienced by Mr Abdulla were not caused by Horizon, and SPMs who had discrepancies in their branch accounts were either extraordinarily careless and/or they and/or their assistants were probably stealing or losing the money. The necessary points were put to Mr Abdulla entirely correctly and Mr Cavender was professionally bound to do this.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">However, I do not accept the challenge mounted by the Post Office to the content of Mr Abdulla’s witness evidence before me. I do not find that he was lying, or that his evidence was untrue. However, his evidence must be viewed in the light of someone who acted as he did with the undated cheque and the potential misstatement of damaged bank notes. Horizon issues, and the TCs concerning the lottery, were not the only issues uncovered on the audit of his branch. He was, also, so convinced that he had been treated badly by the Post Office, and his point of view became so extremely subjective, that he was not an entirely satisfactory witness. On matters concerned with his contracting with the Post Office, what he received by way of documents, how the Horizon system was operated and his experience of how it worked, I find his evidence reliable and I accept it. In fact, he was vindicated in terms of the Branch Trading Statement by the contents of Appendices 3 and 4. On factual matters concerning what occurred when the audit happened, how his suspension and termination occurred and were dealt with by the Post Office, I accept his evidence. So far as the actual substantive issues that were uncovered in the audit that led to his termination, namely the shortfalls, misstatement of mutilated notes and the undated cheque, express findings will have to wait until a later trial. There may be more to come so far as Mr Abdulla is concerned, as he had (potentially, as I make no findings on this) incorrectly entered the amount of damaged banknotes in the branch. His accounts were however prepared in the way he explained; that is, regardless of his view concerning any of the Transaction Corrections, he had no option but to “Accept Now” to reach the point of preparing or returning a Branch Trading Statement in order to open the next day. I make it clear that I make no findings in relation to the issues to be dealt with in later trials, namely Horizon Issues, breach, causation and loss. It should therefore be clear that I make no findings on whether he falsified his accounts to the Post Office at the time, and if so, how, because that is not an issue before me in this trial. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Given the last two sentences of the preceding paragraph, the Post Office may ask why all of the evidence given by Mr Abdulla was admissible in this trial. The Post Office certainly tried extremely hard and expended considerable expense, in advance of this trial, to prevent this evidence from emerging into the public domain, and issued an application seeking to strike out most of it. The answer to this, and any ongoing challenge to admissibility, is very simple. The terms upon which Mr Abdulla contracted with the Post Office were factually in issue. The operation of the Horizon system in terms of the generation of a Branch Trading Statement, and the options available to a SPM at the end of a Branch Trading Period, and whether losses had to be accepted by a SPM (even if disputed) by clicking “Accept Now”, were also factually in issue. These steps go to the very essence of what a Branch Trading Statement was, or is, and the way in which a SPM accounted to the Post Office. The presence of unexplained shortfalls, and how these were dealt with in the context of an agent accounting to his or her principal, are factually in issue. The functions of a SPM </p>

It is part of the dispute between the parties that SPMs owed a duty to account to the Post Office and whether the SPMs, as a matter of construction, have to bear the burden of proving that any Branch Trading Statement they have signed and/or returned was or is incorrect. It is therefore necessary to know – and to decide, given it was not agreed – what a Branch Trading Statement was. </p>

I am not making specific findings on whether the shortfalls he experienced were caused by Horizon or something else, whether his suspension and/or termination were justified, whether either Mr Abdulla or the Post Office were in breach to another and if so how, and if so, what the consequences were in terms of loss that was caused. I must, and will, guard against hindsight when construing contract terms, and this is a well known legal principle. But Mr Abdulla’s evidence is not irrelevant. </p>

Mrs Stockdale (in common with Mrs Dar, who was appointed slightly later than her in November 2014) contracted on the terms of the NTC, and not the SPMC. This form of contract started being used for SPMs following what was called the Network Transformation Programme which had started in pilot form in 2011. NTC is shorthand for “Post Office Limited Standard Conditions for the Operation of a Local Post Office Branch” and the contract which was, by 2014, being used extensively. It will be remembered that “Local” is one of the types of branch that the Post Office established under the Network Transformation Programme. The other type is a “Main” contract and none of the Claimants contracted upon that form. I use NTC in this judgment to mean the NTC Local contract form. </p>

The SPM is described as the Operator, and there is a document which states “The Operator and Post Office Ltd hereby agree to enter into the Agreement as defined above” and this was signed by both parties prior to Branch Transfer Day. Mr Stockdale signed hers on 17 February 2014.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">It is as though the Post Office had finally realised, or been given advice, based on some basic principles of English contract law, not least those of offer, acceptance, and notice, for the new NTC as opposed to the SPMC. Without trivialising any of the issues in this case, an awareness of a contracting party of at least the existence of terms of a written document are clearly required, in order to fix a party with notice of that document’s terms. Willingness and awareness of terms are some of the basic building blocks of the law of contract. As can be seen from the analysis of the four earlier Lead Claimants, the Post Office’s procedures in terms of the SPMC went, in my judgment, from the sublime to the ridiculous. The approach in 2000 was simply to assume the outgoing and incoming SPMs would sort the SPMC out between themselves, because the SPMC was supposed to be kept in the branch (or not kept, depending upon the individual practice adopted in each branch). This approach was wholly unsatisfactory for a number of reasons, not least there is no evidence that </p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">either an incoming or outgoing SPM was ever told that is what was expected or required of them. The documents had also used confusing and interchangeable terms for different or the same document(s), as well as referring to documents which did not even exist such as the Book of Rules (or book of rules in later versions). It should be noted that the Acknowledgement of Appointment Mrs Stockdale signed on Branch Transfer Day still, however, referred to the non-existent “book of rules”. Initially the SPM was not provided with the SPMC in advance from the Post Office at all (or was, depending upon who put what in different envelopes). Added to this unsatisfactory situation was, under the former regime, the Post Office’s approach to Branch Transfer Day, when a whole raft of documents was produced to an incoming SPM to be signed by them immediately, with no opportunity to read or study them (still less to take any advice on their contents). The amount of time available to read them in any event would depend upon the length of time it took the auditors to do the closing audit for the outgoing SPM, but it would certainly be far less than a day, or even half a day. By the day of the transfer, an incoming SPM would have completed their purchase or lease of the business and the property where the branch was located, and would actually be moving in and taking over the branch. Additionally, there was no differentiation between documents such as the operating manuals, which went to the practice of dealing with the business of running the branch and dealing with customers, and those of a different level of importance, such as the SPMC, which governed the contractual relationship between the SPM and the Post Office itself.  </p>

This was to give me an idea of the volume of paperwork presented to an incoming SPM on that day. They were produced by the Post Office and comprised 6 full lever arch files. In my judgment, there is simply no possible way that this material alone could be read, sensibly digested and/or understood in a single day (still less ½ day, if a closing audit could be done in the first half of Branch Transfer Day) even by a specialist judge or commercial silk, still less by an incoming SPM. Although during the life of the SPMC this improved very slightly – for example, Mr Sabir and Mr Abdulla were at least supposed to have been sent the SPMC and Modified SPMC respectively – the Post Office’s practices in this respect left a great deal to be desired, and the new approach under the NTC is, in my judgment, an absolutely necessary reform.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The terms and the way that the SPMs were provided with the contract changed over time, and particularly so with the introduction of the NTC. There are four improvements that are very notable in my judgment in terms of the difference between the NTC and the SPMC (including the Modified SPMC). Firstly, the NTC was provided to an incoming SPM well in advance of Branch Transfer Day. Secondly, the NTC expressly states that the SPM is to sign it, and that this represents an offer from the SPM to the Post Office to contract on its terms. That offer will be accepted by the Post Office signing it and returning it to the SPM. This is conventional contract formation. It is markedly different to how the Post Office conducted itself in respect of the SPMC as has been seen. The third feature is that under the NTC the SPM was expressly told in writing that he or she should take legal advice and only sign the NTC if content to be bound by the terms. Both of these lead into the fourth notable feature. Prior to the NTC, the way in which an incoming SPM was provided with the detailed contract terms upon which he or she was supposed to </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">be contracting was, based upon the evidence for this trial and in my judgment, haphazard to say the least, if not wholly deficient, as I have already explained. The Post Office also expected an incoming SPM to access and discuss the SPMC with and through the outgoing SPM. This is because the Post Office considered the SPMC would and should be kept in the branch, along with other documents such as Operational Manuals. That unsatisfactory situation simply could not arise, on the evidence before me for Mrs Stockdale and Mrs Dar, regarding the NTC, as the procedure adopted by the Post Office of sending the document, requiring a signature from the appointee, and sending it back signed by the Post Office, means that Mrs Stockdale’s was signed by Mr Padget for the Post Office on 20 March 2014 and returned to her. This is far more satisfactory, for everyone concerned, as the scope for confusion, doubt and argument over contract terms becomes far narrower in scope. </p>

It is a matter of considerable surprise to me why it took so long for the Post Office to streamline and improve its contractual formation procedures. Mr Beal, with whom I deal in more detail below, worked for the Post Office from 1987 when he started as a counter clerk. He eventually became, in 2010, the Network Relationship Manager, and in 2011 Head of Network Development. One of his three main areas of responsibility was developing and implementing the terms of SPMs’ contracts. If so, he may well have been involved in implementing the basic but rather important improvements in contract formation for the NTC to which I have referred above. I doubt that these improvements occurred by accident, or without the Post Office realising that their existing procedures were deficient. However, whether that is the case or not, none of the Post Office’s witnesses told me such a realisation had occurred, and so it remains a moot point. In any event, it may not much matter. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In my judgment, there are no grounds for these inferences in this case. Taking the one at [284](1) first, the most suitable entity from whom an incoming SPM would obtain such information would be the Post Office itself, particularly in circumstances where that person had to make an application to, and be approved by, the Post Office. The others are all vulnerable to such similar observations, which lead in my judgment to a contrary inference. In so far as inferences are required or appropriate, I find that the correct inference is that the matters at [284](1), and (3) to (7) would be (and should have been) dealt with by the Post Office and notified to Mrs Stockdale (and any other incoming SPM) by the Post Office itself. I do not find that the inference at (2) is a justified one, but it is the closest in type to the subject matter of what might potentially be inferred. Further, Ms Collinson, who was selling the business to Mrs Stockdale, would not in fact provide these details to her, and the Post Office specifically knew this by at least the interview stage as this was the reason Mr Carpenter, who interviewed her, assessed her application as high risk. It is also unlikely any person selling a business to someone who would be investing substantial sums, and basing their financial projections and decision on Post Office remuneration, would wish to highlight to the purchaser that this could be changed and the purchaser could have their contract terminable for cause on breach or terminable at will on notice. These alleged inferences are, in my judgment, wholly unrealistic in the circumstances of an outgoing SPM selling their business (including a branch Post Office) to an incoming SPM. It is also unrealistic to suppose that a seller of a business of this nature, a major element of which was a Post Office, would draw to the purchaser’s attention points (6) and (7) in the list above of inferences, because they would draw specific attention to very unpalatable features of the relationship with the Post Office. It must also be remembered that the sale of a branch Post Office is not a highly sophisticated business transaction, with warranties provided by the seller and so on, in the way more complicated and substantial businesses are sold. These inferences might be justified in more complicated business transactions, but I find that they are not justified in the sale of the small businesses being considered in this Common Issues trial.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">This interview was recorded, as was the Post Office’s practice at the time. Rather oddly – if not, entirely surprisingly – that recording is simply not available. This is because the recording is encrypted, and even though Mr Carpenter said he had not password protected it, and he had no password, the encryption key has been lost. I was somewhat sceptical when I was first given this explanation. Given both parties have IT experts acting for the Horizon Issues trial, and the Post Office itself has instructed a digital forensics consultancy to assist with e-discovery and technical assistance, I ordered an explanation by witness statement concerning this. This was provided during the trial by Dr Tristan Jenkinson in an 8 page statement. The recording exists, the Post Office and its specialists possess it, and it is encrypted with Symantec Endpoint Encryption. This file has been encrypted to a Certificate, a conclusion Dr Jenkinson has reached due to the code within it that he has been able to view. Symantec uses for this program a 2046 keypair for certificates, which means the total number of 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2048 </span>binary combinations are present. For anyone with any grasp of mathematics and exponential function, the understatement is that this is a very large number. The certificate would have been actually installed on Mr Carpenter’s computer at the time. The explanation for why the Post Office cannot de-encrypt its own recordings is as follows: </p>

She did not have all the training she was told she would receive because the premises were subject to building works necessary to transform it into a Local branch, and also because one of the trainers who attended in the first week after her branch had opened, a lady called Lina, attended for only one day and had to leave unexpectedly; another person called Daniel, did not really know what he was doing (according to Mrs Stockdale) “and stayed in the back mostly”. The works encompassed moving the position of the counters and other internal works, including signage and so on, although her husband actually did some of the building works himself. Her father is a former police officer and he was acting as her guarantor for the lease. He considered some of the documents and she trusted him to check he was happy with it. She expended considerable sums to invest in opening the branch.  </p>

They could pay it the Post Office by debit or credit card; they were not required to pay it immediately. It was an alternative to that SPM immediately physically adding the cash amount to make up the shortfall that way. It was not an alternative to a SPM “accepting it” – as has been seen, “settle centrally” was an option reached on the Horizon terminal only <span style="font-style:italic">after </span>the button “Accept Now” had been clicked. The phrase “settle centrally” was used by the Post Office for the majority of the Common Issues trial at least, as though it was synonymous with disputing a transaction correction in some way, or otherwise connected with a process on Horizon when an unexplained shortfall and the SPM wished to challenge it. This is incorrect. Whatever the origin of that phrase when the Horizon system was designed, and who chose the words, does not matter. What the phrase means, in the context of this litigation, the Horizon system and the way that the Post Office and the SPM transacted their business, is transferring a shortfall on the account into (as the training slide stated) a “holding account” which would give the SPM time to pay it.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Mrs Stockdale’s experience of running the branch was not a happy one. Unexplained shortfalls would appear on Horizon when she was completing a weekly balance or submitting a trading statement. There were no explanations for these, and there was no way available for her to get to the bottom of them either. She found it very difficult to obtain any details from the Post Office, and did everything she could think of to keep the most detailed records within the branch itself. Her first shortfall was £172.50 in the very first balance that she did in the branch on 21 May 2014. One of the Post Office auditors was there, Mr Longbottom. This is because this was the final part of her training, and he is an auditor and trainer. He was also the auditor who had done the transfer audit from Ms Collinson to Mrs Stockdale. I deal further with his evidence below. Mrs Stockdale said that even he could not get to the bottom of the shortfall either, and he also told her that she had to settle the shortfall by cash or cheque, or settle it centrally. This matches the way the Horizon system presented </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">These shortfalls continued. On 15 October 2014 there were unexplained shortfalls of over £3,500. When she phoned the Helpline she was told that this was “only £3,000, that’s a drop in the ocean compared to some people’s problems”. This contradicted an earlier statement from the Helpline when she had been told she was the only SPM experiencing these problems, which just made her feel inadequate. I will track this particular shortfall through in terms of her evidence. She phoned the Helpline again on 21 October 2014 and again asked for assistance, as well as further training in relation to the balancing problems. She felt that a sum of over £3,000 was a lot of money, notwithstanding the views of the Helpline operator when she first called. Mr Longbottom came to her branch on 29 October 2014 to try to work out what was going on, and she let him have access to her records. He printed out various documents but he could not get to the bottom of it either. He said the problem would be referred to the Horizon Technical Desk. I accept this evidence by Mrs Stockdale. There can be no doubt that this shortfall was clearly in dispute, even on the Post Office’s understanding of how disputes were to be raised.  </p>

She introduced a robust paper recording system for all cash movement in the branch. She required all staff to complete manual till and safe logs, what had been paid in or paid out, and even the denomination of notes. She could therefore do a complete cash reconciliation in and out. She installed CCTV so she could monitor her staff at all times. She trusted them but she wanted to be able to have tight control of all cash, in and out, and to be able completely to rule out theft by her staff. She explained that she spent hours with the records, including her own paper records, trying to investigate. </p>

Even if the precise terms of the first claim form were not known in early May 2016 (which depends upon when it was served), the Post Office would probably have learned of them at some point during the summer and before 16 September 2016. During this period the Post Office chose to act as it did with Mrs Stockdale, shutting her branch and stating she was considered to have committed a criminal offence. It also expressly stated to her that it was taking into account that she had not contacted the NSBC or asked the Post Office for assistance. The documents available in this litigation show that this was simply not true, and she had expressly done both of these things. I will return to this subject when summarising the evidence of Mr Carpenter, who was the Post Office witness predominantly involved.  </p>

I accept that legal advice was referred to by Mr Trotter in a general way at the second meeting (whether it was a second “interview”, or not) but do not consider that the way it was said, or its emphasis, meant that Mr Trotter told her she did not need to obtain any, or that he said anything on this subject that could or should be construed as Mrs Dar being able to rely upon it in contradiction to the terms of the NTC itself. Mrs Dar herself accepted, this second meeting was relaxed and friendly, as well it might have been. Mr Trotter had expressed reservations about the financial viability of her application in the first, more formal, interview, and by this second meeting on 4 June 2014 these had been resolved on a resubmitted application. She received a letter of congratulation and details of training in a letter dated 4 June 2014.

Given the presence of a signed set of terms none of these particularly matter contractually, but they give a good idea of the approach of the Post Office to the Lead Claimants generally: </p>

Actually, the notice period is “at least 12 months” for Main branches. Mrs Guthrie could have been mistaken and told Mr and Mrs Dar the notice period for Main, rather than Local, branches. 1 year is not so far out of the realms of the period of notice, although obviously Mrs Dar was to have a Local, rather than a Main, branch. There is not a great deal of difference to a lay person between 12 months, or “at least” 12 months. The period of notice is in any event stated in the NTC itself. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Taking on a new business commitment would be exciting for someone such as Mrs Dar; particularly if one expected it to improve the financial performance of an existing retail shop, (or was a change of career direction as with some of the other Lead Claimants). The Post Office in these proceedings were desperate to maintain that these contracts were purely “business to business” and in doing so wholly ignored, and disparaged, the human element involved both in purchasing a business and also in becoming a SPM. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally, in my judgment, Mrs Dar’s evident astonishment during this crossexamination at being told the Post Office was “actually very straightforward” is entirely well-founded. She had registered with the Post Office a number of expressions of interest in her branch. The Post Office had either lost at least three of these, or its online systems had failed to deal with them correctly. She had received e mails stating they attached documents when they did not, and the Post Office had told her they had sent important documents such as her draft contract which just did not arrive. When she chased up all of these instances, she was either disbelieved (with the online registration) or the faults were blamed on her (viz “we issued a contract for Lenzie however the PNO has since moved house and failed to tell us, so we sent it to the wrong address”). At every turn, at least so far as Mrs Dar was concerned, the Post Office had showed its level of administrative competence to be at the very bottom end of the scale. Yet she was told it was “actually very straightforward” and the Post Office submitted to the court that “she tried to pretend the documents were confusing – when they were clearly not”. I find that the suggestion that the Post Office was </p>

Mrs Dar considered the training inadequate. This was followed by branch set up and induction training at the branch. The Post Office auditor present for this was Mrs Margaret Guthrie. She did not give evidence before me.  She was also responsible for induction training. She had problems with Horizon, logging on took some time and even before the branch opened Mrs Dar said there was a shortfall of £977, which she believes was due to mistakes by Mrs Guthrie in inputting the stock into Horizon. Mrs Guthrie spent some of her time trying to fix problems with Horizon rather than doing the induction training that Mrs Dar was expecting.

She had apparent shortfalls other than this one on what she said was “a regular basis”. One TC she was issued was for £2,660 in coins with which she did not agree, but she says she was told she had to accept it in order to roll into the next balance period.

This assistant had worked for the Post Office for 12 years. Mrs Dar dismissed her for gross misconduct, as she felt she had no choice. Mrs Dar was suspended. A large amount of the shortfall related to cheques which were said to be missing. These cheques later turned up and were credited by the Post Office, reducing the shortfall.

The entirety of the text relating to <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> investigation by the Post Office in respect of Mrs Dar’s numerous issues and experiences (including with the Helpline, the way that she was told to report disputes) is the single sentence “Post Office Limited's investigations have now concluded”. It is not said what those investigations consisted of; what issues were investigated; how they were investigated; over what period of time; how long that took; or any other basic information. The suggestion in the sentence is that there was some sort of investigation, but the accuracy of that statement may become clearer in later phases of these proceedings. Certainly no outcome of any investigation in terms of any detail was put to Mrs Dar.  </p>

I reject those criticisms of her. I found her to be a reliable and entirely straightforward witness who was, so far as the evidence in this trial is concerned, telling me the truth. There are isolated instances where I have not accepted her evidence, such as whether Mr Trotter told her not to get legal advice on the terms of the NTC, but that difference probably comes down to a different understanding on her part regarding what Mr Trotter in fact said, rather than disbelieving that he actually said anything at all to her about such legalities. As with the other Lead Claimants, I make no findings concerning breach, causation or loss. Also, and again this applies to all six of the Lead Claimants, my acceptance of their evidence does not mean that all or any future evidence on all the other issues will automatically be accepted uncritically. However, on the evidence before me on these issues, I accept what Mrs Dar has told me save for the exceptions I have identified. </p>

In her case this does not affect contract formation, as she contracted on the NTC form. However, the way the Post Office dealt with the documentation generally as I have identified, was far from competent. The second was her challenge to Mr Cavender’s assertion on behalf of the Post Office that the signing of the agreement and the structure was “actually very straightforward”. She said: </p>

The Post Office also provided a helpful Reading Note, which explained the structure of the statements and a suggested order in which they might first be read. It was explained that the statements dealt with three main areas. These were the structure of the business of the Post Office; the appointment of SPMs; and what was called “Claimant-specific evidence”, which meant evidence specific to the Lead Claimants selected by both the parties. I will summarise their evidence in the order in which they were called, which is not the same as the sequence in the Reading Note. Even given there were 14 of them, the Post Office evidence was not the same in scope as that of the Lead Claimants, as so few of them could give any direct evidence at all, of any of the six Lead Cases. It is for that reason that Part D of this judgment is somewhat shorter than Part C. </p>

As will be seen in Part H which deals with the contractual terms themselves, the clauses that deal with liability of a SPM for losses is entirely differently worded in the SPMC (which uses the word “fault”) and the NTC (which does not have any such express reference). Mr Beal sought to give me the impression that the intention of the Post Office was to keep the liability for losses the same when the NTC was introduced. I doubt very much that was the case, and I reject that evidence by him. If it were, I do not see how the relevant clause of the NTC would be drafted as it is. Indeed, the Post Office’s own counsel accepted that the wording of the two clauses was rather different, as he would be expected to accept, given the obvious differences in terminology. Mr Beal is obviously a highly intelligent and successful member of the senior team at the Post Office, and must know this.  </p>

This was to glide away from pertinent questions, or questions to which the witness realised a frank answer would not be helpful to the Post Office’s cause. Giving evidence in court and being cross-examined, is an unusual experience for most people, regardless of the amount and type of preparation that a person may have undertaken in advance. Mr Beal certainly knew his subject very well. He sought to give me evidence highly favourable to the Post Office, which I consider was slanted more towards public relations consumption rather than factual accuracy. It did not match the contents of the documents to which I have referred, namely the GFA, and the change in wording of the terms dealing with liability for loss by a SPM under the NTC. </p>

It must also have been the intention of the Post Office to widen the scope of liability of a SPM for loss under the NTC, hence the change in wording. (Of course subjective intention is not something taken account of in contractual construction.) Mr Beal’s attempt to persuade me to the contrary on both points is regrettable; it is possible that he has persuaded himself. His evidence came across to me as a public relations exercise.  </p>

He said he relied upon people not contacting him and saying "I thought you were sending me a contract and I haven't had it".

He had realised shortcomings in the Post Office processes for contracting with incoming SPMs, and (for example) had drafted the SERV 135 in 1993, and had adopted some regional and ad hoc (in the sense they were not nationally adopted at the time) practices to try and get around this. However, these were obviously not universally accepted by the time Mr Bates acquired his branch in May 1999. Indeed some of the archaic references, in important documents such as the Acknowledgement of Appointment, persisted as has been seen for another 20 years or so after that. If anything, his evidence certainly does not contradict Mr Bates’ account in general terms, it rather confirms it. To be fair to Mr Williams, he frankly accepted his evidence was his recollection of the processes of over 20 years ago, and his team would do their best to help incoming SPMs if any of them said there was an error. But they were dependent upon that, I find.  </p>

That probably explains why it was not routinely sent out. Secondly, I can think of no logical reason why the Post Office should have been so secretive to incoming SPMs about the document which the Post Office considered would contain their contract terms.

That rationale does not, nor could it, outweigh the legal principles both of contract formation and construction under the law. Obviously, the nature of the business of a Post Office branch is that cash and stock belonging to the Post Office is kept in the custody of a SPM, and some SPMs may be dishonest. Mr Breeden essentially explained why financial and personal probity is required from SPMs, and sketched out situations where the Post Office “may consider it appropriate to suspend a SPM” such as civil or criminal proceedings, misconduct, grounds to suspect dishonesty and insolvency. Prior to 2014 the decision to suspend a SPM, and thereafter to reinstate or terminate their appointment, rested with the Contracts Advisor allocated to the case. After that date, the decision had to be made either by Mr Breeden (as Team Leader of the Agents Contracts Deployment team for the relevant area) or his counterpart. This change was made because the right to appeal against an immediate termination, which was included in the SPMC, was removed in the NTC. </p>

This is more than an academic nicety. Terminating someone without notice is a severe step. A right of appeal was supposed to be present under the SPMC, but the Post Office’s own witnesses do not know what that appeal consisted of and what the test was. This is deeply unsatisfactory.  </p>

Also, the Post Office’s reputation might be significantly affected if it were found to have suspended a SPM on grounds that were wholly unjustified. Unjustified suspension ought to be a factor in favour of an appeal succeeding, on any sensible view. The Appeal Managers are senior Post Office managers who are said to have had training to hear appeals. The reputation of the Post Office would best be served by appeals that were justified succeeding, and those that were not failing. It should not have formed any part of the criteria. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In the period April 2013 to June 2018 the number of SPMs who were suspended was 626. This equates to about 10 SPMs being suspended per month. 407 of those had their contracts terminated and as at the date of Mr Breeden’s statement 150 had been reinstated, with 69 pending. The Post Office seeks to put a Temporary SPM (these are called Temps) in place during a suspension, to which the suspended SPM must agree (as they control their own premises). If they do not agree, the Post Office would be closed. If they do agree, usually most Temps insist (in Mr Breeden’s experience) on receiving all the remuneration that would be paid by the Post Office for the running of that branch. From the evidence in the Common Issues trial, the Temp appears usually to be an agency. There are obvious adverse consequences to a suspended SPM as the Post Office immediately suspends his or her remuneration. Nor are they in a strong bargaining position in terms of negotiating terms with the Temp. </p>

His evidence was presented in terms obviously designed to put the best possible gloss for the Post Office on matters, and some of his statements simply did not stand scrutiny. The one I have explained above, that SPMs had the chance to review their contracts before appointment, was expressly preceded by a statement that made clear he was referred both to the SPMC and the NTC. Such evidence is in my judgment inaccurate, and inaccurate factual evidence is not helpful. When faced with the actual documents, he would agree Mr Green’s points to the contrary, but one reason why the factual part of the Common Issues trial became so protracted is because of this approach by the Post Office generally. Agreement to even obvious points would be reached, <span style="font-style:italic">eventually</span>, but getting there took much longer, and a great deal more effort, than it ever ought to have done.

She became a Branch Manager, Retail Network Manager, Head of Area for the rural agency in Wales between 2001 and 2005, General Manager for the Community Network, and as the National Network Development Manager, designed, developed and deployed the process which is called the Network Transformation Programme. This resulted in the closure of 2,500 branches. She was then Head of Network Services until 2012, and Head of Partnerships which included responsibility for the relationship with the NFSP. She was then Programme Director for the Branch Support Programme from 2013 to 2015, responsible for improving operations across the Post Office, including the handling of in-branch transactions. She was Director of Support Services (with responsibility for the Helpline) between April 2015 and December 2016. She was People and Change Director from January 2017 to January 2018, and she became People Services Director in January 2018, and was in that post when she signed her witness statement in August 2018.

Claims were being made by SPMs who became Claimants, and these claims were resisted or not accepted by the Post Office, so defending seems to me to be an entirely apt choice of word. There is nothing wrong with defending a position, if that defence is justified, which will be a point ultimately resolved at the very end of this group litigation. She had been appointed Programme Director of something called the “Branch Support Programme” at about the same time as Second Sight, an independent consultancy that was appointed by the Post Office to investigate the Horizon system, produced its interim report. This was as part of the Initial Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme which was instituted at the behest of a Parliamentary Select Committee following numerous complaints by SPMs to their constituency Members of Parliament about the Post Office and Horizon. The Post Office began to participate in that process, but did not proceed all the way through, and withdrew. It was this that led to this litigation.   </p>

That is not to say that the issues will be resolved against the Post Office, as final resolution will only eventually occur after future trials and nobody can say what the outcome of the many varied issues still to be tried will be. However, having such a senior witness with such an entrenched view as this means that a degree of obstinacy affected the whole of her evidence. She seemed to be entirely incapable of accepting any other view of the issues other than her own, which I consider amounts to an absolute refusal to accept that the cases of the many hundreds of Claimants were linked. She has been involved in the Post Office’s handling of the complaints made about Horizon by many SPMs since 2010/2011. She remains heavily involved. She was involved in the Working Group with the title of an animal, the name of the particular animal being said to be privileged. Given she has, for so many years, been involved in defending the Post Office’s position, she has become, in my judgment, extraordinarily partisan.

The records produced for the litigation (but which were not available at the time of Mr Abdulla’s suspension) showed three separate TCs relating to his branch, each for £1,092. The short point is that these potentially showed that Mr Abdulla’s branch had been incorrectly “billed” by Horizon for sums not properly due in relation to the Lottery. When Mrs Van Den Bogerd was asked about these points in some detail, she said: “ ... I have just seen this cold, so I don't know what is behind it so I can't really comment further than that.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">“A.  The ping fix was -- we were having a lot of transaction corrections from the lottery.  So the process was that branch had to declare their figures into the Horizon system, so lottery is not connected to Horizon system and therefore they had to manually enter figures, and they were making quite a lot of mistakes doing that.  So the ping was where we took the information from Camelot, because they would already have processed the information on the lottery machine, and sent the  transaction acknowledgement to the branch to say: this is what your transaction sales should be, or your prizes, and therefore they just accepted that.  So it was a semiautomatic way of getting the information into the Horizon system and that made a massive difference to the transaction corrections.  And I believe it was 2012 although I am not 100 per cent certain of the date.  But for 2015, I am sorry, I don't recall anything.” </p>

So at the end of the day, the branches basically summarise their cheques if accepted and rem them out, and part of the process on Horizon was that once you did that you had to go back into the system and then rem them out.

A Branch Trading Statement is treated by the Post Office as a settled and agreed account between it and an SPM, even though it may include items with which a SPM does not agree. This could only be fully understood when one finally came to grips with what the Post Office eventually accepted what it meant by “settle centrally”. As stated in a Post Office document dated 14 November 2008 called “TC/Debt Recovery Review” the following is stated: “Settle Centrally” signifies acceptance of debt liability”. The only difference between settle centrally and the other two options – making good for cash, or cheque – is a SPM is given time to pay. Whether there is a dispute is something that arises as a result of what the Horizon system shows, but there is no provision within Horizon to deal with a disputed item. This is because a positive step needs to be taken by the Post Office to take the amount out of the debt recovery process <span style="text-decoration:underline">even if</span> an item or amount has been “settled centrally” on Horizon. Even then, as Mrs Stubbs found, one part of the Post Office might say that the debt recovery process had been suspended, yet the sums would still be pursued regardless, as though they were agreed by the SPM to be due. </p>

The Post Office accepted that it had removed documents – indeed, it attempted to take Mrs Stockdale’s, but she would not provide them – but said that there was “no evidence” that the withholding of data had “prejudiced an applicant”. Given the “prejudice” would be a SPM demonstrating that <span style="font-style:italic">with</span> the records they could provide an explanation for a shortfall, whereas <span style="font-style:italic">without</span> them they could not, such evidence of prejudice could only be provided by having the </p>

However, for the most part, she was extraordinarily conscious of the need to protect the Post Office’s position in the case generally, which given her very close involvement in the Horizon problems with SPMs over the years, effectively meant protecting her own position too, which led to a disregard for factual accuracy. I find that it is necessary to scrutinise everything she said as a witness, both in her witness statement and in cross-examination, and treat it with the very greatest of caution in all respects.  </p>

Mr Dance made it clear that the Post Office “also reviews how the business plan covers Post Office and retail income and costs to evaluate the net profit and cash flow of the business.” This therefore means that the way in which an applicant has understood, and made provision for, losses due to shortfalls not only is reviewed by the Post Office but forms part of the Post Office’s evaluation of that application.  </p>

The central point in this litigation is that the Claimants’ case is that due to the Horizon system, shortfalls and discrepancies appeared in their accounts through no fault on their part. They however maintain they were treated in a great number of cases as though they were dishonest, with all that entails, even though they were not.

In my judgment, an investigator such as Mrs Dickinson ought to have a detailed knowledge of how Horizon works, certainly in terms of the options available to a SPM at the end of a trading period, as otherwise she would not know if a SPM she was investigating was telling her the truth or not. </p>

Whether this is justified will only be resolved after further trials, and this judgment does not contain findings on breach, loss or causation.

He would not be involved in the decision to suspend. The Post Office does not control the premises and so needs the suspended SPM to agree to a Temp, although the actual choice for a SPM who has just learned they are to be suspended is either to agree to the use of a Temp or have their branch closed by the Post Office. Not only would closure in this way affect whatever other retail business the SPM is operating at the branch, but there is the potential for detrimental public perception if the branch is simply closed. The incoming Temp receives whatever remuneration is due from the Post Office, which stops paying the SPM whose branch it is. For a period of time either Mr Shields or his team produced the contractual documentation in respect of the Post Office and the Temp, although the terms upon which the Temp would occupy and use the branch premises were agreed separately between the Temp and the suspended SPM. </p>

This understanding on his part was something he had been told, and given the lack of differentiation by him between SPMC and NTC SPMs, the logical consequence is that the Post Office acted this way in respect of all SPMs regardless of their different contract terms. This is at least consistent with the point accepted by Mr Breeden, namely that the Post Office doesn't tend to focus on the precise words of a contract, it knows what its interpretation is and that is what everyone works to. This could be described as the Post Office method of contractual construction.  </p>

His lack of knowledge of the terms of the SPMC and the Modified SPMC was surprising, in objective terms, but did match the Post Office’s approach to contract wording generally. The Post Office personnel believe they know what a SPM’s obligations are and they do not need to trouble with the wording of the NTC or the SPMC, or the differences between them. </p>

She could not therefore remember specific details of Mr Abdulla’s interview and cannot be criticised for this. Although she stated what areas would be covered by reference to two Post Office documents, these were from Mr Trotter’s interview conducted with Mrs Dar in 2013. There is nothing to suggest that these documents were in use at the time she interviewed Mr Abdulla 7 years earlier, and this part of her written evidence sought to give the impression, through careful wording of her witness statement, that she had covered the same ground in the interview as contained in these much later checklists. Her evidence orally was very clear and she made it perfectly clear that she could not remember the interview at all and had based her recollection entirely on documents. She immediately accepted paragraph 12 of her witness statement, dealing with everything she “would have” gone through with Mr Abdulla, was based solely on the 2013 document and she could not otherwise remember. Her reliance on documents not then in use cannot have been something that Mrs Ridge herself initiated for the purposes of her statement. I reject the suggestion that all of the different items in the 2013 document were gone through in the interview with Mr Abdulla in 2006.

Liability for losses is an important point and Mrs Ridge seemed to me to be a careful person. Also, given how many interviews she must have conducted, her practice must have become fairly ingrained. She explained that, at that time, interviews would not be recorded if there were two interviewers, but she thought recording may have started prior to 2008 when it became mandatory. There was no detailed discussion of contract terms at interviews at that time, as no applicant would have had the SPMC in advance – she confirmed the practice was as has been described, that it be kept in the branch. The main focus in the interview was the business plan, which the applicants were told to bring with them. The outline summary document was not expected to be discussed and they were not told to bring that with them, by contrast.  </p>

The documents she had in the interview were lacking in much (or any) detail about what different items were, or to what they related. Some were simply numbers listed. She accepted that the much greater detail on another document, which she did not have at the time (an Excel spreadsheet in the trial bundle) would have been helpful, and would have helped her more fully to investigate, and she also accepted that given what she had in the interview, she “could not investigate in any depth”. Given the odd combination of various items all for £1,092 – which she accepted “was a bit odd” - this information would evidently have been very useful. She also accepted that this would be “pretty important” anyway, and would have helped her decide whether to believe Mr Abdulla at the time. I find that he was giving her an account concerning £1,092 which she would have been more willing to consider was truthful had she had the Excel spreadsheet at the interview. She treated his account with scepticism because she did not have the relevant internal Post Office documents that showed a number of TCs for the Lottery, all for £1,092.  </p>

More and better information was available, and I have already expressed my view on it dealing with Mr Abdulla’s evidence above. Mrs Ridge said requesting further information from Fujitsu – something called an ARQ - is not something that she would have done, which I took to mean in any case, not simply Mr Abdulla’s alone. She also said that the Post Office rule that a SPM could not be accompanied by a legal adviser to such a meeting was something that the Post Office lawyers had told them, and that was the origin of the rule. I make no findings on any matters connected with breach, causation or loss. Mrs Ridge seemed to me to have a greater awareness of the need to be fully accurate and helpful to the court than some of the other Post Office witnesses.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">His evidence concerned the process of transfer audits generally, and in terms of his specific evidence, what he could remember, having been shown or read some documents. Mrs Stockdale was not there on 30 April as she was having her classroom training elsewhere, and her husband attended as her representative. Mr Longbottom was the lead auditor and the Post Office cannot locate signed copies of all the documents in the Transfer Pack. He stated, that notwithstanding this lack of documents, “all the relevant documents from the Transfer Pack would have been correctly completed, signed and returned. If documents …. are missing, I think they have been mislaid after I (or one of my colleagues) returned them to Post Office”. In human terms, it is understandable that Mr Longbottom is reluctant to admit of the possibility that he did not arrange for all the necessary documents to be signed. One of the main functions of the auditors on transfer day is to obtain signatures on multiple documents. Given Mrs Stockdale signed the NTC itself this may not much matter in any event, but I accept Mr Longbottom’s evidence that he would have obtained the necessary signatures and sent the documents off to the relevant departments in the Post Office, where they have been lost. He struck me as a careful and diligent person. However, it was also clear from his evidence and that of other witnesses – both from the Post Office, and the Lead Claimants – that Branch Transfer Day was a day of frenetic activity generally, and documents were presented to incoming SPMs for signature as a formality. He said there would be about 12 or 13 signatures required, but some documents would be duplicates, and he thought about 7 or 8 different documents were involved. Even so, I was left with a clear impression not only that there would not be time for an incoming SPM to read them all, or any of them, and the Post Office knew this, but that the Post Office did not even expect a SPM to read them in any event.  </p>

He had internally requested these going back only to November 2016, and the Post Office department in question had refused to give them to him. This left him angry and frustrated, although he tried to play this down by saying the visit wasn’t an audit and he was doing it for the SPM “as a favour”. He was undoubtedly there in his official capacity as an auditor, and he was undoubtedly asking for these records in that capacity too. I do not accept that he was performing such a task informally or as “a favour”. I consider that attempting to get to the bottom of the unexplained shortfall is another example of him being diligent and careful. I do not know why such records should not be made available to a Post Office auditor by others in the Post Office, particularly when that auditor specifically requested them in order to get to the bottom of what a SPM maintained was an unexplained shortfall. Given by early 2017 this litigation was well underway it may be an example of internal suppression of material, but I make no specific findings on that, as the point was not raised. I can think of no rational explanation for this, however.  </p>

This is yet another example of documents produced and used by the Post Office being incorrect and consisting of reference to archaic items which no longer existed. Another example was an e mail sent to Mrs Stockdale from the Post Office saying it would provide a one day induction session for her and her staff on 7 May, even though the branch was not going to be ready to open until 8 May. Booking a one day training induction for a day before the branch was even going to be ready is not likely to be particularly useful. This latter one in isolation is not a large point, but is symptomatic of the lack of accuracy generally in communications from the Post Office. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Longbottom was somewhat too ready to argue the case for the Post Office; for example, the previous paragraph refers to an answer from him that was only eventually reached after some difficulty. The usefulness of his evidence is limited to the points I have identified in this section. That is not to say he was always positively unhelpful, simply that he was somewhat wedded to the overall Post Office cause in the litigation. An example of this is when he was being asked about the wording on the SERV 135 form. He said in relation to the issue of whether incoming SPMs were, generally or somewhat, unaware of important contractual terms (which was said in the SERV 135 itself to have come from audit teams) “I don't think a postmaster has ever said to me that they didn't know that the funds were not for their private use.” This was not remotely an answer to the question, and is exactly the sort of argumentative and combative answer that is wholly unhelpful. He must know that of the significant number of issues in this litigation, both contractual and otherwise, there is no question of the Claimants advancing any case that the funds held in a Post Office branch are for their private use. The question related to what appeared, on the face of a Post Office drafted document, to be a widespread issue of SPMs not being aware of some important contractual terms. This had emerged from the experience of audit teams generally. It is wholly distinct from SPMs taking Post Office funds for their private use.  </p>

In all but a handful of cases the money transfer for the business does not take place until at least 2pm on the day of the transfer and it is quite often later than that. Once the money has transferred the incoming is then pulled in all directions, trying to learn from the outgoing what all the keys open and close, learning the locking up process, how the tills work, dealing with stock takes, removal men, agreeing meter readings, putting beds together so the children have somewhere to sleep that night, numerous phone calls from the bakery/ milk/ newspaper supplier wanting to set up accounts etc etc. The last thing they want to do is serve in the PO. So you either get the staff running the branch, which is OK as you can get them coached in minimum sales standards (if required) but this could obviously be completed later in the week.

There was also a recognition that on transfer day incoming SPMs had a huge amount to do, and were pulled in many different directions. It was also clear that the cost of training incoming SPMs was thought to be lower if that could be combined with a transfer audit, as the same person would perform both the training and the transfer audit.

I did not find his evidence either helpful or accurate in terms of what happened at Mr Sabir’s interview. Neither did he know how Horizon worked, or that a SPM would be forced to accept in their accounts figures with which they disagreed. Nor do I accept that Mr Haworth would have explained at the interviews for SPMs that the Post Office could terminate the appointment of a SPM on 3 months’ notice. I accept that he would have gone through responsibility for losses, and used an example as he explained. I accept he did use his own personal checklist, but as he did not put this in the file at the time, and there is no longer a copy of it available, that is a point that does not go very far. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I reject Mr Haworth’s evidence that he would always explain to an applicant at interview that they should obtain legal advice, or that he did so with Mr Sabir. There is no doubt that the awareness on the part of the Post Office of the importance of recommending an incoming SPM take independent legal advice eventually dawned upon the Post Office at, or about the time of, the introduction of the NTC. That document contains wording to that effect. Indeed, it is a notable difference in the Post Office’s approach from the time when the SPMC was used, as was the (perhaps obvious) step that the document should be provided in advance to an incoming SPM, giving them the opportunity to read it, and then be signed and returned. However, there is no reliable evidence to suggest that this was done in the days prior to the use of the NTC. Mr Haworth may have persuaded himself that he did – and I am not finding that he consciously sought to mislead me – but there is no corroboration of this, he had no independent recollection of Mr Sabir’s interview, and he accepted it did not appear on his personal checklist. It would also have been very odd had he done so, because at that point the interviewee would not even have been provided with a copy of the SPMC. Mr Haworth’s evidence that he did tell an interviewee to seek legal advice is, in my judgment, simply wishful thinking on both his, and the Post Office’s part, and I find that this did not occur.  </p>

Shortly after proceedings were issued, the Post Office acted as it did with Mrs Stockdale, shutting her branch and stating she was considered to have committed a criminal offence.

Whether the Post Office was guilty of acting in the ways complained of by the Claimants can only be resolved later in these proceedings after other trials. However, even putting it at its best for the Post Office, such conduct towards Mrs Stockdale during this early stage of the litigation could potentially be construed as threatening, oppressive, and potentially discouraging to other potential Claimants to become involved in the litigation, whether by accident or design. I can think of no reason why such an approach was taken unilaterally by the Post Office in such a way, without the Post Office’s solicitors giving advance notice to her solicitors, so that a less confrontational and aggressive path was adopted, given her role as a claimant in the litigation. However, even once it was done and she was suspended, the Post Office continued to act in a highly regrettable fashion.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Further, the discourtesy in the Post Office simply ignoring so many communications from the SPM herself to them is extremely puzzling. The Post Office wrote to her directly (rather than to the Claimants’ solicitors on her behalf) when it suited them; her requests back in response were not even given a bare acknowledgement, or a request that she communicate to the Post Office’s solicitors. Even her most basic and immediate request to be provided with details of the appeal process was simply ignored. Even Mr Carpenter accepted that, if he had not known she was a claimant (which he was not sure about) he had found out extremely quickly. Yet here the Post Office was, simply ignoring and “stonewalling” the desperate attempts to communicate back to them from Mrs Stockdale. I do not understand why direct communications were made to her given she had solicitors on the record acting for her. However, if direct communications were to adopted, that should have been twoway, and there is no reason to send letters directly but entirely ignore everything that came back in return.  </p>

She appeared as one of the first Claimants in the first Schedule of Claimants, Claimant No.77. At the earliest stage, it was not Group Litigation at all.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">That concern is amplified by the approach of the Post Office to specific disclosure requests made by the Claimants’ solicitors in this litigation in the period following the audit. On 26 May 2016 Freeths asked for disclosure of different categories of documents relating to Mrs Stockdale. These were precisely drafted categories, and included (for example) Helpline printouts, audit reports, and internal Post Office correspondence including that relating to the basis for, and making of, the decision to audit her branch and suspend her. The answer to that from the Post Office’s solicitors Womble Bond Dickinson was in a letter dated 2 June 2016 and said “in circumstances where you have not set out any basis on which you believe that our client’s actions have been unlawful or otherwise affect Mrs Stockdale’s ability to participate in the Bates High Court litigation, we are not currently minded to engage in ad hoc piecemeal disclosure connected to a live investigation.” All that the Post Office was prepared to do was preserve the documentation, which it should be noted, it would be required to do as a bare minimum to comply with a litigant’s obligations of disclosure generally. I am surprised that it even occurred to the Post Office otherwise that it might <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> preserve such documents. Offering to preserve potentially important documents in High Court litigation, rather than destroy them, is not a concession. </p>

The response from Womble Bond Dickinson on 22 June 2016 was “….we find it difficult to see how provision of certain of the information you have sought will progress matters (in the absence of any input from your client as to the cause of the losses, it looks like a fishing expedition)”.  </p>

This was wholly illogical. The subject matter of the litigation, which by then was well underway, included complaint that SPMs specifically could not themselves identify cause. The claim form itself stated that Horizon “severely limited their ability to access, identify, obtain and reconcile transaction records and themselves investigate any alleged shortfalls.” </p>

Again, this was refused. The letter of refusal of 5 August 2016 from Womble Bond Dickinson stated that “we have given you all requested information that could reasonably be said to assist your client in identifying the cause of the shortfall” and “the relevance of these further documents is not understood in relation to the current issues”. The current issues must, on any sensible construction of that phrase, at that time have included those on the claim form.

It is also the case that all litigants have continuing disclosure obligations. Once Mrs Stockdale was chosen as a Lead Claimant for the Common Issues trial, and at the very latest when the Post Office decided (as at some point it must have done, given the way she was cross-examined as to her credit) to accuse her formally of false accounting, the documents underlying the audit (the result of which formed the basis of the accusations) became highly relevant and clearly disclosable.  </p>

The evidence by Mr Carpenter, far from satisfying these concerns, actually increases them. The Post Office appears, at least at times, to conduct itself as though it is answerable only to itself. The statement that it is prepared to preserve documents – as though that were a concession – and the obdurate to accept the relevance of plainly important documents, and to refuse to produce them, is extremely worrying. This would be a worrying position were it to be adopted by any litigant; the Post Office is an organisation responsible for providing a public service, which in my judgment makes it even worse.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The evidence of Mr Carpenter also clearly reinforced the central flaw running through the Post Office’s case, which directly impacts upon Common Issue 13. I will return to that flaw when considering that issue. I consider that the Post Office’s approach is one that amounts in fact to treating a Branch Trading Statement as though it were an agreed and settled account between agent and principal. When this judgment was distributed in draft, the Post Office submitted that this statement actually submitted the opposite of this, and drew my attention to paragraph 98(a) of its Closing Submissions. This stated: </p>

Certainly the design of the process does not identify within them entries which are disputed.

It also overlooks what follows in paragraph 98 (b) which states </p>

While everyone knows that memory is fallible, I do not believe that the legal system has sufficiently absorbed the lessons of a century of psychological research into the nature of memory and the unreliability of eyewitness testimony. One of the most important lessons of such research is that in everyday life we are not aware of the extent to which our own and other people's memories are unreliable and believe our memories to be more faithful than they are. Two common (and related) errors are to suppose: (1) that the stronger and more vivid is our feeling or experience of recollection, the more likely the recollection is to be accurate; and (2) that the more confident another person is in their recollection, the more likely their recollection is to be accurate.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">Underlying both these errors is a faulty model of memory as a mental record which is fixed at the time of experience of an event and then fades (more or less slowly) over time. In fact, psychological research has demonstrated that memories are fluid and malleable, being constantly rewritten whenever they are retrieved. This is true even of so-called 'flashbulb' memories, that is memories of experiencing or learning of a particularly shocking or traumatic event. (The very description 'flashbulb' memory is in fact misleading, reflecting as it does the misconception that memory operates like a camera or other device that makes a fixed record of an experience.) External information can intrude into a witness's memory, as can his or her own thoughts and beliefs, and both can cause dramatic changes in recollection. Events can come to be recalled as memories which did not happen at all or which happened to someone else (referred to in the literature as a failure of source memory).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">Memory is especially unreliable when it comes to recalling past beliefs. Our memories of past beliefs are revised to make them more consistent with our present beliefs. Studies have also shown that memory is particularly vulnerable to interference and alteration when a person is presented with new information or suggestions about an event in circumstances where his or her memory of it is already weak due to the passage of time.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">The process of civil litigation itself subjects the memories of witnesses to powerful biases. The nature of litigation is such that witnesses often have a stake in a particular version of events. This is obvious where the witness is a party or has a tie of loyalty (such as an employment relationship) to a party to the proceedings. Other, more subtle influences include allegiances created by the process of preparing a witness statement and of coming to court to give evidence for one side in the dispute. A desire to assist, or at least not to prejudice, the party who has called the witness or that party's lawyers, as well as a natural desire to give a good impression in a public forum, can be significant motivating forces.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">Considerable interference with memory is also introduced in civil litigation by the procedure of preparing for trial. A witness is asked to make a statement, often (as in the present case) when a long time has already elapsed since the relevant events. The statement is usually drafted for the witness by a lawyer who is inevitably conscious of the significance for the issues in the case of what the witness does nor does not say. The statement is made after the witness's memory has been ‘refreshed’ by reading documents. The documents considered often include statements of case and other argumentative material as well as documents which the witness did not see at the time or which came into existence after the events which he or she is being asked to recall. The statement may go through several iterations before it is finalised. Then, usually months later, the witness will be asked to re-read his or her statement and review documents again before giving evidence in court. The effect of this process is to establish in the mind of the witness the matters recorded in his or her own statement and other written material, whether they be true or false, and to cause the witness's memory of events to be based increasingly on this material and later interpretations of it rather than on the original experience of the events.”  </p>

My observations have also been specifically endorsed by two academic psychologists in a published paper: see Howe and Knott, “<span style="font-style:italic">The fallibility of memory in judicial processes: Lessons from the past and their modern consequences</span>” (2015) Memory, 23, 633 at 651-3.

What gets <span style="font-style:italic">retrieved </span>later from that memory is determined by that same multitude of factors that contributed to encoding as well as what drives the recollection of the event.  Specifically, what gets retold about an experience depends on whom one is talking to and what the purpose is of remembering that particular event (e.g., telling a friend, relaying an experience to a therapist, telling the police about an event). Moreover, what gets remembered is reconstructed from the remnants of what was originally stored; that is, what we remember is constructed from whatever remains in memory following any forgetting or interference from new experiences that may have occurred across the interval between storing and retrieving a particular experience. Because the contents of our memories for experiences involve the active manipulation (during encoding), integration with pre-existing information (during consolidation), and reconstruction (during retrieval) of that information, memory is, by definition, fallible at best and unreliable at worst.” </p>

First, numerous experiments have shown that, when new information is encoded which is related to the self, subsequent memory for that information is improved compared with the encoding of other information.  Second, there is a powerful tendency for people to remember past events concerning themselves in a self-enhancing light.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Although that case concerned a disputed alleged oral contract formed in a public house, and this has different subject matter, those statements about memory are notable. Judges will rarely, if ever, take directly challenged evidence of fact at immediate face value, regardless of the subject matter of a particular case. The process of weighing up and considering different factual evidence involves considering, on any particular point, all the evidence in each direction including the contents of any documents. In <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Blue v Ashley, </span>the central issues were what was said at a meeting the Horse &amp; Groom on 24 January 2013 and the only sources were the recollections of those people who were present. In other cases, there may be documentary references not only to what was said or happened, but to other documents and e mails, as well as the contents of actual documents themselves, such as (in these proceedings) the SPMC and the NTC, together with covering letters and so on. The confusing and contradictory nature of the documents produced by the Post Office to SPMs, and the difference in terminology when referring to a particular document, together with the same terminology to refer to different documents, does not assist the Post Office in its factual case against the different Lead Claimants in this trial. Any recipient of a particular document needs to know that it is supposed to be included in an envelope, in order sensibly to have any chance of pointing out that it is not (if it has been missed). Further, if an incoming SPM is expected to familiarise themselves with the terms of a document held by the outgoing SPM, basic common sense requires that the incoming SPM is actually told this important information.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">It is for this reason that the Post Office has had to resort to an inferential case on contract formation for those SPMs who are Lead Claimants who did not sign that standard term document. The approach of the Post Office can be summarised as follows: the outgoing SPM would have had his or her contract available; you would, should and probably did ask to see it; if you had, it would (or might) have been shown to you; therefore you had knowledge of the terms, and contracted with the Post Office on that basis. The weaknesses in such an approach are in my judgment obvious, and numerous. When the formal document of Appointment, presented for signature on the day of transfer, does not even specifically refer to the SPMC and uses the ambiguous phrase “terms of my agreement” then the difficulties for the Post Office become even more pronounced, in my judgment.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I consider that it is likely that the Post Office itself must have realised internally that the processes for contract formation using the SPMC were inadequate, and that is why the procedure under the NTC became more conventional, with both parties having to sign it, and it being provided to an incoming SPM in advance. The Acknowledgement of Appointment still referred to documents that did not exist, and was not entirely clear, but it was at least an improvement.  </p>

The first is some of Mr Beal’s more extreme claims that the drafting of the NTC was designed to replicate a SPM’s responsibility for losses under the SPMC, and that it was also intended by the Post Office that the contract with the NFSP would be made public. Neither of those claims bear analysis when compared with the detailed drafting of each of those documents, both of which had been carefully drafted no doubt with the assistance of sophisticated legal advisers. The second is Mrs Van den Bogerd. She tried to give me the impression that the detailed cross examination about Mr Abdulla was something she could not really deal with because she had no detailed knowledge in the witness box. This was simply not correct; she had signed a very detailed witness statement just a few days before for the Horizon Issues trial which dealt with the matters being put to her about Mr Abdulla in considerable detail. I find that she was simply trying to mislead me. She also explained a wholesale absence in her witness statement of highly relevant matters as being due to a restriction on length of that document, or if not a restriction, a desire to </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">keep her witness statement short. That answer was simply disingenuous. This is a very significant and high-profile dispute for the Post Office. There was no such restriction on length, and I do not believe that, of all the witnesses, she felt there was any need to keep her statement short. The non-inclusion of that evidence within her statement is explained, in my judgment, by the Post Office’s approach to the litigation. The Post Office has appeared determined to make this litigation, and therefore resolution of this intractable dispute, as difficult and expensive as it can. Mrs Van den Bogerd did not provide any reference in her witness statement to matters unfavourable to the Post Office case. That witness statement was her evidence in chief, and therefore supposed to be the whole story. I find that she did not do so, because those matters (which Mr Green put to her in some detail) were highly unfavourable to the Post Office’s case. She was simply not prepared to volunteer such matters in a witness statement. She was only grudgingly prepared to accept them in cross-examination, after some time.  </p>

When even a Post Office auditor, Mr Longbottom, attempts to go beneath this veneer, properly to investigate an unexplained shortfall, and finds that he is not provided with the documents he considers necessary, very considerable doubts arise about the approach adopted at the Post Office to its overall control of information.  </p>

She remains, apparently genuinely, of the view that none of the different claims by the 589 Claimants have common issues or themes between them, and every single case is simply factually different, with no connection between them.

But they remain steadfastly committed, in their collective psyche, to the Post Office party view, despite such steps having been taken as amendments to the Camelot software using the Ping fix, and the contents of some of their own internal documents that suggest to the contrary. They give me the impression that they simply cannot allow themselves to consider the possibility that the Post Office may be wrong, as the consequences of doing so are too significant to contemplate.  </p>

The Branch Trading Statement is treated by the Post Office as having the status of an agreed and settled account between agent and principal.

The first is that, as clearly identified in that document, the Post Office recognised as long as ten years ago that SPMs “are forced to accept debts they do not agree with at Branch Trading”. The phrase “at Branch Trading” means at the end of the branch trading period. The second is, in relation to the question “what does settle centrally mean?” the answer is clearly given as follows:  </p>

They were also consistent with the evidence given by the Post Office witnesses during their cross-examination. They are, however, both directly contrary to the case being run by the Post Office in these proceedings as at the beginning of the trial. In the early phase of the Common Issues trial at least, it was expressly submitted by the Post Office – and also put to some of the Lead Claimants – that a SPM did <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> have to accept debts with which they did not agree at the end of a branch trading period. That proposition is plainly incorrect in fact. It is recognised as being incorrect in fact on the terms of the Post Office’s own internal documents.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The second reason that I find those statements so notable is that the Post Office spent an enormous amount of time in the trial before me attempting both to challenge and put to witnesses, and indeed persuade me in submissions, that if a SPM decided to “settle centrally” then that meant the item was put in dispute. In other words, that the phrase “settle centrally” did <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> signify acceptance of debt liability. This proposition is also plainly incorrect in fact. Even Mrs Van den Bogerd accepted that if an item were “settled centrally” it was treated by the Post Office as a debt owed to the Post Office by the SPM. It would be subject to debt recovery procedures, and if a SPM ignored the letters of demand and did not pay, then the best that the SPM could expect would be a repayment plan. That, of course, would still lead to the SPM paying the sum in question, simply over a longer period. </p>

The Lead Claimants’ evidence made it clear that just getting through to the Helpline was an achievement in itself, and when this was finally accomplished, the experience would be variable at best, and does not seem to have come close to resolving any of the disputes. Some operators would assist with getting Horizon to permit rollover into the next trading period by suggesting “work arounds”. These “work arounds” did not resolve disputed items. No particular investigation appears, in the case of any of the six Lead Claimants, to have been initiated by reporting a dispute to the Helpline. An item “settled centrally” would be subject to debt recovery processes by the Post Office regardless of what the particular Lead Claimant did regarding the Helpline. Mr Carpenter said he thought the Helpline’s role was to direct a query to a particular department within the Post Office, but that was not simply made out on the evidence before me.  </p>

Mrs Stubbs has been pressing for many years to find out the outcome of whatever “investigation” was in fact performed in her case. In both cases, the Helpline had been notified by each of these Lead Claimants. In neither case could the Post Office produce and put to each of these Lead Claimants, or show the court, the end product of any such investigation.  </p>

What was presented to the court by the Post Office in respect of disputes notified to the Helpline show that, for the most part, initially the SPM in these individual cases was told they would have to pay the shortfall. Even when persistent, all that would happen is the sum would be “settled centrally” and after a period of a few weeks the SPM would be chased for the Post Office for that sum as though it were a debt. Detailed findings of fact as to this must however wait for a later trial.    </p>

Mitigation is a word that means moderation or reduction in effect, as well as other synonyms. If a party mitigates the loss it has suffered, this means steps are taken that reduce the effect of that loss. In the sense the term was being used by the Post Office’s witnesses, it meant that the financial impact of the shortfall, discrepancy or unexplained loss would be “mitigated”, by the SPM being given time to pay. Payment in instalments, usually 12 months, may be offered, instead of the payment being demanded instantly.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">This approach had two very fundamental problems. Firstly, it confused primary liability (whether the SPM was liable for the disputed sums at all) with mitigation of the effect upon the SPM of owing the Post Office those sums. Mitigation only has any relevance if primary liability is first established. That step was ignored completely by the Post Office. Secondly, because that first step was ignored, there was no separate resolution to the dispute; a blanket assumption was made that the sums were indeed owed by the SPM. Thirdly, if there were subsequent disputed sums, these were dealt with the same way, namely the same assumption was made again. In fact, the SPM’s position was even worse for subsequent shortfalls, as they would already have been given time to pay for amounts for which the Post Office considered they were also liable. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">These problems led to what Mr Green described as a “debt trap”. The sequence would go as follows. The Horizon system would show that there was a discrepancy at the branch, which so far as the SPM was concerned would have arisen through unexplained shortfalls and discrepancies. These were challenged through the Helpline. That SPM disputed that the sums were due. Because of the way that the Post Office approached such disputed items, these were treated as due and owing by the SPM to the Post Office in any event, in other words as non-disputed debts. The most that a SPM could expect from the Post Office was time to pay off the amount, over 12 months, deducted from their future remuneration. The only alternative the SPM would have would be giving notice themselves, which would bring to an end their appointment as a SPM, and they would in any event (so far as the Post Office was concerned) still owe the disputed sum. Accordingly, the SPM effectively had no option but to accept the offer of time to pay – it was their only real alternative. This scenario is amply demonstrated by the position in which Mrs Stockdale found herself. She was told matters were being investigated, but then sums said to be due were demanded from her in any event. The most she could obtain was time to pay. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Their position would then, in financial terms, simply become increasingly worse for any subsequent unexplained discrepancies and shortfalls. The amount owed would simply increase in size. This downward spiral would continue until, at some point, the amount would be too large for the Post Office to deal with in instalments; or the Post Office would perform another audit; or the Post Office’s patience would come to an end. Suspension would then follow. Throughout the entire sequence the Post Office would treat the sums as undisputed debts.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The whole of this litigation is aimed at resolving the disputes involved between the different SPMs and the Post Office. However, it remains the case that there was no separate mechanism established at any stage to resolve the disputed shortfalls and discrepancies. As the flow chart at Appendix 5 demonstrates, unless the SPM could identify with precision the day and time of the fault he or she alleged, the Post Office will not assist. This is clear from the entry “Can agent provide specific day and timeframe for alleged fault?”, where if the answer is “No” the following entry states “Advise unable to progress further until can do so.” This is a 2012/2013 document, but I find as a fact that it correctly identifies the Post Office’s approach to this issue raised by SPMs from the introduction of Horizon onwards. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Given the amount of information available to a SPM on Horizon, it is difficult to see how an SPM in this position could ever satisfy the Post Office by providing exact details of the fault, or product, that had led to the unexplained shortfall or discrepancy. The evidence of all the Lead Claimants was that they were unable to do so. In any event, by confusing mitigation with primary liability, the Post Office’s approach meant that the most favourable outcome any SPM could hope to achieve for disputed shortfalls and discrepancies was time to pay the disputed sums. The only exceptions to this were when, occasionally, items were “written off” with no explanation which is what happened to Mr Bates, or when a SPM simply refused to pay, which is what occurred with Mrs Stubbs. However, even Mrs Stubbs paid the sums she disputed in 2000, before her awareness of the situation was as developed as it became, and when the sums claimed by the Post Office were far more modest. This means that, even for disputed items going back as far as the year 2000, this litigation is the first time that there will be any independent consideration of disputed items showing in the branch accounts for the vast majority of the Claimants. </p>

Firstly, a great many material facts were simply not agreed by the parties. The only way forward therefore was to decide the contested issues of fact. Secondly, there are six different Lead Claimants, each with their own different factual situations concerning contract formation. It was also the case that the way in which the Branch Trading Statement came to be produced, and what options a SPM had at the end of a branch trading period, was in issue, at least until after the end of the trial when Appendix 3 was produced. Even then, given the potential public importance of the issues to other cases, I have considered it beneficial to identify in detail what a Branch Trading Statement is or was, and how it would come to be generated by a SPM who wished to dispute the accounting information from Horizon in respect of his or her branch. In any event it was necessary to do so, given the subject matter of Common Issues 12 and 13.  </p>

It should also be remembered that Horizon did not exist until 2000. Although when I come to consider Contractual Formation in Part G for Mr Bates and Mrs Stubbs, the question of the SPMC governing their contract with the Post Office is in issue, the questions of construction of the terms SPMC arises anyway. The Post Office did not identify in its Opening or Closing Submissions any variation to the SPMC as at the date of the introduction of Horizon. The Post Office maintained that the underlying manuals were changed, and also maintained that these had contractual effect. However, neither party contended that those manuals change the terms within the SPMC which require construing as part of the Common Issues trial.  </p>

There is no doubt that the submission of false accounts is a serious matter, and the Theft Act 1968 specifically identifies false accounting as a separate criminal offence. However, this final entry in the Factual Matrix by the Post Office, the relevance of which to the Common Issues is disputed, is so general that it serves no purpose. I therefore propose to deal with this point as follows. False accounting is a criminal offence, and although concealment of losses is not an element of that offence, in many instances concealment will be involved. Concealment of losses by someone committing fraud might be discovered after many months, and on occasion even years, dependent upon the individual circumstances of a particular fraud or frauds. </p>

I asked Mr Beal, who was the person within the Post Office who dealt with the NFSP, when the MOU was published on the website. He could not remember.

Also, the NFSP’s own website was amended during the trial. At some point between this matter being raised in cross-examination with Mr Beal, and the question of documents evidencing dates being re-visited at the end of the evidence, someone at the NFSP had specifically altered the NFSP website. I deal with this at [594] below. What they did not know, when whoever it was did this, was that counsel for the Lead Claimants had printed the NFSP website page as at the beginning of the trial. It was therefore clear that the change had been made, and also clear that it was done during the trial. I was given no evidence by anyone from the Post Office about why this was done, and done in terms that suited the Post Office’s case on this point. I find this behaviour highly suspicious. It also undermines, yet further, the claim by the Post Office that the NFSP is independent.  </p>

It is therefore the case that were the NFSP to decide to support the litigation, which undoubtedly risks damaging the Post Office’s reputation if the Claimants were to win, the NFSP would not only put itself in breach of the terms of the GFA but face having grants “clawed back”, that is repaid by the NFSP to the Post Office.  </p>

It may have been after the date of Mr Beal’s cross-examination, which was 15 November 2018. It must certainly have been after 12 October 2018. I refused to make such an order, because this would have been an order against the NFSP, who are not a party to the proceedings. It would also have been a distraction to have had a contested hearing against a non-party, though if highly relevant different considerations would apply.  I did however make an order, limited in scope, in respect of any e mails between Mr Beal and the NFSP within the period 12 October 2018 and 26 November 2018. That did not shed any further light on the matter one way or the other. I consider that it is likely that the passage was added after Mr Beal’s cross-examination, but either way, adding a sentence to the website of the NFSP to bolster the Post Office’s position before me simply adds to my view (which I reached on the basis of Mr Beal’s cross-examination and the documents) that the NFSP is not independent at all.  </p>

It is not only dependent upon the Post Office for its funding, but that funding is subject to stringent and detailed conditions that enable the Post Office to restrict the activities of the NFSP. The Post Office effectively controls the NFSP. The agreement also enables the Post Office to seek repayment of funds already paid to the NFSP. The NFSP is a company limited by guarantee and there was no evidence that it had any other source of funding. It is not likely to be able to repay any funds “clawed back” by the Post Office and therefore its very existence depends upon it not giving the Post Office grounds to challenge its activities. There is also evidence before the court that the NFSP has, in the past, put its own interests and the funding of its future above the interests of its members, in the e mail to which I have referred. In those circumstances, the fact that the NFSP does not support the Claimants in this litigation is entirely to be expected. </p>

The two entities (the Post Office and the NFSP) were certainly not in a commercial bargaining position. This may, or may not, explain the difference in wording regarding how losses are dealt with in the two different documents, the SPMC and the NTC. So far as the Post Office’s “interpretative spectrum” is concerned, the SPMC and the NTC were probably both professionally drafted, and certainly the NTC was.

That assertion is verging on insulting the intelligence of anyone who has read the GFA itself. The drafting of the actual document itself – which has obviously been carefully done, by highly skilled legal advisers – is directly to the contrary. The assertion is also contrary to the Post Office’s own initial responses to the Freedom of Information requests, from the very team at the Post Office whose specific role in life is to deal with such requests. </p>

The documents he had received as of 31 March 1998 were the ARS 43 and ARS 44 documents, which stated “The Subpostmaster is personally responsible for all losses or gains incurred to Post Office cash or stock. Losses must normally be made good immediately they are discovered. Gains are normally retained by the Subpostmaster.” SERV 135, which referred to clauses of which many SPMs were said to be unaware, did refer to clause 12.1 which stated responsibility for losses caused by fault (which the clauses in the ARS 43 did not) but he did not receive the SERV 135 until the day he acquired the branch in May, some weeks after the parties are agreed that the contract was formed.  </p>

This is for two reasons. Firstly, the ARS 43 set out responsibility for losses. Applying conventional principles for construction, namely objective meaning of the words using the background knowledge available to the parties, the phrase “personally responsible for all losses or gains incurred” means, in my judgment, losses caused by fault on the part of the SPM. The intention of the parties, objectively ascertained, was not to impose strict liability upon an SPM. Secondly, if I am wrong about that, and the term in the ARS 43 did not form part of the agreement between the Post Office and Mr Bates, then there would be an implied term, necessary for business efficacy, to like effect of Section 12 Clause 12 as I have construed it above. This term would therefore be, using wording that reflects my findings above: </p>

Therefore, Mr Bates is responsible for all losses caused through his own negligence, carelessness or error, even though I have found he did not have the SPMC and did not contract on that basis. His scope of responsibility is therefore the same.  </p>

It is also the date upon which she agreed with Mr Woolbridge, who was plainly acting for the Post Office for these purposes, that she would become the SPM at that branch, from that date onwards. She signed a document on that date providing her bank details and the Post Office paid her from that date. There was no express term dealing with losses in her case, as she received no ARS 43. The terms of the SPMC did not apply; she did not have it, and its existence had not been brought to her attention.

She is also responsible in the same way for her assistants, in the same way that I have construed the express clause. In both cases, however, the implied term requires that deficiencies due to such losses would be made good within a reasonable period. There is no business necessity that such losses be made good “without delay”. What the length of a reasonable period would be, would depend upon the amount of the losses caused by the fault of the SPM. For very small losses of a few pounds such a period would be immediately; for losses of tens of thousands of pounds, the reasonable period would be longer.  </p>

Whatever the number, for any in respect of whom there is no express term dealing with responsibility for losses, there is the need for an implied term, and I find that it is one to the same effect as [601] above, and that they are responsible for all losses caused through their own negligence, carelessness or error. Responsibility for assistants, for such Claimants who did not contract upon the terms of the SPMC (regardless of how many there are) is also covered by an implied term to like effect for reasons of business necessity. They are also both strictly responsible for the safe custody of cash and stock, and were required to keep them in a place of security.

The purpose of interpretation is to identify what the parties have agreed, not what the court thinks that they should have agreed. Experience shows that it is by no means unknown for people to enter into arrangements which are ill-advised, even ignoring the benefit of wisdom of hindsight, and it is not the function of a court when interpreting an agreement to relieve a party from the consequences of his imprudence or poor advice. Accordingly, when interpreting a contract a judge should avoid re-writing it in an attempt to assist an unwise party or to penalise an astute party.” </p>

Indeed, the uncontroverted evidence of the Post Office itself is that even if a SPM had sought some specific amendments to the terms of the SPMC or NTC, these would not have been tolerated at all. There was simply no negotiation possible. If the spectrum is one which has highly detailed provisions at one end, and informal brief and loosely drafted terms at the other, then these are detailed terms. However, it would be wrong to approach the matter as though they were at the same place in the spectrum as carefully negotiated and/or professionally drafted by both parties (whether represented or not).

The “rule” (if rule is the correct word) requires ambiguity in a provision – for example, in an exemption clause - to be resolved against the party who put the clause forward and relies upon it. The rule has been subject to criticism, and is something of a historical remnant. The first and most difficult aspect of the rule is determining in a commercial contract which party is in fact the <span style="font-style:italic">proferens</span>. Here that is not so difficult, because it was only the Post Office who ever drafted any of the terms (subject to the involvement of the NFSP, which certainly was not occupying the position of an opposite negotiating party).

That term is distinct from “safe custody” because losses could occur other than through a failure of keeping physical things safe. One example, beloved of both sides in this litigation and many witnesses, and used multiple times in the evidence, was the book of stamps. The archetypal book of first class stamps and its chequered life was often used in the evidence to illustrate a particular point. Continuing that example here, a book of stamps could simply be lost by an SPM because it was not put away safely, or because it was inadvertently put in the waste bin, or inadvertently given to a customer who bought two books of stamps, but was given three books by mistake (and did not notice at the time). This loss would become apparent at the end of a trading period. The SPM would be liable under both Section 12 Clause 5 and also Section 12 Clause 12, which stated: </p>

An example would be an incorrect entry in a savings book. A customer may deposit £30, but this might be recorded as £300 – this example of the “extra nought” was used by at least one interviewer, Mr Carpenter, in his evidence. The customer in this example would leave the branch with a notional gain of £270 in their savings book, to which he or she would not, given the amount of money deposited, be entitled, but the mistake in the book would mean the record showed that they were. So far as the branch was concerned, this would become evident at the end of the relevant trading period (as the cash in the branch would be £270 less than it ought to be, as the customer had only paid in £30 and not £300). That £270 would have to be made good from somewhere, and given the error would be on the part of the SPM, it would be his or her responsibility.

Firstly, the “responsibility” element is not contractually dealt with in the same way for losses generally in Section 12 Clause 12, as it is for the safe custody of cash and physical stock in Section 12 Clause 5. Fault on the part of the SPM is necessary for losses that arose other than through cash and physical stock going missing because they were not kept safely. For the latter, the SPM was agreed to be “strictly responsible”, a phrase not used in Section 12 Clause 12. I do not consider that the Post Office is correct in seeking to have Section 12 Clause 12 construed as making the SPM liable for “shortfalls/deficiencies except in specified circumstances, creating exceptions to liability”. Such an approach would require a blanket imposition of liability, <span style="font-style:italic">unless</span> the SPM could bring the loss within an exception available to him or her.

But as you will have seen from our submissions, Post Office accepts that we have the persuasive burden of showing there is a loss arising obviously from a shortfall or deficiency.

This is because it is also maintained by the Post Office that such a shortfall cannot and does not exist, hence there is no such thing. Accordingly, by entirely circular reasoning, the Post Office contends that it <span style="font-style:italic">can</span> rely upon Section 12 Clause 12 for what the Claimants called Horizon generated shortfalls, <span style="font-style:italic">unless</span> the SPM could show that such deficiencies were <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> due to his or her negligence, carelessness or error.

It is not for a SPM to demonstrate that there was no negligence, carelessness or error on his or her part. It is for the Post Office to demonstrate that there is. It is only if the Post Office can demonstrate that there <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> a loss which falls within the scope of the clause, that it is entitled to rely upon the clause to establish liability on the part of the SPM for that loss. This means that the wording of the clause imposes a contractual burden upon the Post Office to do that. This is clear from the natural meaning of the words. The fact that the Post Office has in fact chosen to adopt a blanket assumption of liability upon SPMs for shortfalls and discrepancies, by creating a new category for the trial (of Horizon-generated shortfalls), saying the clause does not include these, but it is for a SPM to demonstrate the shortfall and/or discrepancy falls into that new category, essentially amounts to the same thing. The Post Office contends for a construction of the clause that requires a SPM to demonstrate that shortfalls and/or discrepancies fall outside the clause.  </p>

The way in which the accounts were prepared after Horizon was introduced required a SPM to make a Branch Trading Statement even if it contained disputed items. It was also produced as part of the operation of the Horizon system. The auditors used Horizon to identify what the Post Office expected to find in the branch in terms of cash and stock. Shortfalls and discrepancies were identified against Horizon in all circumstances. Yet further, Mrs Stockdale did not even sign the Branch Trading Statement, and was careful not to do so. Finally, SPMs had to close a branch trading period every four (and sometimes five) weeks by producing a Branch Trading Statement in order to “roll over” into the next branch trading period and open the branch and continue trading. Whether the Post Office is entitled to rely upon the accounts, or evidence obtained in the audit or otherwise from Horizon is part of the dispute between the parties, but it does not affect the contractual construction of the clause. I consider there is a contractual burden upon the Post Office to demonstrate that the loss for which it seeks to hold a SPM responsible was caused by the negligence, carelessness or error of the SPM.  </p>

For a SPM to demonstrate they were not at fault, if there was a loss, could be verging on nigh on impossible. Firstly, they would have to concentrate upon and analyse all of the branch records for every single transaction within the particular trading period. That would be an onerous burden for a single SPM. Secondly, those records would only be between the branch and the Post Office; SPMs have no access to data between the Post Office and its clients, and are not able to obtain it. A further factor – though far less important - is all of this would have to be done whilst the SPM was complying with their obligation to open and run the branch during working hours during the week.

Secondly, that workload would be borne by the (or a) relevant department, and not by one sole individual, who would be trying to run a branch Post Office during normal business hours at the same time. Thirdly – and in contractual terms this is less important, but it is an implication of a rival construction, and hence appropriate to consider it - the Post Office is responsible for compiling evidence for prosecutions for offences of false accounting and theft by SPMs. As such, it bears the burden of proof of demonstrating to the appropriate criminal standard that conduct by SPMs is dishonest. It must therefore have the ability to demonstrate how a loss has been caused.   </p>

Secondly, although the second part of the provision simply states “caused by his Assistants”, the main clause of the sentence is the first part. This expressly limits and defines “cause” by reference to the negligence, carelessness and error of the SPM. It would have been, in my judgment, surplus verbiage to have added “and also for losses of all kinds caused by his Assistants’ negligence, careless and error”. “Cause” in the second part of the sentence, which I consider (in grammatical terms) to be a subordinate clause to the main clause, should be read in conjunction with, and is limited by, the provisions concerning cause in that main clause which requires fault.  </p>

If Horizon were to be affected by a bug that caused it to inject £100 into the derived cash figure for the branch, it may then show an apparent shortfall of £100, but that would not be the result of either a physical loss or a transaction loss at the branch, and there would be no “deficiency” within the meaning of clause 12. The SPM is liable for shortfalls that result from losses in the branch, not for whatever number may be shown on Horizon….. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">12 Clause 12. This argument mounted in its Opening verges on misrepresenting the Post Office’s own case. It wholly ignores that the Post Office effectively denies that there can be losses “caused by Horizon” because it is “robust”. It also wholly ignores that Section 12 Clause 12 in the SPMC is precisely the clause relied upon by the Post Office to impose liability upon the four Lead Claimants when they were chased for unexplained discrepancies and shortfalls, which they maintained had been caused by Horizon. Further, it ignores the fact that there is no other separate clause within the SPMC which would make a SPM liable for a “loss caused by Horizon” as defined or explained by the Post Office. This section of the Post Office Opening ends with the sentence “If Horizon fails to reflect the transactions that were conducted in the branch, its error does not create liability”. The Claimants’ whole case is that the figures shown on Horizon did not reflect the transactions conducted in the branch, yet the Post Office still used the loss provisions of the SPMC to demand sums from SPMs, and on many occasions, suspend and terminate their engagement.  </p>

A Horizon generated figure that was incorrect due to a bug or software glitch would not be a real and actual loss. However, if the Post Office has done that, and satisfied the contractual burden upon it to show that it has suffered a loss or such a loss has occurred, then the SPM is liable, unless it can be brought into the sole exception. I consider that the contractual burden would then be upon the SPM to bring that loss (demonstrated by the Post Office) within the exception. In most situations, a loss caused by a physical crime such as a robbery or burglary would not require enormous consideration as to how the loss arose. It would be obvious. Criminal acts of Personnel (which is a defined term, and means assistants) are not caught by the exception, so if (say) an assistant was stealing from the Post Office, the SPM would be liable for those losses. </p>

It is certainly correct that SPMs are not employees, and so the law does not imply terms as a necessary incident of the specific relationship between the Post Office and an SPM being one of employer/employee. The nature of the relationship is not entirely free of some characteristics that are found in employer/employee relations, for example SPMs could qualify, under the SPMC, for payment during holidays (although it is an allowance, and is not called “holiday pay”), as long as they provided at least 18 hours of personal service in their branch per week. The interview process included ascertainment by the Post Office of whether this amount of personal service was intended, in which case it would be required. All the Post Office witnesses who were asked about it were clear that the Post Office was very sensitive about SPMs <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> being seen as employees. However, notwithstanding that, I do not consider that the law imposes into these contracts implied terms as a necessary incident in the same way as employment contracts. That statement must however be subject to my conclusion on Common Issue 1.  </p>

In that case, under the terms of four commercial leases, each lease contained a break clause allowing the tenant to terminate the lease on 24 January 2012. This had to be done by giving the landlords six months’ prior written notice, provided that, on the break date, there were no arrears of rent and the tenant had paid the landlords a break premium equivalent to one year’s rent. In early July 2011 the tenant served a break notice on the landlords. It then paid a full quarter’s rent in December 2011, and the break premium a few weeks later. As a result of those payments the break notice was effective and the lease determined on 24 January 2012. However, the tenant then claimed repayment of rent which it had already paid for the period after the termination of the lease on the basis that a term entitling it to such repayment should be implied into the lease. Morgan J allowed the claim at [2013] EWHC 1279 (Ch). The landlords appealed, and the Court </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">This case decided that a term would be implied into a detailed commercial contract only if that were necessary to give the contract business efficacy, or so obvious that it went without saying. The implication of a term was not critically dependent on proof of an actual intention of the parties when negotiating the contract but was concerned with what notional reasonable people, in the position of the parties at the time at which they had been contracting, would have agreed; and that it was a necessary but not sufficient condition for implying a term that it appeared fair or that the court considered that the parties would have agreed it if it had been suggested to them. This test for the implication of terms is referred to by the Post Office, usefully, as the test of necessity. When I refer to business necessity, or implication of a term being required for business efficacy, that is the test that I am applying.

The agreed introductory wording to that Common Issue is potentially misleading, because it states “Which, if any, of the terms in the paragraphs listed below were implied terms <span style="text-decoration:underline">(or incidents of such implied terms)</span> of the contracts between Post Office and Subpostmasters?” (emphasis added) </p>

This is because, if the correct conclusion is that the contracts between the Post Office and the SPMs are relational contracts, then a great many (if not all) of the “implied terms” at Common Issue 2 are not individual implied terms in themselves, but “incidents”, examples or consequences of the operation of duties of good faith, fair dealing, transparency, cooperation, and trust and confidence (if that is what relational contracts are). </p>

One manifestation of the flexible approach referred to by McKendrick and Lord Steyn is that, in certain categories of long-term contract, the court may be more willing to imply a duty to co-operate or, in the language used by Leggatt J in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Yam Seng PTE v International Trade Corp Ltd</span> [2013] EWHC 111 (QB) at [131], [142] and [145], a duty of good faith.  <span style="text-decoration:underline">Leggatt J had in mind contracts between those whose</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">relationship is characterised as a fiduciary one and those involving a longer-term</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">relationship between parties who make a substantial commitment.</span> The contracts in question involved a high degree of communication, co-operation and predictable performance based on mutual trust and confidence and expectations of loyalty “which are not legislated for in the express terms of the contract but are implicit in the parties’ understanding and necessary to give business efficacy to the arrangements”.  He gave as examples franchise agreements and long-term distribution agreements.  Even in the case of such agreements, however, the position will depend on the terms of the particular contract.

In particular, I drew attention to a category of contract in which the parties are committed to collaborating with each other, typically on a long term basis, in ways which respect the spirit and objectives of their venture but which they have not tried to specify, and which it may be impossible to specify, exhaustively in a written contract. Such 'relational' contracts involve trust and confidence but of a different kind from that involved in fiduciary relationships. The trust is not in the loyal subordination by one party of its own interests to those of another. It is trust that the other party will act with integrity and in a spirit of cooperation.

The claimant provided the content, and the defendant converted that into an electronic application, which was jointly published and marketed. When the parties fell out, and in anticipation of their joint venture coming to an end, the claimant secretly accessed the defendant's database and downloaded material, later using this downloaded material to continue selling the electronic training manuals. One issue was whether the secret download was a breach of contract. There was no express term of the contract which prohibited it. But Mr Richard Spearman QC, sitting as a deputy High Court judge, characterised the joint venture agreement as a relational contract and held that there was an implied term of the contract requiring good faith in its performance.

The title was “Judges and Professors – Ships passing in the night?” and Lord Neuberger made clear what I believe to be non-controversial, that the historic hostility of judges to the views of academics is long gone, and academic opinion is of very great assistance. </p>

This means that the parties must refrain from conduct which in the relevant context would be regarded as commercially unacceptable by reasonable and honest people. An implied duty of good faith does not mean solely that the parties must be honest.  </p>

Its terms do not depend upon the subjective intention of the parties, but upon what was communicated by words or conduct. An objective observer looking at what Boots and Hamsard said and did would be bound to conclude that they recognised the necessity for such an immediate, interim contractual arrangement (and that, so far as it was necessary to give commercial effect to that interim arrangement, would refer to the financial and operational terms of the 2007 Agreement).

One of the characteristics of the contract in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">D&amp;G Cars v Essex Police Authority </span>which the judge found to be a particular feature which warranted the inclusion of the implied term of good faith, was that the claimant was performing certain acts (in that case, recovery of vehicles) on behalf of a law enforcement agency.

Further, I find that the notice provisions do not undermine the correctly ascertained objective intention of the parties when contracting, namely that the post of SPM at a particular branch was intended by both parties to be a long term one.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I reject these arguments. Firstly, the <span style="font-style:italic">Stirling v Maitland</span> term deals with inhibition and prevention. Simply because it is agreed by the parties that they would not inhibit or prevent one another does not amount, in my judgment, to coming even close to the type of relationship considered to exist for a relational contract. Secondly, there is more to an obligation of good faith than necessary co-operation, as I have explained. Co-operation is part of it, but I do not consider it is limited to co-operation. The Necessary Co-operation term only goes, as the name suggests, to co-operation that is necessary. Even if an obligation of good faith were limited to co-operation (which I find it is not) such a term of co-operation would be wider than simply necessary cooperation. Finally, I very much formed the impression that this argument was a forensic device based on an overly technical and unjustified pleading point.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I should also deal with any suggestion by the Post Office that by agreeing or admitting these implied terms, the Claimants somehow shut out or undermined their arguments on relational contracts. This Group Litigation is hotly contested and has some very fundamental and highly contentious legal issues dividing the parties. I do not intend to decide it on a technical pleading point in any event, and certainly not this one, which I do not consider to be justified. I find that the two implied terms that were admitted do not mean that, applying the test I have identified above, these contracts were not relational ones. </p>

However, it would be wrong to conclude that they all are. In my judgment, it is necessary to consider each of them individually to consider firstly, are they simply consequential upon my finding that these are relational contracts; and secondly, if not, are they to be implied terms because they are necessary to give business efficacy to the contracts, in other words, under the first category as set out by Baroness Hale in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Geys v Société Générale. </span>It must also be remembered that the question of whether or not a term is necessary is to be judged at the date the contract is made.

The question posed at [93] of the judgment assumes the premise which it is intended to prove or support. It is not based upon the Agreement as drafted.

The final sub-clause should be “in circumstances where the Defendant was itself in material breach of duty in respect of the matters which the Defendant considered gave it the right to suspend”. A similar narrowing of the implied term at (o) should be to the same phraseology, so that term reads “in circumstances where the Defendant was itself in material breach of duty in respect of the matters which the Defendant considered gave it the right to terminate”. The reason for this narrowing in both instances is because it is where the Post Office itself is in material breach in respect of the matters it considers gives rise to the right to suspend, and terminate, that is important. It is this that is the necessary incident of the implied duty of good faith. It is not necessary for the Post Office not to suspend (or terminate) a SPM if the Post Office was in material breach in respect of different matters entirely unrelated to the ones under consideration as justifying suspension (or termination).  </p>

The relevant term that is required for business efficacy is that the Post Office provide adequate training and support for its SPMs when it imposed new working practices, but particularly new systems such as the Horizon system. It is also necessary for business efficacy that the Horizon system, which was provided by the Post Office, be reasonably fit for purpose, including any or adequate error repellency (which is a technical computer term meaning the way the system deals with errors).  </p>

I do not consider that implied term extends to including matters which could affect the business, health and/or reputation of the SPMs. So far as business is concerned, SPMs were conducting a variety of other businesses on the same premises. These would all be different. Haberdashers, newsagents and convenience stores all featured in the evidence before me.

Indeed, the extreme nature of the Post Office’s denial of these implied terms (and in my judgment, a stance that is wholly incorrect in law) can be tested in a way consistent with common sense as follows. The Post Office’s submission amounts to one that it <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> contractually entitled to suspend and/or terminate SPMs arbitrarily, capriciously, irrationally and without reasonable or proper cause, and to exercise contractual powers other than honestly. The necessity for these terms to be implied to give business efficacy is clearly established, in my judgment, even if I am wrong about these contracts being relational and the consequences of that finding. </p>

The answer is that the implied duty of good faith applies to the exercise by the Post Office of all its contractual powers and discretions under both the SPMC and the NTC, including the four identified in this Common Issue. The four sub-paragraphs of Common Issue 3 all involve the exercise of powers, discretion and function by the Post Office, and are consequential upon the findings I have made in respect of Common Issues 1 and 2. However, I have found that the term at Common Issue 2(i)(t) does not extend to the business, health and reputation of the Claimants. Accordingly, Common Issue 3(d) should be similarly restricted to accounts only in the same way, and only therefore includes accounts (and therefore liability to alleged shortfalls).  </p>

However, when construed in its commercial context, there are, as a matter of construction, limits on that authority. If, as a matter of construction, there were no limits, the SPMs (the agents) would have the power to bind the Post Office in all respects. I do not accept that, when considering the words in the contract with the necessary background knowledge and applying the correct legal test, the answer could be otherwise than that there are limits on the SPMs’ authority.

The ability of an SPM to consider and investigate shortfalls and discrepancies was wholly different; in a paper-based system, they could do so, as the evidence of Mr Bates and Mrs Stubbs (which I accept) made clear. When Horizon was introduced, the process of accounting to the Post Office changed, and Branch Trading Statements upon which the Post Office seeks to rely cannot, in my judgment, be properly characterised as agreed accounts rendered to a principal (the Post Office) by its agent (the SPM) for two reasons. </p>

Section 12 Clause 4 required a SPM to keep these “in the form prescribed by” the Post Office. The Post Office required them to be prepared or “agreed” using Horizon, which as has been seen meant that even disputed items were included in the Branch Trading Statement. Common law principles cannot take precedence over what is actually agreed in the SPMC itself.  </p>

In this case, that happened when Horizon was introduced. The Manual was changed to require Horizon to be used within the branch. However, that does not entitle the Post Office to apply common law principles that apply to a freely agreed account rendered to a principal by an agent upon a Branch Trading Statement, even though the system instructed to the agent to be used would include disputed items.

During preparation of this judgment I invited the parties to draw to my attention any reference in their submissions that dealt with specific contractual variations to the SPMC that occurred on the introduction of Horizon. Given there were none, there were no references, but the Post Office correctly drew my attention to the Manual which it stated “had contractual effect”. I consider this is correct. The Manual did have contractual effect, and the Manual required the accounting approach I have explained to be adopted when Horizon was introduced. This therefore means, in my judgment, that the Branch Trading Statement did not have the status of an agreed account between agent and principal if it included disputed items. </p>

The NTC imposes an express obligation upon a SPM to account for and remit to the Post Office all monies collected, in accordance with the Manual. The Manual requires this to be done using the Horizon system. The Horizon system has (as has been extensively explored) no mechanism for disputing shortfalls, discrepancies, and TCs which are not agreed, other than through the Helpline, and even then the Branch Trading Statement is produced separately from those disputes – in other words, the Branch Trading Statement is the same whether component elements of it are disputed or not.  </p>

Because of the way that Horizon works, that “account” (the Branch Trading Statement) is not one agreed by the SPM in the sense of being either compiled, agreed or rendered by the agent, or in the sense of being a settled account. Indeed, in my judgment it does not come close to being such an account at all. The SPM has no option but to “agree” it, or “accept now”.  </p>

Indeed, the imposition of such a principle would, in my judgment, not only be entirely wrong and unfair, it would be contrary to the express terms of the contracts. The Horizon system, and the options available to a SPM who disagreed with (for example) a Transaction Correction, were designed by the Post Office and whichever company was responsible for the IT architecture. There was no ability on the part of any SPM to demonstrate there were “mistakes” in the “account” (that is to say the Branch Trading Statement), or it identity within that Branch Trading Statement items or amounts that were disputed. The whole issue with the information available to an SPM on Horizon is that they could not identify discrepancies or shortfalls, or understand the basis on which TCs with which they disagreed were issued.

I also consider that this conclusion applies regardless of whether the matter is approached (correctly) through the contractual obligation upon a SPM in either the SPMC or the NTC, or whether the Post Office’s approach relying upon common law principles were applied (although I do not consider this to be the correct approach).  </p>

That is why it was an unexplained shortfall or discrepancy. It is no answer to this point for the Post Office to require a SPM to identify the time and/or product when it occurred, in order that it could be investigated. That is simply a more refined way of requiring the SPM to do the impossible. Branch Trading Statements are done on a cycle of 5 weeks, 4 weeks, 4 weeks.

However, I do not consider that such an approach is correct, in either law or fact, for a Branch Trading Statement for any period in respect of which a SPM notified or called the Helpline concerning a dispute. This could be by way of seeking assistance on a disputed item, unexplained shortfall or discrepancy, or otherwise drawing to the Post Office’s attention that the trading statement was not agreed, but this had to be done through the Helpline. Further, and for completeness (and to provide maximum utility to the Group Litigation) there can be no requirement for any magic phrase that had to be uttered by an SPM when doing so. This is to deal with a situation which Mrs Stubbs experienced, after she had phoned the Helpline multiple times, disputing the shortfall shown. Eventually she was asked by the Helpline whether she wanted to report this particular issue as “a dispute”. This surprised her, as she was fairly certain that was what she had been doing all along, in her many phone calls on the same subject. If there were such a magic phrase, the SPMs should have been told what it was, and the evidence is that they were not told any such thing. It may transpire, in later trials, that internally at the Helpline an item was only treated as being disputed if certain words or phrases were used. Alternatively, it may transpire that different Helpline operators behaved differently.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I turn therefore to the final common law principle which the Post Office seeks to deploy under this Common Issue, namely where “an agent deliberately renders a false account to his or her principal, in relation to the matters covered by the account the Court should make all presumptions of fact against that Subpostmaster as are consistent with the other facts as proven or admitted.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">This principle applies where an agent “deliberately renders a false account to his or her principal”. However, I do not consider that it can be said to apply where the account in question is a Branch Trading Statement, for a branch trading period when the SPM in question has notified the Helpline of a dispute. Such a SPM would not be “deliberately rendering” a false account. They would be rendering an account in the form in which they were contractually required to render it, due to the express terms in their contracts. This is for the reasons already explained in this judgment about the correct characterisation of a Branch Trading Statement for such a period. It would, as a result of the options available to a SPM when using Horizon, and clearly shown now in Appendices 3 and 4 to this judgment, contain disputed items.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Firstly, the statement that “the amount is then <span style="text-decoration:underline">taken out</span> of the branch trading account” is contrary to the evidence of Mrs Van Den Bogerd, and also contrary to Appendices 3 and 4. I find as a fact that amounts disputed and notified to the Post Office through the Helpline were not taken out of the branch trading account. If and in so far as the statement in [829] may be argued in the future by the Post Office as not being contrary to the contents of those agreed Appendices, I find that it is. Mrs Ven Den Bogerd readily accepted that amounts that were notified in dispute to the Helpline that were settled centrally were still treated as debts due to the Post Office.  </p>

It clear means a debt that was due to the Post Office, but which the SPM either could not, or did not wish to, pay immediately. A considerable amount of time was spent at the trial, with both the Lead Claimants and Post Office witnesses, working out exactly what options were open to a SPM at the end of a branch trading statement, and what “settle centrally” actually meant to the Post Office. I find that in the circumstances of this case it means a debt which the Post Office considered was due to it by the SPM, but which the SPM either could not, or did not wish to, pay immediately. This was clear both from the evidence of Mrs Van Den Bogerd and internal Post Office documents.  </p>

Although on one view that is the submission being made by the Post Office, it is directly contrary to the way the Post Office behaved with the Lead Claimants, it is directly contrary to the case that was originally put to the Lead Claimants in cross-examination, and in my judgment would represent a volte face in the way that the Post Office’s claim is pleaded. I have dealt with this matter already at [525]. The Post Office has treated, and attempts to persuade the court that it should be entitled to continue treating, a Branch Trading Statement as a settled account, unless an individual SPM demonstrates why that Branch Trading Statement is wrong. This is in circumstances where items disputed by the SPM are included within that statement.  </p>

In that alternative scenario, I would hold that it is unconscionable here for account represented by the Branch Trading Statement not to be reopened for any trading period when the SPM had contacted the Helpline to report an unexplained shortfall, discrepancy or dispute a TC. </p>

I find, on the evidence before me in this trial, that imposing such a burden upon an SPM would be requiring them to perform the impossible. As was clear from all the evidence of both the SPMs and the Post Office witnesses who actually knew about how Horizon worked, unexplained shortfalls or discrepancies became apparent at the end of a branch trading period. It was simply not possible, on the information available to a SPM on the Horizon system, for them to identify the day, product, and still less the time of day, that was responsible for this. This was exactly what was identified by Mr Bates as a problem in the very earliest days of Horizon. The prolonged and extraordinary efforts of Mrs Stubbs and Mrs Stockdale showed that this burden simply could never be discharged by a reasonable and diligent SPM. This is not an answer to a question of construction, as it deals with post-contractual events, but it is telling that the Post Office argue for a construction that would impose an impossible burden upon SPMs. </p>

Firstly, SPMs as agents of the Post Office (and their contractual duty to account) is included in the SPMC and NTC expressly, which in my judgment makes that a more logical starting point.

All of the occasions that give rise to the power being available – arrest, charge, investigations, criminal and civil legal proceedings, insolvency – have the power to harm the Post Office’s legitimate business interests. It is therefore, in my judgment, obviously the case that these legitimate business interests can be protected, by means of the exercise of this power. I do not consider that there is any substantial difference between a test whereby such an exercise of power is “desirable” to protect such legitimate interests, or “necessary” to do so. What is necessary would be desirable; equally, what would be desirable would be broadly equivalent to what is necessary. I do not consider that there is any appreciable difference between the power under each form of contract.  </p>

I do however consider that the limitation contended for by the Claimants arises as a matter of construction of the clause in its commercial context, and is in any event both justified and required by adding “material breach in respect of the matters which the Defendant consider give it the right to suspend.” </p>

Suspended SPMs are not only entirely excluded from the Post Office part of their premises, they appear to be excluded (in some cases) from the entire premises, and also are completely denied access to any information or records. Given the severe effect upon a SPM of having their appointment terminated, it is not only important, but I would go so far as to say crucial, that they are given a reasonable opportunity to meet the case being brought against them by the Post Office. It is difficult to see how they can have such an opportunity if they are denied access even to copies of information or records. The experience of Mr Abdulla shows that he was, at his interview with Mrs Ridge, not given access to documents that showed his account concerning the TC and the lottery in the sum of £1,092 was substantiated by internal Post Office records. Mrs Ridge did not have these either. I do not see how a decision about a SPM’s future can sensibly be taken on proper grounds in the absence of such a document being made available either to the SPM, or to the Post Office personnel tasked with taking such a decision. Such an approach is not justified on the terms of either the SPMC or the NTC. </p>

The evidence of Mr Breeden was that this would be done very rarely for commercial reasons, and if there were “performance issues” these would be explored firstly with the SPM who would be given the opportunity to remedy them first. It is also the case that the Network Transformation Programme which led to the rationalisation of the Post Office branch network paid compensation to SPMs. This was up to 28 months’ remuneration, with an average of 12 months, a figure reached eventually in conjunction with the NFSP. In a contract which provides for “not less than” 3 months’ notice, that is obviously far in excess of the strict contractual entitlement, if it is construed as the Post Office contends. However, the way that the Post Office stated in evidence this provision would or may be applied, is not an answer to a disputed contractual construction.  </p>

There is no ambiguity. The period of notice has to be a minimum of three months. However, that does not mean that it should be construed as the Post Office wish it to be, which is to the effect that it is the Post Office who can unilaterally decide to terminate on exactly 3 months at any time, and also whether any particular SPM is granted a longer period than 3 months, on consideration of vague and non-specified factors that are not dealt with in the clause. </p>

It could (and the Claimants by extension argue that it should) be longer in some circumstances. I accept that submission. If the notice provision was intended always to be one of precisely three months, it would not use the term “not less than three months.” If the words “not less than” are to have any meaning at all – which in my judgment they plainly must -  they must require consideration of what the appropriate period of notice should be. If consideration has to be given to what the period of notice should be (with the absolute minimum always being three months) then there has to some conscious thought given to that decision. It cannot be decided arbitrarily.  </p>

The first of those, breach of condition, uses the language of repudiatory breach. Under the law of England and Wales, a contract does not have to contain a term entitling a party to bring that contract to an immediate end if the other party is in repudiatory breach; this is a right that contracting parties have generally.  </p>

That is denied by the Post Office; in other words, the Post Office argues that contractually it is entitled to act in this way. Although that is a surprising position, in my judgment it is also an obviously incorrect position. I have dealt already in this judgment with why that is so. Firstly, these contracts are relational contracts. Secondly, as stated by Lord Sumption JSC in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">British Telecommunications plc v Telefónica O2 UK Ltd</span> [2014] UKSC 42 at [37], absence very clear words to the contrary, a contractual discretion has to be exercised consistently with its contractual purpose, and in good faith and not arbitrarily or capriciously. Thirdly, I have considered as a matter of construction the termination on notice provisions in both the SPMC and the NTC, and concluded on the words used, considered within the contracts at a whole and in accordance with their commercial purpose, how the power to terminate on notice should be exercised.  </p>

In order to obtain the work, these people had to sign contracts stating that they were subcontractors not employees, that they had to provide their own materials, that they were not obliged to provide services to the company, now was the company obliged to offer work to them, and they could provide suitably qualified substitutes in their stead. The Claimants brought proceedings claiming they were “workers” for the purposes of the National Minimum Wage Regulations 1999 and the Working Time Regulations 1998, and that accordingly they were entitled to be paid the national minimum wage and to receive statutory paid leave. An employment tribunal found that the true agreement was not contained in the contractual documents and that they were employees. The Employment Appeal Tribunal dismissed an appeal by the company, holding that the Claimants were not working under contracts of employment, but were working under contracts for services and hence fell within the regulations. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal of the company, and allowed a cross-appeal by the Claimants, holding that they were “workers” under both limbs of the definition.  </p>

Personal service entitled a SPM to some benefits similar to that of an employee. An SPM providing personal service was not entitled to be absent for more than 3 days without permission. Hours of opening were dictated. The Post Office witnesses accepted that there was a “sensitivity” within the Post Office about the employment status of SPMs. It was evident that the Post Office was anxious that SPMs remain on the “non-employee” side of that line.  </p>

This is because individual people looking for work will be in a particularly weak bargaining position. The Claimants in the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Autoclenz </span>case were seeking declarations that they were entitled to the national minimum wage.

All the wording of each of these clauses do is to make the position vis-à-vis a future purchaser of the business clear, so far as the SPM with whom the Post Office is contracting is concerned. That prospective purchaser will have to take their chances on an application to the Post Office to be a SPM. The SPM, if they come to sell, will have to leave matters between the incoming purchaser and the Post Office as to whether than purchaser will be approved as a SPM. I find nothing in any of the terms of either the SPM or the NTC that would suggest that the Post Office’s ability to choose the identity of those whom it would wish to appoint as SPMs should be subject to some sort of restriction or duty that has to be exercised in a particular way.

The Claimants’ grounds, such as they are, for justifying this approach are somewhat whimsical. They are not, so far as I can tell, grounded in any contractual analysis.

The difficulty arises, in my judgment, from the use by the Post Office of the term “ultimately responsible.” The Claimants maintain that the Post Office, effectively, had the primary obligation to train an SPM’s assistants, but this has some difficulties, not least the express terms themselves which imposes this upon the SPM.  </p>

However, the Post Office’s case ignores what the word “cascade” in Part 2 Paragraph 2.4 of the NTC must connote.

There is no way that a SPM could, on Horizon, train his or her assistants to a higher level of competence than the Post Office’s own training had given that SPM. In other words, any deficiency of training given to the SPM by the Post Office is not cured, in contractual terms, to the Post Office’s benefit by that deficient training being passed on to an assistant by that deficiently trained SPM. I find this argument by the Post Office to fly in the face of commercial, business and indeed common sense. I construe the relevant terms in the contracts to that effect, but if it is necessary to imply a term (and at least so far as the non-modified SPMC it is, because it does not deal with this subject expressly at all) then I do so due to business necessity.  </p>

A great effort was made by the Post Office to explain in detail how the training was structured and what its content included. Some evidence was given by the Lead Claimants of their experiences of the training, which the Post Office initially sought to strike out of their witness statements. That attempt failed, and once it was admitted as evidence, however, the court then at least had both sides of the story. This painted a very different picture to that presented by the Post Office witnesses.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">One feature which seemed to me to be wholly absent from the training courses run by the Post Office for the Lead Claimants was any sort of assessment or test of competence at the end of the training. Every case will of course be wholly different, but whereas one individual might, after four days, be wholly competent to use the Horizon system unsupervised, another might need longer than that. If they are all given four days of training regardless, and there is no assessment at the end of that four days, then some incoming SPMs might not be conversant with all the features of the system. This situation is in no-one’s interests, and in my judgment I would go further and say it is contrary to business logic. Although there was some in-branch training, the approach to that did not appear to be uniform either. Add to this that the auditors have the dual role of in-branch training after branch transfer day, and subsequent auditing of that particular branch, it can be seen that inadequate training is not likely to be readily discernible to the Post Office. Certainly the subjective experiences of the Lead Claimants so far as training was concerned was far from ideal. I do not consider that it would be difficult for any training to include at the end of it some sort of assessment or test, and if a SPM were to fail that assessment or test, then they would not have been satisfactorily trained. They would therefore require further training.  </p>

Their assistants should not have been trained to a lower standard than they themselves were. These findings are not dependent upon the contracts being relational ones.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">“At the time of the ticket cases in the last century it was notorious that people hardly ever troubled to read printed conditions on a ticket or delivery note or similar document. That remains the case now. In the intervening years the printed conditions have tended to become more and more complicated and more and more one-sided in favour of the party who is imposing them, but the other parties, if they notice that there are printed conditions at all, generally still tend to assume that such conditions are only concerned with ancillary matters of form and are not of importance. In the ticket cases the courts held that the common law required that reasonable steps be taken to draw the other parties' attention to the printed conditions or they would not be part of the contract. It is, in my judgment, a logical development of the common law into modern conditions that it should be held, as it was in Thornton v. Shoe Lane Parking Ltd. [1971] 2 Q.B. 163, that, if one condition in a set of printed conditions is particularly onerous or unusual, the party seeking to enforce it must show that that particular condition was fairly brought to the attention of the other party.”  </p>

That case concerned what she described as a “cruel disappointment”, when a reader of the Daily Mirror thought he had won £50,000 in the daily scratch card game played in a daily newspaper, although the proprietors of the newspaper thought otherwise. She described the issue in the following terms: “It would make an excellent question in an undergraduate contract law seminar or examination. Like all good questions, it is easy to ask and difficult to answer.” Due to a printing error, too many cards had been printed and there was some confusion over which cards issued with a particular Sunday sister title, The People, were the right ones for the purposes of playing the game. The central issue in the case was whether the Mirror Group’s rules had been incorporated into the competition. In particular, the newspaper sought to rely upon Rule 5 which stated “Should more prizes be claimed than are available in any prize category for any reason, a simple draw will take place for the prize.” </p>

The Claimants owned Cabbage Hall Farm in Oxfordshire and had a re-mortgage with the bank. Sterling interest rates were high in late 2007, and so they considered re-mortgaging in a foreign currency with lower interest rates. They therefore borrowed a sum in Swiss Francs approximately £480,000 more than the £300,000 owing on their existing mortgage; paid that mortgage off; put the surplus into sterling deposits, and attempted to profit from the differential in interest on the two currencies, performing something called a “carry trade”. This did not work well for them, and indeed proved to be disastrous when the Bank of England base rate fell dramatically. The bank eventually appointed receivers over their property. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I do not believe that these cases demonstrate “a trend”, as the Post Office submits. I consider that the cases make it clear that the principle is that it may in certain circumstances lead to a clause not being incorporated into a contract, if the written contractual term is of an unusual and stringent, or particularly onerous, nature, unless it has fairly been brought to that person's attention. The degree of notice depends upon the nature of the clause; the more severe its effect, the greater the notice required.  Such a clause must have the potential to act very severely to the detriment of the party in question. It is a principle available to contracting parties who are not consumers, but context and the respective bargaining positions of the parties are relevant. So too is a recommendation that legal advice be sought before the contract is entered into. I also consider that it is a high hurdle that must be passed for a term to be held to be onerous and unusual. The phrase used by the Post Office at one point in its Closing Submissions is that the Claimants must show the terms “are literally extraordinary in their harshness”. That phrase uses different words to the way I have expressed it in [973] above, but whether there is any appreciable difference between the different ways of expressing the same concept, I doubt.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">This judgment is unlikely to be improved by a linguistic analysis of whether there is a difference between harsh, onerous, unusual and/or extraordinary (or outlandish). I prefer onerous and unusual, because that is the phrase in the majority of the cases, but the test may amount to the same whether one uses the phrase extortionate, extraordinarily harsh, or any permutation of those words. A clause imposing a literally Draconian punishment would undoubtedly qualify under any of these words, but I doubt a clause has to be as severe as that in any event.  </p>

SPMs are not employees, but the relationship has some of the qualities similar to those of employment; they are not consumers; but they are not fully autonomous, either in the terms upon which they can become SPMs, and also how their behaviour is regulated once they are appointed. The evidence was clearly that no changes to terms and conditions would be entertained by the Post Office; the Post Office wished to have all their SPMs contracting on the same terms (putting to one side their inability to do so competently in the early days, and also the three different forms, SPMC, Modified SPMC and NTC).  </p>

They relate to the way that the SPM would run the branch Post Office, in terms of how they present different products, how they operate Horizon, and how the day-to-day business is transacted. For these aspects of the relationship, it is entirely normal for the Post Office to be entitled to change these in Counter News, the publication that it sends to the SPMs. However, it is not normal, for one commercial party to be able unilaterally to change the conditions upon which the other party contracts with it, without the consent of the other party. Certainly that is not an ordinary feature of what the Post Office characterises as a “business to business” contract. An SPM contracts with the Post Office on the terms that he or she does as at the date of that contract. </p>

They include within them a sophisticated mechanism for the instruction of variations to the works themselves, due to the subject matter of the contract. However, the contract terms that permit this are extraordinarily detailed, and are contained in industry-wide standard forms, the terms of which are negotiated by trade bodies such as for JCT contract forms, the Joint Contracts Tribunal, and for the NEC contracts, the Institution of Civil Engineers. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The statements attributed to Mr Stretford are surprising. As a players' agent it was his duty to keep himself informed of the Rules. Rule K applies as much to disputes between a player and his club as between a players' agent and the FA. Moreover there was nothing secret about Rule K. It was published as one of the Rules in the annual FA Handbook, in particular that for the Season 2001-2002, where it featured in the index under the heading of 'arbitration procedures'. Plainly Mr Stretford would need to have a copy of the annual handbook as part of the tools of his trade and he himself exhibited parts of the edition for the 2004-2005 season, including Rule K, as part of exhibit 'PS 1' to his witness statement made on 16th September 2005 in which he described it as an annual publication.  </p>

Moreover the question must be considered at the time the contract into which it is said to have been incorporated was made, namely at the time the players' agents licence was issued by the FA to Mr Stretford in 2002.  </p>

It is not disputed that the licence granted to Mr Stretford in 1995 was granted by FIFA and that it was FIFA, not the FA, which was the other party to the contract with Mr Stretford. Nor is it disputed that the article 13(a) of FIFA' players' agents regulations then in force required Mr Stretford to observe all the regulations of the FA. Thus from 1995 until the FIFA licence ceased to have effect in 2002 there is no doubt that Mr Stretford was bound, at least to FIFA, by the Rules of the FA, including, from 1999, Rule K.  </p>

The licence stated on its face under the name and a photograph of Mr Stretford that the holder agreed to abide by the rules and regulations of, amongst others, the FA.

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment the obligation to observe the Rules, as a whole, became a term of the contract between Mr Stretford and the FA by any one or more of three distinct processes. First, the obligation to observe the Rules was a continuing obligation. It first arose in 1995 under Article 13 of the original players' agents regulations. It was continued by Article 14(a) of the revised version. The exchange, pursuant to Article 23, of the FIFA licence for the FA licence in 2002 altered the identity of the other party to the contract from FIFA to the FA but had no other effect on the obligations by which Mr Stretford was bound. This case is unlike those in which a contract is made for the first time without any prior course of dealing. Thus in the well known case of <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Olley v Marlborough Court Ltd</span> [1949] 1 KB 532 the terms were not incorporated into the contract because the relevant party had had no notice of them before the time at which the contract was made. Second, if it is necessary to find some conventional offer and acceptance then the supply of the licence on 9th April 2002 bearing the statement to which I have referred followed by the acknowledgement of its receipt by Mr Stretford on 23rd April 2002 would suffice. Thirdly, the transaction of business as a licensed players' agent on the terms of Article 14(a) of the revised players' agents' regulations and the terms expressed on the face of the licence constitute the acceptance of those terms by conduct.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I consider this case to be wholly distinguishable for the following reasons. Firstly, the FA – and FIFA before it – were regulatory bodies approving licences. This is different to the Post Office contracting with SPMs to provide branch Post Offices for reward. Secondly, the term in question was an arbitration provision, which governed the dispute resolution forum, and not Mr Stretford’s substantive rights. Thirdly, the issue in the case was not <span style="font-style:italic">ex post facto</span> incorporation, but Mr Stretford’s knowledge of Rule K. The Chancellor found that as “a players' agent it was his duty to keep himself informed of the Rules. Rule K applies as much to disputes between a player and his club as between a players' agent and the FA. Moreover there was nothing secret about </p>

Fourthly, as [1] makes clear, “the terms of the licence required the agent to observe the regulations of FIFA and the national associations at all times”. The license was therefore permissive in nature, but the ongoing nature of that permission required that if the regulations were to change in the future, these new changed regulations had to be complied with as a condition of the permission continuing. Fourthly, as [4] makes clear, after the change was made from FIFA to the FA providing the licence “on 30th August 2001 Mr Stretford duly applied to the FA and, having received temporary authority on 11th January 2002, [Mr Stretford] was issued with a new licence by the FA on 9th April 2002”. The arbitration rule was already in place by then, and as [16] makes clear “It was published as one of the Rules in the annual FA Handbook, in particular that for the Season 2001-2002, where it featured in the index under the heading of 'arbitration procedures'.

The terms of appointment are also in the context of what was intended to be, by both parties at the time of contracting, a long term relationship, which may (and for Mrs Stubbs did) run over into a third decade or even longer. It would be important for the Post Office to have the ability to change or introduce further terms. It would also not be possible, at the beginning of such a long term relationship, to anticipate all the relevant terms that might be required in the future. </p>

Although the introduction of new terms would themselves have to be properly incorporated, with (using the sliding scale to which I have referred) required specific and reasonable notice to the SPMs, the degree of such notice depending upon the content of the new terms which the Post Office seeks to introduce. I do not consider that Counter News would be the appropriate way of giving notice for terms that affected liability for losses, for example. Also (depending upon the conclusion I reach in the next section, reasonableness under the Unfair Contract Terms Act) if these contracts are governed by that Act, then the contents of new terms would have to satisfy the test of reasonableness too.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">As I have construed the first of these clauses at Part 2 Paragraph 4.1, in the section of this judgment “The Terms of the NTC dealing with Losses” at [677] and following above, this clause means, on the natural meaning of the words, that as a matter of construction, the NTC imposes full liability upon a SPM for any losses to cash and stock, whether by as a result of negligence or otherwise, with the sole exception being losses arising from criminal acts which could not have been prevented. In that section of the judgment, I accepted the submission of the Post Office that there is no general fault requirement for liability, and the starting point is that the SPM is liable for all shortfalls, whatever the cause of the underlying loss, as long as the Post Office has demonstrated that there is an actual loss.  </p>

It has a very wide ambit, with potentially very serious financial implications for any SPM. Its effect is, absent any fault on the part of that SPM, that they may become liable for very sizeable sums with no upper limit, for something entirely out of their control. The term may also be unreasonable, although that point is considered separately under Common Issue 7.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Turning to the second term, this is a clause that imposes an obligation upon a SPM to reimburse the Post Office on demand for <span style="text-decoration:underline">all</span> losses, claims, demands, proceedings, liabilities, costs and expenses incurred by the Post Office as a result of any negligence <span style="text-decoration:underline">or breach</span> of the agreement by the SPM. Given I have found that the correct construction of Part 2 Paragraph 4.1 effectively imposes strict liability upon a SPM (once loss is established), then a failure to pay for sums claimed by the Post Office for something out of the SPM’s control, but which were due under that clause, would constitute a breach. If the Post Office were to demand those sums, and incur costs as a result, then these would be recoverable from the SPM too. The words of this clause are, again, very wide, impose a potentially very wide liability upon SPMs, and in the context of the NTC, I consider them to be onerous and unusual.  </p>

However, running a branch Post Office is a full time occupation and this, in conjunction with the associated small business, is a SPM’s livelihood. The vast majority of SPMs are individuals. The Post Office regularly would argue that the NTC Local contract is used for it to contract with limited companies to run branch Post Offices. That is, in my judgment, an isolated point which does not dilute the effect of these clauses. Firstly, there is a wholly different contract form used by the Post Office to contract with large companies such as WH Smith to run large Post Offices, and this is called the NTC Main Contract. The NTC Main Contract is not a contract upon which any of the Claimants in this litigation have contracted with the Post Office. Secondly, there is no evidence that any companies have contracted with the Post Office on the SPMC contract form in any event. Thirdly, it is the Post Office that chooses the contract form it uses to contract with SPMs who are individuals. Fourthly, even for SPMs who have more than one branch, if they are suspended on valid grounds from running one branch, they are highly likely also to be suspended from their second branch too. Therefore, these provisions on remuneration affect their income and livelihoods, regardless of how many Post Offices they operate.  </p>

Indeed, in my judgment, they are on their terms capable of putting a SPM in a simply impossible position, under either contract form. Even after reinstatement, which may have eventually occurred after a very lengthy period of suspension (for which the suspended SPM has been paying the costs of keeping open the branch) the Post Office may decide not to pay any remuneration that would otherwise have been due. The consequences are potentially financially ruinous for any SPM.</p>

He also claimed that the Post Office had “dismissed him in a harsh and humiliating way which imputed dishonesty on his part and made it all but impossible for him to find another position”, as set out at [4] in the judgment of Brooke LJ. The case did not concern Horizon. Parts of Mr Lalji’s claim were struck out at first instance and his appeal against this was substantially allowed, although his claim for damages for his depressive illness was not allowed to proceed.  </p>

However, I find that although specific and separate notice was not given in respect of these two clauses, the signature means that this provision for terms in the NTC was sufficient.

This is because the SPMC was not signed, and certainly the evidence of the Lead Claimants makes clear that the SPMC was not even routinely provided by the Post Office to the SPMs at all. There also does not seem to have been a uniform procedure adopted by the Post Office in terms of documentation sent to SPMs prior to appointment, nor even uniform documentation. The documents sent to Mr Sabir, for example, included within Appendix 1 identification of certain requirements in terms of remuneration and painting the branch. However, no actual notice was given at all of the terms in the SPMC which I have found to be onerous and unusual. Broadly the same point applies to Mr Abdulla. His attention was drawn to the provision for losses in the summary he was sent, which went with his invitation to interview. However, no specific notice was drawn to any of the onerous and unusual clauses I have found. All that he was told was to read the document. I do not consider that qualifies as specific or adequate notice of the terms which I have found to be onerous and unusual.  </p>

I have found in respect of Mr Bates that the contract was formed on 31 March 1998 on the terms of what was enclosed with the Letter of Appointment. This did not include even the extract of terms contained in the document SERV 135. Mrs Stubbs was appointed on the day after her husband’s death, on very little documentation other than her simply signing the direct debit form with her bank account details so she could be paid. If, for example, the SERV 135 document evolved over time and included reference to other specific terms provided prior to or upon the formation of the contract, then separate identification of those terms, given the terms of that letter, probably would be sufficient but <span style="font-style:italic">only</span> for any terms specifically identified in that letter. The document referred to “certain very important Post Office regulations.

None of those are in the list that I have found onerous and unusual. If the terms of the SERV 135 document remained in that form, then that would not assist the Post Office in respect of giving adequate notice, and no adequate notice would have been given in respect of the SPMC terms I have identified as onerous and unusual. That would mean that they are not incorporated. A similar approach in Mr Sabir’s case shows that none of the terms I have found to be onerous and unusual were brought to his attention either. They were, at best, buried within a document he was told to read. That is not, in my judgment, sufficient notice, and it is not sufficient to incorporate them. The only term that was specifically notified to Mr Abdulla was the one relating to losses, and I have found that not to be onerous and unusual. That was identified in the summary sent to him with his invitation to interview. The others in respect of which I have made findings above were not.

I also put to one side entirely that the genesis of this clause emerged about a decade <span style="font-style:italic">after</span> SPMs, on their case, started to experience significant discrepancies and shortfalls due to Horizon; and which on any case, they expressly blamed upon the Horizon system. It would be, perhaps, too cynical for even the most hardened Post Office watcher to suggest that the problems with Horizon led to changes to, and extension of, the contractual liability of SPMs for losses that were adopted in the NTC.

That seems to me to be the force of the words "written" and "standard" in the expression "written standard terms of business". In other words, it is not enough to bring a case within [UCTA] section 3 that a party has established terms of business which it prefers to adopt, as, for example, a form of draft contract maintained on a computer, or established requirements as to what contracts into which it entered should contain, as, for example, provision for arbitration in the event of disputes. Something more is needed, and on principle that something more, in my judgment, is that the relevant terms should exist in written form prior to the possibility of the making of the relevant agreement arising, thus being "written", and they should be intended to be adopted more or less automatically in all transactions of a particular type without any significant opportunity for negotiation, thus being "standard"."  </p>

But this 'paragraph' of section 3 refers not to the</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">performance specified in the contract but to the performance "which was reasonably</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">expected" of that party.</span> It seems to me that in appropriate circumstances a precontractual representation or promise may affect the performance that is reasonably expected of a party. It follows that clause 24 may be subject to the reasonableness test in UCTA in relation to both collateral warranties and representations. However, section 3(2)(b)(i) will only come into play in the present cases if it is possible to identify both the performance by AXA that was reasonably expected and that defined by the contract. The effect of clause 24, if any, on a representation such as "We are the largest insurance company in England" will not be within the scope of section 3(2)(b)(i).” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">“[72] It is submitted on behalf of the appellants that they were reasonably entitled to expect that, in performing their side of the bargain, the Claimant would not apply rates which were substantially out of line with rates applied by comparable lenders to borrowers in comparable situations to the appellants. It is contended that the setting of interest rates is "contractual performance" within the meaning of section 3(2)(b) of the 1977 Act, and that the Claimant set interest rates that defeated that expectation.  [73] The first question is whether the fixing of rates of interest under a discretion given by the contract was "contractual performance" within the meaning of section 3(2)(b). Mr Broatch [for the appellants] submits that it is. He relies on two authorities. The first is <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Timeload Ltd v British Telecommunications PLC</span> [1995] EMLR 459. In that case, the plaintiff set up a free telephone inquiry service, and entered into a contract with BT whereby BT provided the plaintiff with the use of a certain telephone number. There was a clause in the contract which authorised BT to terminate apparently without reason. BT gave one month's notice of termination, and the plaintiff sought an injunction to restrain BT from terminating. It was held by the court of appeal that it was at least arguable that a clause purporting to authorise BT to terminate without reason purported to permit partial or different performance from that which the plaintiff was entitled to expect, and that section 3(2) of the 1977 Act applied. But the licence agreement imposed clear performance obligations on BT. Thus, clause 1.1 obliged BT to provide the various services there set out. In these circumstances, it is not difficult to see why the court thought that it was at least arguable that a clause authorising termination of the obligation to provide those services for no good reason purported to permit a contractual performance different from that which the customer might reasonably expect.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The second authority is <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Zockoll Group Ltd v Mercury Communications Ltd </span>[1999] EMLR 385. This was another telecommunications case. The plaintiff planned to set up a network of franchisees to provide goods and services to the public in response to telephone inquiries. It entered into a contract with Mercury under which it obtained a number of telephone numbers. Mercury wished to withdraw one number from the plaintiff and asserted that it was entitled to do so at its sole discretion. The plaintiff brought proceedings and relied on section 3(2)(b)(i) of the 1977 Act. The court held that the withdrawal of the disputed number did not render the contractual performance substantially different from what was expected. Mr Broatch points out that it is implicit in the decision of the court that it was accepted that the withdrawal of the disputed number was <span style="font-style:italic">capable of being</span> contractual performance substantially different from that which it was reasonable to expect.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, neither of these authorities assists Mr Broatch's submission. In both cases, the defendant telecommunications provider was contractually bound to provide a service. The question was whether the withdrawal of the service in the particular circumstances of the case was such as to render the contract performance (ie the provision of that service) substantially different from that which it was reasonable for the other contracting party to expect. The present cases are quite different. Here, there is no relevant obligation on the Claimant, and therefore nothing that can qualify as "contractual performance" for the purposes of section 3(2)(b)(i). Even if that is wrong, by fixing the rate of interest at a particular level the Claimant is not altering the performance of any obligation assumed by it under the contract. Rather, it is altering the performance required of the appellants.  </p>

Nor, it is submitted, would that provision extend to a contract term which entitled one party, not to alter the performance expected of himself, but to alter the performance required of the other party (e.g. a term by which a seller of goods is entitled to increase the price payable by the buyer to the price ruling at the date of delivery, or a term by which a person advancing a loan is entitled to vary the interest payable by the borrower on the loan)." </p>

They should, in my view, be taken to be the best judge of the commercial fairness of the agreement which they have made; including the fairness of each of the terms in that agreement. They should be taken to be the best judge on the question whether the terms of the agreement are reasonable. The court should not assume that either is likely to commit his company to an agreement which he thinks is unfair, or which he thinks includes unreasonable terms. Unless satisfied that one party has, in effect, taken unfair advantage of the other – or that a term is so unreasonable that it cannot properly have been understood or considered – the court should not interfere." </p>

I consider that the Post Office occupied a potentially unique position in terms of strength of position. Mr Green QC would often describe this as asymmetry; he did this almost as often as Mr Cavender described the relationship as “business to business”. It is indeed asymmetrical, but in my judgment it is a very significant asymmetry. If one wished to become a SPM, then it was the Post Office’s terms that were available, and those terms alone. There was no negotiation permitted whatsoever. The Post Office is also a sizeable and significant institution. A SPM is a small business person, although some may have more than one branch. The two parties are not remotely equal. In fact, they are almost uniquely unequal. </p>

Reasonableness of the terms of the SPMC has to be viewed as at the time of contracting; the same exercise has again to be performed for SPMs who contracted on the NTC. The answer will not necessarily be the same for each of the terms, or for each of the contract forms. I will deal with liability for losses first, as the parties concentrated on these terms extensively in the trial. I find that the provision in the SPMC at Section 12 clause 12 (as I have construed it concerning the extent of responsibility for assistants) is reasonable. It requires fault in order for a SPM to be liable, and that is entirely reasonable. Section 12 Clause 4 and Section 12 Clause 13 are also reasonable.  </p>

Indeed, the only evidence, from Mr Beal, which I have rejected, is that the NTC was supposed to reflect the same extent of liability of the SPM as contained in the SPMC. Nor, in my judgment, does it matter what the driving motivation within the Post Office was for the imposition of the wider, no fault liability in the NTC.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">This therefore leaves the NTC without a clause dealing with the scope of an SPM’s liability in respect of losses. It would therefore require a term to be implied for reasons of business efficacy. For the same reasons that I concluded that, for Mr Bates and Mrs Stubbs, a term of like effect to Section 12 Clause 12 would have to be implied into their contracts given my findings on contract formation in their individual cases, a similar term would have to be implied into the NTC. This is that the SPM is “responsible for all losses caused through his or her own negligence, carelessness or error.” The clause which is unreasonable, namely Part 2 Paragraph 4.1 of the NTC, deals with responsibility for assistants using the term “Personnel” and so, in terms of business necessity, implication of a term for losses into the NTC would also need to include the second part of Section 12 Clause 12, which deals with assistants.  </p>

This is because it requires reimbursement in full on demand of all losses claims, demands, proceedings, liabilities, costs and expenses, including reasonable legal costs and expenses incurred by the Post Office as a result of any breach, or any claim brought under the Equality Act in respect of the branch. That is extraordinarily wide, has a potentially unlimited effect in financial terms, and there is no evidence at all that there is or would be any insurance available to a SPM to insure against such losses. In the same way as Part 2 Paragraph 4.1 fails the reasonableness test. If I am right about signature and notice, and it is incorporated, it is not part of the contract as it fails the reasonableness test in UCTA.

I consider, on the basis of how I have construed the clauses, requiring termination on notice to be interpreted as relating to repudiatory breach, the no notice provisions to be reasonable. On the way I have construed the clauses, in particular the phrase “not less than three months’ notice” in the SPMC and “not less than 6 months’ notice” in the NTC, the termination on notice clauses are reasonable. However, on the Post Office’s contended for construction, I consider both clauses fail the test of reasonableness. I have rejected that construction but deal with this in the alternative, in case I am wrong. The reason they would fail on that alternative construction is because a SPM who had invested very significant sums would be liable to termination for no legitimate business reason and on only a few months’ notice (under either contract form) without any consideration of their length of service.  </p>

The two clauses that state, in each of the SPMC and the NTC, that the SPM is not entitled to compensation for loss of office each fail the test of reasonableness. Office could be lost – which is another way of saying the Post Office could terminate an SPM’s appointment – for (on the Post Office’s case) no legitimate reason at all. It was still, as at the end of the Common Issues trial, in issue between the Post Office and the Claimants whether the Post Office could act arbitrarily, irrationally and/or capriciously. I put entirely to one side, and ignore, why the Post Office might wish to claim a contractual right to act in any of these three ways with its SPMs. However, in my judgment, a blanket lack of entitlement to any compensation for loss of office cannot be reasonable in all the circumstances of this case. These terms therefore fail the test of reasonableness too.  </p>

The Post Office has failed to satisfy this test in respect of the NTC terms concerning liability for losses; remuneration for SPMs in terms of suspension and also reinstatement following suspension in both the SPMC and NTC; termination (on the Post Office’s construction of those terms, which I have rejected in any event) in both the SPMC and the NTC; and no compensation for loss of office in both the SPMC and the NTC. </p>

So far as these Claimants, and the subject matter of this Group Litigation, are concerned, this might be thought to be wholly wishful thinking. Trust is an element of an obligation of good faith, a concept which I find is to be implied into the contracts between the Post Office and the SPMs because they are relational contracts. The Post Office asserts that its brand is trusted by the nation, but the SPMs who are Claimants do not trust it very far, based on their individual and collective experience of Horizon.  </p>

Some of these are identified at [542] above. The first document in that paragraph of this judgment dates from November 2000. At [41] I deal with part of an internal Post Office report from as recently as June 2014 – other parts have been redacted – that make it clear that steps had to be taken within the Post Office to “ensure consistency of accounts and enable a higher chance of detecting errors in accounts due to problems with Horizon”. The Post Office’s position in this litigation remains that Horizon is what is called “robust” and that none of the Claimants experienced shortfalls or discrepancies in their branch accounts due to problems caused by Horizon. Further consideration of this will occur in subsequent judgments and after the Horizon Issues trial. </p>

The Post Office treated disputed amounts as debts which they were entitled to claim under debt recovery procedures from SPMs. There was no mechanism adopted by the Post Office to resolve such disputes. The Post Office accepted during the trial that amounts that were “settled centrally” were treated by it as being legally due and owing to the Post Office, even if they were disputed by SPMs. I find that the Post Office is not therefore entitled to rely upon the Branch Trading Statements, for any period in respect of which a SPM notified a dispute to the Helpline, as a settled account between agent and principal. Nor do SPMs bear the burden of demonstrating that the Branch Trading Statement is wrong for such a period.  </p>
