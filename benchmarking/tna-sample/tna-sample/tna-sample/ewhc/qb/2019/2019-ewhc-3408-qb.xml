	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">This judgment is part of the long-running legal dispute between the claimants, who are all either former or serving sub-post masters and sub-post mistresses (“SPMs”), and the Post Office. All the SPMs in the litigation had contracted with the Post Office at different times to run branch Post Offices in different locations across the country. The Post Office introduced a computer system called Horizon in 2000 across all its branches. That was changed in 2010 to an online version called Horizon Online or HNG-X, and the former version is now called Legacy Horizon. The claimants’ case is essentially that both Legacy Horizon and Horizon Online (which used many elements of the existing system) were or are unreliable, and this led to unexplained shortfalls and discrepancies in their branch accounts. The Post Office denies this, asserting that the systems were and are robust, and extremely unlikely to be the cause of such matters. There are numerous different causes of action brought against the Post Office, and the Post Office counterclaims against the claimants, including seeking damages for fraud. This is group litigation under CPR Part 19. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">This judgment concerns the operation and functionality of the Horizon system itself. It follows the lengthy Common Issues judgment, which is Judgment (No.3). That judgment was extremely long, for two main reasons. It concerned six different claimants, each of whom had contracted with the Post Office at different times, and each of those six claimants’ cases concerned very different facts. Very few of the material facts relating to contract formation were agreed for any of these six, and therefore factual findings had to be made for each of them in this respect. Approximately 500 paragraphs were necessary to do this. Although first instance judgments must be reasoned so that parties understand the outcome (and so that any judgment can be subject to appropriate review), very lengthy judgments can be difficult to follow. If a judgment becomes too long, or too technical, it can be counterproductive to wider understanding on the part of those not immersed in the fine detail of every aspect of the case. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">I have therefore included technical detail about the Horizon system, its operation, and some aspects of the technical evidence, in a Technical Appendix to this judgment. The contents of that appendix should not be seen as being of subordinate effect to the contents of the judgment itself; this is done simply for the convenience of readers. It is also intended that readers who do need to immerse themselves in technical matters to a very fine level of detail may not find it necessary to study the appendix, and reading the judgment alone may be sufficient. Notwithstanding that approach, however, this judgment too is extremely long. This is due to the complexity of the Horizon system, which even for computer systems is extraordinarily complicated for the reasons explained below; the period of time over which the complaints range (which starts with the introduction of Horizon in 2000 and runs to date); and due to the way that the litigation has unfolded. There are some matters in this judgment that go to issues affecting the group litigation going forwards, such as disclosure, which have increased its length. It is also the case that this litigation is being very strongly contested on both sides. I have endeavoured to provide a reasonable level of detail to explain my findings on the Horizon Issues to assist both sides as much as possible. Finally, the only findings that are made in this judgment are those necessary to come to conclusions on the Horizon Issues. All other matters in all the claims of the claimants and the counterclaims by the Post Office remain for decision in later judgments.  </p>

A more comprehensive introduction to the issues generally between the parties is contained at [2] to [43] of Judgment (No.3) “Common Issues”, which is at [2019] EWHC 606 (QB). Other judgments concerning procedural rather than substantive issues, are the first Judgment at [2017] EWHC 2844 (QB) and Judgment (No.2) “Strike Out” at [2018] EWHC 2698 (QB). During the Horizon Issues trial which is the subject of this judgment, the Post Office issued an application that I recuse myself as Managing Judge in this group litigation, and stop the Horizon Issues trial, so that it could be recommenced at some later date in the future (before a replacement Managing Judge). That application was refused and the judgment is at Judgment (No.4) “Recusal Application” at [2019] EWHC 871 (QB). Permission to appeal was refused by the single Lord Justice on 9 May 2019. There is also Judgment (No.5) “Common Issues Costs” at [2019] EWHC 1373 (QB) which made various orders in respect of the costs of the Common Issues trial, a hearing in respect of that having taken place on 23 May 2019.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The two IT experts could not be called until 4 June 2019 onwards. The two experts therefore had a period of some weeks, following on from the evidence of fact, before they were called to give their oral evidence. There was therefore an interval between 11 April 2019 and 4 June 2019 when the experts were called. Their evidence collectively took two court weeks. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The effect of this interruption upon the trial timetable meant that there was therefore time available for each of the experts to consider the full scope of the crossexamination of the factual witnesses that had taken place some weeks before, and reflect (with more time than is usual for experts whilst a trial is underway) upon whether that impacted upon their views. Experts are supposed to consider the factual evidence advanced by both sides in litigation neutrally, and if witnesses are crossexamined, then – at least potentially – other evidence that might emerge ought, if it is important, to be considered by those experts in arriving at their final opinions given in evidence. In a conventional trial, expert evidence will usually follow on almost immediately after the evidence of fact has been heard. This means that, in practical terms, most experts will only have a very short time in which to consider any potentially important factual developments in any case before they are themselves cross-examined. Here, there was no such restriction.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The Horizon Issues trial timetable was therefore different to a conventional trial in this respect, because the vast majority of the oral factual evidence, with the single exception of Mr Parker’s evidence, was completed by 21 March 2019. That is 75 days, or almost 11 weeks, before Mr Coyne was called by the claimants, and even longer before Dr Worden was called by the Post Office. The approach of the experts to the opportunity presented by that interval further to assist the court with their evidence is notable, in my judgment. I will deal with this further in Parts H and I of this judgment. For a more detailed description of the architecture of the Horizon system (both Legacy Horizon and Horizon Online) reference should be made to the Technical Appendix. For a general understanding of the issues in this litigation, an overview is sufficient. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Horizon is both an accounting system, and also supports a large number of what are called business applications. Some transactions that a customer might wish to carry out in their local Post Office branch are what are called retail activities, such as buying a Post Office product. One example of this is buying a book of stamps. However, the Post Office has a large number of business customers whose products are offered to the public through branch Post Offices. The Post Office calls these companies “clients”. For every kind of activity which a customer wishes to transact in their Post Office branch, Horizon needs to have the functionality to perform it. This functionality means supporting the counter activity of carrying out the transaction, which is another way of saying Horizon enables the SPM or their assistant to transact the business over the counter. That business may be a combination of Post Office retail activity, and purchasing services or products offered by the Post Office on behalf of its clients. However, in conjunction with the ability of a SPM to serve a customer (what is called counter or front office), there is the associated “back office activity” of settling with Post Office's 'client' organisation, who has provided some service to the customer - such as the DVLA, or a bank. Accounting is a theme or thread that runs through all of these business requirements of Horizon, but it is only a part of them. The number of services provided by Post Office branches is large and has increased steadily from 1998 to the present day. The number of clients has almost certainly increased, and the functionality of Horizon has expanded in line with the growth in service, both on the counter and in the back office. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">For those activities where the Post Office branch is acting like a retail outlet (such as selling stamps), both the hardware and software is provided by Horizon to support this activity. This is the Electronic Point of Sale Software component of Horizon, that is referred to as “EPOSS”. EPOSS allows the SPM or assistant to record that some goods have been provided to a customer, compute the price of those goods, and allow the customer to pay the money required for all their purchased goods, using either cash or a credit/debit card. Often, a customer may wish to carry out two or more different activities in one visit to the counter - for instance, to settle a utilities bill and to buy some stamps. This can be done in the same activity and so Horizon has the concept of a customer carrying out a 'basket' of activities and settling the total amount due for the basket in several ways - by one single credit card transaction, by a cheque, or by cash.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Baskets of Post Office activities and non-Post Office activities are not supported by Horizon. Often, a local Post Office branch will be a retail outlet too, selling non-Post Office goods such as groceries, newspapers or even (as with Mr Bates at Craig-yDon) a haberdashery. If a customer wishes to buy a newspaper and some stamps, the newspaper is not sold by the Post Office; it is simply sold by the associated, though in accounting terms separate, retail outlet run by the SPM which uses the same premises. So, the customer has to settle in two parts. In some premises, a customer may queue up to purchase (say) greetings cards and pens (from the retail side of the branch Post Office). If they then wish to perform some activities with the Post Office, they may then need to queue up at a separate counter position to do that; that separate and second activity would be transacted through Horizon. In this respect, the National Lottery is an exception and spans the two businesses.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The Post Office’s clients include high street banks, Camelot, gas and electricity companies (for paying utility bills), DWP (for paying benefits and pensions) and DVLA (for paying road fund tax). Because of the different nature of the services provided through the Post Office for all of these many hundreds of client organisations, the services provided through the Post Office will be different from the service provided for other clients. There is therefore the need for some unique software functionality within Horizon. This must be provided both in the branch and the back office to support the activities for that client. This is a part of what makes Horizon such a large and complex system. The other reason that Horizon is so complex is because it has evolved over a long period. As will be seen below, the original concept and design for Horizon was for a joint Post Office/DWP project so that welfare benefits could be paid to benefit claimants in a certain way. That changed and the DWP withdrew from the project, but the need to offer other and an increasing number of products has led to many additions being added on to the system, increasing its complexity over time.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">As well as the counter activities necessary to run a branch Post Office, Horizon also supports the periodic process of balancing and rollover for each branch; essential elements in the accounting to the Post Office performed by the SPM. Every branch operates in Trading Periods, which are either four or five weeks (according to a timetable published periodically by Post Office). At the start of each Trading Period the branch is supposed to be 'in balance'. This means that the physical stock and cash in the branch agrees with the data regarding the stock and cash held in Horizon. Then, during the Trading Period, Horizon records all customer transactions made at the branch, so it records the changes in cash and stock. It is also required to record any replenishments or remittances of cash or stock in the branch. Thus, Horizon records all changes in cash and stock held at the branch during the Trading Period, and should be able to compute, from the starting amounts and the changes, the expected amounts of cash and stock at the end of the period.  </p>

The claimants maintain that the Horizon system in operation threw up numerous discrepancies and shortfalls in their branch accounts, for which the Post Office unfairly held them responsible. The Post Office dispute this, and maintain that these occurrences are explicable by carelessness, fault or criminality on the part of the claimants. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Horizon, whether in its first incarnation as Legacy Horizon until 2010, or what is called Horizon Online since then (originally HNG-X, now since 2017 HNG-A running on a different windows system), is at the centre of this group litigation. It should also be noted that it is not a system that is operated by the Post Office. It was originally designed, “rolled out” and operated by ICL, a company that was partly owned by Fujitsu, and which is now fully absorbed within Fujitsu, and has been for many years. There is a contract between Fujitsu and the Post Office in respect of Horizon, and perhaps in its current form it is rather different than the original contractual relations between those two entities. The contractual relationship between the Post Office and Fujitsu is not of direct relevance to the Horizon Issues, but arises tangentially only in respect of what is a sub-issue, namely the charging structure operated by Fujitsu for what are called ARQ requests for audit data and whether this inhibited the Post Office in this respect. The operation, functionality and accuracy of Horizon is an extremely thorny issue (or bundle of issues), although given the breadth of allegation and counter-allegation in the group litigation they are not the only issues. Providing the answers to the Horizon Issues will not lead to complete resolution of the litigation. It should however resolve one of the central issues about Horizon’s accuracy and functionality. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Here, the two main areas of dispute over the meaning of the Horizon Issues were as follows (there were others, but these are the most important ones). The claimants approached Issue 1 as it was worded, requiring consideration of whether bugs, errors or defects had <span style="font-style:italic">the potential</span> to cause discrepancies or shortfalls in SPMs’ branch accounts or transactions. In other words, this issue was not limited to consideration of whether bugs, errors or defects had <span style="font-style:italic">in fact actually caused</span> discrepancies or shortfalls. The Post Office, on the other hand, approached Issue 1 as requiring consideration of whether bugs, errors or defects had <span style="font-style:italic">in fact</span> actually caused discrepancies or shortfalls, and by reference to the claimants’ accounts specifically. This approach by the Post Office sought, in my judgment, to narrow the scope of the Horizon Issues. This was not raised at the case management stage.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The second main area of dispute concerned Issue 3. This includes consideration of the concept of “robustness”. This word has been at the heart of the Post Office’s defence of the Horizon system for many years. The Post Office has said publicly, and on many occasions, that no computer system is 100% accurate and/or perfect but Horizon is “robust”. This approach by the Post Office pre-dated the commencement of the group litigation and was at the heart of the Post Office’s response to the increasing criticisms from different quarters about Horizon. I deal with this important concept below in more detail at [36] below. What the Post Office effectively means by this (in outline terms only) is that the Horizon system can properly and safely be relied upon by the Post Office for the purposes for which it is designed and intended. The parties – and this is clear on the pleadings, as well as in the terms of Horizon Issue 3 – disagree over whether Horizon is robust. In the Reply, the claimants challenged this in the following terms: </p>

He was not involved in the drafting of the Horizon Issues, as the Post Office had used different leading counsel. However, that criticism overlooked that the Post Office had agreed to the wording of all the Horizon Issues through its other leading counsel, and the wording had also been approved by the court. Although there have been a total of three leading counsel altogether instructed for the Post Office thus far at first instance, with a fourth leading counsel used by the Post Office to try and appeal the Common Issues to the Court of Appeal, simply because different counsel are used does not mean that the issues ordered to be tried become different. The Horizon Issues themselves were appended to the Case Management Order itself.  </p>

That list of issues then constitutes the road map by which the judge is to navigate his or her way to a just determination of the case.” In this litigation, the Horizon Issues are not only important, but are vitally important. The whole of the proceedings concerns the operation and reliability of the Horizon system. It could quite easily be called the Horizon Post Office Case. Although there are a great number of different causes of action pleaded in both directions, both by the claimants and by the Post Office, against one another, the central core of the case is about Horizon. I consider that the wording of both Horizon Issues 1 and 3 – indeed, all the Horizon Issues – to be clear and had they not been, I would not have approved the agreed wording.  </p>

The parties in this litigation, usually but not always for convenience, would often refer simply to “bugs”, and one part of the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> Experts’ Joint Statement became known as “the Bug Table”. Computer professionals will often refer simply to “code”, and a software bug can refer to errors within a system’s source code, but “software bugs” has become more of a general term and is not restricted, in my judgment, to meaning an error or defect specifically within source code, or even code in an operating system. Source code is not the only type of software used in a system, particularly in a complex system such as Horizon which uses numerous applications or programmes too. Reference data is part of the software of most modern systems, and this can be changed without the underlying code necessarily being changed. Indeed, that is one of the attractions of reference data. Software bug means something within a system that causes it to cause an incorrect or unexpected result. During Mr de Garr Robinson’s cross-examination of Mr Roll, he concentrated on “code” very specifically and carefully. There is more to the criticisms levelled at Horizon by the claimants than complaints merely about bugs within the Horizon source code.  </p>

Although that wording was proposed and agreed by the parties, I considered at the case management stage when the Horizon Issues were ordered, and still consider now, that these words clearly cover the whole range of criticisms levelled at Horizon by the claimants, and the matters that could potentially be wrong with the Horizon system without restriction. Bugs, errors or defects is not a phrase restricted solely to something contained in the source code, or any code. It includes, for example, data errors, data packet errors, data corruption, duplication of entries, errors in reference data and/or the operation of the system, as well as a very wide type of different problems or defects within the system. “Bugs, errors or defects” is wide enough wording to include a wide range of alleged problems with the system.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">In my judgment, the correct construction of Horizon Issue 1 is that contended for by the claimants. In other words, it involves a two-stage process. Firstly, consideration of whether there were, or are, bugs, errors or defects in the Horizon system as alleged by the claimants. Secondly, if the answer is that there were, or are, such bugs, errors or defects, the second stage is to consider whether these have (or did have previously) the potential to cause apparent or alleged discrepancies in SPMs’ branch accounts generally. The issue is <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> whether such bugs, errors or defects did <span style="font-style:italic">in fact</span> cause such discrepancies or shortfalls in the claimants’ accounts specifically. That separate or different issue – the effect upon claimants’ branch accounts - is a more claimant specific one. It will have to be determined at some stage, for any of the claimants whose individual claims come to trial in the future. It may require expert forensic accountancy evidence. It was not ordered to be dealt with in the Horizon Issues trial. The Horizon Issues were intended to be, and in my judgment on their wording are, generic issues relating to Horizon and its operation. However, if a bug, error or defect is shown to have had an actual impact on any SPM’s accounts, then by definition it has had the potential to have such an impact. Actual impact on branch accounts can therefore be of assistance in considering Issue 1 as ordered, namely including potential.  </p>

The passages in paragraph 56 of the Defence that explained that no SPMs had been “ultimately held responsible for the shortfalls that it generated” reads a little differently with the hindsight provided from evidence in two lengthy trials. This is because the Post Office’s Defence effectively accepts that “Subpostmasters in the affected branches had made good or settled centrally” the sums in question – that is the shortfalls in their branch accounts that Horizon showed –  but states that these were <span style="font-style:italic">later</span> corrected. Both the expressions “making good” and “settled centrally” means that the Post Office had originally held the SPM responsible for the losses, as the shortfalls formed part of their branch accounts. These terms mean that the SPMs had either paid the money (making good) or been given time to pay sums which the Post Office treated as a debt, even if they were disputed sums (settling centrally), meanings given to these terms that were confirmed by Ms Van Den Bogerd in her evidence for the Common Issues trial. However, the pleading means that the Post Office had then, on the Post Office’s case, subsequently corrected this impact on branch accounts which was why it pleaded no SPMs were “ultimately held responsible”. Therefore there might prove not to be as much between the parties on this point in reality, as the group litigation unfolds, as there appears to be on the pleaded case. The Suspense Account Bug undoubtedly had actual impact upon SPMs’ branch accounts.  </p>

Context is important so far as the meaning of the word “robust” is concerned. If someone is in robust health, it usually is taken to mean that they are healthy, or even very healthy. A robust exchange of views can be a polite way of referring to an argument. Given the importance of the concept to the Horizon system, its prominence in the Post Office’s defence of the system, and its express inclusion (admittedly in inverted commas) in the Horizon Issues, I asked each side in the litigation during oral closing submissions for a reference from their pleadings or submissions for the meaning which they ascribed to the word. I referred to this as their benchmark definition. Robustness was referred to by both sides in the litigation in numerous places, but not always in the same precise terms, and clarity is to be welcomed.  </p>

This would mean therefore that it had no separate independent meaning other than as a summary of the longer second part of Issue 3. In other words, a robust system would be one that is extremely unlikely to be the cause of shortfalls in branches. The claimants also implicitly, if not expressly, criticised use of the term both by the Post Office in its pleadings and written submissions as being more aligned to public relations than as a performance standard. </p>

The robustness of a system is the effectiveness of the system in managing the risks of imperfections (which are inevitable in any system) and their consequences; this is the same meaning as how robustness was described in the Post Office’s written submissions dated 18 July 19.

The subject matter of such litigation is different from group to group, and what is appropriate in one set of proceedings will not necessarily be the best approach in another set. Group litigation may involve many claimants – even tens of thousands, in some cases – all with what is essentially the same type of claim, governed by a number of common issues that apply across all or most of the cases. Some group litigation may involve similar numbers of claimants, all with similar claims that are factually different. In this case, there are 584 claimants, which in the context of some group litigation, is not very many, although it is still in the many hundreds, and the period of time over which the relevant events are said to have taken place is about 16 or 17 years. There are different aspects to each individual case, but to deal with the litigation efficiently, cost-effectively and proportionately it is simply not feasible for the same judge to try all the claims, one after the other, in full on all of their respective merits. Such a process would take several years. It is not what group litigation is intended to achieve.  </p>

That will – or should – lead to cost and time saving. That does however require a high degree of co-operation from the litigants. Here, my intention of holding a substantive trial each judicial term onwards to resolve as much of this group litigation as possible, as quickly as practicable, became simply unachievable as a result of the issuing of the recusal application by the Post Office, explained at [5] above. A further trial in the autumn of 2019 also became undesirable as a result of the parties wishing to have time to consider mediation, and to find out whether the Court of Appeal would grant the Post Office permission to appeal on the contractual issues in Judgment (No.3). Over the numerous hearings and two full substantive trials that I have conducted, I have gained the distinct impression that the Post Office is less committed to speedy resolution of the entire group litigation than are the claimants, but it is not possible to state with finality whether that is correct.  </p>

In this group litigation, all the claimants are of the view summarised at [10] in Judgment (No.3) in terms of the behaviour of the Post Office. Recitation that the claimants are of that view does not mean that any similar views are held by the court, or that any decisions have yet been made by the court on that point one way or the other. The total sums claimed by way of liquidated sums (excluding heads of general damages not yet quantified) are approximately £18.7 million. The Post Office counterclaims for certain sums against the claimants and also alleges fraud. Reputations are plainly at stake on both sides. That is the case in many types of proceedings, particularly high-profile ones that attract press interest. However, that sum of money is not large, in the context of large scale and protracted litigation. The parties’ joint costs are approximately now £27 million, and because of the notification provisions in one of the earlier Case Management Orders I made, regular notifications of the total sum of costs are made to the court. The Post Office alone spent over one million pounds in little more than a month earlier this year; the notification letter of 13 May 2019 from its solicitors stated that its costs were in excess of £12,800,000; by the time of its letter of 25 June 2019, the Post Office’s costs were in excess of £13,900,000.

Not all of the Post Office’s costs will be recoverable costs regardless of the outcome, not least due to the existence of two Costs Management Orders which are in smaller amounts than the Post Office’s rapidly growing grand total, but the total figures still represent real expenditure of actual money.  </p>

In the claimants’ oral closing submissions, Mr Green QC for the claimants identified a high level chronology of what he called “doubling up”, by which he meant bugs, errors and/or defects that led to certain entries in branch accounts being “doubled” incorrectly.

That statutory provision replaced what had been referred to as the <span style="font-style:italic">sub judice</span> rule, but this did not relate to statements made in evidence in open court. The principle of open justice is a most important one and there were no restrictions imposed on any reporting of the Horizon Issues trial (nor the Common Issues trial) at all, nor were any sought by the claimants or by the Post Office.  </p>

I have not heard any argument on the matter, but I do not consider it would be proper to do so in any event. It was also not argued before me that the CCRC proceedings, which are subject in any event to a stay pending at least part of the outcome of the group litigation, are in any way of such a character that reporting of the Horizon Issues trial ought to be restricted in any way, or such that they could be prejudiced by the group litigation. Indeed, the presence of a stay of those proceedings pending the outcome of some of the group litigation issues would suggest directly to the contrary. The objection therefore by the Post Office to the way in which the claimants sought to make closing submissions on the actual impact upon different SPMs of what were said to be bugs, errors and defects in the Horizon System was, so far as it could be understood, not a well-founded one. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.66in;margin-right:0.39in">Finally, the claimants by their counsel were trying to draw parallels between what had happened to one particular SPM regarding “doubling up”, and numerous entries in internal Fujitsu and Post Office documents prior to that of similar “doubling” occurrences being caused by bugs, errors or defects. Those parallels are obvious on the face of the documents. The degree to which the CCRC find such parallels of assistance, if at all, is a matter entirely for them. The Post Office submitted most strongly that these different references were not to one single bug, but were references to a number of different issues or bugs that had been experienced in Horizon over the years. Whether that makes the claimants’ point for them or not, it is important to remind all the parties that the issues in this litigation are not going to be decided with sympathy, or lack of it, coming into account in the analysis in any respect whatsoever.  </p>

A different way of putting the same point is that simply because certain adverse findings had been made concerning the evidence she had given in the Common Issues trial, this did not mean that I adopted any particular starting position so far as her factual evidence was concerned for this trial. The court was entirely neutral in terms of starting position. Although it was certainly not a point that went to her credit that I had already made adverse findings of the accuracy of her evidence in the Common Issues trial, that did not mean that I started with any fixed view of the likely accuracy of her evidence in the Horizon Issues trial.

Sometimes, depending upon the nature of the subject matter, such an approach is understandable or unavoidable, and may be unobjectionable. It is not therefore sensible to state that this should never be done in any conceivable circumstance in any trial. However, on important points that have been dealt with by a particular witness in their evidence of fact, it is not a suitable device to adopt. This was particularly done in terms of the cross-examination of Mr Coyne concerning evidence already given by Mr Godeseth in his cross-examination, about alteration by Fujitsu of a particular branch account.

Blurring (or ignoring) the lines between submission and evidence is entirely unhelpful. Evidence is something that comes from a witness (lay or expert) and which the opposing side is entitled to test by way of cross-examination. It is not appropriate for detailed factual assertions to be made in closing submissions that are not directly referable to evidence in the case. There is no way such factual assertions can be tested; if they come in closing submissions, there is no way that the opposing party can deal with those assertions in their own evidence, or even put relevant points to witnesses for the other party in cross-examination.   </p>

The use of an electronic bundle has made this easier to manage than otherwise, but written submissions alone were in excess of 1100 pages in total from both sides. It is neither possible nor desirable to recite in this judgment, or in the Technical Appendix, or resolve, every single disputed item, or every single disputed fact, no matter how minor. I only make findings in this judgment that are necessary to enable me to resolve the Horizon Issues themselves. Simply because I do not specifically refer to a particular submission or piece of evidence, it should not be thought that I have not had regard to it. I have considered all the material, evidence (both factual and expert), submissions, and passages in contemporaneous documents, multiple times. The experts’ agreements in particular have been of great assistance, but everything has been considered. This judgment, together with the Technical Appendix, will be of substantial length, and to recite everything would very probably make it of unmanageable proportions. It is in any event far longer than is ideal, but that is partly explained by the fact it deals with the life of a complex computer system that spans some 18 years. </p>

Second, it is not necessary to deal expressly with every point, but a judge must say enough to show that care has been taken and that the evidence as a </p>

Third, the best way to demonstrate the exercise of the necessary care is to make use of "the building blocks of the reasoned judicial process" by identifying the issues which need to be decided, marshalling (however briefly and without needing to recite every point) the evidence which bears on those issues, and giving reasons why the principally relevant evidence is either accepted or rejected as unreliable. Fourth, and in particular, fairness requires that a judge should deal with apparently compelling evidence, where it exists, which is contrary to the conclusion which he proposes to reach and explain why he does not accept it.” </p>

He was called for the defence. The sums in question were approximately £74,000. Mrs Misra pleaded not guilty, and her defence was that the Horizon system was to blame. She was convicted by a jury after a trial in late 2010 at Guildford Crown Court, and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 15 months. She was pregnant at the time of her conviction and imprisonment. Expert evidence was called by the Post Office at her trial from Mr Gareth Jenkins from Fujitsu. Mr Jenkins was not called as a witness by the Post Office in the Horizon Issues trial before me, but a large amount of the evidence from the Fujitsu witnesses was attributed to information directly given to them by Mr Jenkins. This was a controversial matter between the parties at the Horizon trial. The Post Office did not proffer an explanation for Mr Jenkins’ non-appearance as a witness; they were not obliged to do so. However, in their closing submissions and after all the evidence had been called by both parties, they did so. The explanation provided was by way of submission and not evidence. This is a matter with which I deal with further at [509] to [513] below. Prior to the PTR, the Post Office objected to Mr McLachlan’s evidence on the basis that it contained opinion evidence and the claimants did not have permission for it, which is something required under the CPR.

Mr de Garr Robinson also expressed concern that any failure by the Post Office specifically to cross-examine upon any particular point in any of the accompanying Second Sight material, rather than the actual witness statement of Mr Henderson, would lead to the claimants submitting that such a point was not challenged, and that any such point would therefore be taken by the court as being formally agreed by the Post Office.

The court was to hear detailed expert evidence from two IT experts whose evidence would go directly to the Horizon Issues. Whether the Second Sight reports were, or were not, correct in their conclusions (which were generally critical of Horizon) would not form part of that process, and would not even qualify as a sideshow. Certainly their contents would not be determinative of the Horizon Issues in the group litigation. I have had no regard to the contents of the different Second Sight reports, nor to the Second Sight conclusions, in arriving at the answers to the Horizon Issues. I am aware that all of the Second Sight conclusions were challenged by the Post Office.  </p>

This is particularly so in a time-limited trial such as this one, but in my judgment is a general point of principle. The court was effectively being asked to direct the Post Office as to how it should conduct its case, and also consequentially, about how much of its time at the trial should be used for particular witnesses. This is not the function of the court. I was aware that Mr Henderson’s evidence was challenged by the Post </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Thirdly, it would in any event be wholly unconventional in a time-limited trial dealing with the subject matter of this group litigation for the court to give any weight to any submissions by the claimants that particular points of criticism or detail in such detailed documentation as the Second Sight reports were essentially “accepted” by the Post Office because they had not been specifically challenged in cross-examination. There is never sufficient time, in any time limited trial, to cross-examine upon everything. A time limited trial in the 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> century is not conducted in the same manner as a trial would have been many years ago, particularly in a detailed technical dispute such as this one. There was no forensic route available to the claimants whereby a failure to cross-examine upon the Second Sight conclusions or reports, whether due to the length of the trial or otherwise, would or could lead to a conclusion by the court that some aspect of the Second Sight reports was agreed or admitted by the Post Office, when it plainly was not. The period in question in the group litigation spans some 18 years. If attention is to be paid to other court users, the overriding objective and the Civil Procedure Rules, it is simply not possible (nor desirable) for any trial judge to permit the parties to have unlimited time to cross examine upon everything. The quid pro quo of that is a party cannot be expected to cross examine upon everything. There should have been no concern on the part of the Post Office that the Second Sight report(s) would be taken as not challenged by the Post Office unless their contents were subject to cross examination. Given there appeared to be such a concern, I explained the position at the PTR. The claimants also expressly said at the PTR that no such point would be taken. That latter element was unnecessary, as whether the point was taken by the claimants or not, it would not have been accepted.  </p>

A transcript of this hearing is available. The contents of the Second Sight reports were not cross-examined upon when Mr Henderson gave evidence, but in my judgment there was no need for them to be. As it happened, Mr Henderson was not cross-examined for very long, but that does not matter.

The specific experiences of the claimant witnesses who gave evidence about what occurred in their branches are, if I accept them, specific examples of the working of the Horizon system at the branch Post Office end in practice.

There was no explanation for this that he could come up with, including having checked his own CCTV, and he was sure he had carried out the transaction correctly – it was not an unusual transaction.

The correction occurred and he accepted it, but the stock figure for scratch cards in his branch on Horizon remained unchanged. This therefore showed his branch as having £1,000 more in scratch cards than was actually present in the branch. This issue was still outstanding as at the date of his amended statement which was 1 March 2019, and remained outstanding as at the date of his cross-examination which was 12 March 2019.

Because of the Post Office’s position on Horizon, almost all and any of the criticisms or accounts of factual events which the claimants made, or make, about how this system worked in practice are attributed to fault or carelessness by the SPM or their assistants. Indeed, without fault or carelessness by an SPM, the Post Office simply cannot explain these occurrences. The Post Office’s position is therefore to challenge the factual account – which it is entitled to do – because if the factual account by an SPM is accepted as truthful and accurate, then the Post Office would have to accept that there must be a fault or faults within Horizon. Therefore, the Post Office cannot accept that the factual account is truthful and/or accurate. Thus the dispute goes around and around in endless circles. This litigation is aimed at breaking that deadlock. </p>

Mr Latif was subject to a fairly robust attack, not only on his account, how it matched up with other records which the Post Office said contradicted it, what he and his assistants had or had not been doing, and indeed upon the full scope of his evidence and his credibility – as shown by the question I have reproduced. That question was framed as though even his own colleagues had concerns about what he had done. It was positively put to him by the Post Office that he had not even complained to the Post Office, although he provided the name of his Area Manager Mr Navjot Jando and said he had complained to him many times.

Firstly, extensive spreadsheets were put to Mr Latif which he had not seen before.

They simply have to be accepted. This was accepted by Ms Van Den Bogerd when she came to give evidence orally. Therefore the notable point made by Ms Van Den Bogerd, a director of the Post Office, in her written evidence, to shift the blame back onto Mr Latif, is simply wrong in fact.

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The second is that the Post Office evidence entirely omits any reference to the “memo view” – a type of communication used by the Post Office on Horizon which leads to a “pop up” on the terminal the next time each user logs on. There was simply no reference to this at all by Ms Van Den Bogerd, and Mr Latif said that this was sent out by the Post Office “to everyone” saying the error on the Lottery would be corrected by means of the issuing of a TC. Finally, Ms Van Den Bogerd corrected this passage in her evidence in chief by way of printed corrections prepared before she was called. She said that these corrections had been handed to her solicitors prior to the trial. If that is correct, it is surprising that Mr Latif was cross-examined on the basis of the original evidence in her statement, as that was not going to be her evidence in chief. However, regardless of that, she readily agreed that there is no choice regarding the acceptance of TAs – they simply have to be accepted by the SPM. In those circumstances, there is no explanation as to how the emphasised sentence in [93] above came to be in her statement at all, and it was plainly incorrect. Also, the call logs (about which Ms Van Den Bogerd was cross-examined) concerning this incident entirely support Mr Latif’s evidence.  </p>

I find that Mr Latif performed the required steps correctly in respect of the stock transfer between units, as one would expect of someone who had 17 years of experience, and was sufficiently skilled at his role such that the Post Office had, prior to the litigation, been sufficiently satisfied of his competence that he was used by the Post Office as a trainer for training other SPMs. I also accept his evidence, which is direct primary evidence of the state of the accounts at this branch, that neither he nor the auditor for the Post Office whom he named, have resolved the issue concerning the Lottery, the incorrect TAs and the effect of the </p>

Ms Van Den Bogerd’s evidence is a number of steps removed from the branch, and is little more sophisticated than assertions that there must have been other matters to blame, alternatively reliance upon records which did not, due either to their contents or to the way that they were deployed in cross-examination of Mr Latif, demonstrate the points that the Post Office maintained they demonstrated. I make further findings in respect of Ms Van Den Bogerd’s evidence in the section below dealing with the Defendant’s Evidence in Part E. Mr Latif’s branch was subject to an audit, and his appointment as a SPM ended then or shortly afterwards.  </p>

He gave evidence regarding certain issues with Horizon that he had experienced, which included the effects of a complete power failure to the building, which occurred mid-transaction. This occurred whilst a customer was making a withdrawal in the branch from her Post Office card account. On his evidence, this led to a shortfall in his accounts of about £600. Mr Tank paid this sum to the Post Office, and the letter from the Post Office stating how it came to be owed described it as a “branch discrepancy”; it was in fact £660. He paid it by way of a deduction from his remuneration. </p>

He was therefore given the warning against self-incrimination under the Civil Evidence Act in the same way that the two claimants in the Common Issues trial, who were accused in cross-examination of criminal offences, were given it. Mr Tank answered all the questions that were put to him. Mr Tank had, eventually, used the icon on Horizon in his branch for “Official Postage” incorrectly, and his explanation for this was that this was deliberate and was done in order to get the attention of the Post Office. He said at his 2015 interview that all his attempts by way of phoning the helpline and contact with his area manager had simply not resolved the numerous complaints he had made. He frankly accepted that he had not sent the post by official means which he had entered on the Horizon system as official postage, doing what he did by way of protest. It was put to him in cross-examination that he had “helped himself” to official postage, which on the evidence available was a suggestion that did not seem to have any basis in fact, if he had been doing what he said he was doing. There was certainly no evidence before the court to substantiate this assertion.  </p>

This acceptance at the time by the Post Office investigator was directly contrary to the way that the points were put to Mr Tank in his cross-examination, which were that he had “helped himself” to postage and “improved his financial position” by acting as he did. Detailed findings on this will have to wait for the full trial of his claim and counterclaim, but it is notable, in my judgment, that the attack on the credibility of this witness in the Horizon Issues trial, and positive allegations to him of criminality, were not consistent with the contemporaneous record of the acceptance by Mr Bridges for the Post Office in the investigation interview in 2015. Mr Bridge clearly accepted that the entries had been reversed. Indeed, Mr Bridges introduced this subject in that interview as follows: </p>

In any event, the Post Office’s explanation accepted that “there may have been a problem with the system” which is equally consistent with the claimants’ case, as it is with the Post Office’s case, if not more consistent with the claimants’ case than with that of the Post Office. Power outages do happen, and there is a process to be followed. Given Mr Tank was using Horizon Online, he was then in his crossexamination taken to Version 5 of a HOL quick reference guide. The version to which he was taken was not, however, the version available to him at the time, as that was a single A4 double-sided version in his branch, and the one put to him at the trial was longer than two pages and available online. The date attributed in the electronic trial bundle to Version 5, the version put to him in cross-examination, is 30 July 2015. His forum posts and his supplementary witness statement made it clear that the incident occurred in September 2014, a later date admittedly than given in his first statement, but still somewhat earlier than July 2015. This was however the version of the guide that Ms Van Den Bogerd relied upon in paragraph 78 of her 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> witness statement to challenge Mr Tank’s account. I find the version that he would have had available at the time was not Version 5, and was the single A4 version that he had available to him in his branch in September 2014. However, and regardless of this, Mr Tank accepted that recovery receipts would or should be generated and set out the procedure. He also accepted that giving all the receipts to the customer was not the proper procedure.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">In my judgment this entry clearly supports Mr Tank’s evidence about how Horizon operated on the occasion to which he referred. The heading of the PEAK was “failed recovery transactions”. The PEAK clearly states that the customer’s account would be correct – they were given the cash of £195.04 as they expected, but “the branch will have a shortage (for a withdrawal)” as the session was not recorded. A transaction correction was issued. There were related PEAKs, and also there was an entry “KEL acha959T may be relevant” on the PEAK, and Anne Chambers was referred to. The PEAK also recorded “Sending to SSC for investigation.” That KEL was raised by Anne Chambers on 28 February 2010, and the title was “HNGX banking reconciliation – state 4”. This is an important KEL, and I deal with its further detail in the Technical Appendix.  </p>

It was put to him that he would have been refunded even had he not called in to report, although how this would have occurred given the way PEAKs are initiated was not explained to him.

Ms Van Den Bogerd’s evidence was that there was a procedure available that Mr Tank should have used, yet the document put to Mr Tank that was said to support this stated expressly in terms that “the label could only be spoiled if the label was on hand” and Mr Tank’s point was that no label was “on hand”, given the problem he had was that the label did not print at all. Using the procedure in the document therefore would not be possible, and indeed would be contrary to the Post Office instructions that it could only be used if the label was on hand. These instructions also required the SPM to write “spoilt” on the label and keep it with the Horizon receipt for two years. This could not be done if the label had never printed. The explanation by Ms Van Den Bogerd, put to Mr Tank, was also directly contrary to the contents of a letter dated 7 September 2015 from the Post Office to Mr Tank which stated: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">“Your enquiry has been investigated and I can confirm there are no issues with Horizon online or the production of postage labels which would cause the situation you described. However if a user either pressed the yes or return key quickly before screen messages appear this can lead to a user confirming a postage print has happened when in rare circumstances it may have failed and put the cost of the failed print into the basket. In this circumstance Subpostmasters should contact Network Business Support Centre to arrange a credit for the spoiled postage.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">This means that the Post Office in that letter accepted that in some circumstances, depending upon how quickly a key was pressed, the printing of a postage label could fail and cause an impact to branch accounts. The SPM must make a telephone call to the helpline, to correct the fact that the branch account would show a charge for the postage even though no label had been printed and hence could not be provided to the customer. This letter suggests not that Mr Tank had not followed a particular procedure for dealing with spoiled (rather than non-existent labels) but that the system would, depending upon how quickly a user pressed a particular key, not print a label, even though the cost of the failed print would go in the basket. By going “in the basket” this means the branch accounts would include the cost of that label as a debit to those accounts. In other words, this letter supported Mr Tank’s direct evidence.  </p>

If the speed of pressing a key could lead to the cost of a printed label being added to the basket (and hence branch accounts) even though that label had not printed, it is difficult to see that there is a “procedure built into Horizon” as defined to cater for this. On the contrary, it appears from the Post Office’s own letter in 2015 that there was no such procedure. For the avoidance of doubt, I find that there was no such procedure built into Horizon. The evidence demonstrates to the contrary. Phoning the helpline and asking for a refund is not “a procedure built into Horizon”.</span>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Further, it is difficult to see how the explanation proffered by Ms Van Den Bogerd regarding how to deal with a spoiled label could apply to Mr Tank for two reasons. Firstly, I accept that as a matter of common sense interpretation and language, a label cannot be “on hand” if it was never printed. Mr Tank did not consider he could properly use the procedure in the guide for the problems he experienced, and I agree with him.  Secondly, the Post Office’s own explanation to him in 2015 was very different to what he was told in cross-examination in 2019 that he should have been doing. Even were I to assume (in the Post Office’s favour) that there must have been instructions from the Post Office somewhere regarding how a SPM should behave when a label failed entirely to print, as print failures (which would not produce a label “on hand”) were plainly not unheard of, it remains to be seen what those instructions were, and whether those instructions conflicted with what he was told in the letter in 2015. No such instructions have been produced by the Post Office in any event. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">I consider Mr Tank to have been a credible witness. I find that Mr Tank’s experience in branch was not an example of Horizon working “as it was supposed to”. I find that the creation both of a PEAK, and reference to a KEL within that PEAK, to be consistent with my conclusion. The proposition that Horizon worked as it was supposed to is an obviously flawed one. Indeed, that proposition is also inconsistent with common sense. PEAKs and KELs are not created for situations where Horizon is working “as it is supposed to”. They are created to deal with errors. The acronym KEL is for Known Error Log. Nor are matters referred to the SSC for investigation when Horizon is working correctly. Whether what occurred afterwards was an example of Horizon working correctly depends on the categorisation of Transaction Corrections and whether they are part of the Horizon system or not. I explain later in this judgment that they are not, therefore the issuing of a TC cannot be Horizon working as it should. Mr Tank also gave evidence, which I accept – and this is made out in the contemporaneous documents – that he had some difficulty in advancing this matter through the correct channels. The helpline operator with whom he was dealing initially refused to “pass up” the matter to a more senior person. Whether this was an isolated instance of unhelpfulness in this single case, or a more generally obstructive approach across the helpline, will have to wait for future trials in this litigation, and I recite it for completeness only in respect of Mr Tank’s experience. It does not form part of my consideration of the Horizon Issues.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Mr Tank was accused of criminal offences and it was said that he had “helped himself” to official postage and had “taken official postage”. These accusations were not put to him at his interview in 2015 and indeed the text of that interview shows that the Post Office interviewer expressly accepted that he had reversed the transactions, which is not consistent with Mr Tank “helping himself”. There are 10 pages of detailed closing submissions by the Post Office about Mr Tank’s evidence, and although he is criticised for being vague, confused, imprecise and for not having prepared his evidence with care, the allegation of criminality is not raised. However, the point was positively put to him in open court, and Mr Tank is entitled to a finding on it. In my judgment, it would be quite wrong to leave such an accusation hanging in the air, unresolved in this way. I find that on the material before the court in this trial and on the evidence available and put to him, these serious accusations are not made out. That is not to say I have made binding findings on the full details of his claim which remains to be tried in due course. The Post Office submitted, both in respect of Mr Tank and other of the claimants’ witnesses, that they confined their evidence to what was described as “a small sub-set of his complaints, presumably because it was felt that this threw light on the Horizon issues – and Post Office’s evidence was similarly confined”.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">However, there are two important points that must be borne in mind about that submission, both as it is made in respect of Mr Tank, and indeed the other witnesses called for the claimants. This has not been a trial of their individual claims. There may be other issues about Mr Tank’s branch accounts, raised both by him and by the Post Office, at the full trial of his claim and the Post Office’s counterclaim. That does not mean that this specific evidence, about specific incidents experienced on Horizon, should be discounted. Indeed, this specific evidence is not only directly relevant to the Horizon Issues, but is, in my judgment, very important evidence going to those issues. The second point is the parties’ agreed wording of the Horizon Issues does not allow for any wider issues going to Mr Tank’s branch accounts to be considered in this trial. All the other issues between Mr Tank and the Post Office remain to be tried in the later proceedings. The only point of difference between them on one of his two issues concerning Horizon was whether what occurred when a transaction correction was issued could properly be described as “Horizon working as it is supposed to”, and certainly the KEL referred to in the PEAK appeared during the Horizon Issues trial more than once. The creation of a PEAK, and the KEL to which reference was made </p>

The wider consideration of these matters that are dealt with both by the experts and later in this judgment. I reject the suggestion that Horizon was working as it was supposed to on this occasion. So far as Mr Tank’s experience with the £195 shortfall is concerned, there was a Horizon Online failure; three identical receipts were printed, which should not have happened; the receipts all showed a disconnected session; and there was a loss in the branch accounts that evening for the amount paid out to the customer. This was even though Mr Tank had settled with the customer for the amount specified on the receipt. There was no record of the transaction at all on the transaction log that was produced for the period of the Horizon Online failure. None of these, in my judgment, are examples of “Horizon working as it was supposed to”. </p>

This was just a few months before he was suspended. This outage led to the closure of his branch and he believed that this had affected the whole network. At the end of the next trading period, which was on 11 May 2016, there was a shortfall of almost £17,000, predominantly made up of a shortage of 16,000 coins of £1 denomination. This was a very large number and he said that he knew he would never have such a large amount of £1 coins in his branch. He was also the person in the branch who had dealt with the cash delivery that took place on the relevant morning, which is called “remming in” the cash. This means accepting cash into the branch from the cash delivery that Post Office makes to the branch, and entering the cash received into Horizon. His son, who also gave evidence, followed this matter up with the Post Office. On 19 May 2016 the Post Office contacted him about a discrepancy in respect of stamps, which so far as he was concerned related to the £16,000 regarding coins.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">This suggestion by the Post Office is, in my judgment, somewhat fanciful. A “big pile of £10 notes” is not the sort of thing that ordinarily gets “put in a safe and forgotten about”, and then suddenly “found”. It was also put to the witness that “things were pretty chaotic in your branch when it comes to these sorts of things” and “the cash declarations look like they are all over the place”. Mr Patny Senior did not agree with this characterisation of the way his branch was run. He certainly did not agree with the “big pile of £10 notes” theory the Post Office put forward. His evidence was also that it was his son who had contacted the helpline, and who had made the adjustments to Horizon that he was advised to do by the helpline. Initially the Post Office sought to challenge this account through cross-examination of Mr Patny Senior only. Counsel for the Post Office did not initially intend to put questions on this to his son, even though his son was plainly the correct witness to answer the detailed questions, as he was the person who said he had done certain things, and he was about to be called as a witness. The reluctance of the Post Office to put questions to the person who was plainly the relevant person to ask about this was said to be because “the records are the records” and the Post Office did not intend to repeat cross-examination that had already been done. I was not prepared to permit this. I required questions about what Mr Patny had, or had not, done, to be put to him directly, and not have the crossexamination conducted by proxy through his father. Mr Patny Senior’s son had given a witness statement in respect of these matters, and was plainly the correct witness to whom the questions should be put. He was the next witness listed on the trial timetable, and was going to be called next for the claimants. The notion that questions challenging what he had done, or not done, should more properly be directed to his father is contrary to how cross-examination should be conducted. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">So far as 11 May 2016 was concerned, when Mr Aakash Patny had arrived at the branch he became aware of the shortfall of over £17,000, which was a “complete surprise” to him and which he considered could not be explained. He had contacted the helpline, and had followed the steps he was advised to take, which he thought had resolved the issue. These steps were things he did on the Horizon terminal, and sequences of entries he was talked through over the phone. The documents available supported his evidence that he had made such a call, although some of the entries did not match what he said he had told them. There was no record of what he was told to do, nor was there any record put to him showing what key strokes had been inputted at the branch.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The Post Office’s case on the shortfall was that the outage on 9 May 2016 did not lead to any discrepancy. It was not put to Mr Patny that he had not made key strokes as advised over the telephone, or that he made different keystrokes to those advised. All that was put, somewhat unclearly, was that “the problem” was resolved, cash had been physically “found” that had been missed at the time of the previous cash declaration, and also that a figure showed on a cash declaration of “plus £17,000 odd” had the effect of “cancelling out” the previous discrepancy and showed that “there was no longer a cash problem”. Mr Patny denied any money had been found that had been lost; denied that if a discrepancy had been cancelled out the figure would have been plus £17,000, rather than zero; and said that although he thought following the key strokes he was told to input had resolved the issue, it had not. He was told to “readjust” the cash stock figure, something he had never done before, and relied upon the instructions he was given by the helpline. The Post Office’s cross-examination was done by reference to the cash management report, not the audit data. I will return to audit data later in this judgment in Part K, but the audit data would have showed what keys were pressed, in what sequence and when. Such data would have been of great assistance, but was not produced by the Post Office.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">On 19 May 2016 the branch was contacted by the Post Office, in respect of an overdeclaration of stamps. The amount of this was approximately the same value as the amount of the discrepancy of cash had been a few days earlier. He had done the declaration for stamps. A person called Debra Lambley phoned the branch. He was struck by the co-incidence in the amount of the stamp discrepancy, and told Ms Lambley the stamp declaration was impossible due to the number of stamps this represented. To assist a reader of this judgment on that latter point, but something that was not explored in the evidence, to obtain a broad idea of how many stamps that would represent, the following points are relevant. On 28 March 2016 the Royal Mail announced an increase to take effect that week in the price of stamps. 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> class stamps became 64p each, and 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> class stamps became 55p each. This shortfall would therefore have represented 25,000 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> class stamps, or over 29,000 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> class stamps.

The circularity of the Post Office’s case can be seen from a lengthy passage of evidence, which I will not reproduce, from page 26 on that day’s transcript to page 35. Mr Patny explained, basically, that the helpline gave instructions to resolve the cash discrepancy; this resulted in the figure for stamps being wrong by the same amount; Ms Lambley was not prepared to have this, and following her instructions this resolved the stamps situation, but the cash discrepancy reappeared. Then the sequence happened a second time. Mr Patny was prepared to accept he may have made a mistake once, but denied he could have made exactly the same mistake the same way a second time.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">There was no direct evidence to support the proposition that by increasing a declaration of stamps, it would have a corresponding effect in the opposite direction upon the declaration of cash held in the branch. In any case, in the Common Issues trial, there was evidence that making a cash declaration required specifying how many notes of each denomination was physically held in the branch. An SPM had to declare both the cash <span style="font-style:italic">and</span> the stock that was held in the branch. It is difficult to see how changing the number of stamps held in a branch would, or could, affect the physical counting and declaration of the amount of cash held in a branch by way of specific denominations. However, and in any event, the allegation of dishonesty against Mr Patny was a line of cross-examination that was not supported by evidence from Ms Van Den Bogerd, who was expressly asked about it, and who accepted that she had not made an allegation of dishonesty in her witness statement and said she did not offer an opinion on whether Mr Patny was dishonest or not. That means that there was no evidence from any witness called for the Post Office to support the allegation of dishonesty.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The second problem in relation to which Mr Patny gave evidence was a MoneyGram transaction in February 2016. This related to a failed payment by card by a customer, who tried to send £3,100 by MoneyGram but whose card was declined twice. However, the branch accounts still showed two debits in that amount in the branch accounts that led to a loss showing at the branch of £6,200. A TC was issued but only for one of these, which led to a £3,100 loss. Mr Patny accepted that he had only cancelled the transaction at the time, and not reversed it as well (which was required) until later, in the evening, when advised to do so by the helpline. As he put it, the amount had “doubled up”, in that the MoneyGram transaction, which was cancelled and reversed later on (which was for £3,100) had led to a loss showing of £6,200. If that is correct, then it is indeed double the value of the transaction. Ms Van Den Bogerd said that this was “not supported by the data” and also relied upon the fact that the cash shortfall on the day was greater than £6,200, namely about £500 greater than the cash shortfall which Mr Patny said had been caused by MoneyGram. She could not proffer an alternative explanation, however, and in her witness statement said: </p>

The net value of transactions during this period resulted in a £1,806.71 decrease in cash. The Moneygram transaction described above would account for a further £3,100, bringing the total explainable cash movement to a £4,906.71 decrease. However, this leaves £3,694.88 of cash movement unaccounted for. <span style="text-decoration:underline">I cannot say for certain what caused this additional loss of cash but there is</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">nothing in the accounts that suggest a problem with Horizon.</span> It appears more likely to me to be a problem with cash handling in the branch or a user error when making cash declarations.” </p>

Firstly, it assumes that the MoneyGram transaction was only responsible for £3,100, not the figure of £6,200 which Mr Patny stated. It assumes that £3,694.88 does not include the lower figure of £3,100, which in my judgment, on the documents deployed, it plainly does. Secondly, Ms Van Den Bogerd cannot say what caused the additional loss of cash. Thirdly, it states that that there is “nothing in <span style="text-decoration:underline">the accounts</span> that suggest a problem with Horizon” (emphasis added). That is rather stating the obvious. If all the problems complained of by the claimants with Horizon could be seen in the branch accounts, this litigation would not be occurring. Fourthly, she retreats to criticism of the way cash is handled in the branch, or other mistakes – “user error”. It is a perfect summary of the Post Office’s case, but it does not provide an answer. Other than vague “user error”, there is no explanation provided. I find that there is nothing in any of the documents to suggest user error. </p>

Further disclosure by the Post Office when the trial of Mr Patny Senior’s claim comes to be tried, together with evidence from Mr Irwin if he is called, will provide further information. Finally, the exercise undertaken by the Post Office in cross-examination failed to take account of the fact that one had to consider both the cash figure, and the shortfall, from day to day to make sure that one is comparing apples with apples. I consider the exercise undertaken in crossexamination to be flawed.  </p>

However, I do find that Mr Patny came across as a careful person, and as a credible witness, and I accept that he took the steps he did as explained in his evidence. He accepted that he had not reversed the transaction until later, rather than immediately as he ought to have done. The resolution of the movement of the cash position, and what if any explanation is available, simply cannot be done with finality at this stage on the basis of the factual evidence before the court alone. The Post Office had, according to Mr Patny, failed to provide the Credence data which would make it clear what had happened and how. The helpline logs show that Mr Patny had chased this on numerous occasions, and also the entries suggested that a Credence report was being prepared. The audit data showing what key strokes he had undertaken and when, was not produced by the Post Office.  </p>

I am only deciding matters in this judgment that are necessary to resolve the Horizon Issues.

So far as the second point is concerned, the documents put to Mrs Burke demonstrate that Fujitsu had worked out what had occurred; that the internal document attached to an internal email of 12 May 2016 did <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> accept that Newport branch had in fact paid the money to the customer, even though Mrs Burke had told them this on 9 May; and that by 16 May 2016 the decision had been taken that the branch would receive a TC anyway.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The conclusion that I draw from this is that the Post Office required something more from Mrs Burke than her word that the money had been paid out by her branch to a customer – the internal documents refer to “not knowing” if the money had been paid, even though she had already told the Post Office this. I find that the fact that this is a Fujitsu document rather than a Post Office document does not matter for this purpose. That something more that was required, in her case, was the evidence she had personally compiled that was of great weight, and was accepted by the Post Office, as the TC was issued. Whether evidence of lesser weight would have been accepted by the Post Office is not possible to say, and is entirely hypothetical. Fujitsu had, though, identified this particular problem experienced at the Newport branch by the national outage.  The information of what occurred, and the problem, was not visible to the SPM or their assistants in the branch.  </p>

Mrs Van Den Bogerd stated in paragraph 110 of her witness statement that “Once Post Office was presented with evidence that the customer had received the cash and the customer's bank had recorded the withdrawal, a transaction correction was issued to bring the branch.” She makes it clear, in my judgment, that it was the work that Mrs Burke did personally that had led to the issuing of the TC.

However, if Mrs Burke had not acted as she had, and if an investigation had been done by the Post Office, if that had been resolved in her favour, and if that had led to a TC being issued, then the shortfall in the branch accounts would have been corrected in a later branch trading period, namely the period during which the TC was issued. No loss flowed to Mrs Burke in respect of this incident, as a result of her own investigation. In any event, this is not a point of difference between the parties that it is necessary to resolve in order to resolve the Horizon Issues. There was plainly a potential impact to her branch accounts in any event, and that potential impact was caused by the Horizon system.  </p>

This was during the days of Legacy Horizon and he had no experience of Horizon Online. He provided two witness statements, the first of which was dated 11 July 2016. This was obviously very much in the early days of the group litigation. The second statement addressed certain factual matters in Dr Worden’s first expert report. I consider Mr Roll to be an important factual witness in this group litigation. He has no personal interest in the litigation and is not a claimant. He has never worked for the Post Office, although whilst at Fujitsu working on Legacy Horizon he obviously had a great amount of involvement in the Horizon system. However, given the expert evidence and particularly the degree of agreement between Mr Coyne and Dr Worden on the number of accepted bugs in Horizon, which even on Dr Worden’s position was 11 different ones, in addition to Mr Roll’s evidence there was ample other evidence in relation to my findings on the Horizon Issues. Mr Roll’s career has started in the Royal Air Force, which he joined in 1976 and left in 1989. Whilst in the RAF, which he had joined as an avionics engineer, he worked on mainframe computer systems and was selected for a software development team working on aircraft control and attack systems. After he left the RAF, he worked in various roles in development and support, and joined Fujitsu in January 2001. There, he worked in the Software Support Centre, or SSC, in Fujitsu at Bracknell in 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> line support. </p>

The Post Office also concentrated on a narrower band, or subset, of the issues regarding which he gave evidence, focussing more on potential problems with code and Mr Roll’s experience of those, rather than the wider issues generally in respect of Horizon of which he gave evidence.

Mr Roll also, again inevitably, was not submerged in the fine details of the subject matter of the litigation, in the same way as some of the Fujitsu witnesses such as, for example, Mr Parker himself, who is the Head of Post Office Application Support and the SSC, and who has worked on the Post Office account at Fujitsu since 1997, before Horizon was even introduced.

He would also not be likely to be able to recall these details, even had he known them at the time.

The expressions “tiny proportion”, “tiny fraction” and other terms used sought to demonstrate, basically, that Horizon worked very well most, if not all, of the time. Given the use to which the Horizon system was put by the Post Office, namely monthly balances which governed the branch accounts of SPMs, with shortfalls and discrepancies being “made good” – which means paid – by the SPMs in question, this approach can be seen to have limited utility. Firstly, these are subjective terms. Secondly, given the PEAKs show that a SPM may report a single unexplained discrepancy for (say) £25,000, or even £1,000 or £500, the fact that this may be only a tiny fraction of the number of calls the SSC worked on that month might come as cold comfort to that specific SPM. The number of calls, and how they were dealt with, is of some relevance to robustness, but such high level and subjective points were not likely to be of enormous assistance, one way or the other, in challenging Mr Roll’s evidence.  </p>

It is clear to me, and this was effectively confirmed by the documents put to Mr Parker later in the trial, that everyone at 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> level support in SSC was a specialist. The notion that these 30 people, in a department separate from the normal Fujitsu work areas, to which access was security restricted, were all at “the junior level” or “ordinary” with 5 people managing them who were “the true specialists” is simply misleading. There were a handful of people at the senior level, and the rest of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> line support were product specialists. A Fujitsu internal document, put to Mr Parker by the claimants (but not to Mr Roll by the Post Office) explained it rather more comprehensively.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">This series of questions introduced another subjective variable, “large amounts of code”. Mr Roll, in his answer above, explained that he had been a C programmer before he moved to Fujitsu. C is a general purpose programming language which is widely used. Mr Roll, as someone who had been a programmer both in C and other languages before he went to Fujitsu, had both written code himself (as a C programmer), and I find would have been very familiar with code in its different guises. Indeed, given the Fujitsu documentation describing the expertise of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> line support in [168] above, which stated 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> line support would have “detailed knowledge of the system based on documentation and source code inspection”, it is clear to me, and I find, that Mr Roll was amply experienced to give evidence to this court on the matters that he did concerning the Horizon system (which was at that point Legacy Horizon), the problems that were experienced with it, and what occurred at SSC. Source code is a term used to describe a version of software, or a description, as it is originally written. There are different definitions of source code in different computer authorities (such as the Linux Information Project) but the precise definition is not important for the purposes of the Horizon Issues trial. The Horizon Issues do not concentrate solely on problems either with code, or source code. The phrase is “bugs, errors and defects” and the Horizon System is defined in the Horizon Issues. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">What is important, in my judgment, is that Mr Roll used to programme in C programme language and other languages before he went to Fujitsu; he was required to understand and have “detailed knowledge of the system based on documentation and source code inspection” by virtue of being a member of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> line support at SSC; all the evidence demonstrates that he did his job effectively and competently; and he did not leave Fujitsu under any sort of a cloud. It was effectively accepted by the Post Office that he had a responsible position and a responsible role, and was well trained. The Post Office also sought to draw the following conclusion from Mr Roll’s evidence in favour of Fujitsu: namely that “….a clear picture emerged of Fujitsu as an organisation which was thorough, professional and conscientious and which took considerable care to ensure that matters were properly investigated and dealt with.” I do not accept that this picture emerged from Mr Roll’s evidence, but there was a considerable amount of other evidence in respect of Fujitsu in the trial other than that of Mr Roll. I will return to this claim by the Post Office at the end of my review of all the evidence, factual and expert, which is in Part L “Overall Conclusions”. That section of the judgment begins at [925] below. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">His use of “frequently” and “routine” are, in my judgment, subjective, and as explained above in terms of “tiny fraction”, subjective terms are not entirely helpful. What he meant by this is it was not unusual for this to occur. It is difficult to judge, at the remove of 15 years from when Mr Roll left Fujitsu, just how often something that he remembers as frequently or routine in fact occurred. He sensibly accepted that the more regular or mundane matters in which one is involved tend not to be remembered, with rather more unusual events sticking in the memory. In terms therefore of how often this occurred whilst he was there, it is not possible to come to a concluded view. However, I consider it important that the occasions to which Mr Roll refers were not isolated incidents on his evidence, nor were they unusual, and that financial discrepancies on the Horizon system at branch level was something which he recalls working on daily. It is also important that he gave evidence that if Fujitsu could not track down the cause then it was assumed the SPM was responsible, in other words user error would be used as a default setting for investigations. This matches the evidence of an enormous number of PEAKs in the Technical Appendix.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Notwithstanding the limitations on his evidence due to the passage of time, I found Mr Roll to be a reliable and helpful witness. I do not consider it was hazy in any important respects. I also found his evidence to be very important. The Post Office set out in cross-examination to demonstrate that he did not have the expertise that he claimed to have; that he was at too low a level in 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> line support to have been involved in the matters which he described, certainly so far as software issues were concerned; and that Mr Parker’s evidence in particular about what he had been doing should be preferred. On those two former points the Post Office failed, in my judgment. The success or failure of the latter point also, but not exclusively, depended upon the evidence of Mr Parker. After Mr Parker was cross-examined, it was clear to me that Mr Parker’s exercises that were put to Mr Roll could not be relied upon to demonstrate what they sought to demonstrate. I prefer and accept the evidence of Mr Roll to that of Mr Parker and the other Fujitsu witnesses (with the exception of Mr Godeseth) by some considerable margin. I find that during the years when Mr Roll worked at Fujitsu, 2001 to December 2004, SSC were not infrequently involved in attempting to remedy unexplained shortfalls and discrepancies in branch accounts reported by SPMs. If they were unable to find the cause of the discrepancy then the assumption would be made that it must be the SPM to blame. This is clearly shown in my analysis in the Technical Appendix particularly on the different entries in the Bug Table, and my findings on the number of bugs present in the system. </p>

The relevant passages are as follows: </p>

The test team felt they were under enormous pressure to complete the testing within certain timescales which negatively affected the test regime. Meanwhile, the development team had to balance time spent on fixes, with time spent on developing new features for Legacy Horizon and time spent developing a new system which I believe later became Horizon Online. </p>

In my first statement, I refer to the pressure that the SSC team and Fujitsu were under generally due to an awareness of the financial penalties imposed by the service level agreements between Post Office and Fujitsu (paragraph 12 of my first statement). I believe that although individual penalties were quite modest, when applied across multiple counters/post offices the cumulative figures involved were very high, potentially amounting to tens of millions or more. I disagree with Stephen Parker’s statement that these potential financial penalties were not a factor for the SSC (paragraph 43 of Stephen Parker’s witness statement) as we were aware of them and often commented on them, e.g. “That’s saved Fujitsu another £25 million”.” </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">I do not attach much weight to this as pressure in the workplace is such a subjective matter. Some members of SSC may have felt under great pressure; others less so. This is a subjective account of what it was to work at SSC at that time from the point of view of Mr Roll. The type of statement to which Mr Roll refers in terms of millions of pounds saved does not advance matters one way or the other. Given the type of problems that 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> level support was involved in attempting to resolve, there would have been an inevitable pressure involved in attempting to resolve such issues speedily. Mr Roll chose to leave Fujitsu, and therefore he left those pressures behind. Putting it at its mildest, it would be extraordinarily disappointing if PEAKs were closed, attributing fault to a SPM, simply because that was the easiest and quickest way for a SSC product specialist to keep on top of their workload. Without separate cross-examination of each product specialist who chose to close PEAKs where prior entries suggested user error had been ruled out, it is not possible to determine the degree to which this was their motivation in any individual case. However, it is not relevant. It is no part of the Horizon Issues to determine why, or whether, individual personnel at SSC acted in a particular way – budgetary concerns for their employer; exercises of judgement; even laziness; or any of the other many possibilities. Mr Parker gave evidence that “the possibility of financial penalties was never a factor for the SSC”, and Mr Roll said that it was. Mr Parker’s evidence on this suffers from a wholesale attribution of this lack of motive to every member of SSC, as indeed does Mr Roll’s, in the other direction. Everyone is different, and there will have been a </p>

Any sensible business will, in any event, always have at least part of its attention on financial performance and this is understandable. The Horizon Issues trial is not an inquiry into how Fujitsu manages its personnel, or its business. I do question the allocation of Category A, B or C to some of the PEAKs that were used in the trial, but this is something that was pursued (though not very far) with Mr Parker and I deal with it there.    </p>

In my judgment, this the Post Office failed to do. Mr Roll’s evidence was also what directly led to the true picture emerging of remote access.

It ran from 2012 to 2015, when Second Sight’s appointment was terminated.

All of the documents and emails which Second Sight had at that time were returned to the Post Office.

Some important documents, such as the Fujitsu XML transaction reports, were described by the Post Office as “unreadable”. He had however reviewed some, but not all, of the XML data when inspection was provided of some of the unreadable documents. He did not believe that the documents provided in the Horizon litigation were the complete set of data provided to Second Sight, which he had returned. I accept his evidence on this. He was clear in his recollection about how the documents were organised, and approximately how many there were and their type.

He had also been told at the same meeting that remote access was “occasionally used” by Fujitsu. He asked for complete email records for 2008 for the 7 employees known to be working at Bracknell at the time, so he could satisfy himself as to whether such remote access was done without the SPM’s permission or knowledge. He was not given these, and the partial records he was given were inconclusive.

Foreign exchange is the subject matter of bugs 14 and 23 in the bug table.

I have outlined these terms above to make it clear, on a transparent basis, what restrictions were imposed upon Second Sight. The Post Office’s wish to avoid any “material adverse effect on Post Office's commercial or financial interests or reputation” is expressed in very wide terms. Its concern about its reputation is similar to a provision included in its funding agreement with the National Federation of Subpostmasters which is referred to in Judgment (No.3).  </p>

There is a master PEAK in relation to this from 2001, and even though Mrs Van Den Bogerd was very closely involved in the issues on Horizon, she had not known about this until some time later. Indeed, she could not remember even the approximate year when she had become aware of it. She did not even recall, in the witness box, having seen the master PEAK before. </span>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">I am most surprised that Mrs Van Den Bogerd could not remember seeing this PEAK before she was shown it in cross-examination. It is a very important PEAK. It is <span style="color:#00000A">PEAK number PC0065021, dated 17 April 2001. The reason it is important is as follows. It relates to multiple branches. It concerns phantom transactions. It identifies dissatisfaction from more than one SPM as to how phantom transactions are being investigated and resolved, or more accurately, how they are not being. It shows calls being “closed” – ie brought to an end - without the permission of the SPM, even though that should not be done. It also shows at least one SPM threatening not to comply with their contractual obligations due to lack of confidence in the system, and also threats of legal action. Further, in one branch, where items had been the subject of phantom transactions (according to the SPM) ROMEC, the Royal Mail’s own engineers, attended that branch to fit suppressors and other equipment in an effort to rectify this. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The PEAK plainly records the involvement of ROMEC, the Royal Mail’s own engineering personnel, as follows. “<span style="text-decoration:underline;color:#00000A">ROMEC have </span><span style="color:#00000A">been to site and state that they have </span><span style="text-decoration:underline;color:#00000A">actually seen the phantom transactions</span><span style="color:#00000A">, so it is not just the PM's word now.” (emphasis added). The significance of this entry is obvious, and notable. Mrs Van Den Bogerd agreed that this was “independent site visit corroboration of the problem by Royal Mail’s own engineers at the branch”, and she also agreed that this was “clearly not user error any more”. I do not understand how the master PEAK containing such important information could not have been at the forefront of Mrs Van Den Bogerd’s mind. It is, in my judgment, important corroboration from those with experience of Horizon (the Royal Mail’s own engineers) who stated they had actually seen the phantom transactions. </span></p>

Given the entry that “it is not just the PM’s word now”, this conclusion ignores two entirely different sources of actual evidence. One, what the SPM reported. Two, what the ROMEC engineers visiting the branch actually saw.  </p>

This was PEAK PC0208335 of 14 February 2011, also headed “Phantom Stock Declaration”. This related to withdrawn stock discrepancies, and was summarised as "Branches will be forced to declare stock when they don't want to. Apparent reappearance of withdrawn stock may cause spurious discrepancies." It was recorded in the PEAK that this could affect 10 branches per week over the next few months. The PEAK showed that a SPM was told to declare the correct stock, which that SPM disagreed with, and which Mrs Van Den Bogerd agreed would mean the SPM entering an account into the Horizon system with which the SPM disagreed. Mrs Van Den Bogerd had not seen this PEAK either, before she was asked about it in the witness box.  She agreed that this PEAK appeared to be a software problem, and also that it was in a sense easier for the SPM because the phantom transaction related to stock that was not even any longer in use. The SPM in question simply could not have dealt in that stock.</span>

Further, Fujitsu chose to categorise this PEAK as “Administrative Response”. That term does not begin, in my judgment, properly to describe or summarise the problems to which the body of the PEAK referred. I find that this PEAK clearly related to a software problem, regardless of the misleading way that Fujitsu chose to categorise it as “Administrative Response”.

This SPM, whose branch was known to the Post Office, should obviously have been asked for further details (if further details were required for an investigation), and the Post Office and/or Fujitsu should plainly have investigated the matter as a matter of some importance. By 2013 Horizon was an extraordinarily controversial subject; there can simply be no sensible excuse for the Post Office’s failure to try and understand this particular subject. This is particularly reprehensible given that an internal Post Office document in August 2013 showed that Mr Winn’s involvement in this was because his area of responsibility was as follows: “also responsible for resolving specific branch accounting issues.” It was his specific job to resolve specific branch accounting issues, yet he decided at the time that “we have enough on”. I agree with Mrs Van Den Bogerd that this is inadequate – that is putting it at its most favourable for the Post Office. Somewhat stronger terms are also justified. </p>

She had clearly stated that Mr Coyne, having taken passages out of context, “mistakenly claim[ed] that the relevant reversal was issued in error by Horizon, not the Subpostmaster”. In fact she accepted that the reversal had been generated by the system, which in my judgment it plainly had. Not making oneself clear is a curious way of describing that her own statement had said the exact opposite of the factual situation.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">In brief terms, the Rose Report dealt with a situation whereby the data being used made it appear that a reversal had been done by the SPM, when in fact it had been done by the Horizon system. Mrs Van Den Bogerd was asked about one particular feature of the Rose Report (named after its author, Helen Rose), which dealt with the fact that no separate code was used such that this could be identified. This arose as a result of an occurrence at Lepton when the SPM engaged a forensic accountant as although he paid the shortfall shown on Horizon (about £80) he was adamant that he had not done the reversal that the system showed he had done. In other words, a reversal could appear in the Credence data as though it had been done by the SPM, yet in fact it had been the system (and not the SPM) that had done the reversal. I consider this to be important, given that the Credence data was used by the Post Office in any investigations. An extract from the report was put to her in her crossexamination (because she had given the evidence above about Mr Coyne, the Rose Report) together with a quotation from an email exchange with Mr Jenkins: </p>

The size of the potential losses was plainly relevant to Fujitsu. Given how the Post Office used the Horizon system vis à vis its SPMs, sums that were not “large” to Fujitsu does not mean that smaller losses would not still be appreciable sums to individual SPMs, who would have to pay for them if there were branch shortfalls. There is also no way of discerning what Mr Jenkins meant by “regularly” in terms of the risk of re-occurrence. Both regularity, and whether potential losses were large, are subjective. The Lepton incident showed that the Post Office required the SPM initially to pay the shortfall, which he did.  </p>

She has been closely involved with the defence of Horizon for some years. To be fair to Mrs Van Den Bogerd, she has also been responsible for some changes over time which have made Horizon easier to use, more reliable and (to use the wording of Horizon Issue 4), more robust. Horizon as at the date the experts were looking at it is a more robust system than it was, say, 5 or even 3 years ago. A great deal of this is likely to be due to the efforts of Mrs Van Den Bogerd.  </p>

Her cross examination led to a far greater understanding of the Horizon Issues on the part of the court, although her written evidence was, as originally drafted, extraordinarily one-sided. She minimised any reference to problems or issues with Horizon, and reverted to potential user error whenever possible as a potential explanation, an approach which she explained in her written statement as providing “plausible” explanations. Her witness statement also stated, in terms, the exact opposite of what the reality of the situation was, and I have given examples at [221], [223] and [226] above. Witness statements are supposed to be factually accurate, and care must be taken in future rounds of this group litigation that they are drafted in accordance with the rules.

When she told me that she had not seen a particular document before, I accept that. However, she also told me that she had been assisted in preparing her evidence by a team of ten people, and the Post Office had devoted “high level resources” to her evidence, as one would expect. It is therefore very surprising that she had not seen many of the important documents that Mr Green put to her in cross-examination. Some, such as the master PEAK on phantom sales, one of the recurring issues on Horizon, would have been the obvious place for anyone, still less a team of ten, to start when considering preparation of evidence for a witness statement. She explained that there was some pressure of time in terms of how long was available to her to prepare the statement, and this was further explained in supplementary reexamination, but I do not accept insufficient time as a valid explanation for her lack of knowledge on such important points. For example, she told me that at the time of preparing her witness statement, she had not even <span style="font-style:italic">heard</span> of the Callendar Square bug, one of two bugs that the Post Office accepted some time ago had been present in the Horizon system. This is an extraordinary gap in her knowledge. She did not know that there was a KEL dealing with failed recoveries, originally raised by Anne Chambers in Fujitsu as long ago as 2010, which is called KEL acha959T and which was updated most recently in 2017. This described failed recoveries, and seemed on its face to accept that these would recur, and was very close to the experience of both Mr Tank </p>

As will be seen from my analysis of the Fujitsu evidence of fact, I have certain views about the lack of accuracy on the part of Fujitsu witnesses in their evidence. If that lack of accuracy has also been included in reporting to the Post Office by Fujitsu, then that goes some way to explaining the Post Office’s lack of grasp of so much material that is consistent with the claimants’ case. As at late 2019, the date of this judgment, the Post Office also has the added benefit of the views of both the IT experts in the litigation, their four joint statements, the agreed number of bugs in the bug table (12, if one takes the number accepted by Dr Worden), the total number of bugs Mr Coyne says he has discovered (which so far as Horizon Issue 1 is concerned became 21), and collectively my findings on the Horizon Issues.

It obviously states or suggests that SPMs had a choice, when no such choice was available to them. The only choice they had was whether to pay the amount immediately, or settle centrally which means obtaining time to pay.

Sometimes amounts above £5,000 would be checked by reference to the helpline call logs, but the amount was not a set threshold and it depended upon how many sums had been settled centrally as to whether this happened.

Essentially, her task was debt collecting, as the Post Office saw amounts “settled centrally” as debts. Her concern was to obtain payment, or agreements to pay, and if not, then to escalate the matter to a SPM’s contract adviser. Usually, she said, the first or even second letter would lead to payment by an SPM. Neither of those standard letters referred to disputes. Mr Godeseth confirmed that the lack of any dispute button or function on Horizon was, as he put it, “by design”. This shows that the Post Office had been advancing a case, at least for a substantial part of the Common Issues trial, which was directly contrary to the evidence of its own witnesses of fact in the later Horizon Issues trial. I find this difficult to understand or explain. However, Ms Phillips’ role was fairly clear and she explained the process of branch dispute forms which would be used when a SPM raised a dispute directly with her team. This elementary system seems sensible, but it was only introduced in early 2018, and it would lead to a seven day period after which (if the form was not returned) the “block” placed on the amount would be lifted. She estimates that it would be used at least 5 times a month.  </p>

Originally he started in pensions and then moved to human resources and payroll, until in 1999 he moved to the Network Business Support Centre helpline, or NBSC. In 2000 he moved to work as a Problem Manager, dealing with problems that came through the helpline. He led the team that updated the knowledge base for the helpline, and was Lottery Manager in 2004. After performing different roles he became a Change Analyst in 2011, and then the Santander manager. He returned to Lottery within the Post Office in 2013 and worked there as a Team Leader. His existing role has a number of different activities including handling specific product based problems. His evidence dealt with volume of TCs and a suggestion made in Mr Coyne’s report that TCs for a branch in Potters Bar were initially made in error. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">A case management system was introduced by the Post Office in September 2018 to record each individual challenge to a TC. This is called the Dynamics System, and is still in what is called “roll out”. Individual challenges to TCs were not recorded prior to that. Further information about how this system was working was obtained in cross-examination, and leads me to the conclusion that the way that TCs are recorded now is far improved from what it was before the Dynamics System was introduced. That does not however take one very far. Mr Smith knew of reports that were available from that system but he had not produced any. Those reports would be the best evidence of the type of points Mr Smith was seeking to make for the most recent periods at least, but given he had not used them, it is not possible to speculate on what they might show.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Mr Smith had obtained almost all the data contained in his statement from others, and some was plainly incorrect, and other data so vague as to be wholly unhelpful. For example, for Santander, originally he had provided a table with a column stating that 2,890 disputes were received from branches in the 2016/2017 financial year. In fact, that column should have been disputes received by Santander from the Post Office. This was corrected in his second witness statement, but Mr Smith was unnecessarily combative, in my judgment, about the need for the correction, maintaining that “the facts and figures were correct” in the first statement when they plainly were not. The figures were correct as figures but the descriptions of what the figures were, were plainly wrong.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Even after the correction, the various figures extracted by him from information provided by others was not particularly useful. For example, the figures for the numbers of TCs disputed, and for compensating TCs, for BOI Retracts and the Lottery, were both estimated at 1,500 and 500, for both line entries. This estimate was plainly of the most vague type, and even Mr Smith could not comment on the reliability of either of those estimated figures for either line entry, although he maintained the figure for issued TCs would be reliable. This evidence from him, was of the most general type, and was not of great, or indeed any, assistance. For example, in respect of MoneyGram his evidence was that one or two disputes a month were received but they were rarely if ever accepted. Given he had no idea at all of the overall total, this evidence does not assist me in resolving the Horizon Issues one way or the other. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">His explanation for the TCs at Potters Bar was that a cheque that was deposited for £90,000 was mis-keyed, and entered for £900,000. Accordingly TCs were required to correct this at the branch, and the need for two was because the payment was made by cheque.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">I found Mr Smith’s evidence, with three exceptions, to be of no assistance whatsoever. The two exceptions are his evidence I have summarised in [269] which is relevant to the scope of the Horizon Issues and Dr Worden’s countermeasures, and his explanation about Potters Bar and the two TCs. I accept his explanation about the Potters Bar TCs. Both of those exceptions are relevant to the Horizon Issues. The third exception is his evidence about the Dynamics System. This goes to the robustness of Horizon as of 2019 and is therefore relevant. However, the absence of such a system also goes to robustness prior to its introduction in 2018, and is also therefore relevant. However, his wider evidence is of limited relevance at best. His knowledge of the figures contained in his statement, and the vagueness of his evidence generally, were such that the utility of the exercise which he presented in his statement is de minimis. In any event, the substance of that evidence went to an attempt to demonstrate that some TCs are challenged by branches, and fewer challenges are upheld than are made. The figures vary inevitably from year to year, and this case is not about general statistical trends in any event. In some areas of business TCs have fallen to a very low level, for example the DVLA, which Mr Smith explained was only 4 in the last year, none of which have been upheld. However, the records that were put to him show that there were 2,717 in the period 2010/2011. All this evidence does is show that far fewer TCs are now issued by the Post Office in relation to the DVLA business, which as Mr Smith explained, has fallen considerably in any event. None of these points are of particular relevance to resolving the Horizon Issues. The experts are agreed that Horizon as it is in mid-2019 is more robust than it was in the past. One would expect, therefore, fewer TCs to be issued now. </p>

Mr Dunks was then taken to the witness statement of another Fujitsu witness in the Misra trial, called Penelope Thomas. She had given evidence about data extraction and listed a number of controls, which were remarkably similar to the ones that Mr Dunks gave evidence about (although Ms Thomas had omitted one). This is hardly likely to be a coincidence, if Mr Dunks really had compiled his list of controls from memory or experience.

This is because gaps and duplicates in the data affects the accuracy of that data. I consider that such a cavalier approach to whether audit data has gaps and duplicates, as evidenced by Mr Dunks’ saying that such things were not part of his concern, to be entirely contradictory to a statement verifying the accuracy of such audit data.  </p>

This project ran from approximately 1996 to 1999 and was to be provided by ICL (which Fujitsu partly owned and later fully acquired).

The cost of a book of stamps is taken from the reference data table and the terminal shows the SPM or assistant how much money the total number of transactions are worth and what the cost to the customer is to be. It is basically the shopping basket which is put together by the SPM (or assistant) serving the customer and adding, by means of pressing buttons on the screen, different items to the basket as the customer goes through the items or products they wish to buy. At the end of this hypothetical transaction, if the cost of the basket is (say) £21.98, the customer will pay that amount (say by cash) which will be taken by the SPM and put into the cash amount held in the branch.  </p>

If there was no user logged on at the counter then Riposte would introduce a blank user ID and that would be picked up in later processing.” This therefore meant that if, say, a SPM (or an assistant) was logged on at the time that the message was inserted at the counter, it would appear next to that SPM’s user ID (or that of the assistant).

This would appear to the SPM from the records that they could see (and anyone else looking at those records) as though the inserted transaction had been performed in the branch itself.

Indeed, he could not really explain why the records sought by the claimants did not exist at all. He thought the reporting might be done at meetings with ATOS, but he could not remember going to one. In fact, his evidence on this was so very vague as to be somewhat alarming, given his role within Fujitsu. He did not know if there were any records of the particular type apart from between the years 2014 to 2017, and he only knew that because Mr Bansal had told him. </p>

Over the years of both Legacy Horizon and Horizon Online, the total number of software bugs, defects and errors in Horizon considered by the experts is far greater than the number to which Fujitsu have admitted. This is shown in the appendix to this judgment summarising the number of bugs, errors and defects, and their years of operation. The total number of software bugs, defects and errors in both versions of Horizon is very important information. Why Fujitsu chose not to collate and report these in the manner that even a Fujitsu internal document stated would (or should) be done, is wholly unclear. A comprehensive record, whether using the metrics identified by Mr Salawu or other similar ones, would surely only assist both Fujitsu and the Post Office in its administration of Horizon. Given that such a comprehensive record has not been produced to the experts for their consideration, notwithstanding the express request made on behalf of Mr Coyne, the court is entitled to conclude that no such comprehensive record exists.  </p>

As it was put to Mr Godeseth, “the "SQL INSERT" statement effectively goes in and puts in the missing other side of that transaction?”, a point with which he agreed.

Mr Godeseth described himself as not expert on Oracle, but he had a working knowledge of it, and he is plainly more experienced with using Oracle than most people. I find his experience in Oracle more than sufficient for him to be able to answer questions on this subject. Mr Godeseth’s evidence shows that Type 1 was an update – something which the low level design document expressly said the tool would not be used for. The design document did not contain the necessary database object fields table for performing the unlocking function, which the Post Office’s solicitors said represented all of the occasions, save one, when the tool had been used. This was all put carefully and clearly to Mr Godeseth in his cross-examination, and he agreed with all the points put.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">This was further confirmed – the mandatory use of insert, and the fact that an update command was not included in the design intent of the tool – elsewhere in the design document where it stated under method “The module will read the contents of the input transaction file, which will be in the form of an SQL insert statement. Only a single insert statement is allowed and (after an optional introductory comment) it must start with the 'insert into' clause." The insert would be in the SQL script, and Mr Godeseth expressly confirmed this. This is another example of Fujitsu failing to observe its own design intent for the use of a tool that can have an impact upon branch accounts, and in my judgment is a factor that goes to the robustness of Horizon as well as the accuracy of data. As was put to Mr Godeseth, the use of the tool had gone “way beyond” the intent in the design document, and he agreed. He said that “there is tooling which is based on this” – by which he meant based on the transaction correction tool - “which has two aspects to it, certainly, so I think I’m agreeing with you”. It is agreed that there was only one occasion when what was called Type 2 was used. This evidence goes to the wider point that I have explained, namely Fujitsu failing to observe its own design intent.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Mr Godeseth was taken, very carefully, through a specific use of the transaction correction tool in 2010. In PEAK 0195561, a problem was reported to the SSC on 4 March 2010 where a SPM had tried, on 2 March 2010, to transfer out £4,000 (referred to in the PEAK as 4,000 pds, which means either pounds (plural) or pounds sterling) </p>

These two receipts had the same session number. The PEAK, as one would expect, records various matters in note form and also uses informal shorthand. However, the main thrust is that when the SPM did the cash declaration, although the main stock unit (into which the £4,000 was being transferred) “was fine”, the unit from which the cash was taken “was out by 4000 pounds (a loss of 4000 pds)”. This is very similar to what Mr Latif said had happened to him, although the transfer in July 2015 to which he referred was £2,000. The PEAK related to Horizon Online and was the admitted occasion when the Balancing Transaction tool had been used.  </p>

These log files would be held by Fujitsu, so any failure to have them before the court was no fault of the parties in this litigation, and that can only be laid at the door of Fujitsu. If a senior Fujitsu witness thought they would be better records, they should have been accessed and evidence about them could have been given directly. Certainly Fujitsu witnesses could have given evidence that relied upon them, had they so wished. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">In my judgment, the Horizon Issues are sufficiently wide and costly to resolve concerning the Horizon System, both Legacy and Online, without widening them to include some attempt at including specific bugs within Oracle too. The Oracle Corporation is not even a party, and has had no opportunity to provide evidence or submissions. I simply recount Mr Godeseth’s evidence as he attempted to explain the PEAK. He did, as can be seen, refer to potential bugs in Oracle as an explanation for something that he believed to be puzzling. He accepted it was a bug and/or “a glitch”.  In any event, other than Mr Godeseth’s evidence expanded in re-examination that he was involved in 2010 when establishing himself in Fujitsu (and in this he referred to an Oracle bug, which involved nodes in the database going down) there is no evidence before me that there were any bugs in Oracle in respect of this doubling up, and I reject the suggestion that this can be laid at the door of Oracle. What this PEAK shows, in my judgment, is that Fujitsu itself, with a great deal of time to prepare for the Horizon Issues trial, simply could not explain then, and cannot explain now, what caused this event to occur. That is relevant to my consideration of the Horizon Issues, and in my judgment shows that there was in that respect a bug, error or defect within Horizon. It also shows that there were those in Fujitsu who wished to close the call with the error put down to the user, as shown by the “Defect cause” being “updated to 40 – General – User”. There is nothing in any of the material on this incident to suggest it was in any way caused by the user. </p>

In my judgment, the way that Fujitsu anticipated resolving this, by artificially seeking to engineer “a large shortage which cancels out the large gain” is not exactly grasping the nettle.

He did however then add “I think I would say that Post Office were well aware of this and I would argue that it's a Post Office decision whether or not to tell a subpostmaster.” This shows that Mr Godeseth was not immune from arguing the case or making suggestions not supported by the evidence. Nothing was produced by either side to show that the SPM in this case was told. Certainly the person at Fujitsu who wrote “….it’s best that the branch is not advised” cannot have shared Mr Godeseth’s view at the time. Mr Godeseth did however also say, in my judgment again importantly, that “in the background to this there was a dialogue with [the] Post Office” and he agreed with counsel who put to him that the “Post Office would have been aware of what was being done by Fujitsu”.  </p>

These corrections should, in my judgment, have been in the same amount, as one relates to “front end” (or the branch messagestore) and the other “back end” of the accounts so far as Horizon is concerned. The statement in the PEAK that “this appears to be a genuine loss at the branch, not a consequence of the problem or correction” is simply insupportable. That is a statement made by Anne Chambers, which in my judgment flies in the face of the documents. I am supported in my conclusion by two things. Firstly, Mr Godeseth’s evidence, when it was put to him that this was a fair possibility when he said “having read this PEAK in more detail overnight then yes, clearly that is what appears to have been the case.” I accept that evidence. It is supported by the documents and by the text of the two different corrections. Secondly, plain and obvious common sense. </p>

Leading counsel for the Post Office stated “I can tell you on instruction what that figure means”; “So on instructions I can tell you than the sale value of £1,0114.73 and the quantity of 2,080……” and “I appreciate that I’m telling you this on instructions because I have to say nobody knew that this suggestion was going to be made until it was put to Mr Godeseth….” It was made clear that there was what was being put to Mr Coyne as a detailed explanation of what had occurred, was “on instruction”, and it was nowhere in the evidence.  </p>

When Mr Coyne was cross examined, about 2 ½ months later, a great deal was put to him “on instruction”, as I have identified. It was a detailed factual explanation that was not included in any evidence at all. Firstly, the OCR that went with it showed that “This OCR is being raised so that EDSC is authorised to amend the txn details for branch 183227 and insert these into tps_pol_fs_summaries_incomp table on the host.” This was required precisely because Mr Godeseth was correct, in my judgment, in his understanding of what had occurred. I accept his evidence on this. Secondly, the explanation put to Mr Coyne “on instruction” was (broadly) that there were two problems. A careful attempt was made to explain to Mr Coyne how (basically) Mr Godeseth had misunderstood, and to downplay the effect of what had occurred.  </p>

This deprived the claimants of any ability to challenge the explanation, if explanation it was, by cross-examination. Further and in any event, there was ample time for the Post Office to have provided a short witness statement from a Fujitsu witness, such as Mr Parker (who was not called until 11 April 2019) dealing with this, if that was the evidential explanation. If that had been done, permission for that statement would have been required, but given the matter arose from something Mr Godeseth was asked about, that application could have been dealt with at the time and if this genuinely was evidence that the Post Office could not have known in advance would be required, it would have been allowed in. Even supplementary questions in chief could have been used as a method of obtaining actual evidence on this point. It simply is not procedurally acceptable, or fair, for evidence of this nature to be given by way of submission “on instruction”. However, and in any case, I have considered the Post Office’s case on this notwithstanding these points, and I find that the documents do not substantiate the explanation given on Day 16 to Mr Coyne when he was being cross-examined.  </p>

Had that message been produced, it could have been looked at, and deciphered. Understanding such a message is not an insuperable task beyond mortals. The second point is that the PEAK refers to a KEL, namely KEL obengc3120K. At the beginning of the trial, I asked for hard copies of all PEAKs and KELs put to witnesses to be prepared in hard copy too, so that I had a working file that I could use during the trial for PEAKs and KELs already referred to (in addition to the three OPUS trial bundle screens that I had to work from). This was done. That KEL is at tab 21 of volume 2 of the file entitled “PEAKs and KELs referred to in Days 5-8 and 12”.

Following on from that, it was picked up that other giro business deposits that had been entered had not come up on the system, so they were re-keyed.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The important points from this are as follows. This problem turned out to be an admitted bug. At the time, the SPM noticed the problem – and could only identify it as a “problem with Horizon” and reported it. The branch accounts were plainly affected by a sizeable amount, over £6,400. Horizon Support Centre, after investigation, agreed that there was a “navigation problem” – this is a problem with the Horizon system, and was caused by a bug. The Suspense Account Team would not authorise the shortfall in the branch accounts being moved to the Suspense Account; in other words, they were not prepared not to hold the SPM responsible. Mr Godeseth also accepted that “the genesis of it appears to go back to February 2003 and similar lock agent problems back in November 2000”, a point that he accepted as “that’s fair”. The history of the problem was therefore somewhat longer than something that just occurred in 2005 for the first time. During that five year period, branch accounts were usually being produced every four weeks. </p>

Horizon Support were telling the SPM, whose branch accounts were affected by discrepancies, that “they cannot find any problem”. The SMC – the part within Fujitsu responsible for providing corrective action for the “event storms” – would not always notice these had occurred in time and by then “the damage may have been done”.

Also this can be checked on any Balance Reports or Branch Trading Statements that are available from the Branch which should show that Receipts and Payments do match and that the Trading Position is zero. </p>

There were obviously legal cases going on at the time, hence the reference in the underlined bullet point to “ongoing legal cases”. If these were criminal cases, the Post Office would be the prosecuting authority, with certain important duties. If these were civil cases, the Post Office would be a party with disclosure obligations. An affected branch would believe it had balanced its accounts correctly; it would not have done so. There is an evident concern amongst those at the meeting which is recorded in this document that this issue should not become “widely known” in order to avoid causing “a loss of confidence in the Horizon System”.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Of the three solutions considered, the one that was adopted was issuing a debt recovery/refund even though there would be no discrepancy at the branch. Given one of the Common Issues was the status of a Branch Trading Statement, which the Post Office argued should legally have the status of a settled account with the SPM as agent, I note the suggestion adopted with more than passing interest. The solution explains “even though there is no discrepancy at the branch”. This means the Branch Trading Statement would be correct, or in balance. The discrepancy would <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> be in the Branch Trading Statement, it would be in POLSAP or Credence. That this is correct is shown in an associated document from Mr Jenkins (trial bundle reference F/777/2) where he stated that “the data used for the BTS will also have a zero value for Discrepancies at the end of the period.” BTS means Branch Trading Statement. A similar entry is in the document at F/1000/1 which states at /2 “Note that if the bug was not present, then the Discrepancy would have been transferred to Local Suspense and that would have been cleared, so <span style="text-decoration:underline">there are a number of things wrong with the</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">BTS.” </span>(emphasis added).

During the preparation of this judgment, in view of the fact that judgments are required to be factually accurate, because dates can sometimes become lost in the midst of huge trial bundles and very detailed submissions, and also because the simplest way to arrive at a date when something has been done is (sometimes) simply to ask the parties for a date or a reference, on 7 October 2019 the parties were jointly asked the following:</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The Post Office’s approach to this, in my judgment, entirely misses the point. In my judgment, the above passages are simply extraordinary. Two of the documents above are dated 2010, some 9 years ago. The PEAK is from 2004, 15 years ago. Their contents support the claimants’ case on the Horizon Issues. Fujitsu knew, to take Callendar Square as an example, that this bug existed in Horizon. They knew that it had affected branch accounts. It was not, as the Post Office puts it “unnecessary and inappropriate” to notify SPMs of this. I have listed the points on this bug at [425] above omitted by Mr Godeseth from his written evidence. Those same points all lead to the same conclusion in my judgment, namely that the Post Office ought to have notified, at the very least, all those SPMs whose branch accounts had been impacted by this bug that this had occurred, and that it had occurred as a result of a software bug. The fact that the integrity of Horizon data was a live issue at this time should not have influenced the decision to notify SPMs of a software bug. Further, the Post Office’s explanation in its submissions that SPMs had their accounts “corrected in the ordinary course” is not a suitable phrase, unless by “ordinary course” one means keeping the cause or reason for the correction secret and therefore hidden from the other party in the accounting transaction, namely the SPM. Also, one is not educating users in the details and terminology of the system (as suggested by Dr Worden) if one informs them that there is a software bug in the system and its symptoms are as follows. This is relevant to Horizon Issue 2, namely whether the Horizon IT system itself alerted SPMs of such bugs, errors or defects as described in Issue 1 above and if so how, and also Horizon Issue 9, which concerns transaction data and reporting functions available to SPMs. It is also relevant to Dr Worden’s consideration of countermeasures, which he considers includes vigilance by users (which means SPMs). </p>

That date too was factually incorrect. The issue notes refer to Fujitsu knowing about it far earlier, and Mr Godeseth accepted he had seen this document before his cross-examination. That document even records Fujitsu being taken to task by the Post Office about how long it had taken to react, as in “We have asked Fujitsu why it has taken so long to react to and escalate an issue which began in May. They will provide feedback in due course.” Not just the impression, but the express text in Mr Godeseth’s witness statement, was to the effect that the bug was discovered in September 2010 and almost immediately dealt with. That was far from the case, and that written evidence was simply wrong.  </p>

The bug caused entries from local suspense accounts in 2010 to be reproduced in Horizon in two successive years. What was supposed to be only temporary data was retained, not deleted as it ought to have been, and the system then used it again. It affected certain tables in the branch database and the archiving strategy of deleted Stock Units. This affected 15 branches. The effects of the bug were brought to the attention of the Post Office by two SPMs “with the largest discrepancies” and Fujitsu became aware of it in January 2013. However, the note by Mr Jenkins of 15 May 2013 summarising it states that the problem was known about far earlier than that: </p>

A consequence of this is that some changes were made to the archiving strategy on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> July 2011. An unintended consequence of this change was that any Branch that deleted a Stock Unit at the end of 2010 which had local suspense transaction in that Stock Unit before it was deleted were left in the table used for constructing the BTS.

This “outreach” element is used, particularly in very rural areas, to provide post office services to remote communities. A SPM needs to scan or record a pouch from one branch (the core) into the outreach branch (the van or village hall) to record that the contents of the pouch are not in the core branch, but are in the outreach branch instead. This is a branch to branch cash remittance, if the pouch contains cash. Mr Godeseth had no first hand knowledge of this bug.

One related to what is called Forced Log Out, when the Post Log On script was not correctly closed down and was left on the stack of incomplete processes. The other related to the way the Pouch Delivery script operated; because the Post Log On script had not correctly closed down meaning the stack was not empty, the Pouch Delivery script thought it had not finished and attempted to repeat the last part of the script. This had the effect of recording the remittance transactions and printing of receipts. This would lead to duplicate pouch IDs. Pouches have bar codes that are scanned and each is supposed to have a unique ID. The duplicate pouch ID would have a value attached to it – the sum in the original pouch. It would however be recorded twice as a result of this.  </p>

She had Horizon receipts in her outreach branch of £32,000 (4 times £8,000) and therefore a discrepancy of £24,000, as she had only transferred £8,000 in cash out of her core branch into it. This was investigated by SSC and she was issued with a TC a few weeks after it had occurred.

His evidence was of considerable assistance; he did not always answer questions the first time he was asked, but the final answer would be reached. Given his role throughout the whole of the life both of Legacy Horizon and Horizon Online, I found his evidence in cross-examination to be of central relevance to the Horizon Issues. His evidence in cross-examination was also, in my judgment, broadly supportive of the claimants’ general case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">There are, however, two aspects of Mr Godeseth’s evidence – though not his performance as a witness in the witness box - that were highly unsatisfactory and cannot pass without comment. The first aspect relates to his written evidence. The totality of his evidence, after his cross-examination, bore very little semblance to the picture that had been portrayed in his written witness statements. On some extremely important factual matters, such as the dates when Fujitsu had become aware of a particular bug, or the spreadsheet exercise by Anne Chambers prepared in 2015 (and disclosed in 2019), his written evidence was simply directly wrong. On others, such as the headline points omitted on the Callendar Square Bug that have been set out in [425] above, very important central elements detrimental to Fujitsu were simply omitted.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Legacy Horizon had, as has been explained, started life originally as something rather different to what it became, having initially been intended as a tri-partite project involving payment of benefits. It did not unfold in this way and became rather different. Horizon Online also did not have a happy birth. The pilot for it had to be stopped, and Fujitsu put it on what was called “red alert”. Mr Godeseth described this as “very serious”. The biggest issue was with Oracle, which was what Mr Godeseth was working on and hence knew the most about, but he explained that there were other problems going on at the same time. Some of these problems were put to him – and it must be remembered that this was a pilot scheme, with some problems to be expected – and they included cash being short on one day by £1,000 because a transaction for £1,000 did not show up on the online report facility; cash withdrawals being authorised on screen yet the printed receipt being declined (the customer very honestly brought the cash back next day having noticed the receipt wording); a similar problem with a cash deposit; and remming in figures all being doubled up. These are all somewhat – and indeed markedly - similar to some of the problems alleged by the different claimants’ witnesses in this litigation. These all occurred during the pilot scheme. </p>

Witness statements are supposed to be accurate, and in a case such as this one with such centrally important issues, accuracy is clearly important. Quoting only selectively from, or wholly ignoring, contemporaneous documents prepared by (say) Mr Jenkins, who was the extensive source of much of the evidence, is not only unhelpful, it presents an entirely misleading evidential picture. It is not necessary to consider further how many personnel at Fujitsu may have assisted Mr Godeseth in producing such documents. Their content was wholly misleading in their original written form. Fortunately the cross-examination of Mr Godeseth led to a far clearer picture in so far as his evidence is concerned.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The second unsatisfactory aspect which arose from his evidence is the approach of Fujitsu as demonstrated in various documents, including the PEAKs and KELs, but also in particular in the Receipts/Payments Mismatch issue notes. To see a concern expressed that if a software bug in Horizon were to become widely known about it might have a potential impact upon “ongoing legal cases” where the integrity of Horizon Data was a central issue, is a very concerning entry to read in a contemporaneous document. Whether these were legal cases concerning civil claims, or criminal cases, there are obligations upon parties in terms of disclosure. So far as criminal cases are concerned, these concern the liberty of the person, and disclosure duties are rightly high. I do not understand the motivation in keeping this type of matter, recorded in these documents, hidden from view; regardless of the motivation, doing so was wholly wrong. There can be no proper explanation for keeping the existence of a software bug in Horizon secret in these circumstances.  </p>

The majority of problems and defects which counsel put to Mr Godeseth, and which were effectively admitted by him, simply would not have seen the light of day without this group litigation.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">I do not know if this is because of concerns about the future of Horizon going forwards; or for Fujitsu to protect its corporate reputation; or for some other reason. It is unnecessary to speculate, and I do not do so. An internal Post Office IT risk management document from 2017 stated that “the HNG-X platform is end of life and is running on unsupported Windows software”, that it needs replacing, and also that the "Branch counter technology is aged and unreliable, with frequent hardware failures, resulting in branch disruptions." Mr Godeseth agreed with all of this. The unsupported platform is Windows NT4. As Mr Godeseth put it, “any technologist would tell you that was too old”. Windows NT4 is an operating system that was released in 1996, and Microsoft ended mainstream support for it in 2002 and extended support in 2004. Horizon now runs, not on NT4, but on Windows 10 and it is called HNG-A rather than HNG-X. This change to Windows 10 occurred in February 2017 and the roll out was administered by Computacentre, with Fujitsu providing the software. The Horizon system of 2019 is therefore a very different system than both Legacy Horizon and the earlier version of Horizon Online, HNG-X. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The original Horizon Online system was introduced in 2010, and was even then substantially based on the existing system, Legacy Horizon, itself by then at least 10 years old. That had been introduced in 2000, and therefore it should not be controversial to describe Horizon Online in its HNG-X form as old technology. There have of course been upgrades and other improvements since 2010, and other software additions and add-ons, but Horizon will by necessity require replacement at some point. I detected a degree of sensitivity in the litigation generally about any plans for replacing Horizon Online, as though the Post Office feared that any hint that it might </p>

	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">be replaced would be seized upon by the claimants (and/or assumed by the court) as accepting that the criticisms of Horizon Online by the claimants would be corroborated by any Post Office plans for its replacement. Such fears, if there are any, are groundless, at least from the court’s point of view. It is inevitable that technology systems, particularly complex systems from as long ago (in technology terms) as 2010 will need replacing at some point. Technology moves at an increasingly rapid pace. There is reference in some of the documents in the trial bundle, but not in the evidence, to something called “Thin Client”, about which Dr Worden said he had no knowledge. He thought it was a cloud based system. It is unnecessary to speculate about this either. It is sufficient to state that, in my judgment, any plans there may be for replacement of Horizon Online in the ordinary course of the Post Office’s wishes to improve its business are not something that I need to consider in order to resolve the Horizon Issues. </p>

Given the purpose of paragraph 29 and 30 of Mr Parker’s 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> witness statement was to identify how many times data had been in fact injected, a search exercise that did not use “RiposteImport” was never going to give the full picture. That initial search exercise was plainly inadequate. It is also rather curious that, having done that, the exercise that was described in the letter of 20 March 2019 from the Post Office’s solicitors that correctly used “RiposteImport” as a search term should have been done so very closely before Mr Parker was originally due to be called as a witness, namely 21 March 2019. In re-examination, Mr Parker said that “the thought occurred to him that he could add some other search terms into the work that he had done previously” and “he came to me with the data”. Why this thought should have suddenly occurred to the person it occurred to, who was not a witness, and at the time that it did, could not be pursued. Mr Parker denied that he was trying to conceal anything, and said he was just trying “to get the right data for the court which can be difficult sometimes when you are going back fifteen years.” This explanation overlooks that the decision not to use “RiposteImport” was one taken for his witness statements. His first witness statement was dated 16 November 2018; his second was dated 29 January 2019, and his third was 28 February 2019. None of these are “going back fifteen years”.  </p>

Mr Parker’s only recourse was to claim he had not been saying what he plainly had been saying in his 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> witness statement – that Fujitsu did not have the power to do it, and that Mr Roll’s evidence to the contrary was inaccurate and misleading.

It was put to him that he had been giving his evidence initially from a position of not being very well informed about what could or could not be done. He denied that; he said “that would be wrong” and that in general terms he was confident of the information he gave. The obvious conclusion that I draw from this is that Mr Parker chose specifically to give the impression in his 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> witness statement that Fujitsu did not have the power (the word Mr Parker expressly chose) to inject transactions into the counter at branches, even though he knew that it did. This paints him in a very poor light as a credible witness. There is also no adequate explanation for why Mr Parker’s colleague should have decided, in the middle of the trial, to use the “RiposteImport” search term; equally, there is no adequate explanation for why this search term was <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> used for the exercise for Mr Parker’s witness statement. Injection of messages into the counter has been an extremely central issue in the long running dispute between the Post Office and its SPMs for a long time, and Mr Parker’s reliance in his re-examination upon the passage of time and the difficulty of “getting the right data” for the court is, in my judgment, a poor excuse. In reality, he had no credible explanation. </p>

He was, however, left rather exposed in terms of the accuracy of this evidence when it was shown that the points that he had been addressing in this part of the cross-examination – some of which he would not accept - were taken from a Fujitsu internal document, entitled “End to End Application Support Strategy” marked Fujitsu Restricted and Commercial in Confidence which he had himself drafted. Indeed, it is page 1 of that document that specifically identifies Mr Parker himself as the author of the document, and it was approved by the Head of Application Services at Fujitsu, an obviously very senior role. This refusal by Mr Parker to accept his own previously drafted points in what I consider to be an important contemporaneous document also paints him in a very poor light as a credible witness. </p>

It was, however, categorised as “Administrative Response”. That PEAK alone demonstrates to my satisfaction the lack of inaccuracy in the Fujitsu closure codes, but there were many others. Other PEAKs to which he was taken showed reconciliation errors, and a note by the developer identifying that what were “up to 10 unnecessary reconciliation errors each week” and that the PEAK was a regression of another PEAK; the investigation into it led to the conclusion that a subsequent software release had not caught a fix. It stated "Risks (of releasing and of not releasing proposed fix):  Without this fix, there will be possibilities of system errors at counter and while doing reversal transaction". This software fix was “released to live”, which means the fix was actually written and introduced into the system. Mr Parker had not included this in his software category either, because the final person working on it had categorised this as Administrative Response. </p>

Items appear by themselves for which the PM has not pressed an Icon.  These may be individual items or several of the same item.  Sometimes when no one has been near the screen items may appear". These are similar problems being reported by a number of different SPMs. That alone should have suggested, not as a matter of computer expert evidence but simply basic common sense, that something was amiss. If a number of different and unconnected people all report the same symptom, then that could well suggest a common problem to them all. However, the KEL, which ran from 2000 to 2004, suggested that the cable between the screen and the base unit was the root cause.

In re-examination Mr Parker was asked about the way he had done his exercise, and also the point was put to him that the PEAKs to which he was taken were outwith the period when Mr Roll was employed at SSC. The implication of this was that Fujitsu may, or would, have been more accurate in the period in question rather than in later periods. Mr Parker said he could not possibly read all the PEAKs, that he considered his data to be accurate, and although “you may find a few PEAKs where the response code does not tally with the document” given the number of PEAKs involved “human beings will make those errors”.  </p>

My conclusions are also supported by his “deliberate decision” to depart from Fujitsu’s definition in its own internal document, which I have explained at [488] above. I also consider that the fact that someone such as Mr Parker had been on the Post Office Account for such a very long time, in his case throughout the whole life of Horizon, means he was hardly best placed to be objective in this type of evidence. But even making allowance for the natural reaction of an employee to wish to protect his employer’s interests, which many people may have sub-consciously, I find that Mr Parker’s evidence to the court was inaccurate to a significant degree. </p>

It relies upon the categorisation of the PEAKs performed by the Fujitsu personnel themselves, which in the vast majority of documents used in the trial were simply wrong and/or misleading; and it also used a different definition to the one included in Fujitsu’s own documents such as the PEAKs above. He accepted that he had made a deliberate decision to use a definition other than the one in the Fujitsu documents, which he justified by saying was based on his experience. That deliberate decision alone is remarkable. I find that he was, by means of the exercise he was involved in, trying to downplay the extent of Mr Roll’s involvement in software issues, and also trying to downplay the extent of software problems that were experienced on Legacy Horizon during Mr Roll’s employment at SSC. </p>

He continued to maintain this in his re-examination, even though by then he can have been in no doubt that he had departed from Fujitsu’s own definition – which he had said he had forgot about. I found him a very unsatisfactory witness, who presented in his witness statements a misleading and one-sided sanitised version of actual problems and events that Fujitsu had experienced throughout his time at SSC. Although he provided tables with one of his witness statements that provided a detailed commentary on a large number of PEAKs and KELs, that commentary appearing in a column headed “Fujistu’s Comments” with two columns, “Response to Mr Coyne” and “Financial Impact on branch accounts” – that latter almost always “no impact”. The entries in those columns are almost entirely self-serving by Fujitsu and I find them to be of no evidential value. The text of the actual PEAKs and KELs themselves are far more useful, obviously entered at a time when the Fujitsu/Post Office position in the litigation was not at the forefront of the different authors’ minds, and these are what for the most part the experts have considered. Mr Parker’s table is of no assistance.  </p>

These could, potentially, have included previous statements he may have made in earlier proceedings, but in order to be allowed to do that, such statements would have had to be inconsistent with his evidence in the Horizon Issues trial. Putting a previously inconsistent statement on a particular fact is permitted as part of crossexamination if a witness’ evidence on that fact is in issue. However, the Horizon Issues trial would not have become “an investigation of his role in this and other criminal cases” – the Horizon trial was about the Horizon Issues.

The Post Office would have known this in advance, as this is wholly conventional.

The Post Office was are entitled to call such evidence as deemed necessary by both the Post Office and its advisers. They cannot, however, have matters both ways, and try to downplay Mr Godeseth’s evidence because he was called to deal with certain matters, and Mr Jenkins was not. The Post Office has to abide by the consequences of their choice of witnesses, in terms of the evidence now before the court to resolve the Horizon Issues trial.

Parties in civil litigation will usually advance their own evidence of fact, and although mechanisms are available for compelling other witnesses to attend and answer questions, there can be some pitfalls in doing so and issuing a witness summons (what used to be called a subpoena) is a relatively rare step.

These statements by the Post Office routinely and strongly insisted that there was nothing in the criticisms being levelled at the accuracy of Horizon, and that losses that were shown in SPMs’ branch accounts were caused either by carelessness or dishonesty on the part of the different SPMs who experienced what they considered to be unexplained discrepancies and losses. In 2015 a Parliamentary Select Committee held hearings into the mediation scheme that had been set up to attempt to address the claims by SPMs in respect of Horizon.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">I am unaware of whether there is any other final answer to Ms Vennells internally to her very straightforward question, or of what she in fact told the Select Committee. None of the people through whom this email chain passed were called as witnesses in the Horizon Issues trial. However, the point in bold in the email quoted at [522] above is now known, as a result of this litigation, simply to be incorrect. Such editing <span style="font-style:italic">can</span> take place without the knowledge of the SPM. All and any previous statements by the Post Office stating that this cannot be done are simply factually wrong. The more detailed points at (1) to (6) of the email quoted at [523] provide only selected information and, in my judgment, are entirely off the point. They have the effect of obscuring what ought to be a simple answer, with a level of detail which makes the actual answer highly unclear. The answer at (1) applies only to Horizon Online. For Legacy Horizon, transaction data was held locally in the first instance, on what was called the counter. This was explained very clearly by the Post Office in its opening, including in its oral opening submissions. The first sentence of (3) in the list in the email is not correct. The statement in (4) – which may refer to the Transaction Correction tool – is correct (or at least, not incorrect) but only so far as it goes, and in my judgment crucially <span style="font-style:italic">omits</span> the ability to edit transactions without visibility to the SPM. It also fails to consider the existence of APPSUP permissions at all, which every member of SSC had. The experts are agreed that the APPSUP permission was very powerful and enabled an SSC employee to do pretty much whatever they wanted, to paraphrase the Post Office’s own expert. It can also be seen, particularly by the evidence that emerged in the cross-examination of Mr Godeseth, that in a great many cases the PEAKs show that user error was attributed to problems that were not user error at all, and that others within the Post Office (for example its own auditors and ROMEC engineers) had either witnessed for themselves and/or satisfied themselves that user error was not the cause of specific issues, but Fujitsu decided they were user error in any event.  </p>

The email also states “he has captured the same points” yet the most important point to which an answer is given, or certainly the answer given in bold in the answer at [522] above, is not corrected, even though it is plainly wrong. The overall tenor of what Ms Vennells received, if it reflected the full content of this email chain, would have been that the Post Office and Fujitsu could not edit transaction data without the knowledge of the SPM. The evidence in this trial is directly to the contrary, and Fujitsu could do so. It is important to bear in mind the distinction between the way Legacy Horizon, and Horizon Online, work. Referring to keeping data on the “counters” is a Legacy Horizon expression. This refers to the way the data was held at the branch; these were discs (including mirror discs) at the branch which contained the data. The discs were contained in terminals on the counter. In Horizon Online, the data was held at a central database or server (the phrase used by the Post Office in its oral opening).  </p>

This concerns the ability of Fujitsu to insert transactions into a branch’s accounts remotely, without the SPM being aware of this, and without the transaction being identifiable in the transaction data as having been inserted remotely in this way. The term “remotely” means from a location elsewhere than within the branch itself. </p>

Dr Worden was asked about the 2015 Post Office statement in response to Panorama, which he said he had not read, and he explained that it was the audit records in the audit store that could not be edited. He was not prepared to say the 2015 statement was factually wrong. The BRDB records could be edited, and he also referred to the joint statement in which the two experts had agreed that they could not say that anything could not be done. He was very hesitant, if not reluctant, to state that the 2015 statement was wrong.  </p>

Indeed, the submissions I have quoted at [535] above make it clear that the court and the claimants were being told that the Post Office had wasted no time in bringing the truth, “the accurate set of facts”, to the knowledge of the claimants. As the analysis of the Defence and the evolution of the Fujitsu evidence of fact on remote access for the Horizon Issues trial demonstrates, the accurate set of facts did not emerge at that time either. The truth, the accurate set of facts, has only emerged as a result of the final supplementary statements for the Horizon Issues trial that were served, and only finally (so far as Fujitsu is concerned) after their witnesses had initially stated clearly in their witness statements that Mr Roll was wrong. Eventually these witnesses accepted that he was right. The supplementary witness statements that accepted this were dated 29 January 2019. Prior to that date, the opposite position had been maintained by the Post Office.   </p>

It was only following his written evidence that Mr Parker, and Mr Godeseth – both senior Fujitsu employees – prepared their supplementary witness statements correcting their first statements. These first statements, as I have explained above, were simply untrue in that important respect. These witnesses had previously stated that this was not possible.

It also follows that this could be done without an SPM in this position having knowledge of this, and therefore without consenting to it. Someone who does not know something is happening cannot give permission for it to happen. Mr Godeseth also gave important evidence about how such transactions would appear. It is not possible to say, in blanket terms, that permission was not sought and/or given in some cases.

Although one of the contracts between the Post Office and Fujitsu was uploaded to the electronic trial bundle on the penultimate day of evidence (by the Post Office’s solicitors) the litigation is not concerned with the details of that contractual relationship, other than (tangentially only) the cost to the Post Office of making ARQ requests, as the ARQ data is maintained by Fujitsu and charges are raised to the Post Office in this respect. However, Fujitsu’s involvement does cast something of a shadow. That contract has been addressed in terms of whether certain documents were, or were not, in the control of the Post Office. I have already dealt with the issue of PEAKs and KELs, and how the Post Office maintained initially it was not obliged to disclose these. Fujitsu personnel who were not witnesses were involved in providing information to the Post Office’s expert, Dr Worden. It was the Fujitsu witnesses who originally, and in my judgment unequivocally and directly, flatly contradicted what Mr Roll said could be done on the subject of remote access. I have also identified that in my judgment, the majority of the Fujitsu witnesses were more interested in following some sort of Fujitsu party line than they were in answering questions in cross-examination wholly frankly, although I exempt Mr Godeseth from that criticism. From what was said by the Post Office’s leading counsel to Master Fontaine at the very first case management hearing, those within the Post Office had relied upon Fujitsu in obtaining relevant information for its earlier public statements, and it plainly relied upon Fujitsu in terms of evidence of fact in the Horizon Issues trial, because it called a number of Fujitsu witnesses. I am unaware of the degree to which the Post Office has depended upon Fujitsu in the background to the Horizon Issues trial, and there is no reason why I should be, and I make it clear that I do not speculate on this. This information must have originated from Fujitsu at some point, but the Post Office must bear some responsibility for such incorrect statements having been made before, both publicly and in its pleadings.  </p>

Mr Green for the claimants adopted a non-computing analogy, namely that of “a back door”. The origin of this was a phrase of Mr Roll, who referred to the back door to the system. The branch accounts can be likened to a locked room, to which the SPM has the key. This development in the case is comparable, after many years of the Post Office and Fujitsu maintaining that only the SPM has the key, that only the SPM could perform anything within the locked room, and if the Post Office and/or Fujitsu </p>

This analogy is not entirely apt, because software and remote access to edit transactions is not completely the same as physical access through a door, but it is an attempt to capture the general idea in lay terms. </p>

Minor corrections are not unusual and indeed are almost expected, as a trial approaches, as witnesses either research further or remember (when preparing for trial) other minor details. This topic, however, did not undergo that type of correction, and is a subject far more central and important than that. The truth only finally emerged in later statements, which were required to correct what I find were directly inaccurate statements in the first witness statements of Mr Godeseth and Mr Parker. There has been no adequate explanation for the contents of those first statements, which not only omitted this important fact, but contained evidence directly to the contrary. Those first witness statements were misleading. The statement in the Defence was misleading too. It ought also to be noted that the truth did not emerge internally within the Post Office in the email answers provided to internal inquiries in 2015 by senior Post Office personnel, such as the Chief Executive, who posed the specific question in preparation for providing evidence to a Select Committee and asked: “What is the true answer?” </p>

Infallibility is a rare commodity, and everyone is capable of making mistakes. However, it is how one reacts to mistakes that is telling. In this instance, the initial reaction of the Fujitsu witnesses was to seek to shift the blame for their own misleading written evidence upon someone else. In this case, that “someone else” was their former Fujitsu colleague whose very evidence was responsible for exposing the full picture. This is not something that could have been arrived at lightly. To be fair to Mr de Garr Robinson, it was not a point he adopted on the Post Office’s behalf during the Horizon Issues trial. In my judgment, he was entirely sensible in not doing so.

He has not previously made this point clear. Now that he has, following a discussion with colleagues who performed such actions I can confirm that this was possible. I did not mention it in my first witness statement because, when faced with a less clear account in Mr Roll's first statement, my recollection was that if it was necessary for the SSC to inject a transaction data into a branch's accounts, it would have been injected into the correspondence server (injecting via the server was the default option which was followed in the vast majority of cases).”  </p>

I am aware that criticism of the Post Office and Fujitsu in this respect may prove to be controversial, as earlier criticism of certain aspects of the Post Office’s case in Judgment (No.3) was not well received by it. However, if criticism is justified, I consider it would be detrimental to proper resolution of the group litigation if that criticism were to be withheld simply because it might lead to a further negative reaction by the Post Office. It is also an inherent part of the judicial function in any litigation to make findings, which may include criticisms where justified, that may be contrary to a litigant’s own view of the merits of their case. Some litigants are so convinced of the righteousness of their own position that they consistently refuse to accept any possible view of the litigation other than their own. Such a blinkered view is rarely helpful, and would be particularly unhelpful from a publicly owned institution. </p>

Fujitsu should have been frank and unequivocal, internally, with the Post Office, so that there could be no possibility of incorrect statements on this important point being made publicly by the Post Office. The Fujitsu witnesses should not, in their first witness statements, have made the incorrect statements that they did. Had those initial statements been factually accurate, there would have been no need for the supplementary statements from them that eventually led to the true position being accepted by Fujitsu, and therefore by the Post Office. It is highly regrettable that such a situation as this should have developed. I am not making any findings on any future issues, whether of fact or law, yet to be tried. </p>

This was in addition to the amount incurred by that point in terms of the fees of Dr Worden. His costs at that stage were only £58,000. The sum of £800,000 broke down to about £300,000 paid to Fujitsu, and £500,000 paid to other experts, who were not being instructed to give expert evidence. Dr Worden was the expert who would be giving evidence to the court, which meant he would owe the relevant duties of independence to the court under the CPR.

I recorded an adverse comment in the costs management order of 23 July 2018 stating that the Post Office’s incurred costs for experts were extraordinarily high, unreasonable and disproportionate; and that Fujitsu’s costs of assisting with the litigation, and the costs of these internally appointed experts did not, on the face of it, appear to be properly recoverable sums in the litigation. I should clarify that this adverse comment should not be taken as applying to Dr Worden’s costs that had been incurred at that stage, which were modest.

Some 5,000 KELs emerged from Fujitsu well after the trial ended, in October 2019. The experts did not consider these as they were not given them.

In Judgment (No.3) I had identified the issue of unjustified redactions made by the Post Office of some contemporaneous documents that were used in the Common Issues trial. During the early part of the Horizon Issues trial some documents were referred to which again had redactions, which due to their nonredacted parts did not seem to me to be of a type that would necessarily attract privilege. In view of the previous history of this subject, I asked leading counsel for the Post Office to perform his own review of the redactions that had at that point been made of documents deployed in the Horizon Issues trial.  This review resulted in some of the redactions in some of the documents being removed, and unredacted versions of those documents becoming available to the claimants, some of which were then used in cross-examination. Redactions of 2 documents were maintained on the grounds of legal professional privilege, which is entirely conventional. He also provided a helpful two page note explaining the approach that had been adopted. Asking counsel to do a review of this nature in these circumstances is entirely conventional. There was no short timescale imposed for this to be done. I asked for a summary of the position on 4 June 2019, which was after the interval which occurred as a result of the recusal application, and about 2 ½ months after I had asked him to perform the review. It was an outstanding matter, of a type sometimes referred to in a trial as “housekeeping”, which had not been entirely forgotten, but which had been overtaken in the latter weeks of March when the trial was temporarily halted.   </p>

I was not prepared to hear that application at that point. Royal Mail was the correct respondent to such an application, not the Post Office. Royal Mail was not represented, nor even present in court, nor had any notice been given by the claimants to the Royal Mail of such an application. Each of these features is a far from promising start. I did however make directions for the making of a third party disclosure application against the Royal Mail, but this did not ultimately prove to be required.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The fact that the parties chose Model C does not go to answer the complaints that the claimants have made about the Post Office’s disclosure. The Post Office had an obligation to disclose known adverse documents, as do the claimants as well. “Adverse” as defined plainly includes any documents that refer to bugs, errors or defects, or the operation of the Horizon system that led to potential impact upon branch accounts. This obligation is “regardless of any order for disclosure made”, in other words it exists whether any specific classes of documents are, or are not, already the subject of any order. The rational for this is obvious. Reliance upon the adoption of Model C is not therefore the answer to the claimants’ complaints in this respect. However, the fact that the claimants did not make applications for disclosure is relevant to the criticisms made at the Horizon Issues trial.  </p>

I am not persuaded that it is the correct approach to matters of independent expert evidence to seek to “control” the documents that an independent expert wishes to see. The claimants did not issue any opposed applications for disclosure of documents which their expert wished to see, so a filter of some sort was applied in that sense to the documents Mr Coyne wished to see, and was not given. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Given there was no witness statement from anyone at Fujitsu available on the subject at that hearing, that was as far as the matter could be taken on that occasion in terms of making any specific order relating to the Known Error Log. The Post Office had made clear that any order for disclosure that did not specify the Known Error Log, but was more general requiring disclosure of documents in relation to bugs and errors causing branch account errors, would <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> lead to disclosure of the Known Error Log in any event. A practical way forward, without requiring a fully argued separate application which would have included Fujitsu, was adopted whereby the IT experts were permitted to inspect the Known Error Log. The status of the Known Error Log as a disclosable document was resisted both on the grounds of control and relevance. It has to be acknowledged that this practical solution was one suggested by Mr de Garr Robinson. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">It must therefore have come as a surprise to the Post Office, given the contents of its pleadings and the express submissions that it had made to the court, that both experts considered the Known Error Log to be highly relevant. This should also have led to the Post Office beginning to doubt what it was being told by Fujitsu, given the source of what the court was told about this was what Fujitsu had told the Post Office, as set out above. The explanation of what the Known Error Log was, what it contained, and its lack of relevance, was not remotely accurate.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Although a certain number of entries in the Known Error Log, which led to a significant number of different entries which are each called KELs being deployed in the trial and examined closely, were thereafter available, the issue of control of the Known Error Log and the Post Office’s earlier position resisting disclosure of this, did not go away. An entire appendix to the claimants’ opening submissions was devoted to criticism of the Post Office on disclosure, including its shifting position on the Known Error Log. In closing submissions, at the very end of the final day of the Horizon Issues trial, the claimants handed up a document entitled “Claimants’ Points in Reply”. Part F of that was a short document headed “KELs said not to be in the Post Office’s control” together with a variety of references. It ought also to be recorded here that some 5,000 KELs were later disclosed by the Post Office in October 2019, well after the trial ended, once the Post Office was told by Fujitsu that previous entries, which Fujitsu had previously told the Post Office were not retained, <span style="font-style:italic">were</span> in fact retained. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The subject of whether the Post Office had control of the Known Error Log therefore remained somewhat live. It simply was not, therefore, going to go away. The Post Office’s legal team had loaded version 12 of its contract with Fujitsu (“the Fujitsu contract”) onto the electronic bundle database on the last day of evidence, Day 20, for re-examination of its expert witness, Dr Worden. The contractual situation between the Post Office and Fujitsu was therefore before the court, which it had not been for the first case management hearing on 19 October 2017. It is also the case that “control” of documents (other than the KELs) held by Fujitsu could potentially crop up again in this litigation going forwards. It is cost effective and efficient to resolve that now, for the assistance of the parties.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">I therefore gave both parties the opportunity to lodge further written post-hearing submissions restricted to whether the Known Error Log was in the Post Office’s control. It was a point relied upon by the claimants and it has to be resolved. There were two reasons for this. One is that in group litigation of this type, the parties’ approach to disclosure goes beyond a single document, or type of document. Guidance as to the court’s general approach will be of assistance in the litigation going forwards. There may well be other documents held by Fujitsu that need to be disclosed later, and the issue of control needs resolving. Secondly, the court is entitled to expect accurate evidence from parties on interlocutory matters, and accurate submissions.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The Fujitsu contract that was loaded onto the electronic bundle was a recent one. This document has a version history at the front which shows that it runs, with amendments therein identified, from 31 August 2006 to version 12 on 3 July 2017. Version 12 pre-dates the date of the Generic Defence, but in any event, clause 25 (which appears below at [602]) does not appear against any of the later version numbers in the version history of the Fujitsu contract. It is likely therefore that clause 25 in substantially the same (if not identical) form appeared in all the earlier versions of the Fujitsu contract prior to Version 12.  </p>

It also means, when this is put together with what the Post Office, by its leading counsel, submitted to the court at the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> case management conference, that Fujitsu were extraordinarily inaccurate about the information it provided to the Post Office at that stage of these proceedings. As at 2017, the Horizon system (both Legacy Horizon and Horizon Online) had been in use for about 17 years. KEL appears in a table of Abbreviations/Definitions at F/87/3 in a document entitled “CS Support Services Operations Manual” that is dated 29 January 2001.

The Known Error Log does far more than “explain how to deal with, or work around, minor issues that can sometimes arise in Horizon for which (often because of their triviality) system-wide fixes have not been developed and implemented”. The Known Error Log appears to be a comprehensive record of all the errors and defects of which Fujitsu have become aware over the life of Horizon. On the basis of the evidence that has been heard in the Horizon Issues trial, there are many issues in the Known Error Log that could affect the accuracy of a branch's accounts or the secure transmission and storage of transaction data, contrary to what is pleaded by the Post Office. Some KELs led to software fixes too. Indeed, Mr Coyne has used it in order to discover the existence of, and then investigate, the numerous different bugs from what was called “the Bug Table” in the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> Joint Statement, 11 of which Dr Worden agrees in his written evidence.

It was because of this that the matter of control was not resolved at that point, as disclosure was permitted. Mr Coyne inspected the Known Error Log at Fujitsu’s premises.

They were also the subject of a great deal of cross-examination by both sides. I consider that disclosure of the KELs to the experts – the pragmatic solution suggested by leading counsel for the Post Office -  has been central in the discovery and investigation of the bugs, errors and defects that the experts agree were, or are, present in the Horizon system, and also of the bugs, errors and defects that are not agreed, but upon which both experts opine and in respect of which I make findings in the Technical Appendix. Dr Worden has also analysed them extensively, and devoted a separate appendix of his report to them. The best description of the KELs is taken from Dr Worden, who stated that they were “a rich source of evidence”. The notion that they were not relevant, or did not contain relevant material, is extremely difficult to fathom, and I do not understand why, or how, Fujitsu would or could sensibly choose to inform its own customer of many years, the Post Office, directly to the contrary. If Fujitsu’s description of the contents of the KELs had been taken at face value and not challenged, then the knowledge now available to the two experts and to the court about the extent of bugs, errors and defects would not have been available, with the obvious detrimental impact upon the fair resolution of the Horizon Issues. </p>

These documents were requested from the Post Office in July 2018. The claimants maintain that the Post Office were obstructive over this, but whether that is correct or not, over 218,000 different PEAKs were disclosed by the Post Office’s solicitors on 27 September 2018. This was two weeks before the date for exchange of experts’ reports. A further 3,866 were disclosed on 25 October 2018 – two weeks after the experts’ first reports. OCP documents (which are mentioned in PEAKs) were disclosed on 24 January 2019, and a number of PEAKs were identified by Mr Coyne in his supplementary report which he had identified but which had not been disclosed.

This highly unsatisfactory situation led to my seeking an explanation. I consider an explanation was plainly required given the timescales. This is a large quantity of documents, dealing with central elements of the Horizon Issues, and the stage at which they had been provided was very late. PEAKs are important documents. I was told in submissions that Fujitsu had discovered an old database that had been copied more than ten years previously, and as soon as Fujitsu had told the Post Office this, matters had moved speedily and the Post Office had provided the contents of this old database to the claimants.</p>

The Horizon Issues trial in fact had an enforced interlude, from 21 March 2019 when the recusal application was issued, until that application was dismissed on 9 April 2019.

This is one week after Mr Godeseth had completed his evidence.

I also find the wholesale lack of any explanation of when the “further documents relating to these bugs came to light” – and indeed how – puzzling, again in a witness statement ordered specifically to explain what was already a highly unusual situation. Further, the PEAK relating to the Drop and Go bug was plainly identified by Mr Lenton, a Fujitsu employee, on 29 March 2019.

They sometimes contain information not found in KELs about specific impact on branches or root causes – what needs to be fixed. They are written, by people who know Horizon very well. They do not contain design detail for any change. They are generally about development activities and timeline rather than about potential impact. PEAKs typically stop when development has done its job, so they are not likely to contain information about follow-on activities, such as compensating branches for any losses.” It is also agreed, and indeed can be seen from the actual PEAKs themselves, that some of them record observations of financial impact. PEAKs do not however always use the symbol “£”, which was a search item used by Dr Worden to create a set of 259 KELs that contained that symbol. Even where they referred to a financial discrepancy, PEAKs sometimes just recorded the figure, or sometimes used “pds”, and did not use the symbol “£”.  </p>

No details of the actual Release Notes were provided. The spreadsheet was not, in my judgment, complete, nor was it in useful usable form. No Release Notes detrimental to the Post Office’s case have been produced. The Post Office adopted an unhelpful approach to Release Notes, requiring the claimants to identify from the very difficult spreadsheet which Release Notes they would like to see, with an offer to provide those.

At the first CMC in October 2017, I said in a short ruling on disclosure that the Post Office had been “obstructive” in its pre-action behaviour in this respect, and that its attitude to disclosure up to that point had been somewhat less than ideal. In Judgment (No.3) I made some further criticisms, which it is not necessary to repeat. It is regrettable that the Post Office’s approach to disclosure, admittedly this time in conjunction with Fujitsu, has continued in different respects to fall short of what is required. However, it does seem to be improving and it is to be hoped that such improvement will continue. Particularly in litigation such as this, with enormous distrust and suspicion on both sides, it is simply counterproductive to have that atmosphere added to by an unnecessarily combative stance on disclosure.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The Post Office’s case in this litigation will be subject to exactly the same degree of measured and independent assessment, and weighed in the same objective way, as the claimants’ case, and as it would be were these failures not present. However, there must be a change in approach to this group litigation. Disclosing documents late, and in the middle of trials, in such sizeable numbers, and failing (as clearly identified from the passage of Mr Parsons’ own witness statement referred to in [618] above) to act with expedition when clearly relevant documents are unearthed actually during a trial, has two distinct effects. It is disruptive to the proceedings, and it leads to an increase in the costs and/or causes delay. It is the antithesis of co-operation, which the Civil Procedure Rules expressly require. I consider that these passages within this judgment should provide sufficient encouragement to a more constructive approach to prompt disclosure of obviously relevant documents when (or if) they are discovered shortly before, or even during the course of, forthcoming trials.  </p>

The Post Office were pragmatic and sensible, and essentially left this decision to the claimants. The claimants made no such application. However, had they done so, my preliminary view (without hearing any argument) is that I would not have permitted the Horizon Issues trial to be resumed and further evidence adduced. This is for three reasons. Firstly, there has to come a point when the parties are given a decision on the Horizon Issues. The trial had already been interrupted to a substantial degree by the recusal application. This trial was supposed to be completed in April 2019. Resuming it would have led to that date becoming sometime in early 2020. The over-riding objective requires consideration of other court users in other cases. Secondly, subsequent stages of the group litigation would, once again, become consequentially delayed. It is with a sense of wistfulness that I recall a statement at [16] in Judgment No.3 that this litigation would be speedily progressed. Thirdly, the parties have told me that they wish to mediate before Christmas 2019 and would like to know the outcome of the Horizon Issues trial to assist in that process. This would not be possible if the trial were resumed. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in;text-indent:0.5in">This extensive further disclosure does, however, rather reinforce the criticism which the claimants level at the Post Office and Fujitsu. The Post Office are the party in the litigation, and they are the party with the disclosure obligations. They obviously rely upon Fujitsu in this respect. Quite how Fujitsu, a reputable company with a worldwide reputation who have been involved in Horizon for nearly 20 years, could be so wrong on yet another important point going to Horizon is not explained, and will remain unclear. Given the statements made by Fujitsu, relied upon by leading counsel for the Post Office at an earlier hearing and repeated to the court, that the KELs did not contain any material relevant to bugs, errors and defects, a pattern has emerged on the part of Fujitsu. This is that its statements about KELs have been shown to be clearly wrong on more than one occasion, and in important respects.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">I turn therefore to the criticism that the Post Office has levelled at the claimants. It should be borne in mind that the bulk of the disclosure burden fell upon the Post Office, simply because of the nature of the Horizon Issues. However, that does not mean that the claimants were not themselves obliged to give relevant disclosure to the Post Office. This disparity is obvious in the number of documents disclosed by each party, which the Post Office in its Closing Submissions stated was some 517,965 documents by the Post Office, and only 1,525 by the claimants. Obviously that previous number does not include the 5,000 KELs disclosed by the Post Office in September and October 2019, after the submissions. The comparison in the figures demonstrates the different burden upon the claimants and the Post Office. It is also correct to identify that for many categories of very important documents, the Post Office is reliant upon Fujitsu. The claimants are not.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The Post Office, in the context of its complaints about the claimants’ disclosure, submitted that “it was therefore not appropriate for claimants to serve claimantspecific evidence from current or former SPMs” because of the nature of the Horizon Issues and the terms of the Order that ordered witness statements, and that the Post Office sought to avoid making disclosure requests nearer to the trial. However, once the claimants did so, and served their nine witness statements in evidence in September 2018, the Post Office’s solicitors wrote to the claimants on 22 October 2018, 7 November 2018, 30 November 2018 and 20 December 2018 and did not receive any response. Even though the Common Issues trial was underway for part of this time, I do not see why such letters should have gone unanswered by the claimants’ solicitors. When the response did come, it was to the effect that there would be no further disclosure as this was not envisaged by existing orders.  </p>

He also said he had only become aware of the £195 loss to which it related once he had read Mrs Van Den Bogerd’s witness statement. He also explained that he kept a box file and that was where he found the documents. Complaint is made of the fact that the documents that were disclosed should have been disclosed on 17 July 2018, the date for disclosure. I accept that, and even if one makes the assumption in the claimants’ favour that they did not know at that date that Mr Tank was to be a witness, certainly no later than the date of his first statement (which was 28 September 2018) disclosure ought to have been given. Mr Tank’s lack of understanding of relevance and disclosure should not have arisen, and the existence of his box file should have become known to the claimants’ solicitors far earlier than it was. </p>

This also included requests of CCTV recordings which Mr Tank said he had looked at. These requests were refused on 27 March 2019, and the claimants stated that this refusal was on the basis that they were either outside their control, no longer existed or were not relevant to the claimants’ evidence and were not relied upon at trial. </p>

I consider the claimants’ attitude in this respect unhelpful, although it should be noted that for at least the documents in respect of Mr Latif, the Post Office could have taken its own steps in this regard.  </p>

Mr Latif clearly said in his first witness statement at paragraph 7 “I also checked the CCTV to make sure that I had performed the transaction correctly.” Secondly, the Post Office’s closing submissions refer to requests for “the CCTV recordings which were consulted by Mr Tank for the purposes of drafting his witness statement”. He was asked about the CCTV during his evidence and did not say that he had consulted it for the drafting of his witness statement, he said that he had checked it at the time. Had the Post Office wished, it could have asked for that footage shortly after receiving that statement. It is also the case that the event in respect of which he referred to the CCTV occurred in July 2015. It may be that the CCTV images do not still survive, so long after the event in question, but this point was not pursued in cross-examination.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">There is, however, one major difference between the claimants and the Post Office in this respect. The Post Office were entitled to, and did, explore with specific witnesses certain issues in respect of disclosure by asking the relevant person (in the above example, Mr Latif) questions about it. The claimants did not have this opportunity for the following reason. The majority of complaints made about the Post Office’s disclosure arise as a result of Fujitsu. Save for rare circumstances, such as Mr Parson’s specific witness statement about the Royal Mail issue, all that the claimants and the court are usually told is “Fujitsu say X” or “Fujitsu told the Post Office” such and such. Specific individuals are not identified, and they are certainly not called as witnesses to be asked questions about their approach, or (for example in respect of KELs) how they could have been so factually wrong in their explanation of the KELs’ contents. I have formed a dim view of the accuracy of information of this nature coming from Fujitsu, regardless of the person in that organisation responsible for communicating it.  </p>

If a witness refers to a particular document in their oral evidence, and the other party in this litigation wishes to see a copy of that document, then (absent issues of privilege) that ought to be disclosed, even more so if a specific request is made. This is by far the most sensible and proportionate way forward. It is in no party’s interests to engage in squabbling about relevance of a specific document in those circumstances. It costs far more to argue back and forth in solicitors’ letters than it does simply to give disclosure. In any event, the relevance of the document is made clear by the fact that it has been referred to orally in evidence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">It is also correct to say that notwithstanding the different burden upon the different sides in terms of disclosure in the Horizon Issues trial, which has undoubtedly been far heavier for the Post Office, this burden will not always be borne in these proportions. The Post Office also has the benefit of a far higher number of legal advisers. As at the date of this draft judgment, simply in terms of the total number of leading counsel engaged in the group litigation, the Post Office outnumbers the claimants by 4:1. In terms of the number of solicitors’ firms, the Post Office currently outnumbers the claimants by 2:1; although only one firm was acting for the Post Office on the Horizon Issues, and the second firm acted for the Post Office on its unsuccessful attempt to appeal the Common Issues. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The Post Office is, in my judgment, somewhat at risk of downplaying certain unsatisfactory aspects of its own disclosure that have emerged during the Horizon Issues trial. For example, the incident concerning the incorrect statements made to the court about the Royal Mail refusing disclosure without an order of the court was described in the Post Office’s closing submissions as a “mix up” which was “regrettable but should not be the subject of criticism of Post Office.” I do not consider telling the court something in express terms which is factually wrong can properly or correctly be identified as merely a “mix up”. Two points that were expressly explained by its leading counsel were simply not factually accurate. The Royal Mail was not refusing disclosure, and it did not require an order of the court before it would provide certain documents. It had not even been asked for them.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Similarly, in its closing submissions the Post Office referred to the interlocutory discussions about the Known Error Log as a “debate about relevance”. That again downplays what had happened, including the positive submissions made, that the Log was specifically not relevant and even if an order were made in respect of documents showing bugs, errors and defects, the Log would not be disclosed (even if it were in the Post Office’s control, which it was stoutly maintained it was not). The submissions made by the Post Office on the adequacy of its own disclosure have been rather undermined, since the trial ended, by the production (emanating from Fujitsu, once again) of over 5,000 KELs, something rightly described by the Post Office’s solicitors as “a serious matter”.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The claimants have not been entirely co-operative on their own disclosure, however. I consider that the criticisms of the claimants for serving what was described as “claimant specific” evidence are unjustified.

Dr Worden did not, but </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">that does not mean that the claimants were wrong to do so. Some of the criticisms made by the Post Office regarding the claimants are unjustified, therefore, but not all of them are. Although I do harbour the suspicion that the Post Office may have decided that, on disclosure at least, attack may be the best form of defence, some of the criticisms made in the Post Office’s closing submissions are justified. For example, for the claimants’ solicitors simply to state that “at present, it is not the Claimants’ intention to make another round of disclosure in relation to the Horizon Issues trial” as was done in July 2018, is not co-operative. Further, the reason that documents which Mr Tank had in his box, that were plainly relevant, were not disclosed was because Mr Tank had not been asked for them. Had he been asked – which is something that the claimants’ solicitors should have done, once it was known he would be a witness – these could and would have been disclosed. They certainly should have been. </p>

It was then disclosed just before resumption of the trial “in a batch”. This is not working to the time scale either required, or expected, by the court, and it is not the correct way to deal with disclosure during a trial.

The experts were not tasked only with investigating bugs, errors and defects that had a proven financial impact of (say) £18M, £10M, or any financial figure at all, and certainly not one in the millions of pounds. This was for the following reasons. It was never part of the Post Office’s position at the case management stage when the Horizon Issues were discussed and considered, that there should be any sort of threshold for financial impact, above which the experts should investigate, and below which they should not. The wording of Horizon Issue 1 has already been addressed above, and this uses the terms “possible or likely”. This notion of imposing a financial threshold must have come from Dr Worden. </p>

The Post Office’s position is that Horizon is sufficiently robust such that it cannot be the cause of the different shortfalls complained of by the hundreds of different claimants. The counter-position to that by the claimants is <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>that particular discrete sets of bugs had, individually, an impact of millions of pounds upon their branch accounts. If that were the claimants’ case, then Dr Worden’s approach as set out in this joint statement might be understandable. Rather, the claimants’ case is that there are a large number of different bugs, errors and defects that each affected each of their branch accounts over time, with the end result being that each of them was (in accounting terms) identified as owing the Post Office sums in the tens of thousands, or thousands of pounds (or less) with the consequences which are well known. Some discrepancies were only a few pounds, but are said to have occurred many times. Some were said to be tens of thousands of pounds cumulatively. Some occurred many times; others less often, but with greater individual effect. One bug – of which more later – is said to “double up”, which would mean an exponential effect as a loss doubles, then quadruples and so on. If one imposes, at the beginning of the expert investigation process, a filter or threshold that looks for a “set of bugs” causing losses of “millions of pounds” that will have the effect of restricting the field of investigation. There is no reason for such a restriction, in my judgment.  </p>

The experts were also agreed, in respect of Horizon Issue 6, that whilst Horizon contains measures and controls for detecting system integrity concerns, the automatic mechanisms have failed in the past. The experts did not agree as to the ‘extent’ of prevention, detection, identification, reporting or risk reduction that the automatic and manual control measures delivered; however, the agreement that automatic mechanisms have failed in the past, which was contained in the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Joint Statement, is in my judgment important.

Identification required the cooperation of PO staff and the SPMs. Again, I consider this expert agreement to be important. This was, essentially, the essence of the complaints raised by Mr Bates himself in the very earliest days of Legacy Horizon, namely that there was or were insufficient information or reports available to him to enable him to identify the causes of apparent or alleged discrepancies. The experts are agreed that, for some causes of apparent or alleged discrepancies this is indeed the case, due to the complexity of the back-end systems (back-end means not at the branch) and the limited knowledge a SPM would have. </p>

The experts were also agreed that the use of tools and facilities to do this should be auditable, however the maintenance of logs recording this would be dependent upon retention periods and the size of the logs in question.

The individual requiring a Global Use account has to be approved by a Manager showing on the Global User requester and approver list”. However, the document also identified that PWC had discovered that “the current Global User list inherited from Fujitsu contained employees who had left the Business. This raised concerns over the security of access to Horizon. Although this is a low risk in terms of Horizon access (the individual would have to gain access into a Branch first) it is still a risk and needed to be mitigated.” There were 32 such former employees. It was in respect of the permission control procedures concerning these tools that the documented authorisation process was identified, using documents called the “Master Service Change” or MSC documents and “Operational Control Procedures” or OCPs. These documents were requested by Mr Coyne but no actual disclosure application was issued. The document to which I have referred explaining Global User was in the trial bundle.  </p>

Evidence concerning bugs in the Bug Table formed a large part of the expert evidence that was tested in cross-examination. The different bugs, or alleged bugs, identified in the Bug Table were as follows. I have added to the following the summary of the position of the Post Office in Appendix 2 of its Closing Submissions, which in some cases accepted there was such a bug, and qualified that acceptance in most instances by references to what was said to be the impact of the bug. I deal with detailed findings on those bugs that are in issue in the Technical Appendix to this judgment. For the detailed submissions by the Post Office for each bug, the paragraph numbering in Appendix 2 started again at 1 for each bug.  This did not cause particular difficulty, and because the Post Office explained that Appendix 2 had been put together by different parts having been drafted by different counsel/solicitor teams, this is understandable. I refer to it here, because otherwise a reader of the passages below might become confused as to why there seem to be so many paragraphs all (for example) numbered 2 in Appendix 2. The following summary of the Bug Table is intended to be a useful summary for this judgment, and is not restricted solely to the entries within the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> Joint Statement.   </p>

Its identified years of effect were 2000 – 2006. It is accepted as a bug by the Post Office in paragraph 6 of Appendix 2, but is said to have had “transient impact”. Dr Worden added different comments, including that “the bug arose from a fault in the underlying Riposte software, so it is not surprising that it took Fujitsu some time to understand it, or that they had to rely on the suppliers to fix it. It does not show poor system design or support by Fujitsu”. That latter sentence is a little surprising, and seemingly very defensive on Fujitsu’s behalf. This is because the Horizon Issues are all about the operability and functionality of Horizon, not who is to blame for the presence of any bugs, errors or defects. Riposte software was part of Legacy Horizon. The fact that it is a product designed and supplied by Escher, and not Fujitsu, is not relevant to the dispute between the Post Office and the claimants. In any event, and as accepted and recited in paragraph 2 of the Summary of Appendix 2 dealing with this bug, “Mr Coyne asserts that Bug 2: Callendar Square is a bug with lasting financial impact and in JS2, Dr Worden appears to agree that there is strong evidence of this….” </p>

What this meant was that if there was an impact on branch accounts by something within Horizon, but that was then corrected by a TC, he concluded it had a “transient effect” upon branch accounts and dealt with it differently.

It is named in respect of the branch where it was “discovered” in 2015, although the investigation undertaken by Fujitsu in that year identified previous occurrences. There were over 110 occurrences of it over this 5 year period (the actual number is probably 116, but at least 114) with 88 branches affected. Some were impacted multiple times. It is what is called a “cash remming error” and only happened in certain circumstances. It was explained further by Mr Godeseth in his evidence at [445] onwards above. It would, in my judgment, have an impact upon branch accounts – it is the extent of that impact that is in issue, whether it was lasting or transient. Dr Worden relied upon what he described as “a well-tested process of reconciliation and TCs to detect and correct errors in cash remming (used 20,000 times per year)” and said it was “straightforward for Horizon to detect any discrepancy between a “rem out” and the corresponding “rem in” (a mismatch arising either from a miscount, or a multiple count of a pouch) and then a TC can be issued.” He also added that “this process catches and corrects remming errors, whatever their cause - including if they arise from, or are provoked by, software faults.” He therefore implicitly accepted that the Dalmellington bug was a software fault, although he did not say so in terms. I find that it was plainly was. He was also reliant upon the process of TCs to correct it. Further, the bug was there for 5 years and was not discovered, although its effects doubtless were. I find that this was a software bug that impacted upon branch accounts and I will come to the nature of its effect in my findings on the bugs that are not agreed.  </p>

Given this was an entry in the 2</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:11.5pt">nd</span><span style="font-size:11.5pt"> Joint Statement agreed by the experts, it is a little unfair to state that Mr Coyne had done this, as the entry was obviously agreed by Dr Worden.

Mr Parker had identified 33 branches affected. Mr Coyne recorded what he said were four associated KELs, namely acha5259Q (for which there were 6 PEAKs)(this KEL is mistakenly recorded twice in column 3, with acha5838T only mentioned in the text in that column); cardc2043L (10 PEAKs); PorterS199P (3 PEAKs); and acha5838T (which states there are “two different but similar problems” and appears in the text, but not in the list of KELs at the end of the text by Mr Coyne).

Dr Worden is correct that PEAKs and KELs do not record corrections of financial impact; they do however record financial impact, because when an SPM reaches SSC (which raises the PEAK) they often start by recording “SPM says he/she has a problem in that……” and financial impact is often then recorded. The Post Office in paragraph 2 of the detailed part of Appendix 2 dealing with this bug states that “any discrepancy would not be lasting”. This does therefore accept, albeit implicitly, that it would have an impact upon branch accounts. It is also submitted that it was a “teething problem” from the early days of the Horizon Online pilot scheme. </p>

Mr Coyne’s entry in the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> Joint Statement stated “In April 2003 due to a failure in regression testing, Horizon version S30 was released by Fujitsu and this introduced a bug where the value of transactions reversed by Subpostmasters was shown twice in the amount of the reversal in branch accounts.” </p>

The building of data trees is a software function, and given “the system” is Horizon and is supposed to detect failures of this nature, it is difficult to see how it could ever have been in issue that this was a bug. Mr Coyne’s entry in the bug table recites that “Dugannon branch suffered a £43,000 discrepancy but the cause was not immediately known. £52,814.29 at the Yate Sodbury Branch. £9,368.40 at the Appleby Westmoreland branch.” These are sizeable sums and arose in the branch accounts.

It is now accepted as a bug by the Post Office in paragraph 6 of Appendix 2, but is said to have had transient impact. Mr Coyne considered that when replacing a counter within a branch, the process could result in “the total loss of a transaction”. Dr Worden stated that the cause, recorded in the first KEL (which was created in December 2000 and last updated in July 2007) was that Riposte was coming online from the Recovery mode too early, and causing messages to be overwritten. The nature of the correction was stated as being “to find the overwritten transactions for reconciliation we need to look at the Ripostemirror messagestore' followed by detailed instructions”. Riposte, as has been explained, was part of Legacy Horizon and was a product provided by another company, Escher, but it is plainly part of Horizon. Dr Worden also stated that “the incident arose from a hardware replacement (probably from a hardware fault) not from a fault in Horizon. It is a different kind of recovery issue.” In my judgment the hardware is part of Horizon. Findings in respect of this are made in the Technical Appendix.  </p>

The Post Office detailed submissions in Appendix 2 of its Closing Submissions concentrated on the fact that withdrawn stock – which of course is part of the way that the Post Office manages its business, adding and removing types of products from time to time – this removal of products is done by means of an update to reference data, “and not a change to the core code in the system.” This again is concentrating on the code, rather than the way the system operates.

They are basically selfservice kiosks, designed to avoid queuing, and a customer can weigh a letter or parcel, the terminal will print the relevant stamps/labels, and the item is then posted.

Dr Worden stated in the bug table that “there was some implication of hardware faults, with a replacement of a base unit, but the PEAK has no evidence of software faults in Horizon.” In one of the PEAKs, he concluded that there was no evidence of any fault in Horizon.

I do however find it notable that although Dr Worden says the amounts involved are what he calls “small”, he accepts it is as a “back end reporting problem” – which is nothing to do with the SPM, by definition – and also the KEL states that “the accounting tree has not handled this properly when calculating the daily recon figures and it has resulted in a mismatch…” The mismatch in that case was 66p. The accounting tree is part of Horizon. The KEL also appears to be incomplete because only the first page is present. The section that follows the heading “Evidence” is entirely missing. There is also nothing in terms of the text available that demonstrates what occurred in 2008, even though it is plain for the page that is available that the KEL was updated then. The Post Office submits that there are five separate issues drawn together within this bug. Findings on this are dealt with in the Technical Appendix.  </p>

This occurred in July 2017 and related to a duplicate “Drop and Go” transaction for £100. This was performed twice; the branch was debited with £200, but the customer credited with only £100 (which had been the amount “topped up” by the customer). Mr Coyne considered it a bug with impact upon branch accounts; Dr Worden stated in his entry “My analysis of this KEL was ‘Possible financial impact. Seems very visible on the counter. Script = reference data - therefore fixed easily’. Paragraph 2 of the detailed part of Appendix 2 on this bug states “Peak PC0260269 relates to an issue involving a Drop and Go transaction (<span style="text-decoration:underline">a £100 mobile phone top up</span>) that timed out on Horizon” (emphasis added). This does not appear to be correct, and I do not believe that the transaction relates to a mobile phone. However, I deal with this further in the findings in the Technical Appendix.  </p>

Dr Worden considered it was “mainly about a communication problem from BT, outside Horizon” but also wanted to investigate further due to an entry that referred to a “CNIM own goal”.

Dr Worden’s approach minimises or avoids impact on branch accounts that have been caused by bugs, errors or defects, even where those that are (or have been) present in the Horizon system have in fact affected the branch accounts of SPMs. It is a feature that I take into account when I consider which of the two experts’ approaches and evidence I prefer.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">“1.  Irrespective of how you define the detail of robustness, in line with most other large-scale computer systems, Horizon's robustness has generally improved. From our experience of other computer systems, Horizon is relatively robust. We agree that 'robust' does not mean infallible and therefore Horizon has and will continue to suffer faults. Robustness limits the impact of those faults and other adverse events. This increase in robustness has, in part, developed from Post Office discovering bugs/errors and defects in live use and then applying fixes and improving monitoring. </p>

It was agreed that errors in reference data have led to discrepancies in branch accounts, and also that errors in third-party data have led to discrepancies in branch accounts too. Further, the Post Office has no control over the level of errors made by the third-party clients of the Post Office, and this is agreed.

This however, is not for application related purposes, but is for system maintenance and problem-solving purposes. It is also agreed by both IT experts that it is important that the number of users with these abilities is kept down to the minimum possible, AND for each action that they take whilst logged in to be recorded and audited (my use of block capitals).  </p>

The logging of Privileged User Access (in PUA logs) commenced in October 2009. For the period 2009 to 2015 – obviously a 6 year period - these logs only displayed the fact that a Privileged User had logged on or off,  “but not what actions they had taken whilst the Privileged User was logged in”. Therefore the actions they were taking when logged in were being neither recorded nor audited. All that could be seen is they were logged in. Further, it has already been seen that the number of users with the relevant privileges was not, in my judgment, restricted to a minimum. Further, the use of the Transaction Correction Tool cannot be seen in these logs. Yet further, the experts are agreed that at all times, any privileged user access log only shows what tables of BRDB were accessed for a very small minority of accesses.  </p>

It also means, because of the extent (or rather the power) of the APPSUP privilege, the Transaction Correction Tool is but a small subset of the way that records in the BRDB can be affected or changed by Fujitsu. It also means that the tool’s Low Level Design document that was available in the trial bundle, and considered by the experts, has been overtaken by use of the Transaction Correction Tool, because the SQL INSERT command is not present in 2,296 acknowledged uses of the tool. Both the number of uses, and the non-use of the SQL INSERT command, are in agreed passages by the experts in the 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Joint Statement.

At the end of each trading period, the SPM would produce a Branch Trading Statement (or “BTS”) using Horizon, which was the accounting statement of the branch for that period. Any shortfall or discrepancy in the accounts as demonstrated by the BTS would have to be made good by the SPM (which means the amount of the loss would have to be paid) or “settled centrally” (which means the SPM would seek time to pay). Therefore, any occurrence of any bug, error or defect within that trading period would have an impact on the branch accounts (by reason of the regular production of the BTS) at the end of that particular 4 week trading period.  </p>

If, say, a SPM had retired, closed their branch, been suspended or in any other way ceased to be a SPM, then a TC could not sensibly be used to them.

The evidence I have identified at [401] to [414] above makes it clear that this bug was discovered in 2005, and Mr Godeseth accepted that it had probably been present in Horizon since its inception in 2000. It affected at least 30 branches, and was recorded in one of the contemporaneous documents as “this problem has been around for years and affects a number of sites most weeks.” Yet on Dr Worden’s somewhat artificial constraining of impact on branch accounts, it would be categorised as only having a transient impact. The dictionary meaning of transient is fleeting, passing, brief, temporary, momentary, transitory, short-lived or ephemeral, and plainly does not apply to the effect of this admitted bug. In my judgment the use of this word by Dr Worden and the Post Office is unjustified. The use of it by Dr Worden was unnecessarily to restrict his analysis.  </p>

This involved the Post Office calling Mr Parker to be cross-examined, and explaining that Mr Membury (another of the Fujitsu witnesses) was unable to be called, and the relevant Civil Evidence Act notice being given under CPR Part 33.2. The position of the claimants on that latter point was explained as their consenting to the necessary extension of time (rather than a waiver by them under section 2(3) of the Act, a difference that is immaterial in the circumstances).

Just to explain, when Fujitsu did any authorised remote handling of data, to put it neutrally, which might affect branch accounts, they raised an OCP, OCR or MSC whose text was likely to include the six digit FAD code of the relevant branch.  So it's therefore possible to search all the OCPs, OCRs and MSCs with a view to finding all of those which mention the claimant branches during the relevant claimant's period of tenure.  This search yields a limited number of OCPs, OCRs and MSCs, and it's therefore possible to assess expert issues 12 and 13, which is how often was remote access facility exercised and what effect did it have.  It is possible to assess those questions as they affect the claimants by examining that much smaller document set.

It makes, in his view, it possible for the experts to form a view as to how often remote access was exercised and what its likely effect was. It is Dr Worden's view that it is his duty under CPR Part 35 to inform the court of this change of view and to allow the court to consider whether or not it wishes to see it considered.  That belief is based, as your Lordship will be aware, on CPR35.3 which imposes a duty on experts to help the court on the matters within their expertise, whether or not they are instructed so to do.

It is difficult to see how permission could be given in general terms for late expert evidence, the content of which was not available.

Dr Worden’s first expert report was dated 7 December 2018 and his supplementary report was dated 1 February 2019. This notification to the court on 11 April 2019 of Dr Worden having “recently realised that there is a new way of looking at the evidence in this case” came over four months after the date of his first report, over two months after the date of his supplementary report, and exactly one month after the Horizon Issues trial itself had actually started.

Mr Linnett should have been told that this was being done, and the documents could have even been studied together by both experts so that an agreed position could be produced by them on what the documents did or did not show, and the use to which they could or could not be put. I conclude that the only reason for keeping the fact that this exercise was underway, until after it was ready to be served after the trial had actually started, was to cause maximum disruption to MMT. This is a much discredited approach to civil litigation.

Firstly, just because in the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">ICI </span>case that expert performed a new exercise without telling his opposite number he was doing so (which led to criticism), does not mean that all an expert has to do is to inform his opposite number during a trial that he has decided to undertake a new exercise, or produce a new report, and that by giving such advance notice this means the new report will be admitted. The whole ethos of exchange of expert evidence well in advance of trial is so that each party (and their respective experts) have advance </p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">notice of the opposing point of view, so that evidence can be properly addressed and surprise avoided. That is undermined by service of very late reports containing new analyses. Sometimes this is unavoidable and late material emerges. It is not possible to be entirely proscriptive, as each case is different. That is why permission of the court is required. Secondly, the stage of the trial at which this 3rd Report was produced by Dr Worden was very late indeed. It was weeks after the trial had started. Thirdly, the extent to which the court needs to consider all the circumstances depends upon whether the 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> Report was sought to be relied upon by the Post Office. Finally, and of wider application, is the way in which the Third Report was dealt with, namely by service by the expert himself directly upon the court. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Dealing with those matters in turn, the first two are effectively bound up with one another. I do not know the actual date when Dr Worden realised that this new way of looking at things appeared to him to be useful. However, the court was told he had started thinking about this on 11 April 2019, and the claimants’ solicitors had already been told of his intention by the Post Office’s solicitors the previous day on 10 April 2019 (one day after the recusal application was dismissed, and the day before resumption of the trial). Thereafter, a draft report was provided on a without prejudice basis to Mr Coyne on 25 April 2019 by Dr Worden, his “current workings” having been provided on the same basis on 11 April 2019 and the appendices, again on a without prejudice basis on 25 April 2019. There was then a degree of to-ing and froing between the solicitors, which led to the actual report itself being sent on an open basis to Mr Coyne on 16 May 2019 (after another experts’ meeting on 15 May 2019). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Turning to the third of the matters identified in [717] above, this can be readily dealt with. The Post Office made it clear, both on 11 April 2019 in the passages which I have quoted above, and subsequently, that it did not seek permission to adduce the contents of Dr Worden’s 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> Report in evidence. It issued no application in this respect. Therefore, it was not necessary for the court to consider the balancing exercise inherent in resolving any application in this respect (on the basis that such an application was resisted by the claimants, which was likely). It is inherent within this decision by the Post Office not to issue an application to adduce it therefore, that there was no explanation of when or how Dr Worden had experienced this “new way of looking at the evidence”, other than what has been identified above. It also meant that this report was not adduced as any part of his evidence-in-chief, and he was not crossexamined about it. He referred to its existence only once, very much in passing, and given that the contents of it had not been adduced in evidence, that was as far as it went.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Had I been faced with a contested application by the Post Office to be permitted to rely upon the contents of the 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> Report in evidence, the matter would have been considered in accordance with the principles in the CPR generally, CPR Part 35, the Practice Direction that goes with it, as well as the Guidance for the Instruction of Experts to Give Evidence in Civil Claims 2014 (“Guidance of Experts in Civil Claims”) which is in the White Book with the Practice Direction. Doubtless such an application, had it been made, would have been supported by a detailed explanation of all the relevant matters, together with argument on both sides. I do not have the benefit of either a detailed explanation or of any argument. On the material of which I am aware, but without hearing any submissions on it for obvious reasons, a substantial hurdle to the success of such an application would have been its lateness. This is because of the enormous disruption and yet further delay that would have been the inevitable consequence of permitting reliance upon such a late expert’s report. Severe disruption and delay had already been caused to the Horizon Issues trial by the time this report emerged, and by late May, the trial was shortly about to resume after an enforced interval, in very unusual circumstances, of over two months. Had this new report been admitted into the evidence, Mr Coyne would have required time to study it, and then potentially produce a further expert’s report of his own, and none of that could have been accommodated between late May (whenever such an application could have been listed) and 4 June 2019. Calling him would either have been delayed, or he would have had to be recalled later to deal with it. Further delay to the Horizon Issues trial would have been undoubtedly caused. Delay is not always fatal to such applications, but the later an application of this kind is made, the stronger the explanation for that delay has to be. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The claimants had also made the point on 23 May 2019, the day after Dr Worden had served his 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> Report upon the court, that it was based upon an analysis of documents, namely OCPs, OCRs and MSCs, that Mr Coyne himself had expressly requested in July 2018 and which the Post Office’s solicitors had then said were irrelevant. In any event, when I asked him at the end of his cross-examination, Dr Worden confirmed that he had had the documents upon which he had based this 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> Report “for some months” and that he had had the full set of PEAKs since, as he put it, “way back in 2018”. As the Post Office’s own counsel explained on 11 April 2019, Dr Worden was “frankly, kicking himself” that he “didn’t think of this before”. The lateness seems therefore to have been the consequence of Dr Worden failing to consider this approach until very late in the day, rather than only very recently being provided with the material. That is not promising ground for the making of such an application. It is also the case, in my judgment, that there were no exceptional circumstances which made it unavoidable that this new report was produced during the actual trial. Indeed, rather to the contrary. This was entirely avoidable. Finally, the covering email from Dr Worden made it clear that his estimate, included in his first report and revised in the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> Joint Statement of 0.4%, was “still sound”.

An analogy was drawn with an expert seeking directions under CPR 35.14, and it was dealt with by the Post Office as though the direct service upon the court was simply the actions of an expert seeking in the normal way to fulfil his duties to the court, and was entirely usual. It is, however, not usual; it is highly unusual. Further, the covering email from Dr Worden makes it clear that the new report was not a change of opinion; in particular, the sentence that makes this entirely clear is “in my opinion, that estimate is still sound” concerning the calculation in his earlier reports. His exercise was simply a different way of reaching the same conclusion. Therefore, the provisions of paragraphs 64 to 66 in the Guidance of Experts in Civil Claims do not apply.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">I do not consider that any witness, lay or expert, should communicate directly with the trial judge about the content of their evidence, or indeed about any subject at all. There is a substantial risk that the efficient management of proceedings will be compromised if this is done. Communications with the court should always be done by solicitors, if they are on the record. Further, communications between an expert and those instructing him, or her, are privileged. If, as here, an expert takes it upon himself to inform the court of applications that his client may, or may not, be intending to make, there is a real danger that privileged information might be divulged, both to the court and also to the other side in the litigation. This is far less likely if communications are performed by solicitors, who have specific qualifications in legal matters and will be experienced in litigation. Finally, there is specific provision in the Guidance of Experts in Civil Claims dealing with the situation where an expert wishes to exercise their right to ask the court for directions. This is contained in paragraphs 28 and 29. These proposed directions have to be sent to the party instructing the expert at least seven days before the request is made, and to the other parties in the litigation at least four days before. They are to be made by letter in the form prescribed at paragraph 29(a) to (e). That gives the other parties the ability, firstly to have advance notice of what is proposed, as well as providing advance notice that the court will be asked for directions and what those directions are, and why; and also give the expert’s instructing solicitors the ability to consider the communication in advance so that privileged information is not included.  </p>

He also said that he had sent the email direct to my clerk as this was what he had been advised to do by the “Post Office’s lawyers”. He said that he had not given his instructing solicitors the opportunity to check or approve the covering email, but “had been given some advice as to what it should cover”. I assume that advice did not include telling Dr Worden that he should inform the court of the Post Office’s potential intentions on what applications it may, or may not, be minded to make in the litigation. This is a highly unusual situation. In closing submissions the Post Office invited me to provide guidance in this judgment as to what should be done for future cases, as though the position was unclear. I do not know why it should be thought necessary to tell witnesses – lay or expert - that they should not unilaterally communicate with the court. However, if it is necessary, no witnesses should communicate with the court directly in this way. Any communications from legal advisers should always be copied to the other parties in litigation. No expert should inform the court directly what applications his or her solicitors might be contemplating, or not contemplating, in the future conduct of the litigation.  </p>

Mr Bates was a SPM before Horizon was introduced in 2000, and it is from Horizon’s introduction that year that, on the claimants’ case, the problems and difficulties arose, and arose as a result of the functionality of the computing system introduced by the Post Office, which in this judgment is referred to as Legacy Horizon. As the Post Office pointed out regularly during these proceedings, there are thousands of branches and millions of transactions each year in all of those branches, which means that over such a lengthy period, there is a vast amount of computing activity that had to be considered by the experts. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The expert evidence was therefore required to be substantial. The aspects of the litigation that require expert evidence are not, however, of unheard of proportions, so far as the High Court is concerned. The High Court often deals with matters that span a lengthy period; it also often deals with matters of great complexity that require expert evidence. By comparison with many other cases, one expert discipline alone, with only one IT expert per party, is not a particularly expert-heavy case. The experts’ reports, though lengthy, were not of an unusual size. There were two reports from each expert that were adduced in evidence, and each of them was of a type that would be expected in a trial of medium complexity, which I consider the Horizon Issues trial to have been. Nor was it necessary for the experts to examine every claimant SPM’s separate experience; the whole purpose of having generic Horizon Issues was to avoid precisely that. The Post Office would often concentrate on how vast the panorama was before the court, but this may have been done simply to emphasise how few, in relative terms, the claimants are; which also emphasised at the same time how well (so far as the Post Office generally is concerned) the Post Office business operates day by day, week by week, across so many branches. The experts agreed that Horizon has produced over three million sets of monthly branch accounts.  </p>

This case, as with all litigation, is very important to those involved in it – to all of the claimants, but also to the Post Office, as an institution generally, and also to its other directors, employees, SPMs who are not claimants and its clients too. The issues and different causes of action in both claims and counterclaims are of considerable importance, and the amount of money at stake is not small. However, the amount of money is not large in terms of specialist litigation, for example. It is not measured in the billions, or even many hundreds of millions. Ignoring claims for general damages, the amount of damages that are specified in liquidated sums are said to be about £18 million (although that is only an approximate figure currently). There are, of course, also reputational issues at stake as well as money. </p>

At the Pre-Trial Review, the Post Office submitted that at least four days was needed for the cross-examination of Mr Coyne. It was realistically accepted that longer than that was not likely to be permitted, although leading counsel for the Post Office did submit that he would prefer longer. The claimants submitted that they also wanted four days, but had trimmed that period to three days, for the cross-examination of Dr Worden. Given there were further experts’ meetings to come, and given my view of the scope of the expert material and considering the overriding objective, I set a trial timetable that permitted each side two and a half days to cross-examine the other side’s expert. That would have given a total number of five days of cross-examination for all the IT expert evidence. At that time, I considered that would be sufficient, and also proportionate, taking account of the overriding objective.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">However, the subsequent Joint Statements following the PTR did not reach as much agreement as I had (perhaps naively) anticipated. I therefore adjusted the trial timetable and set a new one, with the Post Office being given four days to crossexamine Mr Coyne, and the claimants being given three days to cross-examine Dr Worden. That trial timetable also allowed an interval of one non-sitting week, to follow the evidence of fact, for each side properly to prepare their time-limited expert cross-examination in detail.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">In my judgment, the period of time I had allotted at the PTR of 2½ days each was sufficient in itself; but the increased period of time allowed was undoubtedly sufficient for each party properly to cross-examine and test the expert evidence adduced by the other side in the litigation. Seven court days for the total crossexamination of one expert discipline in a case such as this is, given the Horizon Issues in this trial, generous. Counsel might not have had time to put each and every single individual point to the expert on the other side, but they had more than enough time to put the main ones (and a considerable number of subsidiary ones too, for that matter). Each side had leading counsel, well-versed in all of the issues, who have been involved in the case from at least the making of the GLO itself in early 2017, as well as a team of other counsel assisting too. Considerable pre-reading had been done by the court. As it turned out, the issuing of the recusal application on 21 March 2019 led to an even longer period of the trial not sitting, with only a half day (for Mr Parker) of the trial taking place between 21 March 2019 and 4 June 2019, a period of 75 days, or over ten weeks. The Post Office had a different counsel team acting on the recusal application than the team acting on the Horizon Issues trial. That 75 day period was a substantial period of time for each side to prepare detailed cross-examination on all, and any, points that they considered important, prior to the resumption of the trial and the commencement of the expert evidence on 4 June 2019. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The amount of the costs burden explained in [737] above has been incurred on the basis of the number of trial days made available. Obviously, further time for crossexamination would have led to even higher cost figures. There was a sufficient and proportionate amount of time at trial made available for the expert evidence to be properly challenged and tested, and there was more than sufficient time available for preparation of the time-limited cross-examination. I have set this out in detail in order to make it clear that the time limited nature of the Horizon trial, and the number of days allotted for cross-examination, has in my judgment had no effect on my findings on the Horizon Issues, or restricted either party’s opportunity to put its own case and test the case of the other party.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The other feature of time-limited cross-examination, given the depth of experience of counsel, is that I permitted considerable latitude to the cross-examiners. If counsel wanted to put the same point to an expert again and again; or spend an hour on one specific sentence or detail, when the same point could have been accomplished in five minutes; or devote significant time to high-level issues and avoid descending to specifics; then that was a judgment call made by that counsel. With more junior counsel, in another case, the court might discourage excessive time on less important or agreed points, to encourage progress; but here both sides had highly experienced leading counsel. I therefore intervened rarely. The amount of time made available in the trial timetable for each side to cross-examine the other’s expert was set down in advance, and if one side wished to devote (say) half a day to having an expert state, and then restate, an agreed position on a particular point, then that was very much a matter for them. Such an approach would lead to that period not being available to allocate to other subjects, but in my judgment this case in particular benefitted from allowing the parties to conduct their cross-examination, more or less, in the direction they wished.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">“in line with most other large-scale computer systems, Horizon's robustness has generally improved. From our experience of other computer systems, Horizon is relatively robust. We agree that 'robust' does not mean infallible and therefore Horizon has and will continue to suffer faults. Robustness limits the impact of those faults and other adverse events. This increase in robustness has, in part, developed from Post Office discovering bugs/errors and defects in live use and then applying fixes and improving monitoring.” </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">I consider that this is an important passage of the experts’ agreement, and indeed robustness is an important aspect of the Horizon Issues. It makes clear that, in part, it is the discovery by the Post Office of bugs, errors and defects, the application of fixes (which means changes to the software by means of a software fix) and the improvement of monitoring that has led to the increase in robustness that has been achieved in the system as it is at 2019. This inevitably means that in earlier times, Horizon was less robust, or not as robust as it is now. This applies both to Legacy Horizon and also to Horizon Online. There are undoubtedly more modern or recent bugs in Horizon, as can be seen from the Technical Appendix. Drop and Go, for example, was not even a product until about 2013, and the relevant bug in the Bug Table which is bug 28 occurred in July 2017. That caused an impact to the branch account in question of £100; modest or tiny in comparison to the total Drop and Go business for that year, or even that month, but still £100 which appeared as a deficit in the branch accounts, and still £100 which the SPM had to deal with. Until it was discovered the bug could not have been fixed. It would not have been present prior to 2013 (because Drop and Go did not exist) and any fix cannot have occurred prior to July 2017, if not a month or two later. The agreement that Horizon is relatively robust as at 2018 and 2019 is something that is doubtless of great importance to the Post Office, as it affects how the Horizon system as it is at the date of this judgment is both used by the Post Office, and perceived by the SPMs who use it every day. The Horizon Issues however deal with Horizon from the year 2000 onwards.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The other aspect of this part of the experts’ agreements that bears consideration is that the Post Office have to know about bugs, defects and errors in order that they can agree with Fujitsu that fixes have to be written and applied. This makes it particularly important, in my judgment, that Fujitsu were open and transparent with the Post Office about the presence of software bugs, errors and defects. Given Horizon was being used by the Post Office as the accounting procedure between it and its SPMs, there is every reason that Fujitsu would (or should) have to make the Post Office aware of bugs, errors and defects.  </p>

They rely upon humans actually performing or being aware of certain occurrences. Two of these rely upon SPMs, namely those at paragraph 54(3) and 55(4) of the Defence. The second of these is that “the accounting and record-keeping obligations placed on Subpostmasters reduce the risk of any errors going undetected.” In my judgment, for SPMs to be an effective – or indeed any – part of a “human measure” and to assist or contribute to the process of the Post Office discovering bugs, errors and defects in live use (so that, where necessary, software fixes can be initiated, developed and applied) the Post Office ought sensibly to be transparent with SPMs too.  </p>

If you have seen three branches that have had an impact because they were doing three foreign currency transactions, a £20, a £50 and a £100, but then there is a fourth person that believes that they have been subjected to that but that isn't recorded, you can't simply look at the three where it has been recorded and say the fourth couldn't possibly have occurred because we know there is a defect there. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">There are some important points that arise out of this approach. Firstly, the terms of the contracts between the Post Office and an SPM does not invoke the law of averages, either as it was explained in this cross-examination, or at all. The terms of the contracts, whether SPMC or NTC, have a very precise accounting process which is run by Horizon. Secondly, the existence of a bug such as Dalmellington, which was present in the Legacy Horizon system for 5 years prior to discovery, is of direct relevance to the Horizon Issues. It does not support the proposition that a SPM with an outreach branch in the 5 years before it was discovered was more likely (or equally likely) to be hit by lightning as having their branch accounts impacted by the Dalmellington bug. Thirdly, even if the “law of averages” approach were the correct one to adopt in terms of individual SPM complaints that their branch accounts had been impacted by a bug, error or defect in Horizon (and to be clear, I find that it is not) it is an exercise that could only sensibly even be attempted by firstly using the total number of bugs present in the system (which would require at least this judgment, if not more investigation too following the judgment), a definitive total for the number of instances of each bug occurring (again, which would require another judgment), a definitive total for the full amount of losses caused by each incident of each bug (information again not yet available, if ever) and some sort of probability calculation taking account of all those matters. That calculation would only, in any event, lead to a figure for the probability chances of <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> SPM in the period having their branch accounts impacted by a bug. So many of the essential ingredients or pieces of data for such a calculation are not known, that to try to attempt it in the way put by the Post Office, is to start from the end and work backwards, and work backwards in a way wholly lacking in mathematical precision. The “law of averages” approach cannot be used, in my judgment, in the way contended for by the Post Office. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Similar points can be made, in my judgment, to each of the bugs in the Bug Table, and not simply Dalmellington and outreach branches. Some affect foreign currency transactions. Bug 9 in the Bug Table, Reversals, only affected the value of transactions that were sought to be reversed by a SPM, and were impacted by the bug actually introduced into Horizon by version S30 which was released by Fujitsu. That this occurred at all was due to a failure in regression testing by Fujitsu prior to release of S30. This would, if the bug hit that branch, show the value of a reversal twice in branch accounts. The impact on the branch accounts would be the value of the reversal; if it were a large figure, the impact would be large, and vice versa. Something of that nature cannot sensibly be dealt with by the law of averages. Concurrent log ins, in the early days of Legacy Horizon, and numbered bug 18 in the Bug Table, would only occur if a user was logged in at the same time to two terminals. Again, that cannot sensibly be dealt with by use of the law of averages.  </p>

This answer, which in my judgment is an entirely accurate one in the context of this group litigation, is one that could apply to each of the instances or incidents of each of the bugs, errors and defects impacting branch accounts that have now come to light in the Horizon Issues trial. Individually and when considered across the whole of the 3 million sets of branch accounts in the period from 2000 onwards, the amounts are individually small amounts (although sometimes they are several thousand pounds). The same point can be reached by simply taking the sum at stake in the group litigation in terms of accounting losses for all the claimants (as opposed to other heads of claim not quantified) which is £18.7 million, and comparing it to the total amount of business transacted in the Post Office branch network as a whole across the entire UK from the year 2000 to date. No one has calculated that latter figure so far as I know (and if they have, they have not brought it to my attention) but it will be an enormous sum.

This was done in order to give a sense of scale to the request posed by Mr Coyne. The exact answer provided was “To give this a sense of scale, it is noted that Horizon processes around 6,000,000 transactions per day.” The reason for identifying this is that this figure for transactions per day, together with the agreed figure for the number of monthly branch accounts over the period agreed by the experts, namely 3 million, gives a sense of scale of the Post Office’s business conducted by Horizon and the total number of transactions over the period. Given there are fewer than 600 claimants, the number of impacts on branch accounts complained of by the claimants is a very small fraction of this (whatever its precise total). The law of averages approach does not assist the Post Office.  </p>

A “countermeasure” in this instance would be something that would correct an impact to the branch accounts. If that is only going to occur, as Mr Coyne put it “sometime later” then it would only be of limited utility, if any, depending upon the period of time this takes.

However, it also means that the robustness of a system cannot be measured by other measures (such as TCs, or a human complaints department as another example) taken to correct the effect of the IT system. A ready way of illustrating this is as follows. Consider a hypothetical IT accounting system that has 10 countermeasures designed into it, as a matter of IT design. It also has a human operated complaints department. All 10 of the countermeasures fail so a user has to contact the complaints department, which upholds the complaint and issues a correction, that undoes the impact within the accounts the IT system has allowed to occur. The efficiency of that department, and the accuracy with which it deals with such matters, cannot be used to assess in IT terms the robustness of the IT system itself. It is separate.  </p>

That is entirely at odds with them being part of a countermeasure within the Horizon system. This is effectively accepted in the Post Office’s opening submissions which expressly state at paragraph 114 that the “Post Office’s reconciliation processes are outside the scope of the Horizon Issues”. TCs are part of the Post Office’s reconciliation processes, and I find that they are outside the scope of the Horizon Issues.

His evidence was that this confirmed “the wide-ranging extent of the impact of such bugs/errors/defects. This evidence demonstrates that such bugs/errors/defects would undermine the reliability of the Horizon system to accurately process and record transactions”. He accepted that there was the need for reconciliation reports, and that this was part of the way that a system would check whether (say) the banking records at the Post Office transactions matched the corresponding records at (say) the Bank of Ireland for the same transactions. In my judgment KELs are indeed part of the records (or contemporaneous records) that can be considered in order to arrive at an overall conclusion for the existence and potential impact of bugs errors and defects, but the </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">PEAKs need to be consulted too. This is because the PEAKs are the documents that often have greater information within them, added to which one single KEL could relate to a couple of short PEAKs, or alternatively to many a great many far lengthier PEAKs, and it is only from the PEAKs themselves that one can gain a better view of the impact of that particular bug. Indeed, some of the KELs simply have a start and end date, with very little information on the number of impacts during the intervening period. It is clear to me that if there is more than one PEAK referring to the same KEL, one would only realise that there had been a re-occurrence of the same defect if one considered the PEAKs; the KEL would not show this. Simply looking at the KEL could give the erroneous impression that such a defect had only occurred once. It is also telling, in my judgment, that some PEAKs that are clearly related to errors, for example the PEAK associated with the issue that the subject that “SSC Database users do not have correct permissions”, namely PC0208119 dated 10 March 2012, expressly states in one of the 25 October 2011 entries the following “Have relevant KELs been created or updated? No. None believed to be required”. This clearly demonstrates that Fujitsu would not always even create a KEL for known errors (as SSC users having the incorrect permissions, all having APPSUP when they were not supposed to have this, is clearly a known error). SSC users were (as set out in the PEAK) only supposed to be given “the optional role 'APPSUP' temporarily (by Security Ops authorisation) if required to make emergency amendments in BRDB Live”. I find that the KELs alone do not constitute a record of all bugs, errors and defects. </p>

E&amp;Y had noted that the Post Office was not usually involved in testing fixes or maintenance changes to the in-scope applications (which includes Horizon Online) and they were unable to identify an internal control with the third-party service provider to authorise fixes and maintenance changes prior to development for applications. The risks were outlined by E&amp;Y in the following terms: </p>

In this instance a branch terminal was replaced, which resulted in a number of bills which branch customers had paid (in terms of making payment at the branch Post Office) not in fact being paid (to the ultimate payee, the Post Office clients that had issued the bills). The PEAK stated that “something went wrong and the marooned transaction did not find their way back to the office”, something which had occurred because the mirror disc in the branch terminal was replaced (when it should not have been).

The minutes of the Post Office’s own Risk Compliance Committee meeting of 18 September 2013 showed that not all of the risks identified in the then-recent E&amp;Y audit had been addressed. All four pages of these minutes were heavily redacted, but one surviving entry shows that risk not addressed was “relating to the communication by Fujitsu of changes made to the Horizon system, was still outstanding. It was identified that it would cost over a £1m to implement the mitigation being suggested by the audit and that this was not proportionate to the risk being managed.” Mr Coyne accepted in his crossexamination that this did not relate to a bug being fixed, and I accept that evidence. In my judgment it does go to the robustness of Horizon.   </p>

He was also asked to “forget Horizon Issue 4”. Given that Horizon Issue 4 asked “to what extent has there been potential for errors in data recorded within Horizon to arise in (a) data entry, (b) transfer or (c) processing of data in Horizon?”, being asked to ignore it somewhat narrowed down the utility of the exercise, but it is without doubt the case that Mr Coyne, when asked for a number for the upper range in the Joint Statement, stated it should not be 29, it should be a different figure. He initially stated that it should be 13. The court then rose for the short adjournment. As soon as court resumed one hour later, he immediately sought to correct the number 13 that he had given. He said the number should be 21. A complication in this cross-examination exercise was that initially Mr Coyne was using what he called his bug table in his 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> report (which had been dated 1 February 2019, and amended on 6 March 2019) and the cross-examination was being done by reference to something also referred to throughout the trial as “the Bug Table”, which was the one in the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> Joint Statement.

Starting with the first entry on his CV in terms of his work experience, between 1975 and 1986 he worked on the development of knowledge-based systems and developed Logica’s proprietary relational database management system, and between 1986 and 1990 he was the Managing Director of Logical Cambridge. This is an advanced technology subsidiary of Logica. Between 1991 and 1995 he acted as an independent reviewer of many of Logica’s largest projects, the key projects that constituted a large part of Logica’s commercial risks, and also a large part of its commercial reputation. Between 1995 and 1997 he was a Business and Technical Consultant in Logica, moving to Charteris in July 1997. He has given evidence in the High Court before on several occasions, including in what was at that time the biggest IT dispute tried, namely <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">BSkyB Ltd v HP Enterprise Services UK Ltd (formerly EDS </span></p>

This was a point demonstrated by counsel enrolling his own dog (“Lulu”) in the same establishment, Lulu gaining an MBA with higher marks than the witness. The hearing ran for 109 hearing days and Dr Worden was cross-examined in that case for more than 35 hours, which is a very considerable period of time for anyone to be in the witness box. In his CV he identifies that the majority of his opinions referred to in the judgment of Ramsey J were accepted by him.

He has earlier experience with relational database management systems when he was at Logica in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and from the dates it is possible to tell that he has been involved in the IT field for many decades, and (in comparison with many IT personnel today) from its infancy. He has also, whilst at Charteris, developed and deployed software for data integration and migration. He described himself as having done databases “since the year dot” at one point. He describes himself in his CV as having strong practical experience of information technology and its business applications. He has several years’ line management experience, has successfully managed large IT projects, and acts as a trouble-shooter of major integration projects and consultant in information strategy. He has particular expertise in XML, in largescale information architectures and tools, data integration and data migration, scientific data processing, and in system performance. He explained that as he is trained as a scientist and engineer, he has used mathematics all his life and part of that mathematics is probability theory and statistics. Given the subject of his Ph.D, it will be no surprise that he uses mathematics extensively.

One of the Post Office’s own witnesses, Mr Johnson used it in his evidence, in a passage quoted at [279] above. Further, in an internal document which was prepared after the Callendar Square bug was discovered, it was widely used. An extract from that document appears at [404] above. Not only is the term used in four separate places in that document, there is even reference to the Suspense Account Team. The notion that the Post Office did not understand the term used in the Particulars of Claim is wholly fanciful. Further, there is an agreed bug (number 3 in the Bug Table) which the experts call the Suspense Account bug.  </p>

The whole rationale of this litigation is to work out, more or less, exactly what the “inservice record” of Horizon in fact is.

For example, the Dalmellington bug (bug 4 in the Bug Table) appears to have affected only outreach branches. Relatively few of the Post Office’s branches are outreach branches. Bug 14 in the Bug Table, which Mr Coyne said was a bug but which Dr Worden described as “appears to be a system error with impact upon branch accounts” is entitled in the bug table “bureau discrepancies” and relates to foreign exchange transactions. Dr Worden’s exercise takes no account of what is, effectively, an admitted bug, and one that has an effect only upon foreign exchange transactions. If a branch conducted very few, if any, of these, it would not be affected by this bug. The chances of a branch being impacted by the bureau discrepancies bug depends upon whether it carries out foreign exchange transactions, and if so how many. That is not a bug striking all branches randomly. Indeed, rather tellingly for Dr Worden’s exercise, he assumes that any such bug would strike randomly across the whole branch network and have an equivalent random effect upon the branch accounts of branches that had performed foreign exchange transactions, and those that had not. This is plainly invalid. </p>

His analysis of likelihood of any bug impacting any SPM’s branch accounts would apply equally to any group of SPMs chosen at random from those SPMs with smaller branches. The only adjustment or account taken of the claimant SPMs’ particular characteristics is that they are, generally, from smaller branches, and for this Dr Worden applies what he calls a scaling factor.

The way this would be expressed in statistical terms is that the claimant SPMs do not accurately represent the population of SPMs as a whole (or even the population of SPMs who had smaller branches). The claimants are essentially self-selected, from those who believe they have experienced shortfalls and discrepancies in their accounts from the impact of bugs, errors and defects, and who have been prepared to join the litigation.

He attempts to deal with this by considering whether there is any “special property” of the claimants’ branches that makes them more susceptible to bugs, and concluded (at paragraph 622 of his report) that there is not. This is to approach the matter somewhat backwards, in my judgment. The experts are agreed that there were 3 million sets of branch accounts in the life of Horizon. The number of sets of branch accounts of which complaint is made in this litigation is a small (even perhaps tiny) proportion of that 3 million.

The Horizon system is, whether under Legacy Horizon or Horizon Online, the method by which the Branch Trading Statement or BTS is produced for an individual SPM’s branch Post Office. The BTS is the accounting mechanism under either the SPMC or NTC (the two different types of contracts used by the Post Office for SPMs during the period from 2000 onwards, explained in detail in Judgment (No.3) on the Common Issues). It was the common intention of the parties that the Horizon system would be used for the creation and recording of accurate information regarding all transactions performed in the branch which would be used for the production of the Branch Trading Statement for that branch. This means that at the end of each branch trading period, the BTS will (or should) provide a statement of the branch activity, which includes whether the accounts are in balance (which is where the cash and stock in the branch matches the Horizon system’s records of what should be there) or whether there is a discrepancy. If there is a discrepancy and it is a shortfall, the contractual terms of the SPMC and the NTC require the SPM to “make good” the shortfall, which means pay the money to the Post Office. The other alternative for an SPM is to “settle centrally”, which means seek time to pay. If the Post Office agrees, the shortfall can be paid over 12 months by deduction from the SPM’s remuneration.

Analysis and resolution of the correct and true situation of the branch accounts between the Post Office and the SPM for the trading period in question does not depend upon whether, in all the other millions of branch accounts, there was no such incidence of bug X. The correct analytical approach in my judgment is to consider the branch activity for that branch for that period; consider the evidence both for and against (1) the existence of bug X and (2) the likely cause of the discrepancy, bearing in mind both the burden and standard of proof; make findings on the cause of the discrepancy; and then apply those findings. Expert IT evidence of most assistance in that exercise would be whether or not bug X exists or existed, and what were its effects.

Mr Godeseth accepted that the Dalmellington bug had probably been present in the system from 2010 until it was discovered in 2015. Dr Worden’s analysis would lead to the conclusion that it was overwhelmingly unlikely that it had affected branch accounts during that period. But all the evidence is that this bug <span style="font-style:italic">did</span> affect branch accounts. It is correct that the Post Office relies upon the correction of known and identified discrepancies by means of the later issuing of TCs – a human measure which in my judgment is outside the definition of Horizon - but even putting that to one side, during this 5 year period branch accounts were actually affected. The existence of the bug was not known about for 5 years before it was even discovered. This round of the group litigation is to make findings on the Horizon system and whether there are any, or many, or no, other such bugs, errors and defects in the Horizon system similar to this one, or with similar detrimental effects. The conclusion of Dr Worden’s section 8 exercise is that it was overwhelmingly unlikely that any of the claimants’ branch accounts were affected by any Horizon bugs. This must include a conclusion that the Dalmellington bug cannot have affected any of the claimants’ accounts. This means that he must assume that Fujitsu were 100% successful in tracking down all incidents of the Dalmellington bug, and that any claimant SPMs who report symptoms the same as the Dalmellington bug and who had an outreach branch are either wrong, or making it up. These assumptions are ones that cannot sensibly be made, in my judgment.  </p>

There are agreed to have been over 3 million sets of branch accounts over the life of Horizon, and approximately 6 million transactions every day across the whole Post Office branch network. There are fewer than 600 individual claimants, with the total value of accounting discrepancies over a 17 year period, amounting to only £18 million. As a proportion of the value of the Post Office network business over that period, and as a proportion of the total number of transactions, the number of transactions which underpin the claimants’ case is exceedingly small in percentage terms. </p>

This was recognised, as a SPM would not need both bugs to strike in order to experience an impact on branch accounts, only one would be sufficient. The principle of additivity is a fundamental principle that if the event whose probability is sought can be represented as the union of several other events that have no outcomes in common, then the probability of the union is the sum of the probabilities of the individual events making up the union. However, regardless of this, the point was neither put nor explored in any detail, and the outcome in any event depends upon how the events, and the union, are defined. The situation is further complicated by the fact that depending upon the nature of how “the bug” was defined, to impact upon branch accounts, this could be either Bug A or Bug B (in Dr Worden’s example) independently, or in conjunction. The PEAKs show that sometimes branch accounts would be impacted by a combination of rare circumstances. Such bugs may, but would not necessarily, have to occur at the same time. If independently able to impact branch accounts, they would simply have to occur at any time during the 4 week branch trading period. I refer to this matter for three reasons. Firstly, to demonstrate that probability theory only takes one so far in this case, and that is not very far; secondly, to explain that depending upon how one defines “event” and the intersection (or joint probability) of both or either occurrence, one can arrive at different results; and thirdly, to demonstrate that there were numerous flaws and/or difficulties with Dr Worden’s approach, not all of which were put, but which in my judgment undermine the validity of his exercise. This point about the probability calculation of two bugs striking a branch is not, however, not the main reason (or indeed, any reason) why I have rejected his analysis. The probability calculation for two bugs occurring in one month is not a central element of the statistical exercise he performed; only one bug would be needed in any one branch trading period for it to affect those monthly branch accounts. I have explained this in order to illustrate that it depends upon how one defines the impact of a bug, and chooses to assess its probability, that one can end up with an answer that rather suits the way the question is initially posed.  </p>

I have found that the evidence of Mr Godeseth was somewhat different, at the end of his cross-examination, than how it had been presented in his three witness statements. Litigation cannot go on endlessly. For the Horizon Issues trial, evidence of fact and expert evidence were both ordered, and findings can only be made by the court in its judgments that resolve the disputes of fact. Disputes of fact in the evidence for the Horizon Issues will be resolved in the Horizon Issues judgment, namely this one. This is entirely conventional. If an expert chooses to prepare his or her evidence on the basis that one side’s evidence is true – which Dr Worden did in his reports, in respect of the party instructing him, namely the Post Office – they are not entitled to serve further expert evidence and wholly amend their opinions if that evidence is not accepted by the court. Dr Worden must have known this. There was going to be no opportunity for him “to come back and say what’s the impact”.  </p>

Firstly, he could have provided alternative expert evidence and opinion, were the written evidence of Mr Godeseth and the information coming from Mr Jenkins to be rejected. Secondly, he should have taken the claimants’ evidence into account, because there is no basis for an assumption that it was not relevant to the Horizon Issues which his expert evidence was the subject of. It is entirely normal for experts to provide alternatives of their opinion, depending upon which party’s evidence is accepted.  Thirdly, the “method”, such as it is, demonstrated in the spreadsheets simply cannot be “re-done” to take account of findings that the assumptions were incorrect. The invalid and unjustified assumptions lead, in my judgment, to the inescapable conclusion that the whole methodology is flawed. No amount of “re-doing” of the calculations by the court can remedy that. </p>

The evidence was, very plainly, the witness statement saying that it could be done, and he chose to disregard it. This is just a more sophisticated way of stating the witness statement was not true. He described this as his being “balanced and fair”. I disagree with that description: it was not balanced, and it was not fair. He also said that there were many, many occasions when he had “tried not only to be fair to the claimants but to be biased in my numerical estimates in favour of the claimants”. I disagree with that too. Firstly, it is no answer to a criticism that an expert has taken a partisan view of evidence of fact and ignored one side’s factual account, to say that this has been effectively cancelled out by numerical assumptions elsewhere in different parts of the report. Secondly, I do not accept that Dr Worden was performing numerical calculations assuming in the claimants’ favour in any event, when one assesses the Section 8 exercise as a whole. The assumptions he made were very much not in the claimants’ favour at all. Minor adjustments to numerical figures in an exercise based on assumptions specifically unfavourable to one group does not either make the result “biased” in favour of that group, or cancel out the unfavourable assumptions. Further, the court requires an independent approach from an expert at all stages of their analysis, not a raft of slanted analyses, either one way and/or the other, with the hope (or here, an assertion) that they will eventually cancel each other out. For the avoidance of doubt, here they do not. </p>

I use them in this judgment for consistency, but their use should not be taken to be a suggestion or acceptance that the acronyms are industry norms; the majority are not. The actual term countermeasures suggests that these consist of measures present in the Horizon system which have the effect of countering something else (bugs, errors or defects, issues that would have an adverse impact on robustness) and thereby improving the robustness of the Horizon system as defined. The Horizon system had an agreed definition for the purpose of the list of Horizon Issues which was as follows: “the Horizon System” shall for the purposes of this list of issues mean the Horizon computer system hardware and software, communications equipment in branch and central data centres where records of transactions made in branch were processed”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">This can be seen from the following. Transactional Integrity and database recovery or TIN is undoubtedly a countermeasure within the Horizon system. The explanation given by Dr Worden in his summary table for this is “database management systems provide many facilities so that numerous kinds of failure cannot leave the data in an inconsistent, unusable state, or lose any data that have been previously stored.” This means if there is a failure, which may happen in a variety of different ways, the data should not be left in an inconsistent or unstable state, or be lost. The database management system accomplishes this in a variety of ways. Indeed, Dr Worden himself, with his extensive experience of database management, has particular familiarity with this. He designed and developed one of the first relational database management systems; it is an essential requirement in such a system that data should not be capable of being left in an inconsistent or unstable state. The reliability of any database relies upon reliability of the data within that database.  </p>

(We will elaborate on what we mean by "a correct state of the database" in the next section.) And the underlying principle on which such recovery is based is quite simple, and can be summed up in one word: redundancy. (Redundancy, that is, at the physical level; we do not want such redundancy to show through to the logical level, naturally, for reasons discussed in detail elsewhere in this book.) In other words, the way to make sure the database is recoverable is to make sure that any piece of information it contains can be reconstructed from some other information stored, redundantly, somewhere else in the system. </p>

Such cancellations can be made by what Dr Worden calls the operator (the SPM or their assistant) but cancellations can – and the factual evidence shows this occurred – be caused by outages, power cuts and other incidents. A lay person might say that a system has “crashed", or one of the terms used in the factual evidence in this trial was “system outage”.  </p>

An example of this is defensive programming or DEP. Since programming is at the heart of any software – indeed, programming creates the software itself – the way that programs are originally written (what could be called the programming of the system) constitutes the very system itself. DEP was described by Dr Worden in the following way in his table summary: “software is divided into small self-contained modules, which do not assume that other modules are correct, but defend themselves by checking their inputs and raising alerts early.” A better description was given elsewhere in his report where he stated that DEP was “where small parts of a program are written to assume that other parts of the program may be in error and are written to always check their inputs for the presence of errors.” In other words, part of a program does not start from the point of assuming that all inputs are without error; they check for the presence of errors first (in a variety of ways) before moving to other aspects of the program.  </p>

Often this would take many months. Depending upon the outcome of the investigations, matters would sometimes be reported onwards to Development for a software fix. The investigation by the personnel at 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> level support (of whom, almost invariably, there would be more than one) and also the software writer in the Development section, were done by personnel who are plainly not part of the Horizon system as designed. They are human beings who are undertaking certain tasks. In fact, a software fix designed to prevent a problem re-occurring would change the Horizon system when that fix was introduced in live, a term meaning added to the software within the system. It is, in my judgment, illogical to treat such a process in the same way as either defensive programming (DEP) or transactional integrity (TIN). </p>

Even the Post Office’s own witnesses of fact did not deal with the process of issuing transaction corrections, because the Post Office’s solicitor correctly took the view that transaction corrections were not part of the Horizon Issues and were outside the scope of the Horizon Issues trial. </p>

I find that the level of upheld complaints in TCs, and the value of erroneously issued TCs, is necessary in order to assess the quality of the Post Office back office processes to deal with discrepancies. That data was simply not kept, according to the Post Office witnesses. Further, Mr Coyne’s analysis showed that 77% of disputed Santander TCS were upheld.

I do not consider that a ratio of approximately 1 in 4 TCs being incorrectly issued can be properly described as the process “working well”, particularly as each TC would have a direct impact upon branch accounts. In my judgment, for the process of issuing TCs to be “working well”, the level of accuracy required would be far higher than 77%, and in excess of 90% (if not in the high 90s as a percentage) at the very least. Nor do I consider that to be unrealistically or unachievably high, given TCs impact upon branch accounts, the accuracy of which is required to be very high, and expected by the Post Office to be such that shortfalls in branch accounts have to be paid by the SPMs.  </p>

His approach to countermeasures is not a sensible one; he mixed up both genuine countermeasures such as TIN; design functions such as DEP; and manual corrections as well, and treated them all in the same way.

Another criticism of Dr Worden’s approach to countermeasures relates to one which Dr Worden described in his paragraph 463 as being “one of the most important countermeasures in Horizon”, and that is manual inspection of data. I do not see how this can be a countermeasure in Horizon as defined at all. Dr Worden’s summary states that “Any large business IT system is used by many people, who view its outputs and check them against each other for consistency, and against their own knowledge of the business. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Subpostmasters,</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">watching their branch accounts, were a key component of this</span>.” (emphasis added) </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The inherent illogicality in this is, in my judgment, obvious. SPMs, viewing their own branch accounts, which are created or are part of the Horizon system, cannot in my judgment be included as a countermeasure in the Horizon system (even if one ignores entirely the definition of the Horizon system in the Horizon Issues). The fact that a SPM can or may notice that (say) their accounts are (as the SPM sees it) wrong, or that there is discrepancy of some thousands of pounds (or more, or less) in relation to a transaction that they may not recognise, cannot sensibly be described as a countermeasure in Horizon in the way that Dr Worden does. As Mr Coyne explained, this “assumes that the person scrutinising the data is able to identify the correct source of data to be relied upon, in order to rule out what may or may not be erroneous in the first instance. Additionally, its utility as a countermeasure is heavily reliant upon the person scrutinising the data already knowing there is an issue that requires data inspection.” It also obviously relies upon a human element, which necessarily depends upon the skills or knowledge of the person. When this is put with the lack of notification to SPMs generally by Fujitsu and/or the Post Office of existing bugs (and what the effect of those bugs was), which was a feature of the evidence, it can be seen that there is no basis for including this in any list of such measures.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The effect of some, but not all, of the bugs might be susceptible to being noticed in this way, for example if there were a “doubled up” transaction in the same financial figure at the same time – the SPM might remember that a customer performed a single transaction in the way that Mr Patny did with MoneyGram as set out at [135] above. But that would depend both upon the type of bug, the type of transaction, the memory of the SPM and also crucially the amount. Another bug, Dalmellington, had some noticeable effects as the evidence in this case shows. Other impacts of other bugs would not be noticed in the same way. This shows the random nature of what Dr Worden describes as a countermeasure. In my judgment, Dr Worden was quite wrong to include this as a countermeasure. I find that something that is a “manual corrective fix” cannot sensibly be described as a Horizon countermeasure.  </p>

Examples of this are regression testing, user testing and testing of edge cases. Dr Worden relied upon what Mr Membury in particular had given evidence about in his statement. I have summarised Mr Membury’s evidence at [500] to [507] above, including his serious omissions regarding E&amp;Y and their concerns.

This was most obvious in respect of his treatment of Mr Roll, but also occurred in respect of the claimants’ evidence of individual experiences of events caused by Horizon. No independent expert should do this. One example of this was the important issue of whether Fujitsu could inject transactions under Legacy Horizon without the SPM in question being aware of this. Dr Worden stated that he had “established” that these would be visible to SPMs. Mr Roll’s evidence of fact was directly to the contrary. Dr Worden had dealt with this by stating “So, in my opinion, Mr Roll could not have made these changes to branch accounts “without the Subpostmaster knowing”. In other words, in this expert’s opinion, the evidence of a witness of fact (and a very important one at that) was simply not correct in fact.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">However, in this case, even the Fujitsu witnesses eventually accepted (but prior to the trial, in their supplementary witness statements) that this <span style="font-style:italic">had</span> been possible, and that Mr Roll had been correct. Dr Worden’ supplementary report dealt with this by stating that there was a lack of understanding or clarity on this point. He stated that “it seems to me that I require further factual information before I can comment on this evidence” and also that “Mr Rolls new evidence does not cause me to alter the opinion expressed at paragraph 1119 of my first report, when commenting on Mr Roll’s first witness statement, that he could not alter branch accounts without the Subpostmaster knowing”. His first opinion in paragraph 1119 was wrong, and in my judgment obviously wrong, and this should have been unequivocally corrected both in his 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> report and also in his cross-examination. The extract of this in [843] above makes it clear that he did not accept that.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The sequence is therefore as follows. Mr Roll gave written evidence he had done something, and Fujitsu gave written evidence this was not possible. Dr Worden “established” that Mr Roll could not have done what he said he had done, and plainly preferred the Fujitsu evidence. He therefore adopted a position of which party’s evidence of fact was to be preferred. More factual evidence was then served and Fujitsu witnesses accepted this could be done, in contradiction to their earlier evidence. Dr Worden declined to “comment on this evidence” and remained of the view that Mr Roll could not have done that which he said he had done – in other words, his factual evidence was incorrect.  </p>

Injection of transactions remotely into Legacy Horizon was an important factual point in this litigation, and indeed in the whole history of the ongoing lengthy dispute between the Post Office and the claimant SPMs. Further, in his expert declaration, Dr Worden went wider than the standard wording and specifically referred to an earlier decision in another case. He stated at paragraph 1194 the following: </p>

I had stated in that judgment at [74] that “An expert's role is not to decide issues of fact themselves, and choose what facts to believe and what not to believe”. Specific reference was made by Dr Worden to this judgment in his expert declaration. It might therefore be thought that the requirement upon him as an independent expert <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> to take a view on which factual evidence he preferred was, or should have been, at the forefront of his consideration. In any event, such an approach by the court to how experts should approach evidence of fact is not particularly ground-breaking. Independence requires an objective consideration by an expert of both sides of the factual evidence. It is the court’s role, not that of an expert, to decide which evidence of fact is accepted and which is not. Notwithstanding this, Dr Worden plainly accepted the initial factual evidence of Fujitsu and rejected the factual evidence of Mr Roll. Then when Mr Parker accepted Mr Roll’s account, Dr Worden still would not do so. He was quite wrong to do this on both occasions. </p>

This was so heavily based on assumptions that were either not valid, or conceptually flawed, that his conclusions were not valid either. I would go further – the whole process he adopted so far as his statistical exercise was concerned was both invalid and of no evidential value.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">He also relied – in my judgment heavily - upon information from Mr Jenkins. Mr Jenkins was not even identified as one of his sources of information in section 1.3 of his first report, headed “Sources of information”. This means that Dr Worden was given access to information that was not made available to his opposite number, contrary to the point at (1) above in [878] above. Although there were some references throughout the text of the report to Mr Jenkins, Dr Worden did not routinely identify where he had relied upon Mr Jenkins. He also provided a great deal more information about this contact with Mr Jenkins in his oral evidence than he did in his written reports. In his cross-examination, he identified, when asked about a passage, that he had obtained that information from Mr Jenkins, which plainly took place before the first report was served as he accepted on his first day in the witness box it was “a year ago”. This was not clear in the report itself. One example of this was paragraph 654.2, where the report was dealing with the effect of the Receipts/Payments Mismatch bug, and Dr Worden stated “Because the operation involved was apparently not a double-entry operation on the BRDB, the countermeasure of checking the double-entry constraint DEA did not catch it”. This information came from Mr Jenkins, but until Dr Worden was asked this in crossexamination, no reader would be able to tell this. The involvement of Mr Jenkins in this explanation in his report was simply hidden. Nowhere was there a note or summary of all the information that had been given to Dr Worden by Mr Jenkins. In this litigation in particular, and given the involvement of and information provided by Mr Jenkins, who knew so much about the Horizon system, such a note or summary was, in my judgment, essential. This was particularly important given there was no witness statement from Mr Jenkins. Dr Worden had been provided with, and had used, information from Mr Jenkins in addition to the witness statements served by the parties.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Dr Worden also introduced the concept of “lasting” and “transient” effect of bugs or defects on branch accounts. There was no such distinction in the Horizon Issues themselves. A further difficulty with this approach is that Dr Worden confirmed that even an impact on branch accounts that was corrected several months later by a TC would, so far as he was concerned, be of “transient” impact. A different way of stating the same concept is that, so far as he was concerned, “transient” could be of quite long effect. Given TCs are corrections generated outwith the Horizon system and are effectively corrective actions issued by the Post Office itself, this moved his consideration away from the generic Horizon Issues into the realm of the efficacy of the Post Office business systems as a whole, not only including Horizon but their human processes too. That is not what the Horizon Issues were concerned with, and he frankly admitted in his cross-examination that had he not done this, his opinion evidence would have been rather different. Mr Coyne did not use lasting and transient effect, and correctly addressed the actual Horizon Issues themselves, as drafted and agreed by the parties and as approved by the court. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Dr Worden also adopted this different approach to impact upon branch accounts.

This ignored the word “potential” in the Horizon Issues themselves. In my judgment, that was a wholly unhelpful approach, and also had the effect of minimising or reducing the number of bugs that have an impact upon branch accounts. This can be demonstrated by considering the following hypothetical example.  </p>

This occurs, and the SPM of that branch contacts the helpline and goes through to SSC, who create a PEAK and identify this and after a few weeks of investigation, work out that this is an unexplained software bug which they have not come across before. A KEL is therefore also created identifying H. Future incidents of H occurring would (or </p>

Fujitsu report to the Post Office about the existence of H, which they have now discovered, and understand is a software bug. The Post Office accept that the sum of £999.99 has arisen in the branch accounts as a result of H and issue a TC to the branch in that sum, to correct the unexplained loss in that sum in the branch accounts. If one were to use Dr Worden’s interpretation of impact upon branch accounts, by reason of the issue of the TC, H would <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> be a bug, error or defect with an impact upon branch accounts.

Mr Coyne’s far more vigorous and thorough exercise relied far less on the process of extrapolation inherent in Dr Worden’s approach, who was inevitably basing his opinion on a far smaller sample than Mr Coyne. Given the breadth of the resources being deployed by the Post Office in conducting this case, I find it difficult to understand why Dr Worden restricted his consideration of PEAKs and KELs in this way. However, I consider that the conclusions of Mr Coyne, based on the far more substantial consideration of these important documents, are more reliable than those of Dr Worden. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">This is not the correct, or conventional, use of the word “potential”. It also looks at the matter in reverse. In the context of the Horizon system, whether bugs, errors or defects in that system have, or had, the potential to impact branch accounts or transactions, should focus one’s attention upon the possible effect of those bugs, errors or defects. If, of course, a particular bug actually has had the effect of in fact impacting branch accounts, then by definition it must also have had the potential to do so. Actual effect is a sub-set of potential effect. It means impact upon branch accounts must have actually happened. However, potential effect does not require that impact to have actually occurred. The two terms are not synonymous. Dr Worden therefore moved away from the actual issues before the court, and approached a great deal of his evidence from the point of rather different issues, which he seemed to have narrowed down himself.

In that case, Mr Coyne had appeared as an expert and he was criticised by the judge for an unbalanced view, amongst other things. The judgment was handed down on 4 December 2018. The fact that he had been judicially criticised in that case was not specifically put to Mr Coyne. However, the substantive criticisms of him, that he gave unbalanced and selective evidence, and the other criticisms, were put to him, and he did not accept them. The point that he had been previously criticised in a judgment ought specifically to have been put by reference to that case, so that he could answer this point. However, in any event I have read (as invited in the Post Office’s submissions) the entire Scottish judgment, in which the evidence of Dr Hunt, Mr Coyne’s opposite number, was preferred to his evidence.

The Scottish judgment provides a full explanation of the shortcomings of his approach in that case. I have also taken this prior judicial criticism into account in weighing up his expert evidence in this trial. </p>

I have considered the criticisms of Mr Coyne with particular care in the light of this previous judicial criticism, even though I do not have the benefit of Mr Coyne’s explanation to the specific points arising out of that case. I do not find his evidence in the Horizon Issues trial suffers from the same deficiencies as Lord Bannatyne found in that earlier case. In particular, one of those criticisms in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">CGI</span>, that he had failed to consider material documents and matters, simply does not remotely apply here. He and his team had done an extraordinarily thorough job of examining many thousands of PEAKs and KELs, and many more than Dr Worden did. I do not find that Mr Coyne reversed his evidence, or switched, or that any of the other criticisms of him are made out. It may be that he has changed his approach as a result of his experience in that case or judgment, or there may be other reasons for it. However, I do not find the criticisms made of him to be made out in this case.  </p>

I reject the criticism that Mr Coyne’s evidence was given without having any sense of scale, context or balance. I conclude that Mr Coyne was impartial in his evidence in the Horizon Issues trial, and was giving the court evidence that was entirely uninfluenced by the exigencies of litigation or the interests of the party who called him. I find that he was independent, and that his conclusions in this case on the Horizon Issues are reliable.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">There were some subjects upon which he became a little flustered in his crossexamination, for example on the final afternoon when he was taken to task for the entry in the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> Joint Experts’ Statement on an agreed passage where he and Dr Worden had agreed that “the number of distinct bugs, for which the experts have seen strong evidence of the bug causing a lasting discrepancy in branch accounts, is between 12 and 29”. That latter number had come from Mr Coyne and he wished to reduce the number, initially to 13 but then upon reflection to 21. Mr de Garr Robinson made a great deal of this, as one would expect of a skilled cross-examiner, but in reality it is a simple point, as I have explained above. It did show a change of position because the number of bugs changed as I have explained. However, it is easy to overestimate the degree to which making an error on figures in such circumstances does, or does not, represent a lack of reliability on the part of an expert who has performed a substantial body of work. It must be remembered that this was an agreed entry in an agreed Joint Statement that was 44 pages in length (the experts agreed four separate statements, running to 100 pages in total including appendix). I deal with the detailed analysis of each alleged bug in more detail in the Technical Appendix, but the fact that the number did not remain an immutable “29” in all circumstances is not, in my judgment, a point against Mr Coyne. His attempts to ensure the final number was correct was not as smooth as he might have liked, and it gave Mr de Garr Robinson an opportunity to deploy his forensic skill, but in reality it did not impact upon Mr Coyne’s reliability.  </p>

He had done a substantial amount of detailed analysis in his two reports, and the overall knowledge that the court had, at the conclusion of the crossexamination of both experts, was very much greater than it had been prior to the commencement of the Horizon Issues trial. Dr Worden discovered some bugs himself, bugs that neither the Post Office and/or Fujitsu either knew about, or had admitted the existence of, prior to Dr Worden’s involvement in the litigation. He also took a sensible and considered view of some elements of the documentation, the importance or relevance of which had not been admitted by the Post Office earlier in the litigation, such as the KELs. Some of the matters that were agreed by Dr Worden with Mr Coyne in the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> to 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Experts’ Joint Statements saved a considerable amount of court time.

In my judgment he took a partisan view of the evidence of fact of Mr Roll, which he should not have done, and he also seemed to be acutely aware of the Fujitsu position. For example, if there was a problem in Horizon that originated with Riposte, rather than part of the system written by Fujitsu, he was always enthusiastic to make clear this differentiation in Fujitsu’s favour. It was not relevant to the Horizon Issues whether bugs, errors and defects in Horizon were caused by Fujitsu or Riposte (provided by Escher, a separate company), or any other part of the system. These are all points that lead to the same conclusion, namely that in my judgment his expert evidence was not entirely independent of the Post Office’s and/or Fujitsu’s interests, and his conclusions were substantially less reliable than those of Mr Coyne. I do not know whether he had found himself subconsciously influenced by his discussion with Mr Jenkins or not, but regardless of the reason, his conclusions were not reliable and I reject them in favour of those of Mr Coyne. </p>

The actual text of that entry is the “Post Office does not consult the full audit data (unfiltered ARQ Data) before deciding how to handle discrepancies and issuing Transaction Corrections.” Regardless of this agreement, it is obvious on the factual evidence that the Post Office does not do so. Indeed, throughout both the Common Issues trial and the Horizon Issues trial, it has been increasingly obvious that the Post Office uses sources <span style="font-style:italic">other than</span> the audit data when it is challenging SPMs about what they have actually done in their branch Post Offices. Various terms are used for the audit data. The 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> Joint Statement uses “full audit data” and “unfiltered ARQ Data”.

That is the whole point of audit data. However, it is written (or in other words, recorded) so that it can subsequently be read, and the second part of this concept, “Read Many”, means that it can be read many times. The audit data is there, in my judgment, so that it can be consulted when required.

The management information is confusing, contradictory, has been shown to be wrong and requires numerous assumptions or a “take it from me” type of approach on the part of a questioner. It is rarely agreed what that management data shows. The audit data, by its very nature, will be far superior and the best evidence available of what has occurred on Horizon. It should be consulted in circumstances where there is a dispute between the Post Office and a SPM. </p>

Whether the lack of understanding on the part of Mrs Van Den Bogerd was widespread or not within the Post Office is unclear to me. It is however clear to me that Credence data does not in all circumstances record all keystrokes performed in branch by a SPM. The audit data does. </p>

The E&amp;Y review in March 2011 identified various issues with Credence, including weak change controls within the back-end of the systems which allowed Logica developers (the third-party provider) to move their own uncontrolled changes into the production environment, which included both Credence software code and the data within Credence used for what was called “audit evidence” but which has to be differentiated from what I am referring to audit records in the audit store. There was a lack of further documentation to approve fixes and patches applied to Credence outside of the release process, which meant that linking changes to issue tickets to record the original request for the bug fix was not possible. </p>

The numbers that were discussed were in the amount of hundreds of pounds per request. The parties could not agree on what these charges were, although it was accepted that there were a number each year that were either free, or the costs of which were included in the contract sum (depending upon which way one looks at this matter).

There are some contemporaneous references within Post Office documents suggesting this may have been a disincentive in some cases to raising ARQ requests of Fujitsu. Further, there are numerous references within Post Office documents (at a high level) of the very great cost to the Post Office of the Horizon system generally, that cost being paid to Fujitsu. Fujitsu were said in one document to see the contract with the Post Office as a “cash cow”.

Part of that very attractive commercial arrangement (attractive for Fujitsu) may be charges that Fujitsu is entitled contractually to raise for ARQ requests. Part of an attempt to reduce the expense of the contract by the Post Office may be a reluctance to raise such requests. Dr Worden described this document as “chiming” and said that “I have always had the impression from the governance structure and the documentation and so on that Fujitsu were not short of budget, really”.

There is little point in having audit data if it is not consulted in the circumstances that I have identified above. I appreciate that the audit data itself will not be immediately comprehensible to some SPMs. There may also be charges raised by Fujitsu in respect of such requests. However, neither of these are reasons for the failure to consult it. I also make no findings on whether Fujitsu are, or are not, entitled to raise charges and if so how much.

Because of the different way that the experts went about their tasks, it was not possible to consider in detail and track in Dr Worden’s reports any analysis and possible explanation of single incidents, and attribute that either to a specific bug, error or defect, or something else which was none of these things. The approach Dr Worden had adopted for his written evidence did not permit that, as he was (in a sense) working from the other end (overall reliability) back towards the beginning (individual experiences), in contrast to the approach of Mr Coyne. Dr Worden himself described his approach as “top down”. Mr Coyne, on the other hand, using PEAKs and KELs in particular, identified a great many specific incidents that Fujitsu had recorded, which plainly demonstrated the existence of numerous bugs. Indeed, some of the terms used by Fujitsu made it crystal clear that these were known to be bugs. One notable example is the expression used by Anne Chambers – “this bug has been around for years” – in February 2006. Dr Worden did engage with the detail of PEAKs both in the joint expert meetings and also in his oral evidence, and the final result is that by the end of the trial, the summary at the beginning of Appendix 2 of the Post Office closing submissions, was forced to accept the existence of a great many bugs in Horizon. The extent and nature of their impact was not agreed, but the Post Office could no longer deny their existence.  </p>

It was usually Ms Van Den Bogerd who, for the Pot Office, attempted to demonstrate that this was not what had occurred, often by means of assertions that if the SPMs had followed procedures properly, what they said happened, simply could not have happened. The Fujitsu witnesses gave some limited evidence of fact in relation to specific instances and some specific PEAKs and KELs. The Post Office’s counsel did their best to challenge the factual accounts that were given by the claimants. I have provided the relevant findings in respect of those matters above. I indicated at the Case Management Conference on 22 February 2018 that the Horizon Issues should be capable of resolution with limited, if any, evidence of fact. Both parties chose to submit factual witness statements and called factual evidence. The factual evidence submitted by both the parties was, in my judgment, limited as expected and required. With the exception of the matter to which I have already referred concerning the evidence of Mr McLachlan and Mr Henderson at the PTR, the extent of each party’s evidence of fact was not subject to challenge prior to commencement of the Horizon Issues trial.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The factual evidence of specific instances was of assistance in coming to conclusions on the Horizon Issues. Indeed, I found some of the factual evidence to be of great assistance. That of Mr Roll and Mr Godeseth was extremely useful. The latter, one of the Post Office’s main witnesses and the Chief Architect of Horizon, was sufficiently damaging to the Post Office’s case on the Horizon Issues that they were, essentially, forced almost to disavow him, and the Post Office’s closing submissions were highly critical of the accuracy of his evidence. As a further example only, Mr Latif gave evidence that he had performed certain basic routine steps to transfer the sum of £2,000 between terminals, and (in accounting terms) that sum had – to use his word – “disappeared” from the Horizon system. The Post Office evidence challenging this was from Mrs Van Den Bogerd, and essentially amounted to an assertion that if certain steps had been followed by him, this should not, or could not, have happened. That would be all well and good in an ideal theoretical world that did not pay any attention to reality, but it entirely ignores Mr Latif’s primary evidence of fact. I accept that primary evidence from the claimants’ witnesses in this trial as I have explained in Part D. Mr Latif had been a trainer trusted by the Post Office to train other SPMs, as explained at [98] above. Other references in the documents show both Romec engineers, and even Post Office auditors, being recorded in PEAKs as witnessing events supporting the type of occurrences that underpin the claimants’ case. These were ignored by those at Fujitsu tasked with completing these PEAKs, and conclusions are shown in those PEAKs being drawn by Fujitsu that flew in the face of what had occurred. Mr Latif’s experience is extraordinarily similar to the Dalmellington bug, which is numbered 4 in the Bug Table. Mr Latif did not operate core and outreach branches, therefore his experience is slightly different to what happened at Dalmellington. However, if one is to take an objective and sensible view of the evidence of a previously trusted SPM, whom the Post Office itself has used to train other SPMs for some years, who stated that he did something correctly and X occurred, then meeting that with a bare assertion that X simply cannot have happened is not particularly sensible, nor is it persuasive.  </p>

The findings that I have made, on the evidence in the Horizon Issues trial, show that the reality is rather different, and the existence of the bugs, errors and defects that I have found to exist do have the effect explained by Mr Coyne.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The approach that I have adopted to the evidence can be considered as follows. Firstly, to consider the factual evidence, the relevant contemporaneous documents, and applying the burden and standard of proof, reach evidential findings. I have considered the challenges to that evidence, and if the specific instances of factual witnesses explaining what they experienced could be explained (as the Post Office sought to do with some of the SPMs) by them simply not being reliable, remembering incorrectly, having been careless or even (for some) being criminal. I have also considered all of the Post Office’s factual evidence in this trial, the explanations of the Post Office’s witnesses, and reached my factual conclusions. I have considered the expert evidence on its merits, and then tested my conclusions against the evidence of fact that was adduced by both parties, and considered whether my judgment on the evidence of fact matched and supported, or contradicted, or in any way affected or influenced my conclusions on the expert evidence. In a sense this was to consider the factual evidence, and the expert evidence that I accepted and preferred, separately, and see if they both reached the same conclusion. Secondly, the evidence can also be approached in a different sequence. This is by firstly considering the specific factual evidence, and then considering the expert evidence, and only in the light of the conclusions on the factual evidence. Alternatively, one could simply decide the Horizon Issues on the expert evidence alone, although that would be far less preferable and would ignore entirely the important factual evidence of the Fujitsu witnesses, in particular Mr Godeseth. However, even if that third way were to be adopted, the same answers to the Horizon Issues would, in my judgment, be reached.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Whichever way is adopted, it must be remembered that any claimant can only ever have personal experience of one small element of the Horizon system on a number of occasions. The overview and historical performance of Horizon, both Legacy Horizon and Horizon Online, has to come from Fujitsu witnesses and the two experts. Dr Worden and Mr Coyne had far more of an overview of the life of the system, as did Mr Godeseth and Mr Parker. Mr Roll had experience of it in its early years, but his evidence was what led to the correct picture on remote access finally emerging. </p>

Mr Roll, Mr Godeseth, and even in his own way Mr Parker (though not in the way that Mr Parker himself would have intended) have all provided clear evidence of the problems with the Horizon system, the bugs, errors and defects within both Legacy Horizon and Horizon Online in its HNG-X form, the way that these problems were (or were not) dealt with, and the way that Fujitsu had powers which, until shortly before the trial started, Fujitsu sought to keep from the court, and may not even have fully disclosed to the Post Office. Because the extent of these powers was kept secret in this way, the Post Office finds itself now having made misleading public statements previously. If one looks back to an earlier case management hearing and reconsiders how Fujitsu, through the Post Office, sought to portray the contents and lack of importance and relevance of PEAKs and KELs, then it can be seen that there has been a pattern of considerable defensiveness over the Horizon System. There has certainly been a lack of transparency, and a lack of accuracy in description. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">I have explained above at [172] how the Post Office sought to draw a particularly glowing reference in Fujitsu’s favour from the evidence of Mr Roll in their closing submissions. The Post Office stated that from his evidence “….a clear picture emerged of Fujitsu as an organisation which was thorough, professional and conscientious and which took considerable care to ensure that matters were properly investigated and dealt with.” I have already stated that this is not a conclusion that can be drawn from the evidence of Mr Roll. Nor is it a conclusion that, in my judgment, can sensibly be drawn from the totality of the evidence taken together, both factual and expert, in the Horizon Issues trial. As an example, on too many occasions are there PEAKs that conclude at one point that user error cannot be to blame, only for a misleading closure code to be used for such a PEAK. Fujitsu personnel routinely refer in such documents to the known existence of bugs, without this (so far as the documents deployed in the trial are concerned) being communicated to the SPM in question in these terms. In places there is even debate at Fujitsu shown in the documents about whether the Post Office and/or SPMs should be told.  I do not see how a thorough, professional and conscientious organisation can have produced for disclosure in this litigation so many thousands of KELs during 2019 itself, both during and even after the trial. I reject that description; it is an inaccurate description of Fujitsu and/or its investigative motivation. </p>

HNG-A is a different matter, and the experts are agreed that it is far more robust than Horizon in earlier times. On the face of the relevant KEL, it is not possible to say whether the Drop and Go bug, number 28 in the Bug Table, which occurred in June 2017, was HNG-X or HNG-A. However, if the latter, it is one of only two such items in the Bug Table that relate to the existing version of the Horizon system.  </p>

I have already dealt with the first point, succinctness (obviously lacking in a judgment of this length). The second point is a requirement to consider all the evidence. I have done this, both for and against each of the cases advanced by both the claimants and the Post Office. I have not recited every single disputed fact as to do so would lead to an even longer judgment, and substantially delay production of this judgment well into 2020, and which would be contrary to the overriding objective. The third point is to identify the issues, consider the evidence in respect of the issues, and give reasons. For this trial, the Horizon Issues were agreed by the parties and approved by the court; the review of the evidence has been longer than is ideal, but I have considered it all, whether recited in this judgment, or the Technical Appendix, or not. The fourth point is somewhat salutary, namely that fairness requires that a judge should deal with apparently compelling evidence, where it exists, which is contrary to the conclusion which he proposes to reach. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">In my judgment, there is no such evidence advanced by the Post Office. It is pointless to speculate on how such compelling evidence might have been presented, if there had been any. The evidence that has been advanced for the individual occurrences, for example by Mrs Van Den Bogerd, can be seen once tested in cross-examination to amount to unfounded assertion and, sometimes, an expressed desire, even in 2019, to go away and do more research. This is not apparently compelling evidence to the contrary to my conclusions. Additionally, the time for further research by the Post Office is long past. The Post Office’s approach to evidence, even despite their considerable resources which are being liberally deployed at considerable cost, amounts to attack and disparagement of the claimants individually and collectively, together with the wholly unsatisfactory evidence of Fujitsu personnel such as Mr Parker. The Post Office evidence also includes a very high level overview of Horizon by its expert which amounts to little  more than a claim that it has worked quite or very well, most of the time. This is effectively what Dr Worden’s section 8 exercise consists of. Counsel for the Post Office at one point put to Mr Coyne that there was more likelihood of an SPM being hit by lightning than of having a bug, error or defect in Horizon cause a branch account loss in their branch. Mr Coyne did not agree with that, and neither do I. Indeed, such a point wholly ignores the enormous number of PEAKs that show that branch accounts were potentially impacted on a great many occasions.  </p>

These entries are at odds to the publicly stated position by Fujitsu both then and indeed later. In my judgment, the PEAKs and KELs deployed in the Horizon Issues trial, and there were very many, are consistent with my conclusions on the evidence and the answers that I have arrived at to the Horizon Issues.

That document also made it clear, because there are express entries to this effect, that outages might mean that the system would not deal with the matters sufficiently or accurately. A template message for SPMs is even included in the document for when this occurs, although that template message would not inform SPMs that outages would lead to inaccuracies. It is plain that outages would indeed lead to this, as this is mentioned in many places in the document, and acknowledged by its authors. This information was not however, based on the templates, to be given to SPMs.  </p>

The reference to the “lack of PO technical competence” is a concern, given [75] of the Technical Appendix which makes it clear that currently the Post Office can introduce new clients into Horizon without requiring Fujitsu input. The level of competence may of course have changed since 2016. The IT Strategy, which is referred to in this Update Decision Paper, and outlined that “the IT was not fit for purpose” and which was approved in July 2016 by the Post Office Board is, in my judgment, entirely consistent with my conclusions on the evidence. It is not, however, consistent with the Post Office’s response to the claimants’ pre-action letter, or the Defence in the group litigation, or the evidence adduced by the Post Office in the Horizon Issues trial. The Post Office’s solicitors’ response to the pre-action letter is dated 28 July 2016, very lengthy, and states that “the investigations to date have consistently pointed towards human error or dishonest conduct in branches as the most likely cause of shortfalls.” </p>

The Post Office has gone to great lengths over the years, and spent a great deal of time and a huge amount of public money, in defending the performance of Horizon. It is also the case that the Post Office must have been reliant on Fujitsu to a certain degree in terms of being provided with accurate information of a technical nature. That is not only obvious from the evidence, but has also been agreed by the experts in the 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> Joint Statement.

It became HNG-A in 2017, rather than HNG-X, and runs on a completely different Windows platform. The dates of the bugs in the Bug Table are (between them collectively) from 2000 to 2018, although there are far fewer in recent years. Having said that, some – such as Bug 8, Recovery Issues, and Bug 28, Drop and Go, have been experienced up to 2018 and 2017 respectively. The latter is a reference data bug and hence easily fixed.

It described the group litigation as long ago as its Opening Submissions in November 2018 for the Common Issues trial as representing “an existential threat” to that business. I do not consider that these answers to the Horizon Issues represent a significant threat to the Post Office’s entire business. Findings in this judgment as to the performance and robustness of Legacy Horizon from 2000 to 2010, and then of Horizon Online (in both its forms, HNG-X and HNG-A) from 2010 to 2018 are <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> findings on the Horizon system as it exists at the date of this judgment. These findings cannot be routinely applied to the way that HNG-A operates as at December 2019. It is agreed by the experts that the Horizon System in its HNGA form is now relatively robust. This judgment is a historical analysis of the Horizon System as it relates to the period in question in the group litigation, not a judgment upon Horizon HNG-A as it is today. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">I accept the claimants’ submissions that, in terms of likelihood, there was a significant and material risk on occasion of branch accounts being affected in the way alleged by the claimants by bugs, errors and defects. This is amply demonstrated by Dr Worden’s evidence. He accepted that there was strong evidence of at least 12 bugs causing a lasting discrepancy in branch accounts. This conclusion was reached even within the context of his unjustified creation of both “transient” and lasting impact, which limited his consideration of this, and is an approach which I have rejected. This number of bugs was very much smaller than the number contended for by Mr Coyne, and the number which I have found in Part E of the Technical Appendix, but even on that smaller number, was itself significant. Dr Worden’s reliance upon TCs as a countermeasure led to a failure by him to follow the agreed wording of the Horizon Issues, as TCs are not part of the Horizon system. Given TCs are part of the way that the Post Office corrects the branch accounts (and branch accounting statements) produced by Horizon, the only way that a fully precise answer could be given for the number of times such impacts have occurred would be if the figures were available for the years of operation of Horizon, demonstrating how many TCs each year had to be issued in respect of the effects on branch accounts of such discrepancies.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">However, those figures are simply not available for the majority of the life of both Legacy Horizon and Horizon Online. Nor is there any data centrally recorded by Fujitsu of the number of bugs, errors and defects which were discovered by dissatisfied SPMs reporting incidents to Fujitsu, with percentage outcomes of what the investigations by the SSC led to, in terms of result. Such data as there is, namely Mr Parker’s summation of closure codes of PEAKs, is wholly unreliable and I have rejected it. Nor are the closure codes that were used by Fujitsu accurate in any event. The evidence of fact was that full and accurate records of this nature are simply not kept by Fujitsu. Had they been, both experts could (and probably would) have used such data as a starting point for their investigations. The sheer scale of the number of TCs issued by the Post Office each year – which is over one hundred thousand for many of the years that are the subject of the group litigation – supports my conclusion that there was a significant and material risk of inaccuracy in branch accounts as a result of bugs, errors and defects in the Horizon System (both Legacy Horizon and HNG-X).  </p>

Indeed, the evidence showed that some bugs lay undiscovered in the Horizon system for years. This issue is very easy, therefore, to answer. The correct answer is very short. The answer to Issue 12 is “No, the Horizon system did not alert SPMs”. The second part of the issue does not therefore arise. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Answer: This issue or question is in two parts. I shall deal with them sequentially. The first is the extent and in what respects the Horizon system is “robust”. The experts are agreed that HNG-A is relatively robust, and I have found that the system as it is in 2019 is far more robust than it was prior to 2017. The Technical Appendix in general, and [444] of that in particular, should be consulted for a more complete answer on robustness. However, the Horizon Issues considered the whole life of the system from 2000 to date. In summary terms only, Legacy Horizon was not remotely robust. The number, extent and type of impact of the numerous bugs, errors and defects that I have found in Legacy Horizon makes this clear. Further, Dr Worden considered that TCs were an essential countermeasure. If TCs are excluded from consideration of the Horizon system, which they must be, then the answer becomes even more stark, even on the evidence of the Post Office’s own expert. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">HNG-X, the first iteration of Horizon Online, was slightly more robust than Legacy Horizon, but still had a significant number of bugs, errors and defects. This was particularly so in the years 2010 to 2015, but also after that. This is clearly demonstrated from the findings in the Technical Appendix. The functionality of </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Legacy Horizon was not therefore materially improved when the system moved to the online version, although one of the major differences between Legacy Horizon and HNG-X was the former’s use of Riposte (which was not used at all in HNG-X). I find that the robustness of HNG-X was questionable and did not justify the confidence routinely stated by the Post Office (prior to February 2017) in its accuracy. HNG-A is far more robust than either of the previous two iterations of the system. I have taken into account, in reaching these conclusions, not only the evidence of bugs, errors and defects, but also the lack of records or logs at Fujitsu over time over the use and controls of the powerful access roles permitted to Fujitsu personnel. This deficiency in reporting and controls seems to have been corrected in about 2017. This adds to my conclusion (and that of the experts) that HNG-A is more robust than HNG-X. As the experts agreed, this increase in robustness has, in part, developed from Post Office discovering bugs, errors and defects in live use and then applying fixes and improving monitoring. This is important, as it means that the robustness today of HNG-A cannot be relied upon by the Post Office in justifying, or being equated to, robustness in HNG-X. The same point applies to HNG-X and Legacy Horizon.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">I accept Mr Coyne’s evidence that there are far more TCs than expected even now, compared with comparable systems in the banking and finance sectors. However, it may be that this is the only way in which it can now sensibly be operated. TCs are outside the scope of the definition of the Horizon system in any event. The experts are agreed that HNG-A is robust, and far better than it was in either its Legacy Horizon or HNG-X form.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Turning to the second part of the issue, namely to what extent and in what respects is the Horizon system extremely unlikely to be the cause of shortfalls in branches. I accept that this presupposes a shortfall in a branch, and then requires consideration of whether Horizon is extremely unlikely to be cause of that shortfall. By shortfall, this issue means an unexplained discrepancy of the type explained by the claimants’ witnesses, and also recorded in numerous PEAKs. In my judgment, there is a material risk that such a shortfall in a branch’s accounts was caused by the Horizon system during the years when both Legacy Horizon and HNG-X were in use, which is 2000 to 2010 and 2010 to 2017 respectively. For each of those iterations of the system, the Horizon system was therefore not “extremely unlikely” to be the cause of shortfalls in branches, as contended for by the Post Office. I realise that is a double negative, but I consider wording the answers as closely as possible to the agreed issues is likely to be of greater assistance to the parties.  </p>

It was also agreed that reference data is critical to the operation of Horizon. I have explained in the Technical Appendix what reference data is, and the important part it plays both in the software and operation of the system. It is agreed by the experts that errors in reference data have led to discrepancies in branch accounts. It has also been agreed by the experts that errors in third-party data have led to discrepancies in branch accounts. The Post Office does not have control over errors in third-party data, but given these have an impact upon branch accounts, unless they are corrected, then those errors will also have an adverse effect upon a SPM’s branch accounts.  </p>

The experts’ agreement on reconciliation states inter alia that “Reconciliation between transactions recorded on Horizon and transactions recorded by Post Office's clients is largely automated. Detected discrepancies were subject to manual corrective fixes and/or the issue of Transaction Corrections/Error Notices to the” SPMs. What this means is that if the data in Horizon was wrong (due to bugs, errors or defects within Horizon) and did not reconcile with third-party data, then “manual corrective fixes” and the issuing of TCs would be undertaken, which would not be automatic. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Answer: The experts were agreed that there were many measures and controls within Horizon that existed to prevent, detect, identify report or reduce the risk of varying errors. However, the experts were also agreed that whilst Horizon contains measures and controls for detecting system integrity concerns, these automatic mechanisms have been shown to have failed in the past. The experts did not agree as to the ‘extent’ of prevention, detection, identification, reporting or risk reduction that the automatic and manual control measures delivered. There were numerous specific matters explored in some detail in the trial that clearly demonstrated such failures, such as the Callendar Square bug, the Receipts and Payments Mismatch bug, gaps and duplicates in entries in the audit store, keying and mis-keying errors (which were referred to in different PEAKs) and fixes which introduced other issues. The doubling of the foreign currency discrepancy that was put to Mr Godeseth was a specifically stark example, even though Fujitsu – inexplicably in my judgment – chose to attribute this to user error.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Answer: This issue is substantially agreed. The Post Office had access to data and systems that were not available to SPMs. The role of the Transaction Processing System (or TPS) is to gather the transactions taking place in the branches, and to pass them on both to Horizon’s back-end systems such as APS and DRS. These would also be passed on to other IT systems in the Post Office, such as Credence and a succession of systems based on SAP, which have finally culminated in what is called POLSAP. The Post Office therefore has a range of Horizon reports and its own management information systems (MIS). Dr Worden stated that he expected the MIS to include analytical facilities which were not required by, and so were not available to, Subpostmasters. None of this was controversial by the end of the trial, or in issue between the experts.  </p>

The Post Office could not simply access such audit data itself without recourse to Fujitsu, who had a charging structure in place in respect of such requests. </p>

Credence does not provide this. I also consider that although the Post Office did have access to “the causes of alleged shortfalls in branches, including whether they were caused by bugs, errors and/or defects in the Horizon system”, this had to be obtained through Fujitsu. This should be recorded for completeness. The evidence does not show the Post Office IT department either being capable of investigating directly itself, or if it was capable of doing so, actually undertaking this. All investigations recorded in PEAKs and KELs show that Fujitsu did this. The terms of the experts’ agreement in this respect was that the Post Office was “reliant upon Fujitsu for diagnosis of whether the occurrence of shortfalls was caused by bugs/errors or defects within the Horizon system.” I find that the Post Office plainly was reliant upon Fujitsu in this way.  </p>

The experts were not aware of these contractual findings when they reached any of their expert agreements, as that judgment was not provided even in draft until just before the Horizon Issues trial started. It was handed down formally at the end of the first week of factual evidence. It is of interest, I consider, that the two experts considered at least the essence of one of the implied terms (although not in contractual terms) in their agreement that “identification of the causes of apparent or alleged discrepancies required the co-operation of PO staff and SPMs”. Co-operation is an important part of any investigation, as it is an important part of the contractual relationship between the Post Office and SPMs. </p>

They also had access to transaction logs that would show individual transactions, and event logs, but these were only available for a few weeks (initially this was for 6 weeks or 42 days, then this changed to 60 days). It was possible for a SPM to print these out on paper till rolls. There was evidence in the Common Issues trial from both claimant SPMs and Post Office witnesses about how unwieldy and non-user friendly this was. Indeed, in that earlier trial one of the Post Office witnesses used the size of the Super Court in the Rolls Building (where both the Common Issues trial and the Horizon Issues trial took place) graphically to demonstrate how long such a till roll would be even just for a day in a busy branch. </p>

However, it could only be done by someone who was physically present in the branch, as that is the only way Global User could be used by the Post Office. The answer therefore for the Post Office is “yes” only in respect of that part (relating to injecting transactions) of (i)(a) (b) and (c). With that exception, the answer for the Post Office is “no” to the other eight permutations. The qualifying statement has to be made that whoever at the Post Office was exercising Global User rights would have to be physically present in the branch. This would therefore be likely to mean that a SPM or their assistant would at least know someone was in their branch doing something in terms of access to their branch accounts. A description of “Global User” is provided at [674] above.

This tool enabled Fujitsu specifically to insert a transaction into branch accounts. The one documented occasion of its use was done with the consent of the SPM in question. However, in my judgment, this issue was a sideshow. This is because the design intent in the Low Level Design document in relation to this tool had plainly been overtaken, over time, as the numerous other times it was used showed, based on the messages in fact inserted.

There were permission controls, but the roles were very wide and in my judgment they were not controlled. This included but is not limited to the lack of any proper logs. Although at an earlier stage in the trial, the Balancing Transaction tool was focused upon, it emerged that there were other roles and tools available to Fujitsu in addition to the Balancing Transaction tool which enabled Fujitsu to achieve the same result, namely injection and alteration of transaction data. Indeed, not only were these roles (such as APPSUP and the other roles identified in the answer to Issue 10 above)  more powerful, but they were widely available and in my judgment effectively unaudited. The whole of SSC had the APPSUP role for many years, and internal Fujitsu documents recorded that they were not supposed to have that role. There were a large number of personnel within SSC. Whilst some Privileged User Logs do exist, these logs did not exist prior to 2009 at all. Prior to July 2015, they only recorded when a user logged on and logged off, with no recording of what they were doing. This is a plainly inadequate record. Even after July 2015, the experts agree that such logs are not a useful source of evidence about remote access, due to their content (more accurately, this should be their lack of content). These deficiencies in the control environment were identified as long ago as before the audit report by E&amp;Y in 2011, such that the deficiencies were recorded as being in existence in 2011. Even so, this was not promptly corrected. </p>

The lack of control of these roles, the recording of access, the deficiencies in the logs, and the concerns expressed by E&amp;Y, demonstrate in my judgment an inadequacy of controls. Roles were not properly controlled even after concerns were raised by E&amp;Y in the 2011 Audit, particularly in respect of the APPSUP role.  </p>

From 2009 to July 2015 they did not record actions, only whether a user had logged on and logged off. Even after July 2015, the experts agree that such logs are not a useful source of evidence about remote access, due to their content (more accurately, this should be their lack of content). In my judgment, this amounts to a deficiency in controls.  </p>

Mr Coyne established that the APPSUP role was used 2,175 times between 2009 and 2019. Dr Worden confirmed that this was consistent with his review of the Privileged User logs and he equated this to about one person using this role each working day during that period. The Fujitsu witnesses stated this would be in a “support role” but very little detail is available about what this was, or why such regular access of someone with such a powerful role was required. In any event, the Fujitsu witnesses of fact had not reviewed the Privilege User Logs in any detail. </p>

The answer to this issue is therefore that these facilities had the potential to affect the reliability of a SPM’s branch accounts to a material extent. Further, the evidence shows clearly that there were instances when this in fact occurred, which goes wider than the issue posed (which asks about potential) but which I find is also relevant to the Horizon Issues as a whole. </p>

The Post Office ought to have known how its own system works. It is agreed by the experts that an SPM cannot record a dispute on Horizon at all. Indeed, this point was so very clearly conceded by Mr Godeseth when he was asked about it in cross examination that it was remarkable. He explained that there was no “dispute” button on Horizon, and that this was something expressly and deliberately done by design. Yet there were two substantial points in issue in the Common Issues trial on this very same subject. One was the ability of a SPM to dispute the figures shown on Horizon. The second was whether, in law, a branch trading statement had the effect of what is called a settled account between agent and principal (which would mean that certain legal consequences would flow if it were). Judgment No.3 found in favour of the claimants, and against the Post Office, on both those points. It is therefore more than a considerable surprise to see that, as a matter of evidence in the later Horizon Issues trial, those points should never have been put in issue by the Post Office at all. </p>

If, as a matter of reality, any particular point is not controversial, putting it in issue will simply increase time and costs. A SPM cannot be criticised for “accepting” an entry in their accounts if they have no choice but to accept that entry. Nor can a branch trading statement be given the status of a freely agreed (and therefore settled) account if it is no such thing. I wish to remind the parties to this litigation that points that should not be in issue ought to be conceded at a sufficiently early stage, such that time and legal costs are not spent in argument on an erroneous factual basis.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The functionality of the system is as follows. The SPM inputs, at the end of each trading period, the relevant figures for the cash and stock that are physically present. The Horizon system identifies any discrepancy and the system invites the SPM to transfer the amount of that discrepancy into the local suspense account and continue “to roll over”, or to discontinue this operation. Rolling over is required before the next trading period can commence. For discrepancies of less than £150, the SPM has to “make good” that amount, by adding money to the till (if it is negative) or removing it (if positive). For negative sums in excess of £150, the SPM has the choice of making good (by adding the money) or “settling centrally” which basically just means seeking </p>

This is not done as part of the Horizon system. A slightly different process was available prior to 2005 which was called cash accounting, but the process was broadly the same, although “settling centrally” was not available under cash accounting. Making good would cause the actual cash position to increase by the amount put into the till from the SPM’s own resources. If, say, there was a negative discrepancy of £100 between the actual cash position (the cash physically present in the till), and the derived cash position (shown on Horizon) then making good would lead to the figures being the same. The meaning of “settling centrally” simply means paying the amount to the Post Office over time (or having it deducted by the Post Office from the remuneration paid to the SPM). </p>

The branch trading statement had to be done on the figures for cash and stock shown on the Horizon system.

Horizon records figures even when they are not correct, and there is evidence of figures on Horizon being known to be incorrect by the SPM and the Post Office, or both. A dispute is normally raised by a SPM through contacting the helpline, which is a telephone service which was widely referred to in the Horizon Issues trial. There is a finding in Judgment No.3 that by contacting the helpline an SPM was registering a dispute with the Post Office. The helpline and its function are however outside the scope of the Horizon Issues, and the helpline does not form part of the Horizon system. </p>

Given the size of the system, and its evolution into Horizon Online from the days of Legacy Horizon, it would have been entirely possible to draft an appendix that dwarfed the length of Judgment (No.6). In order to avoid that, as such a lengthy document would not be proportionate or reasonable, I have summarised certain aspects of the technical evidence and documentation where necessary. There may therefore be some passages in this appendix which, for example, to someone vastly experienced in writing Oracle code, may not read as being 100% technically accurate or which seem to be a superficial summary. However, in my judgment, such lack of full technical accuracy in description or terminology does not affect either the consideration of the evidence, or the conclusions, or my findings on the Horizon Issues.  </p>

During evidence the second of those two parties was often referred to as the Department of Work and Pensions, or the Benefits Agency. In fact, prior to 2001 the relevant department was the Department of Social Security or DSS (which had been created in 1988 from its predecessor, the Department of Health and Social Security or DHSS). The Department of Work and Pensions was not created until 2001. The different terminology does not matter, other than for the sake of accuracy. At least part of the reason for the project was so that benefits claimants could be paid by using a card, rather than what used to be the case with paper books which a branch Post Office would stamp, remove and exchange for cash. </p>

ICL Pathway (the department within ICL formed for the purpose) was awarded a contract for an electronic way of paying benefits, the Benefits Payment Card, in May 1996, and there was a Horizon Pilot that was introduced in a small number of branches in 1996. This tri-partite scheme was abandoned in 1999. Pathway cited “greater than expected complexity” and “…major implications for the degree of difficulty of the project”, quotations included in Mr Coyne’s report, as ultimately leading to the failure of the project. In July 1999 Post Office Counters Ltd (or POCL, the previous name of what is now the Post Office Ltd) and Pathway agreed to utilise the project to automate branch Post Offices. This is what is now called the Horizon System or Legacy Horizon, and it was introduced (the technical term is “rolled out”) from late 1999 onwards.  </p>

Prior to the introduction of Horizon, the branch Post Office system used a system of paper-based accounts. A paper-based system was used by SPMs to account to the Post Office for the branch activity, although some SPMs used software packages to assist them in this. Although Horizon is used as an accounting system – it is one of its main uses – there is more to it than that. However, computerised accounting systems have been in use since the 1950s, and Dr Worden explained that accounting was one of the “most mature applications” for computers in business. This means that as a computing application, accounting has been such an application for a long time, even in the late 1990s. </p>

The cuneiform tablets of Ur, as he pointed out, were not double-entry bookkeeping, which was invented in the 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> century. They were singleentry; an entry would be recorded once. Double-entry bookkeeping means that discrepancies can be discovered much more speedily, and easily, than otherwise.

Because any accounting system is intended to track external reality, and to give the most accurate possible picture of that reality, it is essential from time to time to check the picture of reality, held in the accounting system, against reality itself - the physical assets of the business, its money in cash or banks, its obligations and debts.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in;text-indent:0.5in">However, checking against external reality is (or was) an expensive process. You cannot simply look at the books - you have to get up from your desk, go out into the warehouse and count stock, check your bank balance and count your cash, consult other people, and so on. Because checking against reality was an expensive process, it did not get done very frequently. If the check is only made occasionally, and mistakes are found, the interval of time in which one or more mistakes might have occurred is a long one. The error is more likely to have arisen from multiple mistakes. Looking for several mistakes together is much harder than looking for one mistake; there is no 'telltale number' to look for. The process of 'drilling down' to find the origin of a mistake is difficult and unguided, with few clues.  </p>

It was an early, and highly effective, form of error repellency - in a time when manual errors of bookkeeping were likely to be frequent. The error repellency guarded against a single point of failure (i.e. a mistake in a single column of figures) by making any such mistake rapidly and obviously visible, in the next trial balance.” </p>

Double entry bookkeeping can be understood by starting with the simple case of a trader on a farmer's market, who has some money, and who has some sheep. He can keep a list of his money, and a separate list of his sheep - complete with their names if he wants to. He can track changes to those lists, with entries like '23rd July: sold one sheep - Dolly'. From the changes he can work out his current position, in money or in sheep: 'now I have 17 sheep left'. This is single-entry accounting. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">9. Double-entry bookkeeping starts when his list of sheep contains two types of information - the sheep he has, and the price he paid for them; and he also keeps a separate list of his money. He tracks the changes to these lists in a series of dated transactions: '25th July: bought one sheep for 5 shillings'. With that transaction, the sum of his money list goes down by 5 shillings, and the money total of his sheep list goes up by 5 shillings. So, he makes two entries - in those two lists - with money value -5 shillings and +5 shillings, and the total money value of the two lists does not change. Because of the self-consistency of mathematics, however he chooses to do those two sums, the sum of the two sums should not change from day to day. This is his double entry 'trial balance'. If the number does change from any day to the next, he knows he has made a mistake - and he can start to track it down.” </p>

The Post Office employs a number of people called auditors to check on the accounts of branch Post Offices. When Mr Bates, for example, started as a SPM, the Closing Day Audit was conducted on the branch (run by his predecessor) as part of what occurred on what was called Branch Handover Day. This is done so that a SPM on their first day starts with particular stock and cash, identified by the Closing Day Audit, and their branch activity uses that as a starting point. Some SPMs may be suspended, or have their engagements suspended, as a result of what the Post Office (through its auditors) uncovers at other audits, which may be performed at any time (which is entirely understandable, and is included in the terms of the SPMs’ contracts). These audits are done to check the state of the branch accounts, and the cash and stock held in the branch. </p>

POLSAP was created by merging two other systems, POLFS and SAP ADS, the ADS in that latter acronym standing for Administrative Data Services. Horizon provided mainly two things; management accounting functionality, as well as Electronic Point of Sale functions for the branches (also called EPOS).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Some computers provide a highly complex computation function. Dr Worden stated, and I agree with him, that the functions of an accounting system include the input, secure storage and output of many types of information, in large volumes (many transactions per day), with rather little computation. By far the most important type of computation that occurs in financial accounting is straightforward summation of numerical quantities such as money and stock, subject to the rules of double entry bookkeeping. For management accounting, some other kinds of computation are needed, such as for forecasting purposes. However, these are not usually  computationally demanding or complex. This is not disparaging of those who designed the system, but given the function of Horizon so far as branch Post Offices are concerned, Horizon does not possess (nor does it need to possess) a highly complex computational function in the sense that very difficult and demanding complex mathematical equations have to be processed at high speed, for example. The computers at NASA in the United States that are responsible for space exploration, and control of satellites, will be dealing with far more complex computation in terms of mathematical function; however, rarely would there be 12,000 moon shots underway at once. Horizon deals with a huge number of transactions per day (about 6 million) across many thousands of branches, but the nature of the calculations is essentially arithmetical. This is not to understate the complexity of Horizon both in terms of the scale of the system, the number of products or the number of different clients with whom the Post Office (and hence SPMs in branches, on behalf of the Post Office) deal. Fujitsu, in a document of 14 January 2004, described Horizon as <span style="font-style:italic">'Europe's largest non-military IT contract'</span>, so Horizon is at the high end of complexity amongst IT systems. Dr Worden stated that it represents “many thousands of man-years effort in development and testing, and its documentation alone more than 100,000 documents”. It can therefore clearly be seen to be undoubtedly highly complex. </p>

The banks' IT estates, like Horizon, have a complex corporate back-end and an extensive branch office network. They were developed over a longer time period (30-40 years) using development team sizes similar to or larger than Horizon, often merging together or integrating the IT systems of previously independent organisations. This gave them a degree of legacy complexity, and design compromise, and corporate amnesia, not found in Horizon. There are parts of these IT estates which 'nobody dares touch'.”  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Although computerised accounting systems had been used widely for some decades since about the 1960s, in the 1980s there was what was called a “major step change in their architecture”, when relational databases were invented/developed and used. A relational database is a digital database based on the relational model of data, and was first proposed in 1970 by EF Codd. Mr Codd was an English computer scientist and invented the relational model for database management. This model uses a structure and language consistent with what is called first-order logic, although it is also called other things (such as quantificational logic) and this is used both in mathematics, computer science and also linguistics. Inter alia it allows the use of sentences that contain variables. In the relationship model, all data is represented in terms of tuples, grouped into relations. In relational database theory, a relation is a set of tuples (d<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">1</span>, d<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span>, ..., d<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">n</span>), where each element d<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">j</span> is a member of D<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">j</span>, which is called a data domain. Each element is termed an attribute value, and an attribute is a name paired with a domain (which is also called a data type, or simply a type). In mathematics a tuple is a finite ordered list or sequence of elements.  </p>

Many such systems use Structured Query Language or SQL to query and maintain the database. A famous and widely used RDBMS is Oracle RDBMS, which is sometimes called Oracle Database or even simply Oracle.

The accounting software makes calls to the RDBMS to store and retrieve the information. These work (in outline terms) by storing structured information. Unstructured information can be stored in computer systems generally, but this requires very advanced computer programs to understand it. More simple programs, such as accounting systems, store and use structured information. Structured information is (for example) something contained in a spreadsheet, made up of information in different cells in rows and columns. Adding up the value of a list of transactions can be accomplished simply by adding up the figures in a particular column that relates to this information for a number of transactions. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The software in Horizon is what is called data-driven. If the accounting application software was written in a way that depended directly on the accounting needs of a client (here, the Post Office, what Dr Worden called a “chart of accounts”), then each company would need different accounting software. This would be very uneconomical (in writing and testing all that software), and this is not the way in which software is developed. The chart of accounts is not 'hard coded' into the application software. The software is written to work with any valid chart of accounts; and the chart of accounts itself is treated as data and stored in the database. In this way, changes in the chart of accounts (which occur from time to time) do not require changes in the accounting software. </p>

This is one example of data-driven software - in which any requirement which might change frequently is encoded as data, rather than software code. The code is written and tested to work with all allowed values of the data, to meet a wide range of requirements by changing the data rather than the code. The modern practice of software engineering is to use data-driven software as far as possible. This is not always as far as one might like; some differences between companies and their requirements are best expressed as differences in code, rather than data”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Accordingly, the accounting application or applications are built as layered software architecture. This means that the accounting application is built “on top of” the relational database. There will usually be a minimum of three layers in a typical system of this type. Layers are also sometimes called tiers. These are the user interface layer, which presents information to users, and accepts their inputs. This is the layer that a SPM would both observe, and which would react to the actions of the SPM (or their assistants) in the branch such as pressing buttons at the terminal for various transactions. The second layer is the business logic layer, responsible for carrying out business processes, and supporting users in doing so. The third layer is the data layer, responsible for storing and retrieving data. More complex architecture has more than these three layers, and there may even be layers within layers. In the case of Horizon, the user interface also includes a Point of Sale interface which is used in the branches. This interface can be thought of as part of the Horizon Point of Sale application, rather than the Horizon accounting application. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The main purpose of defining an architecture in layers is to separate the functionality into parts in the different layers, with well-defined and simple interfaces between the layers. This not only makes each layer easier to design, build and test; but also, if there are errors that are not found in testing, it should be easier to understand and isolate the cause of the errors by inspecting the exchanges between layers. Dr Worden considered layered architecture to be an important countermeasure. It could also be seen as an important part of designing such a system. It is part of modern practice. </p>

In more recent IT systems, tree-like messages are usually sent in XML (Extensible Message Language), with their structure defined in a notation called XML Schema. This is used in parts of Horizon Online. An XML document is a string of what are called characters. These characters are divided into markup and content.

This means that if certain types of data were created at the branches, Riposte should have ensured (the term used by Dr Worden was “guaranteed”, but I consider that overstates it) that the same data would be available at the data centres/campuses. Dr Worden accepted that “if the underlying network was unreliable, it might take some time for Riposte to deliver this guarantee”.

Dr Worden was of the view that if there were any such software errors, these would probably occur with such high frequency, and occur uniformly across all branches, as giving rise to so many TCs, that the Post Office would soon suspect a software error (for instance, seeing the effect repeatedly in some MIS report) and require Fujitsu to correct it. However, this is supposition in my judgment. This is because it depends upon a software error occurring very frequently, and being noticed rapidly. Some accepted errors (for example Callendar Square) lay in the system for 5 years. The evidence of fact advanced by the Post Office itself, which includes that in respect of the admitted or acknowledged bugs, makes it obvious that this supposition is not made out. Further, the detail of the numerous PEAKs show that it is a combination of factors, including the speed at which a SPM performs some tasks, that sometimes led to unexpected events occurring. If something happened at a particular point – one point put by the Post Office to Mr Tank was that an outage occurred at a very precise moment – then an adverse impact would or may occur. That precise combination of circumstances may not occur with the frequency that Dr Worden stated. His supposition was that a bug would have a wide impact across many branches with a high frequency, which would mean that the Post Office would suddenly realise its existence. That is not a valid supposition or assumption given the evidence in this trial. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Some aspects of how business applications were built on Riposte were explained in the expert evidence, without going into enormous layers of explanation of technical complexity that were unnecessary. These included the following: Zero-sum baskets for customers meant that the overall or net impact of all the services provided for one customer was a sum of money which the customer was required to settle. It was required that the cash or other money produced by the customer should exactly match the cost of services provided; therefore, the whole basket of services and customer settlement had to be what is called “zero-sum”, before the basket could be recorded in the branch (and then, through Riposte replication, later recorded in the back-office systems). The impact of every business application would be fed into the relevant systems at the Post Office, typically overnight. These systems were operated by double entry bookkeeping. The only way to put postings into the accounting system was by double entry, which in turn could only be done for zero-sum baskets. Dr Worden considered this a robustness countermeasure. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">All branch applications had to have what was called transactional integrity. This means that all customer business applications, balancing and reconciliation, cash management and stock management were built so that any zero-sum package of updates from those applications would either succeed completely, or would fail completely. In the latter case, they were supposed to have no impact on branch accounts. This transactional integrity was given the acronym TIN, and was supposed to be enforced by the Riposte infrastructure. It should have been impossible in the event of a failure (such as hardware failure) for a part-completed set of updates to be recorded in the branch and then replicated to the back-office systems. This was necessary to prevent the accounting system from being subjected to non-zero sum updates, which would violate its double entry basis and cause later failures of its trial balances.  </p>

In these cases, the user on the counter would be guided through a short set of recovery steps, to produce a consistent zero-sum result which reflected what had happened. As a comment made here by me for convenience, it is the case that some of the evidence of fact from SPMs which I have accepted about transactions that gave rise to difficulty in branches occurred when there were outages. It will be seen from consideration of the bugs in the bug table that these were not the only instances when bugs had some impact on branch accounts. However, whether there was a hardware failure or outage, the system was built so that partly completed transactions were not supposed to be capable of entering the accounting system.

In these cases, the mistake would often be detected later by a reconciliation process, which would typically lead to a TC. This robustness measure was a correction of user errors (UEC).”  However, that statement in my judgment jumps straight to a conclusion that user error would be to blame for failures in recoverable transactions, and this would “typically lead” to the Post Office issuing a TC. In my judgment, the correct approach is to consider bugs, errors or defects within the Horizon System and whether these would lead to failures in recoverable transactions. This is the correct approach to answering the Horizon Issues. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Many applications were not coded individually but were coded as generic applications which could be configured to run different specific applications by altering reference data, as has already been explained. This is called “data-driven software”. These applications were referred to in Legacy Horizon as 'soft-centred' applications. They have the attraction of adaptability in that the data can be changed without new code having to be written. There were however still some hard-coded applications in Legacy Horizon in any event. Errors could often be corrected more quickly if applications are driven by reference data in this way. Reference data is much more concise and understandable than code, so it is much easier to create it or detect errors in it. Dr Worden considered that errors in the underlying generic code would affect a set of specific applications, and so should be easy to detect. However, this can be seen not to be a statement of universal application. The Callendar Square bug was present for 5 years before it was properly discovered (although its effects were experienced, to use Anne Chambers terms, “most weeks”).  </p>

Every branch operates in Trading Periods, which are either four or five weeks (according to a timetable published periodically by the Post Office). At the start of each Trading Period the branch is supposed to be 'in balance'. This means that the physical stock and cash in the branch agrees with the data on stock and cash held in Horizon. Then, during each Trading Period, Horizon records all customer transactions made at the branch, so it records the changes in cash and stock. It also records any replenishments or remittances of cash or stock in the branch. Horizon will (or should) record all changes in cash and stock held at the branch during the Trading Period, and can compute, from the starting amounts and the changes, the expected amounts of cash and stock at the end of the period. This leads to something called the Branch Trading Statement.  </p>

This is called 'balancing'. If the numbers are all equal, the branch is in balance and is permitted to 'roll over' to the next period. If the two sets of numbers are not equal, there is a discrepancy between what Horizon considers should be present in the branch (for example the actual cash) and what is physically present (the actual cash held at the branch). This also applies to some stock such as stamps. These discrepancies are at the heart of this group litigation, as the reason for the discrepancies are so controversial. As part of “rolling over”, a SPM with a shortfall or discrepancy has to “make good” or “settle centrally” at the time, as part of bringing that Trading Period to an end. Unless they are prepared to do that, the next branch Trading Period cannot commence. Each of those two acts, making good or settling centrally, involved payment by the SPM to the Post Office; the only difference is the former means payment immediately, and the latter means seeking time to pay.  </p>

Whenever the network became available again, Riposte data replication should have ensured that the required data became available to the back-office systems. The only applications which could not run in this way were those that required some immediate validation from a client organisation - for instance, withdrawing cash from a bank account. Horizon Online this was no longer the case as the persistent data was all stored remotely in the BRDB. This meant that without a working network, a branch could no longer trade.

In Legacy Horizon, all data travelled from the counter through the software application at the branch, through Riposte data replication to the two campuses, then through the Audit Agent to the Audit Store. In Horizon Online, all data travelled from the counter through the software application at the branch, through communications hardware and software to the Branch Access Layer (BAL), into the BRDB and then nightly to the audit store.</p>

In August 2000 there was the Release of what is called the Horizon Core System, or Core System Release. This introduced Automated Payment Smart cards and APS/TPS reconciliation into branches. Not all branches received installation of Horizon in the same month; that would, I imagine, be impossible in practical terms given the number of branches in the Post Office network. Some dates are included in Judgment No.3 from the Common Issues trial, in relation to those claimants called as witnesses in that other trial. Horizon was installed in Mr Bates’ branch in October 2000; Mrs Stubbs said it was installed in her branch “in the course of 2001” but it must have been earlier than that, as letters in relation to her shortfalls both to, and from, Mr Manning are dated 1 and 2 November 2000.

Escher Group, a separate company, provided the Riposte Message Server (which was responsible for storing all the data in the Post Office branches and replicating it to the Data Centres). Terminals had two discs within them, one of which was termed a “mirror disc”, which retained all the data of what occurred on that terminal. The branch would have a hard disc, which would store the data for the branch and this would also be replicated on other counter positions (if a multi-counter branch) or, in the instance of a single counter branch, stored to additional external storage on the counter. It would then be passed on from the counter to the Horizon data centre where it is stored in the CS messagestore. </p>

This was called the Network Banking Solution. A primary facet of the Network Banking Solution was the delivery of the banking transactions within the already established Escher WebRiposte environment. The full installation and integration of this was the task of Fujitsu (at the time ICL Pathway).

This was described by Mr Coyne in the following way: “This communication was initially based upon Escher’s Riposte messaging system. This was later supported by the WebRiposte system to accommodate Network Banking changes and the Network Banking Engine supplied by IBM to deal with the increase and change in type of business transacted in the branches. This was subsequently migrated to Horizon Online. Horizon is therefore ultimately a composition of many sub-contracted components.” </p>

However, he also considered that Horizon “originally stemmed from an inherited system and architecture with an initial, fundamentally different design requirement” (namely the Pathway Benefits Payment Card project). Regardless of that, there is no doubt that Horizon is a highly complex and multi-faceted system, because it has so many different elements and interacts with so many other systems. It has been added to multiple times over the years, as clients are added, new products are introduced, and indeed other sub-contracted parties and software products have become involved. I do not consider that resolution of the Horizon Issues requires an analysis of the reason or reasons why, in historical terms, Horizon may have developed (or had inherent within it) any bugs, errors or defects.  </p>

ICL Pathway was (at least partly) owned by Fujitsu and I use the term Fujitsu to refer to the computer specialists with whom Post Office had contractual relations in respect of Horizon. I therefore make no distinction between the years when ICL Pathway or Fujitsu was or were contractually responsible for Legacy Horizon, or indeed with any of the other computer specialist companies such as Escher Group who provided Riposte. Legacy Horizon involved the installation and use of Horizon terminals within branches, which were used by the staff there (including the SPM) to transact all of the branch’s Post Office business with the branch’s customers. If a customer in a branch wanted to purchase something from the associated retail outlet, they would transact that business at a separate till, not at the Horizon terminal. The National Lottery is an exception to this, as certainly now, it spans both parts of the business of a branch.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Horizon was migrated to Horizon Online in 2010. Horizon Online is also called HNGX, but now it is on a different platform since its move to Windows 10 and it is now called HNG-A. The letters “NG” stand for “New Generation”. In 2010 there was no sudden change in the range of business applications supported by Old Horizon in the branches. This range of applications has increased continually over the lifetime of Legacy Horizon and Horizon Online. The main reason or rationale for the change to online was to exploit advances in the underlying communication technology, and improvements in its reliability. This meant that it had become possible to store all persistent data at a centre rather than in the branch (on the counters), with the consequence that a branch could only operate when communications were available, but the risk of failed communications was significantly lower in 2010 than it had been 10 to 12 years before. Dr Worden considered that this change mirrored the wider changes across the IT industry, where increased reliability of communications infrastructure meant that applications could be dealt with in this way.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The centralised storage of transaction data allowed the architecture to become simpler in some respects, with simpler management of the branches in the event of hardware failures or replacements and other events. This is because in those cases branch data would not be lost. There was also no dependence on Riposte data replication, which meant that Riposte could be removed entirely. Riposte is therefore not used in Horizon Online. One feature of Horizon which emerges from all the evidence provided is that it had a difficult interface with the systems of the Post Office’s clients, such as Camelot. It is not necessary to go into the technicalities of why that was, and was recognised by the Post Office (in this instance by Ms Van Den Bogerd herself) so far as Camelot was concerned by the introduction of the Ping fix in 2012.  </p>

This is why Horizon Online could not operate in the branches without working communications. The main difference at the “back-end” was the existence of the BRDB, which was the main persistent store of all transactions for all branches. Many business applications in the back-end were unchanged (and were referred to as 'legacy'), except for the need for them to interface with the BRDB rather than with the previous Agent layer. Other copies of transaction data continued to be stored in those applications. </p>

These included user interfaces, some business applications, and message storage and replication. Because in Horizon Online, Riposte was completely removed, all elements of the branch software were replaced. A great deal of the Legacy Horizon branch code had been written in Visual Basic, for Horizon Online nearly all the branch software was written in Java. Java is a newer language, and supported more modern programs (or what Dr Worden called modern programming paradigms). This allowed a more modern software architecture in the branch, which did not have to be fitted around the existing architecture of Riposte. </p>

The effect of these two layers was to provide a user interface similar in style to that which had been provided by Riposte in Old Horizon. This therefore meant that the experience of the person, either SPM or assistant, using Horizon would be similar to what it had been in Legacy Horizon, but the system would be using Java technology, rather than Riposte as before. </p>

This means that there are several general-purpose software objects (i.e. modular blocks of software) with names such as customer, basket and payment, which represent the behaviour that is required of those in the real world, but is done in a way that can be easily reused in many different business applications. There are therefore certain core design elements used for many different applications.  </p>

As has already been noted, this is generally not done by writing completely different software for each business application, and a great many applications are driven by reference data. This data defines the sequence of steps in completing each type of service for a customer. This reference data-driven style of software is common modern practice. The theory is that </p>

This was a lack of detailed evidence adduced by the Post Office in relation to the specific factual matters recorded in PEAKs and KELs in particular, and the way that this situation was sought to be remedied. This second element was by way of points explained or put “on instruction”, and also in submissions. This is referred to in [69] to [71] of the judgment that accompanies this appendix.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The first of these, the putting of points “on instruction”, in this case related predominantly to the way that certain matters were put to Mr Coyne in crossexamination to correct evidence of fact that had emerged during the crossexamination of Mr Godeseth. The second arose in the context of the Post Office’s Appendix 2 to its written Closing Submissions. The need for both, or either, arose in my judgment because of the way Dr Worden approached his task in comparison with Mr Coyne. Because he had done what he himself described as a “high level” analysis of Horizon, his written reports did not deal with the detailed contents of so many PEAKs and KELs in the same way that Mr Coyne did. Therefore, when the Post Office came to challenge Mr Coyne’s conclusions in closing submissions, they could not simply meet his evidence with opposing expert evidence of the same type.  </p>

For the most part this type of example is rare, and it is not usually the case that the submissions go further than the underlying documents suggest. I would like to record that I found Appendix 2 very useful; it must have taken an enormous time to produce.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">In my judgment, the most convenient approach is to consider each of the alleged bugs, errors and defects in the Experts’ so-called Bug Table in order to come to a judgment on the existence, or otherwise, of each. Horizon Issue 1 requires this, and in addition, Horizon Issue 3 should be answered in the context of whatever the answers are to the different component elements of Horizon Issue 1. This also means Horizon Issue 3 can be considered in the knowledge of how many, if any, of the alleged bugs errors and defects in fact existed in Horizon over time, and what their potential effect was. By the end of the Horizon Issues trial, in reality there was less in dispute between the parties on the different bugs in the Bug Table than appeared at the beginning of that process. This is not to say that there were many concessions, certainly in terms of the existence of bugs, although there were some. However, the expert evidence of both Dr Worden and Mr Coyne, although they differed in their conclusions, was not so far apart on the factual existence of certain bugs, errors and defects. Given the use during the trial of so many PEAKs and KELs, which contained contemporaneous records at Fujitsu of the effect upon SPMs of different features within Horizon, this is not so surprising. Some overarching themes remained, for example the difference between transient and lasting impact of bugs. These are addressed in the body of the judgment itself.  </p>

It was agreed in the Bug Table as an “acknowledged bug” which had an impact on branch accounts. Dr Worden added in his comments that “Therefore, the extent of this bug is well established, in the GJ analysis.” GJ is Gareth Jenkins. It is accepted by the Post Office in paragraph 7 of Appendix 2 as one of a number of “bugs with lasting impact (although they were resolved)”. In the summary in Appendix 2, the Post Office stated that “In the event, however, this bug resulted in transient impact only.” I have dealt with the concept of transient impact in the main judgment on the Horizon Issues. </p>

If a branch had an unresolved discrepancy, when balancing the stock unit, and if the SPM pressed the Preview or Print button to produce the Trial Balance Report, this would cause the counter to return to the rollover screen. Having checked the Trial Balance Report, if the SPM then pressed the rollover button, Horizon would then ask the SPM whether they would like to transfer the discrepancy to the local suspense account or cancel the rollover.  </p>

If the SPM then proceeded to rollover to a new Trading Period in the same session the fault would occur.  This was a bug in the code that was triggered by the ‘cancel’ button being pressed and this incorrectly caused the discrepancy to be cleared so far as the user in the branch was concerned.   </p>

However, that does not mean that this bug does not exist; rather to the contrary. The fact that Fujitsu was supposed to watch for it, and then investigate it, does not affect its existence. Further, the submissions also relied upon the fact that instances of this bug “were collected through [Fujitsu] reports without the need for an SPM to report an issue.” In my judgment this overstates the factual position in the Post Office’s favour. PEAK PC0204263 dated 16 September 2010 shows that this PEAK was raised by a “customer call” on 13 September 2010, which means a SPM, who had a discrepancy of £109. This was given call priority B by Fujitsu. The SPM <span style="font-style:italic">did</span> report the discrepancy; they could not report a payments and receipts mismatch because they would not have known either about the existence of the bug, or its effects. </p>

A reference data fix was necessary to correct it. As explained above, reference data was part of the architecture in Horizon, and in my judgment is part of the software.

It is a bug which was present in Legacy Horizon. It too was agreed by the Post Office in the letter of response in the litigation of 28 July 2016. It was also agreed in the Bug Table as an “acknowledged bug” which had an impact on branch accounts. It is accepted as a bug by the Post Office in paragraph 6 of Appendix 2, but is said to have had “transient impact”. Dr Worden added different comments, including that “the bug arose from a fault in the underlying Riposte software, so it is not surprising that it took Fujitsu some time to understand it, or that they had to rely on the suppliers to fix it. It does not show poor system design or support by Fujitsu”. That latter sentence is in my judgment a little surprising. It is not relevant to the Horizon Issues whether fault or defects can be laid at the door of Fujitsu, Escher Group (who supplied Riposte) or any of the other specialist companies who provided software for different parts of Horizon. Dr Worden seemed to me to be very defensive on Fujitsu’s behalf. The Horizon Issues are about the operability and functionality of Horizon, and there are no findings made in the judgment or this Technical Appendix regarding which specialist company is to blame for the presence of any bugs, errors or defects.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Riposte software was part of Legacy Horizon, although it is not used in Horizon Online, as one of the main changes between the two different types of system (Legacy, and Online) was specifically the way data was stored and messages sent. Legacy Horizon used Riposte and it was a central feature of that system. Riposte is not used in Horizon Online. The fact that Riposte is a product designed and supplied by Escher, and not Fujitsu, is not relevant to the dispute between the Post Office and the claimants. In any event, and as accepted and recited in paragraph 2 of the Post Office’s Appendix 2 to its closing submissions dealing with this bug, “Mr Coyne asserts that Bug 2: Callendar Square is a bug with lasting financial impact and in JS2, Dr Worden appears to agree that there is strong evidence of this….” </p>

Firstly, it was a matter for the Post Office’s legal team how long it spent on each subject with Mr Coyne, who was crossexamined for four days. It might have been sensible to have started with the number of bugs for which Mr Coyne was contending, and then cross-examined on each or some in detail after that. The Post Office chose to leave the total number of bugs until the last day; there is nothing wrong with that, but it is not correct to state that there was insufficient time to cross-examine on this bug (or any bug) and try to blame Mr Coyne for it. Secondly, the submission entirely ignores the evidence of Mr Godeseth, called by the Post Office, who expressly accepted that the bug had probably been present since 2000. </p>

There are two points that this submission fails to address. Firstly, the Horizon Issues concern bugs, errors and defects with the potential to affect branch accounts. The Callendar Square bug is clearly one of these. Secondly, the “ordinary course” in this instance seems to be that not one of the SPMs across the Post Office branch network were told about the existence or effect of the Riposte lock problem, which Fujitsu recorded (by Anne Chambers in February 2006) had “been around for years”. In my judgment, the ordinary course ought to have been providing SPMs with notification of the existence of this bug and its effects. SPMs and the Post Office have agreements in place (at the time of this bug the SPMC) that govern their legal relationship. Judgment No.3 makes clear what the scope of the parties’ legal obligations are.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">One specific factual point of disagreement between the parties was the period of time when the effects of this bug were no longer experienced. The Post Office maintains this came to an end in 2006, and the claimants submitted that it ran until Riposte was no longer used, namely 2010 when Horizon Online came into being.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">A. Well I did explain and I will explain again. That there is a problem in Riposte which leads to a failure to replicate -- failures to release a lock I think -- and then on certain occasions that leads to a short-term failure to replicate.  On other occasions there is a so-called event storm during which there is a longer term failure to replicate and during these failures to replicate all sorts of different things may happen, for instance they double transfer into a stock (inaudible), a precise Callendar Square phenomenon; whereas other things such as system freezes, I can’t remember all the other details, but <span style="text-decoration:underline">there are many other symptoms of then underlying Riposte problem</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">and they have been noted over this whole period.</span>” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">By “this whole period” Dr Worden was, in my judgment, clearly referring to the period 2000 to 2010. Whether the short-term failure to replicate, and the “event storm” with its longer term failure to replicate, are seen as one bug in Riposte (which is the way the experts approached it) or two sub-elements of one bug, which it could be (given one is a short term failure, and the other a long term failure, both being failures to replicate) does not for these purposes matter. In my judgment, the period when the effects of this occurred are 2000 to 2010. Dr Worden’s evidence does not support the Post Office’s position that this ended in 2006, and is indeed to the contrary.  </p>

What this meant was that if there was an impact on branch accounts by something within Horizon, but that was then corrected by a TC, he concluded it had a “transient effect” upon branch accounts and dealt with it differently.

Basically, places where a full time branch Post Office is not justified, such as remote areas, may have such services on (say) half a day per week, in a mobile van or a village hall. These are called “outreach” branches, and they are connected to (or part of) a core branch, run by the same SPM. This means that the SPM is in charge of both the core branch and the outreach branch.

The SPM in that branch had attempted to transfer cash to its outreach branches. The SPM sought to transfer £8,000 and ended up with a £32,000 transaction. This problem involved issues relating to two different scripts, the Post Log On script and the Forced Log Out script. The latter did not close down the former correctly (or in software terms, did not lead to the former script correctly closing down the operation) which meant that the script was left on the stack of incomplete processes.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">There are two points upon which the Post Office relies in respect of this bug. The first point is that the Fujitsu investigation in December 2015 showed that 112 potential occurrences of the Dalmellington issue had been identified in the previous 5 years.  Of these 112 potential occurrences, 108 items were corrected at the time, either by Post Office issuing a Transaction Correction or the SPM reversing the duplicate Rem In. This left 4 remaining potential occurrences, for which Fujitsu had not yet established the outcome. However, the claimants rely upon two points of their own in this respect. One is that this showed that even though the bug had occurred multiple times and affected branch accounts, neither Fujitsu or the Post Office even knew it was a bug prior to late 2015. In my judgment, that is a valid point for the claimants to make. The second feature is that TCs are, as has been identified in the Horizon Issues judgment itself, outside of the Horizon System.  </p>

By the time this bug was remedied in early 2016, the mediation scheme had been brought to an end some time before (this occurred in March 2015) but some of the branches affected by the Dalmellington bug were within the scheme, according to the Fujitsu investigation. However, none of the periods when the bug hit matched what were recorded in the investigation as “Mediation dates”. Not only that, but for the period up to the commencement of the mediation scheme, the Post Office was meeting a case brought by the claimants that there were widespread bugs within Horizon which impacted the branch accounts. Dalmellington shows that there was such a bug, which lay undiscovered (although its effects were apparent) until 2015. </p>

The documents from which these submissions were drawn show that the two branches with these discrepancies were those with FAD codes 209311 and 157242. However, the documents also report that both these branches had duplicate IDs for remming in of cash, that there had been “no contact from the branches raising issues for the period in question (February and March 2013)” and come to the following conclusion (although I consider it is worth noting that the SPMs in each of these branches do not appear to have been asked, nor does the ARQ data appear to have been used): </p>

Dr Worden relied upon what he described as “a well-tested process of reconciliation and TCs to detect and correct errors in cash remming (used 20,000 times per year)” and said it was “straightforward for Horizon to detect any discrepancy between a “rem out” and the corresponding “rem in” (a mismatch arising either from a miscount, or a multiple count of a pouch) and then a TC can be issued.” He also added that “this process catches and corrects remming errors, whatever their cause - including if they arise from, or are provoked by, software faults.” He therefore implicitly accepted that the Dalmellington bug was a software fault, although he did not say so in terms. I find that it was plainly was. I also reject his evidence that it was “straightforward for Horizon to detect any discrepancy”; the evidence about this bug shows that Horizon did not detect it in these many cases.  </p>

Cash rem in issues were shown at the branch in February 2013 but none of the same type as the £25,000 duplicate rem in, and none on the exact date in February which was 18 February 2013.

However, there were no accounting shortfalls ultimately experienced by SPMs whose branches suffered from the effects of the Dalmellington bug as these were corrected by means of TCs.

A certain amount of cash is held in each branch for the purposes of transacting Post Office business. Each pouch has a unique barcode that needs to be scanned by the branch when it is received.  This automatically looks up the contents of the pouch so that the branch can confirm that the physical contents of the pouch match up to the record on Horizon.

In response to that challenge, the Post Office clarified its submissions and relied upon Dr Worden’s report, which was in general terms in respect of the general principle of double entry accounting; the HNG-X architecture document, which again demonstrated the theory or principle of the system; a PEAK document; and Mr Coyne’s cross-examination. It is necessary to consider those therefore, in order to see if the submission is substantiated. </p>

Remming in and remming out. Money is sent from Chesterfield to a branch. Chesterfield has a record of the money it sends over. The branch receives the money and types in -- or usually it is a barcode actually, but it records on the Horizon system how much money the branch has received. You are aware, aren't you, that there is an automatic system that checks Chesterfield's figures against the branch's figures? A.  Yes. </p>

Are you suggesting that every time over the last 20 years there has been a discrepancy between Chesterfield's figures and the branch's figures, are you suggesting that it is necessary for you to see the evidence of what happened next, of whether a transaction correction was sent and what the evidence was in relation to that branch?  Are you really suggesting that's necessary? </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">A.  No, because in a typical scenario where the systems operate as they should, as they are designed, then the positioning of the countermeasures that you have put in place would pick up on that so that would work absolutely fine.  In the scenario where the system doesn't operate as expected there is a bug, error or defect or communication fault, then a different set of scenarios will likely be encountered and it is understanding then what happens that is important. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Given that the PEAK on Issue 1 is dated August 2010, and the KEL itself was raised in March 2010, the KEL must have been updated with the entry relating to that PEAK and that the fix was applied in 2011. Those entries cannot have been included in the KEL originally, as they post date its creation in March 2010. This means therefore that someone at Fujitsu obviously concluded that the later PEAK in time (on Issue 1) was relevant to the same KEL (on Issue 2) as it was added to the KEL. I agree with whoever at Fujitsu linked these PEAKs to the same KEL. I consider that the KEL must refer to broadly the same issue, namely the remming in of pouches that were counted twice by the Horizon System. A fix was in any event issued for the issue identified in the KEL. However, it is correct and I accept the Post Office’s submissions that upon closer analysis it can be seen that there are two separate, but very similar in effect and related, issues here, both of which have the same end result, namely the duplication of remming in of cash pouches.  </p>

It stated that the document was PC0197838, but in fact the reference is BE/0197828, as it is a BIMS Incident Report and not a PEAK, and is dated 16 April 2010. The reference number is the same but the initials are BE and not PC because it is a different type of document. However and in any event, the document relied upon by the Post Office identifies an exception type as “Receipts and Payments do not balance (post migration)” but it does deal with the same issue as this one, as it states within the body of the document that “The PM has used the Previous key whilst scanning in pouches, which has caused a duplicated rem” and also: </p>

If I am wrong about that, then the PEAKs I have identified above, including the BIMS Incident Report, are evidence of and relate to the same bug. Given the finding of two issues, then Issue 1 and Issue 2 could either relate to different iterations of one bug, or to two different bugs. These bugs or this bug (depending upon which semantic analysis of Issue 1/Issue 2 is correct) both impact branch accounts. Issue 2 related to the pilot phase of Horizon Online. However, neither of these issues are caught by automatic reporting. The Post Office accepts that Issue 1 was reported to it by the SPM affected. The fact that the BIMS report requires the Post Office to “contact the PM to confirm if the PM has two identical Rem in slips” for the session identified makes it clear that this also applies to Issue 2 as well. There is therefore, in my judgment, no practical difference whether one approaches this as two different issues with the same effect, or one.  </p>

The cash can be remmed out before it is physically collected. When remmed out the cash appears in a different line in the branch accounts.

Paragraph 22 of the Appendix 2 submissions on this by the Post Office submits “in any event, it was picked up automatically”. This is not correct. An entry in the February Service Review Book on page 11 of 33 of that document shows that there were 526 calls to the Horizon Service Desk as a result of this specific issue, of what were said to be a high number of software calls in that month of 3792.

Mr Parker had identified 33 branches affected. Mr Coyne recorded what he said were four associated KELs, namely acha5259Q (for which there were 6 PEAKs) (this KEL is mistakenly recorded twice in column 3 of the Bug Table, with acha5838T only mentioned in the text in that column); cardc2043L (10 PEAKs); PorterS199P (3 PEAKs); and acha5838T (which states there are “two different but similar problems” and appears in the text, but not in the list of KELs at the end of the text by Mr Coyne).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The statement of Mr Parker introduces another concept, similar if not identical to Dr Worden’s “transient impact”, and that is “temporary financial impact”. Dr Worden is correct that PEAKs and KELs do not record corrections of financial impact; they do however record financial impact, because when an SPM reaches SSC (which raises the PEAK) they often start by recording “SPM says he/she has a problem in that……” and financial impact is often then recorded. The Post Office in paragraph 2 of the detailed part of Appendix 2 dealing with this bug states that “any discrepancy would not be lasting”. This does therefore accept, albeit implicitly, that it would have an impact upon branch accounts. It is also submitted that it was a “teething problem” from the early days of the Horizon Online pilot scheme. </p>

This could be for several reasons including a power failure, system crash or communication failure between the branch and data centre. This is a risk which has to be dealt with as it cannot sensibly be eliminated in a system such as Horizon. Horizon runs various automated reports each day to look for failed recovery events. Mr Coyne dealt with two different documents in his report, PC0197769 and KEL acha959T. The former was created on 15 April 2010 during the pilot phase of Horizon Online. The root cause of the issue was identified on 26 April 2010, work on a fix was started and this was released in early June as shown in Release PEAK PC0199000 (and then estate-wide to pilot branches) by mid-June 2010. It did however undoubtedly evidence a bug. The reference to the “959T” KEL below is the KEL whose full title is acha959T which was raised by Anne Chambers. </p>

I have already dealt with one entry in that PEAK in that part of the judgment. I have accepted Mr Tank’s evidence on this incident. That PEAK was closed with the categorisation “Final – Advice after Investigation” and “Root Cause – General in Procedure”. The entry at 10:40:51 on 14 December 2011, also from Mr Bragg, shows the transaction details which plainly identify an authorised transaction, a failure of the basket settlement, the failure of repeated retries by the system and the failed recovery. It was this analysis that preceded Mr Bragg’s conclusion that “the customer’s account should be correct but the branch will have a shortage (for a withdrawal) because the session hasn’t been recorded”. This is plainly a fault in Horizon, and is directly contrary both to the Post Office’s case on failed recoveries in the Bug Table, and also its case on Mr Tank’s evidence. </p>

The issue here is whether the Horizon System process for dealing with the recovery processes when they had in fact failed was working as it should, or defectively. The fact that there are so many PEAKs identified in the KEL, and the contents of those PEAKs clearly demonstrates, in my judgment clearly, that it was not. I reject Dr Worden’s evidence that human intervention should be required or expected for some, most or all failed recoveries. I also reject his evidence about the word in the PEAK “problem”. He said “The word "problem" doesn't imply a bug in Horizon.” In my judgment, on this subject, it clearly does. </p>

The SPM reported a £43,000 discrepancy after balancing stock units and doing an office snapshot. An office snapshot is a Horizon report that showed the current accounting position of the branch, including any cash discrepancy. To produce the office snapshot, Horizon scanned the messagestore for the necessary information (eg. initial cash and stock levels, all cash and stock transactions, plus other service transactions).  It then compiled that information together in order to produce the office snapshot.  This is the “data tree”. On occasion Horizon would fail to read the necessary transaction data for various reasons so the report would be incomplete. This failure at Dungannon was caused by a missing payments node.  </p>

MSU were involved in the investigation of this and the Post Office submits that “it is therefore likely that the issues at Yate Sodbury and Appleby were resolved via a BIMS report and that the Subpostmasters were held harmless.  However, due to the age of [this issue], comprehensive records are not available and therefore Post Office is not in a position to provide detailed commentary.” Two points need to be made. The shortfall was in a snapshot and not in a Branch Trading Statement; and secondly, there is no evidence of how it was corrected if at all. There are references in the PEAK in respect of Dungannon that shows the SPM and the Post Office agreed to remove the discrepancy from the account.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">There is an associated issue in respect of data trees, namely PEAK PC0121925. As part of the changes made to move branch accounting from weekly cash accounts to monthly branch trading statements (a programme called IMPACT), changes to the data server were made to reduce the number of times that the messagestore was scanned to pick up transactions during balancing.  A Riposte mechanism known as “Notifications” was used to add new transactions to the existing totals as further transactions were generated during the balancing process (rather than rebuilding the data server tree of transactions from scratch).  One of the test branches experienced an issue, where the test branch had a gain of £45.05 following a cash declaration and rolling into branch trading.  Initially, Escher were unable to replicate this scenario and so no further action could be taken.  Subsequently, as demonstrated in a later PEAK in 2005, PC0123319 Fujitsu was able to replicate the scenario and implement a fix on 5 September 2005.  The fix was implemented before any branches had switched to use the new branch trading code, meaning that the issue in PC0121925 could not have impacted any live branches. This is, however, a bug, error or defect, but not in the Horizon System as it is used in actual branches.  </p>

The explanation for why this occurred was the “cut off” time for post being collected from Branch X (which would include the giros to go to Girobank) being earlier than the end of the trading day. Branch X might pay out (say) £85 to a customer at 4.45pm, but the post (including all giro vouchers then available at the branch) might have left at 3.15pm or 4.30pm. This would lead to the difference explained at [250] above. It would also lead to an error notice being issued by Girobank. The Post Office’s submissions state that “in this particular case, the only possible impact would be if the branch had accepted the error notice received because of the reporting issue”. In other words, the only way the system would work correctly would be if the SPM did not accept the error notice. The Post Office have to rely upon a SPM <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> accepting an error notice issued to him or her to avoid any impact on branch accounts. That is not a software bug, it is true; it is however an error or defect in the system. The error notices are issued through or as part of the Horizon System. This type of incident is referred to in PC0044232, which concerned a £505.72 discrepancy. This was a known issue dealt with by KEL MWright531p.  This KEL is now said by Fujitsu to have been deleted and irretrievable due to its age. </p>

This was that the same £81 giro deposit had been included on two consecutive daily reports.  Part of the Post Office’s submissions on this are as follows: “This is because the transaction was entered onto Horizon in a precise (and very small) window of time between two system calls being undertaken, resulting in a duplication.  The overall branch position would still have been correct, but the daily reports to Girobank may have been wrong.  If they were (i.e. if the same transaction was included on two consecutive daily reports), it is expected that this would have been spotted and a TC would not have been issued to the branch.” This is, in my judgment, evidence of a bug, error or defect in the system, as the duplication referred to should not have occurred. There is no evidential basis for any “expectation” that if the reports to Girobank had been wrong, it would “have been spotted” and led to the issuing of a TC. No such TC has been produced.  </p>

Issue 3 applied to two PEAKs, both from 2000. They were PC0052575 (in which the SPM reported discrepancies of £20 and £628.25) and the issue was diagnosed as arising out of the use of a shared stock unit. The Post Office submissions were “There is a window of time between a user printing and cutting-off a report.  If another user was to perform a transaction during that window, that transaction may not show on the report. The issue was already due to be fixed in a future release”.  Mr Coyne accepted in cross-examination that these were indications of a discrepancy being identified, but these were not of themselves evidence of a bug in Horizon. His overall evidence on this was contained in his final answer which was “It created a financial discrepancy within the Horizon system which could then ultimately have an impact on branch accounts.” I accept that this issue caused a financial discrepancy. Given the issue was “due to be fixed” in what is described as a “future release” the issue arose from the operation of the system and is therefore, in my judgment, correctly described as a defect. </p>

Fujitsu were unable to replicate the issue and were therefore unable to issue a specific fix.  However, a new version of the component was released with extra tracing code so that if the issue reoccurred, Fujitsu could gather more evidence.  The SPM would have had an inaccurate report but the correct data was still available and this would not have affected the branch when balancing. In PC0075312, another SPM raised an issue with printing her giro deposits.  The issue was identified as being caused by the same root issue as PC0073855 which was already with the development team. These did not impact branch accounts. However – and I consider this to be important – they constitute evidence of a bug. The KEL with which they are associated is KEL AChambers4410R, the same KEL as the PEAK in Issue 4. The only reason the Fujitsu “development team” would be involved would be to develop a fix. A fix is only required if changes are required to the software, which means there is a bug.  </p>

One report did not have the deposits on it, but the next day’s report had both. I find that this is not a bug and is an example of user error (that is, and to be clear, SPM error).   </p>

The fact that the SPM for whatever reason did not pursue it does not affect that.  </p>

The first was created in 2000 and last updated in July 2007, and refers to 88 PEAKs. The second was created in 2002 and notes occurrences running up to 2009. It is now accepted as a bug by the Post Office in paragraph 6 of Appendix 2, but is said to have had transient impact. Mr Coyne considered that when replacing a counter within a branch, the process could result in “the total loss of a transaction”. Dr Worden stated that the cause, recorded in the first KEL (which was created in December 2000 and last updated in July 2007) was that Riposte was coming online from the Recovery mode too early, and causing messages to be overwritten.  </p>

For a single counter office, the neighbours are the correspondence server in the datacentre and the mirror disk (the second hard drive in the same counter).  For a multi-counter office, the neighbours are the correspondence server and all other nodes at the office, or all the other nodes in the office (known as slaves) depending upon the node number of the counter being replaced.   </p>

The Post Office submissions state that “In this case, the replacement counter came out of recovery mode early, before it had replicated all messages from its neighbour.  The replacement counter started writing messages from the point at which it believed it had replicated all relevant messages from its neighbour.  This meant that it used message IDs that had been used for messages that had not been replicated from its neighbour and this prevented the “missing” messages from being replicated later on (because that would have created duplicate message IDs).  The missing message was therefore “overwritten” by the replacement counter.” </p>

This may have been because the branch infrastructure was not complete (eg not all neighbouring counters are online, multiple swaps or a counter increase/decrease occurring) or the engineer did not connect the system properly.” Regardless of the reason, the failure to replicate messages is a failure in the internal processes of Horizon to cope with the hardware replacement of the counter, and in my judgment is a bug, error or defect.  </p>

PC0133822 is not the same issue as JBallantyne5328R but is accepted as being related. This PEAK is dated 24 March 2006.  The branch had two counters removed, leaving it as a single counter branch.  However, the counter did not have a mirror disk; the mirror disk was a second hard disk within a single counter that provided a replication neighbour for the main hard disk messagestore.  This meant that the branch would have no replication of data if it was not connected to the datacentre and six messages on the counter had not been replicated to the data centre.  The messages were extracted and sent to MSU for a BIMS report to be raised.  The Post Office submits that “An error notice would have followed the BIMS report and so there would have been no lasting impact on branch accounts”. However, that effectively accepts that absent the error notice, the branch accounts would have been affected. PC0153851 is not the same issue as JBallantyne5328R but it does involve a receipts and payments mismatch; it is dated 7 February 2008.  Riposte failed to index four messages resulting in some items being missing from the receipts side of the balance report.  The PEAK itself notes that the branch did not experience a discrepancy as a result because this was a reporting issue only; indexes are not used when replicating data and so cash/stock were unaffected. This does however show that the problem with Riposte persisted.  </p>

A change, or changes, had to be made to Riposte to stop this occurring, and there were still later manifestations of it occurring.  </p>

The Post Office’s detailed submissions in Appendix 2 of its Closing Submissions concentrated on the fact that when the Post Office withdrew stock – which of course is part of the way that the Post Office manages its business, adding and removing types of products from time to time – this removal of products is done by means of an update to reference data, “and not a change to the core code in the system.” This again is concentrating on the code, rather than the way the system operates.  </p>

The office declares stock when they do the balance but insist there is no line showing in either adjust stock or declare stock for the PO Saving stamps.

It states that the SPM could not rem them out because the rem out icon had disappeared for this stock. That is undoubtedly an error by the SPM. However, the fact that the withdrawn stock remained on the stock holdings, which are part of the branch accounts, even after the stock has been returned and a TC issued to correct the discrepancy for their value, cannot be laid at the door of the SPM.

The SPM attempted to cancel the whole order, but the cancellation only worked for the rupiah order, leaving the dollar order of £204.59 in the branch accounts. This is because as recently as August 2017 multiple currency orders were processed as multiple transactions.  The rupiah order was added first at the counter and then sent to the BAL, and this caused the order ID PBX1048411 to be created.  The network timeout occurred at this point – such a timeout has nothing to do with the SPM. At that time that the dollar order had been added to the counter stack but it had not yet reached the BAL.  This meant that it did not become associated with order PBX1048411 and so, when the SPM attempted to cancel the whole transaction (PBX1048411), the dollar order was not cancelled.  This then created a shortfall as Horizon will have expected the SPM to have taken a payment from the customer of £204.59. </p>

PC0265443 is dated 29 December 2017 but relates to a call on 17 December 2017. The Post Office’s internal cash management team’s system (which is referred to as POLSAP) indicated that the branch in Burgess Hill was holding €4,500 and US$1,000 more than the branch was declaring it held. This meant that, from the cash management team’s perspective, the branch held sufficient cash to conduct transactions, and so were reluctant to provide more cash to the branch.  This resulted in a cash flow issue for the branch who were sometimes unable to serve customers as a result. This PEAK is 57 pages long; this is many pages longer than most PEAKs, which are usually 10 pages or less. It evidences a very long investigation.  </p>

It identifies dissatisfaction from more than one SPM as to how phantom transactions are being investigated and resolved, or more accurately, how they are not being. It shows calls being “closed” – ie brought to an end, without the permission of the SPM, even though that should not be done. It also shows at least one SPM threatening not to comply with their contractual obligations due to lack of confidence in the system, and also threats of legal action. Further, in one branch, where items were the subject of phantom transactions (according to the SPM) ROMEC, the Royal Mail’s own engineers, attended that branch to fit suppressors and other equipment in an effort to rectify this.  </span>

Reconciliation discrepancies appeared but did not feature on the expected reports. The counter calculated information each day for the Cash Account in two independent ways to ensure that they matched and a report was generated if they did not match.  In this case, the reconciliation software detected discrepancies relating to two low value transactions (£8.06 and £0.08, totalling £8.14).  The PEAK suggests that “there was a bug in the reconciliation software, although the Peak is not fully conclusive” as the Post Office’s submissions recognise in this sentence that I have quoted. This would have generated a false reconciliation report but there would have been no financial impact on the branch.  The reconciliation error was captured, as that is what triggered the investigation in the PEAK.  The fix is documented in PC0047955 of 19 June 2000.

Fujitsu had issued a BIMS Incident Report to the Post Office, and had confirmed that the recovery messages were in the branch messagestore (even though they do not appear to have been shown by Horizon to the SPM in the first place). However, the branch appeared in the NB102 report again, and upon investigation this was found to be because the SPM (quite properly, in my judgment) had not followed the recovery messages because they had not taken the sums from the customer.  </p>

Nor do I see how the SPM can be criticised for “not following the recovery procedure correctly” as it is accepted that this should have occurred if the SPM had taken money from the customer, but if they had not, it should not have been followed.

I find that this was a bug, with the potential to cause lasting impact to branch accounts. Dr Worden attempts to play this down and so, in my judgment, does the Post Office. Fujitsu clearly recognised and recorded that in 2001.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">I find that this was a bug in Horizon which plainly had the potential to cause impact to branch accounts. The fact that in this specific case the discrepancy was later corrected does not, in my judgment, alter that characterisation. Indeed, on the Post Office’s own case, the accounts were affected (albeit corrected). Further, the way that PEAK PC0027581 unfolded – a lengthy PEAK which runs from July 1999 to February 2002 – shows the unsatisfactory way some of these incidents were dealt with at Fujitsu. The entry of 9 November 1999 states “….at first glance it could have a fair bit of business impact”. Even as late at August 2001 and January 2002 this PEAK was still given the code “Incident under Investigation”. One wonders quite how long Fujitsu would need properly to investigate something identified as “a bug in the Supplier’s Code” in July 2001. The final entry contains the sentence “Mr Lui [who is the SPM] is no longer employed by the Post Office and has not been for some years.” </p>

They are basically self-service kiosks, designed to avoid queuing. A customer can weigh a letter or parcel, the terminal will print the relevant stamps/labels, the customer deals with that themselves, and the item is then posted without the need for queuing.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The PEAK indicates that on 14 September 2010, Fujitsu requested detail of the specific transactions relating to the £80 loss from the SPM in order that it could carry out an investigation into the issue.  No information was provided by the SPM.  Given the absence of evidence, the matter was thereafter closed by Fujitsu as Category 95 “Final – Advice after investigation” and “no fault in product”. I find that this is a misleading description ascribed to close this PEAK. It also states “TC data is kept on the live database [BRDB] for 40 days so any txn query for a TC where it was put through the system more than 40 days previous WILL NOT show up in the branch. System is working as designed.” The first sentence of this is correct. Those timescales are indeed what occurred. However, the entry “system is working as designed” is at odds with the fact that second line support at Fujitsu had already said there was no user error. The penultimate entry in the PEAK also states “however, beyond that, I will have to request archived data from our Audit Team in order to confirm those TC txns in July 2010.” There is no evidence to suggest this was done; the matter was simply parked without any proper resolution. I find this to be evidence of a bug. Given that Mr Coyne stated in cross-examination that there was no evidence of impact on branch accounts (although the £80 referred to might suggest otherwise) I take this into account in relation to Horizon Issue 4. However, it plainly has the potential to cause impact to branch accounts and therefore should also be taken into account under Horizon Issue 1.  </p>

It is included in paragraph 5 of Appendix 2 under the heading “the following bugs had no branch impact”. It is also submitted by the Post Office that “a number of PEAKs arose in testing. The PEAKs that arose in the live environment do not indicate evidence of branch impact.” It is listed in the Bug Table as concerning Horizon Issue 4. Mr Coyne stated in the Joint Statement that “Branch accounts would be affected by this bug which would cause a discrepancy when handling cheques where the value of the cheque would be doubled” although he accepted that the SPM in question was processing a cheque in a different manner to that recommended. Dr Worden used the term “a fault” in his entries, maintained that there was no impact on branch accounts if the SPM followed correct procedures, and he also (in respect of another branch) relied upon the fact that the effect was an error of 2p only. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">PEAK PC0053160 refers to a report by a Fujitsu test team member on 29 August 2000 which concerned an issue with the Training Counter which froze when completing a transaction log report.  Further testing by Fujitsu demonstrated that the issue could also be present in the live environment, and a software fix was deployed on 6 September 2000.  Mr Coyne concluded that the fix implemented what are called regression bugs. There are references to this in the PEAK. A regression bug is something that prevents a function from operating as it should. Entries in the PEAK such as: </p>

The document was PEAK PC0053160. The entry expanding on common sense states “the developer is stating that the tester failed to re-test against an approved combination of work packages; hence the assertion by the tester that there was a code regression is incorrect”. It is also stated “work packages sometimes have interdependencies in order to provide a complete fix to any given issue.” I consider that the PEAK document was deployed in the trial in the sense that it is referenced by Dr Worden in his entry in the Bug Table, but in any event the entry relied upon is 22 September 2000 when Les Ong stated: </p>

The Post Office, again boldly, submitted at paragraph 2 on page 511 (which is part of its Appendix 2) in relation to this bug that “There is no evidence of a bug in Horizon. Each issue is an example of user error in Horizon.” I find those submissions to be verging on the extraordinary. The substantive judgment to which this is an appendix identifies what the Known Error Log is. The entries above make it clear that there is a bug – the very word chosen by the Fujitsu employee who wrote the two KELs is “bug”. To see this characterised in submission as there <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> being a bug, and being evidence of human error, is not only puzzling but flies in the face of the terms in the Fujitsu documents. I find that it is evidence of a bug. One of the PEAKs only of those listed in the Bug Table, namely PC0137437 is user error, a point identified by both Mr Coyne and Dr Worden. However, simply because one PEAK is this, does not mean that the summary submissions can be accurately stated as “There is no evidence of a bug in Horizon.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">There are some unsatisfactory aspects to the way the Post Office tries to explain its position on this bug. At paragraph 14 of its submissions, it submitted that the Post Office subsequently “reviewed ARQ data for the branch” in question on one of the PEAKs, and that “there is nothing to suggest that the branch’s remming in/out of foreign currency caused a loss in branch.” When challenged by the claimants that this was not in the evidence, the Post Office clarified by stating this came “on instructions from Post Office, which did not have an opportunity to adduce evidence on the point”. That is not correct. This submission was made in relation to PEAK PC0151787 which is the second entry in the final column in the Bug Table itself, headed “supporting evidence”. It is also referred to, correctly, in paragraph 4 of the Post Office’s submissions in the following terms “In JS2 Mr Coyne mentions three PEAKs under the heading of “<span style="font-style:italic">Bureau de Change</span>””. JS2 means the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> Experts’ Joint Statement, which was dated 25 February 2019, well before the start of the trial. There was such an opportunity, as supplementary questions in chief could have been put (or permission to do so asked) and it is wrong to suggest that the Post Office was denied the opportunity to meet this evidence. Dr Worden chose to adopt a different way of giving his expert evidence, namely very high level.   </p>

Richard at NBSC 2nd line has requested that I log a call and send to SMC.” Even Fujitsu categorise the call closure as “Defect cause updated to 42 -- Gen - Outside Pathway Control.” That is not consistent with user error.  </p>

The role that reference data plays in the operation of Horizon has been explained. Here, this led to an incorrect amount of change being displayed on the branch screen leading to the operator (which means SPM or their assistant) providing the branch customer with the wrong amount of money, thereby leaving a discrepancy in Branch Accounts. He also stated that “It is possible that the amount of change shown on screen is more than the actual money tendered by the customer.” Dr Worden’s entry was “When analysing this KEL I noted ‘Sounds like a genuine problem which may have led to giving the customer the wrong amount - i.e. not recoverable.’ It is now accepted by the Post Office in paragraph 7 of Appendix 2 as one of a number of “bugs with lasting impact (although they were resolved)”.

Depending upon what happened when the customer and the SPM did this transaction, would affect whether branch accounts were adversely affected. However, the Post Office accepts that “if the SPM recovered the transaction and incorrectly confirmed on Horizon that the top up had been successful, despite no top up receipt having been printed, the transaction would be recorded in the branch’s accounts, meaning the branch would likely have experienced a shortfall to the value of the top-up as no money would have been taken from the customer. If the SPM logged back into the counter and correctly confirmed that the transaction had not been successful, a zero value transaction would be recorded in the branch accounts and a reversal generated for the top up.  This should have resulted in the affected branch accounts being correct, but due to the reference data issues the reversal being sent to E-Pay caused E-Pay to treat the top-up incorrectly as a successful transaction.” </p>

Of the five issues: issue 1 resulted in incorrectly flagged exceptions but no reconciliation was required; issue 2 resulted in no financial or operational impact on a branch accounts and was limited solely to the  process of copying/ harvesting transactions to Post Office's back-end systems; issue 3 did not result in a mismatch between the files sent to Post Office and the branch data; issue 4 was flagged by automatic reporting and issue 5 could result in a receipts and payments mismatch thus needing reconciliation.”  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">I do find it notable that although Dr Worden says the amounts involved are what he calls “small”, he accepts it is as a “back end reporting problem” – which is nothing to do with the SPM, by definition – and also the KEL states that “the accounting tree has not handled this properly when calculating the daily recon figures and it has resulted in a mismatch…” The mismatch in that case was 66p. The accounting tree is part of the Horizon system. The KEL also appears to be incomplete because only the first page is present. The section that follows the heading “Evidence” is entirely missing. There is also nothing in terms of the text available that demonstrates what occurred in 2008, even though it is plain from the page that <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> available that the KEL was updated then.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Regardless of whether the impact was small or not – and I accept that for the most part, the amounts referred to in the PEAKs are in pence or a few pounds – this is a reflection of the fact that the cost of postage labels is relatively modest.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">The reason the counter reconciliation figures are “upset” is that the label was generated for a minus figure, namely “-£2.40”.

I will count them as a single bug, even though manifestations of the early 2005 example were dealt with as follows, taken from the Post Office submissions: “A permanent fix involving a code change was released to all branches in 2005 as part of the S80 software upgrade.” </p>

It “details PEAKs that are outstanding at S80” and the approved form of that document is in the trial bundle. The Technical Design Authority for it was Gareth Jenkins. It includes analysis of the PEAKs that affect the counter only, and the document is an addendum to another document. It identifies 45 different PEAKs that affect the counter. This document shows that there were other issues, not simply the one relating to TPSC reporting, where a decision was taken not to deal with certain errors and/or coding bugs at that time. One example only, cash volume adjustment states “This is a code error but the problem has been in the system since before S80 and doesn’t appear to be causing any significant confusion. A KEL should be raised and a fix considered in a Future Release.”. Of the 45 PEAKs in this document, most are to be dealt with at a “future release”, one is accepted (which is cosmetic), one closed, and another is to be dealt with by a documentation update. It would therefore not be correct to assume that all known PEAKs were fixed by release S80. </p>

However, the fact that a fix is needed at all demonstrates that it is a bug and that it had the potential to cause lasting impact to branch accounts. It can plainly be seen from the following analysis of the KEL. </p>

The clerk settled the transaction and the customer handed over £100. The customer checked the balance and stated that the top up had not gone through, so the clerk then performed another Drop&amp;Go transaction which was successful.

There obviously would have been in this case. The SPM has taken £100 from the customer but the Horizon system has treated it as though his branch should be debited for £200 (2 x £100) even though one of the top ups was clearly not successful because it had timed out. The other point of note is that the KEL, the trial bundle reference of which is {F/1660}, is headed “HNG-X KEL cardc235Q”, although on the dates within it (namely June and July 2017) other evidence in the trial was that the system by then was not HNG-X. This is because it became HNG-A on February 2017 when the platform became Windows 10 rather than the older platform (and by 2017 unsupported) Windows NT4. It is not therefore clear on the face of the KEL whether this bug – which it clearly is, and which I find is a bug – is within either the HNG-X or HNG-A version of Horizon Online.  </p>

The Post Office does not accept this as a bug. Mr Coyne stated that “Horizon appears to mis-handle communications, leading to errors within network banking and in turn causing the potential for branch account discrepancies.” One of these was pension transactions being declined, yet the customer’s bank account being debited; when the customer complained, the SPM themselves refunded the £50 in question. Dr Worden considered it was “mainly about a communication problem from BT, outside Horizon” but also wanted to investigate further due to an entry that referred to a “CNIM own goal”.

The associated entries go from 1 February 2011 to 9 June 2015 (even though the date on the covering page, or page 1 of the PEAK, is 14 May 2012). It is necessary to go through all the way to the final page, page 8, to see the most recent date when the PEAK was closed. Under “Impact Statement” the following entry appears “3. The customer is not aware of this problem or change”. In my judgment this shows two things. Firstly, the Post Office had not been told by Fujitsu that SSC database users did not have the correct permissions. Secondly, the Post Office had not been told by Fujitsu that a change is proposed to change this. There is a fix extensively debated in the same PEAK and the entries strongly suggest that the fix (which is the change referred to in the Impact Statement) is being done without the customer (which must be the Post Office) knowing about it.  </p>

The experts were agreed that such users could, in terms, do whatever they wanted in terms of access to the system. That could obviously have an impact on branch accounts, depending upon what was done by any particular user on any particular occasion. SSC users should only have had the far more limited SSC role and Fujitsu itself were aware of this, and can only be the entity responsible for them having the incorrect wider role, as they were all Fujitsu employees. The section of the accompanying judgment of Mr Godeseth in the judgment that accompanies this also refers to evidence from My Coyne and Mr Parker on the same subject. Mr Parker challenged Mr Coyne’s figure but had no basis for doing so, as all he had was his impression, and he had specifically failed to do a proper investigation even though I find Fujitsu could have provided far more proper, cogent evidence of the number of occasions.

Although the Bug Table was numbered 1 to 29 (suggesting there were a total of 29 separate ones) rather confusingly Bug 6 was split into two, 6(i) and 6(ii). The bugs which were accepted by the IT expert for the claimants as not providing evidence showing lasting impact on branch accounts were those in the Bug Table, other than those numbered 1 to 14 inclusive, 18, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28. That is a total of 22 different bugs that did show such evidence, but only if Bug 6 is counted as one bug. If counted as two bugs, there would be 23. This is a convoluted way of saying that in the experts’ agreement, when they agreed they had seen a range of 12 to 29 bugs that showed evidence of lasting impact to branch accounts, that upper limit should be 23 not 29. Of the other bugs, for the most part Mr Coyne considered they were relevant to Horizon Issue 4 regarding robustness.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Ultimately, the Post Office in Appendix 2 of its Closing Submissions stated that of the 29 bugs in the Bug Table, eight were not bugs at all. Those that it challenged as not being bugs at all were those numbered 8, 13, 15, 16, 17, 20, 23 and 29. This by definition means that 21 of the 29 were accepted by the Post Office as existing. This was a sensible approach; in my judgment the claimants’ evidence of the existence of those 21 as bugs was very strong. The dispute therefore moved to the effect of bugs, rather than whether they existed at all. Three were said to have had no branch impact; nine had or potentially had only transient impact; and nine were said cause or had the potential to cause lasting impact, but it was said this was resolved by the Post Office and Fujitsu.  </p>

I have found that Entry 15 was a bug; Entry 16 were software faults, albeit with no potential to cause impact to branch accounts; Entry 17 was an error or defect that only occurred once.

However, as explained above against that entry, the PEAKs show a variety of different software problems concerning Girobank. I have also found that Entries 21 and 22 are both bugs.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Arriving at an overall final total of bugs therefore is not apt to be helpful, in my judgment. This is particularly so if one attempts, as the Post Office did, to downplay their effect by introducing new concepts such as “transient” impact. All that does is dilute, or seek to confuse, in terms of the potential to cause apparent or alleged discrepancies or shortfalls relating to Subpostmasters’ branch accounts or transactions; and/or to undermine the reliability of Horizon accurately to process and to record transactions. That last sentence keeps, so far as possible, to the actual wording of Horizon Issue 1, which was agreed by the parties a long time before the Horizon Issues trial. On some of the entries in the Bug Table, such as Bug 11 concerning Girobank, I have termed it a single bug (as the experts did that) but the underlying PEAKs show multiple bugs under that single heading. It could quite easily be counted as six separate ones, a point supported by the Post Office’s own submissions identifying the six separate matters contained in the numerous PEAKs grouped by the experts under one single heading. If it is counted as six bugs, and if Bug 6(i) and 6(ii) are counted as two (which they ought to be, but which the experts grouped together in their range of “12 to 29”, (later corrected by Mr Coyne to an upper number of 23) then the total number of bugs of which I have found specific evidence of having the potential to cause impact to branch accounts is about 30.  </p>

The internal Post Office and Fujitsu documents (running through the whole life of Horizon in this example) all demonstrated, to my satisfaction, unreliability of certain branch account entries due to this doubling up of discrepancies. Even the 2018 Operations Board document showed that these were still occurring in mid-2018 – on three separate occasions in that week alone. It does not matter, in my judgment, to the claimants’ case, whether there was one single cause for these specific discrepancies, or a number of different ones, all of which had a similar effect. The claimants’ case was, in any event, that there were a number of different bugs, errors and defects in Horizon that all had this, or a similar, effect. Nor does it much matter for the purposes of the Horizon Issues whether there was one single cause, or a number of different ones over a number of years. My findings in this appendix show that there were a large number of bugs, errors and defects. There was a far larger number than were admitted by the Post Office at the beginning of the Horizon Issues trial, and a far larger number than ought to have been present in the system if Legacy Horizon and HNG-X were to be considered sufficiently robust such that they were extremely unlikely to be the cause of shortfalls in branches.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.39in">Going through the evidence, PEAKs and KELs, it can be seen that there is a slight majority of the bugs, errors and defects that I have found to exist present in Legacy Horizon, as compared to the number in Horizon Online. However, there are still a significant number in Horizon Online, although not quite as many as in Legacy Horizon. The former regarding Horizon Online are those numbered 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 (although in the pilot), 8, 13, 14, 19, 23, 25 and 28. Those in Legacy Horizon are 2, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 17 (an error or defect, not a bug), 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26 and 27. It is also notable, in my judgment, that those in Horizon Online were in its earlier years. There is only one that dates from 2017 onwards, namely bug 14, Bureau Discrepancies, with some instances of bug 8, Recovery Issues running into 2018. It must however be remembered that this analysis is on the KELs made available to the experts. A very significant number of KELs were produced by Fujitsu towards the end of the trial which the experts did not have time to consider, and an even more significant number were produced in September 2019, well after the trial had ended. Neither expert has studied these. </p>

Given there have been, effectively, three iterations of the system, the number of bugs, errors and defects have to be considered against the iteration of the system in which they occurred. An obvious example of this is Legacy Horizon and Riposte. Riposte is no longer used and has not been since 2010. A simple extrapolation across all 19 years of the life of Horizon (ie, 2000 to 2019) would not lead to a sound conclusion. In any event, the number of bugs, errors and defects that have been found by me based on the Bug Table, without extrapolation but by the above analysis, shows that there is ample material, without the need for any extrapolation, to come to measured conclusions on robustness in any event. </p>

However, that distinction undoubtedly exists and Mr Godeseth explained the switch from NT4 to Windows 10 in his evidence. The internal Post Office IT risk management document from 2017 stated that “the HNG-X platform is end of life and is running on unsupported Windows software”, that it needed replacing, and also that the "Branch counter technology is aged and unreliable, with frequent hardware failures, resulting in branch disruptions." This plainly recognised that replacing the platform, which is what occurred when the system became HNG-A, would result in some improvements, and this appears to have happened, although the counter technology in the branch would not necessarily also be changed by a change from one Windows platform (NT4) to another. The risk management document envisaged the required replacement of both. Also, it has to be taken into account that the Horizon Online bugs analysed in Part E of this appendix are, for the most part, those in HNGX. I do not see why the HNG-A form, which both experts agree is relatively robust, should be considered in exactly the same light of the PEAKs that arose (and there are a great many) during the HNG-X years. Dr Worden really only concentrated on the HNG-A iteration of the system in any event, as he considered the operation and functionality of the system as at 2018 and 2019, and this means HNG-A. He readily accepted that his reports concentrated on Horizon as it was at the time of his investigation. </p>

I accept Mr Coyne’s evidence that there are still far more TCs than expected arising during its use, compared with comparable systems in the banking and finance sectors. However, it may be that this is the only way in which it can sensibly still be operated. TCs are outside the scope of the definition of the Horizon system in any event. It is also an unavoidable conclusion that, notwithstanding the change of platform from Windows NT4 to Windows 10, it is still a Horizon system, which given my conclusions at (1) and (2) is hardly a glowing endorsement of its antecedents. However, the experts are agreed that HNG-A is robust, and better than it was in either its Legacy Horizon or HNG-X forms. Horizon is not free from bugs from any particular date. As shown by the Drop and Go bug, number 28 in the Bug Table, this occurred in June 2017 (the KEL is headed HNG-X as explained in [410] which is after the date HNG-A was introduced, so it may be a bug in HNG-A). Drop and Go appears to be a product introduced by the Post Office relatively recently, but I am unaware of the precise date.

Therefore HNG-A is included within that definition. It is also, however, relevant to record that the effect of any bugs, errors and defects in HNG-A is likely to be limited in this group litigation, as there is a cut-off date for claimants to have joined the group litigation. This cut-off date is 24 November 2017, as extended in paragraph 15 of the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Case Management Order sealed on 27 October 2017. The final date by which claims had to have been entered on to the Group Register was 8 December 2017.

He stated that “any mistake is most likely to have occurred in one column of figures, without any balancing mistakes on the other columns. So, the mistake will immediately destroy the trial balance.” The consequence of the many bugs that I have found that exist in Horizon, in both its Legacy and Online form, have the effect of making the detection of errors so much harder than in conventional double entry bookkeeping. This is demonstrated by so many of the Fujitsu documents where a great amount of investigation was required by Fujitsu simply to work out what had actually happened, and why. On many investigations this took even Fujitsu an extraordinary length of time, in excess of a year, and sometimes even two years. Members of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> line support were involved, on multiple occasions, in this process. The experts are also agreed that SPMs only had a relatively limited amount of reporting available to them on Horizon, and that proper investigation required co-operation between the Post Office and the SPMs. It must also be understood that the trading periods for each Post Office branch were usually 4 weeks, and sometimes 5 weeks. At the end of each trading period a SPM had to complete a Branch Trading Statement and then “roll over” for the next period to start. If a bug in Horizon had an impact on branch accounts, then the Branch Trading Statement for that period would include the effect of that impact.  </p>

As can be seen from the answers to the Horizon Issues in Part M of the judgment, the claimants have been largely successful in their case on the Horizon Issues. In my judgment – and regardless of whether Fujitsu and/or the Post Office was applying user error bias, or not – it is clear to me that Fujitsu was far too ready, even after investigations that clearly included the express discovery of bugs in code, to ascribe possible user error to the effect of bugs, errors and defects that caused impact to branch accounts.
