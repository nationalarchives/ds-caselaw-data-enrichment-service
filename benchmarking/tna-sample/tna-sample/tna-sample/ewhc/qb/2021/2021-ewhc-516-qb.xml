      <p style="margin-left:0.65in;margin-right:0.54in">2.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>The Claims arise from Mr. Toner’s purchasing and being granted and subsequently holding a long lease (“the Lease”) of Flat No. 57 (formerly Plot No. 229), Courtyard Apartments, 3 Avantgarde Place, London E1 6GU </p>

      <p style="margin-left:0.64in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.00in">Building”).  The Lease was dated and granted on 29 November 2013 and is made between Bishopsgate as Landlord, Avantgarde as Management Company and Mr Toner as Tenant, and followed on from an “off-plan” contract (“the Contract”) dated 21 December 2012 between them for Bishopsgate to build out the Building (including the Flat) and then for the Lease to be granted.  THL is a high-level company (or at least an associated company at a higher corporate structure level) within the “Telford” group of companies which include Bishopsgate and, at least in the past, Avantgarde. </p>
      <p style="margin-left:0.64in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.00in">The Contract itself followed a reservation agreement (“the Reservation Agreement”) dated 24 November 2012 between Mr Toner and (probably) THL, and negotiations between employees of THL and Mr Toner.  </p>
      <p style="margin-left:0.64in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.00in">Avantgarde appointed R&amp;R as its Managing Agents of the estate (“the </p>

New matters are (if at all) for subsequent attempts to amend, and much of what Mr Toner sought to advance was new material or either repetitious or not such as to impact upon what are the “legal” questions which I have to decide.  I also had to bear in mind and give weight to the “unless” order which I had made in the above circumstances, and the importance of avoiding undue pressure being exerted on the Applying Defendants or the Court by way of the adducing of new material at a very late stage. </p>

However, they are not to set out the evidence upon which they will rely to seek to prove those facts (although they can set out secondary facts from which certain primary facts may be inferred) or a general history (see e.g. White Book notes 16.4.1 and Hague Plant v Hague [2014] EWCA Civ 1609 and paragraph 30 of Portland Stone v Barclays Bank Plc [2018] EWHC 2341 and which I set out in full below), although there is often a tension between assertions that a statement of case is both over-long in terms of including evidential material and over-short in not stating enough to amount to reasonable grounds for the causes of action advanced and remedies sought, and where the Court will afford some latitude to prevent potentially meritorious cases being struck-out on technical pleading grounds. </p>

However, the Court will generally not engage in any mini-trial, although it may ask whether the Claimant lacks a real prospect of establishing a contended fact or whether a document can be construed safely (and without reference to any genuine disputes as to its factual matrix). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.64in;margin-right:0.54in">Thus, while the Applying Defendants contest that various matters are not properly pleaded at all, and while it may be open to the Applying Defendants to seek to challenge what the Claimant says and pleads are the material facts upon which the Claims are based (and I do consider this at points below), much of the essence of the Applications under both CPR3.4 and CPR24.2 are submissions from the Applying Defendants that, even assuming that those facts are established, they do not give rise to claims in law or, at least, claims which have a real prospect of success.  Thus, subject to my having to consider various specific attacks upon the Claimant’s pleadings and assertions of fact, I proceed on the basis that those facts will be proved if the matter goes to trial and ask myself then as to whether, in such circumstances, the Claimant would (or would not) succeed (or has a realistic prospect of success) in law in relation to his various claims and particular issues. </p>

The function of statements of case (or pleadings as they were previously called) is to set out the facts relied upon as giving rise to a claim in law (or from which such facts are to be inferred); while witness statements adduce the evidence from which those facts are to be proved, and which evidence should not appear in the statement of case itself. It is important that the facts are “pleaded” in the statement of case both in order to test whether the relevant party is advancing a claim which can exist in law so as to give rise to the remedies sought and so that the other party (and the court) can assess it and respond to it by their own statement of case and generally. However, the court does have to bear in mind that the line between what is “fact” and what is “evidence” may be a narrow one and one which it is difficult for litigants, especially if acting in person, to appreciate. </p>

The reason is quite simple: if the respondent's case is bad in law, he will in truth have no real prospect of succeeding on his claim or successfully defending the claim against him, as the case may be. Similarly, if the applicant's case is bad in law, the sooner that is determined, the better. If it is possible to show by evidence that although material in the form of documents or oral evidence that would put the documents in another light is not currently before the court, such material is likely to exist and can be expected to be available at trial, it would be wrong to give summary judgment because there would be a real, as opposed to a fanciful, prospect of success. However, it is not enough simply to argue that the case should be allowed to go to trial because something may turn up which would have a bearing on the question of construction: ICI Chemicals &amp; Polymers Ltd v TTE Training Ltd [2007] EWCA Civ 7252”.   </p>

I would  only add that, where a claim is defective and therefore susceptible to be struck out or subject to summary judgment, the Court should consider whether the defect in question might be cured by amendment and, if it might, should consider whether it is right to give the party in default an opportunity to make the defect good: see Hockin and Ors v RBS [2016] EWHC 92 (Ch) per Asplin J. This is another facet of the Royal Brompton Hospital principle that the Court should not merely look at the materials before it but should take account of what can reasonably be expected to be available at trial.

One of the features of claims involving fraud or deceit is the prospect that the Defendant will, if the underlying allegation is true, have tried to shroud his conduct in secrecy. This has routinely been addressed in cases involving allegations that a defendant has engaged in anti-competitive arrangements. In such cases, the Court adopts what is called a generous approach to pleadings. The approach was summarised by Flaux J in Bord Na Mona Horticultural Ltd &amp; Anr v British Polythene Industries Plc [2012] EWHC 3346 (Comm) at [29] ff.  Flaux J set out the principles in play as described by Sales J in Nokia Corporation v AU Optronics Corporation [2012] EWHC 731 (Ch) at [62]-[67], which included the existence of a tension between (a) the impulse to ensure that claims are fully and clearly pleaded, and (b) the impulse to ensure that justice is done and a claimant is not prevented by overly strict and demanding rules of pleading from introducing a claim which may prove to be properly made out at trial but may be shut out by the law of limitation if the claimant is to be forced to wait until he has full particulars before launching a claim.  Sales J indicated that this tension was to be resolved by “allowing a measure of generosity in favour of a claimant.”  Flaux J continued at [31]:  “[31] This generous approach to the pleadings in cartel claims has been endorsed by the Court of Appeal, not only in Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Company Europe Ltd v Dow Deutschland [2010] EWCA Civ 864 but most recently by Etherton LJ in KME Yorkshire Ltd v Toshiba Carrier UK Ltd [2012] EWCA Civ 1190 at [32]: "As was stated by the Court of </p>

That same generous approach was for the same reason taken by Sales J in Nokia Corporation v AU Optronics Corporation [2012] EWHC 731 in dismissing an application to strike out or to grant summary judgment against the claimant in proceedings for damages for infringement of Article 101. That approach is appropriate in the present case prior to disclosure of documents." </p>

Although the test [whether the claim has a real prospect of success] can be stated simply, its application in practice can be difficult. In my experience there can be more difficulties in applying the "no real prospect of success" test on an application for summary judgment (or on an application for permission to appeal, where a similar test is applicable) than in trying the case in its entirety (or, in the case of an appeal, hearing the substantive appeal). The decision-maker at trial will usually have a better grasp of the case as a whole, because of the added benefits of hearing the evidence tested, of receiving more developed submissions and of having more time in which to digest and reflect on the materials.… 18. In my judgment, the court should also hesitate about making a final decision without a trial where, even though there is no obvious conflict of fact at the time of the application, reasonable grounds exist for believing that a fuller investigation into the facts of the case would add to or alter the evidence available to a trial judge and so affect the outcome of the case." </p>

As Lord Millett put it, there must be some fact “which tilts the balance and justifies an inference of dishonesty.” At the interlocutory stage … the court is not concerned with whether the evidence at trial will or will not establish fraud but only with whether facts are pleaded which would justify the plea of fraud.

The “facts on which the Claimant relies” should be no less and no more than the facts which the Claimant must prove in order to succeed in her or his claim. Practice Direction 16PD8.2 mandates that the Claimant must specifically set out any allegation of fraud, details of any misrepresentation, and notice or knowledge of a fact where he wishes to rely upon them in support of his claim. The Queen’s Bench Guide provides guidelines which should be followed: they reflect good and proper practice that has been universally known by competent practitioners for decades. They include that “a statement of case must be as brief and concise as possible and confined to setting out the bald facts and not the evidence of them”: see 6.7.4(1). A statement of case exceeding 25 pages is regarded as exceptional: experience shows that most cases can be accommodated in well under 25 pages even where the most serious allegations are made.  Experience also shows that prolix pleadings normally tend to obfuscate rather than to serve their proper purpose of identifying the material facts and issues that the parties have to address and the Court has to decide.  </p>

It seems to me that the following principles are well established, at least as articulated in relation to summary disposal under Pt 24 of the CPR. (1) The purpose of resolving issues on a summary basis and at an early stage is to save time and costs and courts are encouraged to consider an issue or issues at an early stage which will either resolve or help to resolve the litigation as an important aspect of active case management: see Kent v Griffiths (No. 3) [2001] QB 36 at p. 51B–C. This is particularly so where a decision will put an end to an action. (2) In deciding whether to exercise powers of summary disposal, the court must have regard to the overriding objective. (3) The court should be slow to deal with single issues in cases where there will need to be a full trial on liability involving evidence and cross examination in any event and/or where summary disposal of the single issue may well delay, because of appeals, the ultimate trial of the action. (4) The court should always consider whether the objective of dealing with cases justly is better served by summary disposal of the particular issue or by letting all matters go to trial so that they can be fully investigated, and a properly informed decision reached. The authority for principles (2)–(4) is to be found in:  Three Rivers District Council v Bank of England (No. 3) [2003] 2 AC 1  per Lord Hope at paras 92–93, considering Swain v Hillman </p>

THL was marketing long leases of various flats (called “Plots”) for contacts for sale “off-plan” with completion of the relevant lease to take place following completion of the relevant flat.  Mr Toner went to a marketing presentation on 18 October 2012 at which there was a model of the proposed Building (“the Model”). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.65in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Toner says that the Model showed the exterior of the Building with the fifth floor flats (which have floor-to-ceiling windows) having balconies which were symmetric in form, appeared to be open to the sky and to have something like average waist height (say 3 foot) high clear transparent external panel guards and so that from inside each flat it would be possible, even when seated inside, to look out and both through and over the flat’s Balcony to whatever view available in the relevant direction beyond the Building.  This was to be contrasted with lower floors where flats were shown with some opaque panels.  He says that he had emphasised to him by sales staff subsequently the attractiveness of floor to ceiling windows and unobstructed external views from inside the Flat externally to the city skyline.  He has produced an email exchange over 11-13 November 2012 (“the November 2012 Emails”) in which he talked about Plot 229 having “unobstructed views of the City “ which is consistent with his having that understanding and having gained it from some source. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.65in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Toner has produced a copy brochure (“the Brochure”) which he accepts he was not provided with at the time but only obtained later at some point which he cannot recall.  It shows both a picture of the Model and internal (looking out) and external mock-ups of the Building to the above effect and contains various references to the views and vistas to be enjoyed from the Flats. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.65in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">The picture of the Model in the Brochure appears to have also on it a statement “Information on this model is indicative only and should not be relied upon as accurately showing the layout… and is subject to change from time to time in accordance with planning permissions yet to be obtained during the course of construction.  The information on this model is for guidance only and should not be relied upon as accurately describing any of the specific matters proscribed by any other under the Property Misdescriptions Act 1991.  This information does not constitute a contract, part of a contract, or warranty.”  A somewhat similar wording appears at one point in the Brochure in small print although seemingly directed to particulars of specific design elements (with no mention of balconies). </p>

Mr Toner also says that there must have been plans and specifications of THL and Bishopsgate to such above effect in view of what had been lodged with the planning department. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.65in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">I am unclear as to the extent to which THL and Bishopsgate (and Avantgarde and the other Defendants) actually disagree with the above.  They appear to accept that there was a later planning variation to legitimise the Balcony as actually built (with a high opaque barrier); and Ms Proferes, counsel for THL and Bishopsgate, said on instructions that they do not (presently) know at what point it was decided to depart from what has previously had planning approval.  In any event, Mr Toner’s factual case as to these factual matters, including that until after the grant of the Lease the then planning permission provided for a clear etc. Balcony (and not a Balcony in the form constructed), appears to have a real prospect of success on the evidence; and the relevant challenges to his case are mainly matters of law and interpretation.   </p>

Mr Toner appears now to read something sinister into this event, but I am unable, on the present evidence, to see that as anything other than mere speculation in circumstances where particular (especially “off-plan”) buyers may well come in and out of play as marketing proceeds, and sellers may well seek to emphasise deadlines in an effort to persuade buyers to make legal commitments (but where buyers may always choose to seek more time or to refuse). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.65in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Toner also says, and I accept, that the marketing material suggested that he instruct a particular firm of solicitors Alexander JLO Solicitors (“Alexanders”) to act for him on his purchase of the Lease and that he did so.  Mr Toner says that those solicitors failed him in various ways, and that they were, in effect, creatures of THL (and Bishopsgate and Avantgarde) or at least likely not to question what they proposed.  He has, however, not advanced any claim based upon this, and if he was to do so then I think that that would have to be distinctly pleaded out in order that it could be seen precisely what was being said and so that that could be responded to, assessed and tested.  Mr Toner has not brought any claim against those solicitors (and who he suggested had inappropriately destroyed his file) and any such claim would now be likely to be limitation barred.  That does not, of course, relieve the Defendants from any claims which may exist against them, but it does mean, I think, that I should approach matters on the basis that (at least from the Contract to the grant of the Lease) Mr Toner had solicitors acting for him who would have owed him the usual duties. </p>

Mr Toner says that it substantially obstructs the external views from inside the Flat (and, at least if sitting down or of limited height, from the Balcony itself) towards the City of London and towards other notable landmarks such as the Olympic Stadium.  That may be disputed but is a question of fact which I cannot resolve on a summary judgment application.  There is no suggestion that Mr Toner was informed of during the period between the Contract and its completion, and Ms Proferes told me, on instructions, that it is not known as to when it was decided that this form of construction should take place.

The words refer to conduct of relevant defendants (here in particular Avantgarde in relation to its demands for service charge) which post-dates the grant of the Lease, and which conduct cannot have induced the entry into of the Lease (or the Contract) which had happened earlier.

I did not find the Particulars of Claim very clear as to whether Mr Toner was alleging that (i) when the alleged representations were made to him the relevant defendants had already decided that the Balcony would take a different form from that represented or (ii) the decision was taken later and whether before or after the Contract (although obviously before the grant of the Lease).  However, Mr Toner clarified this during the hearing to say that he did not know, and that this had been concealed from him, and he wished to advance both alternatives.  It then turned out that Ms Proferes for THL and Bishopsgate could not tell me when the decision had been taken and which lends support to Mr Toner’s contention that he should not have to commit himself one way or another. </p>

In circumstances where a decision must have been taken as to the Balcony’s form at some point, it is those Defendants (who took the decision) and not Mr Toner who have the relevant information and documents.

However, that does not make the original representation either false or fraudulent, in fact the opposite.

(3) Third, this condition was not a ‘take it or leave it’ condition of the kind sometimes imposed in small print on consumers, acting without legal advice, in consumer transactions. It was a special condition agreed by the parties’ lawyers in circumstances where the parties had equal and corresponding negotiating positions. Moreover, such condition had the general imprimatur of the Eastbourne Law Society and was, it is to be inferred, in common use. That, too, is a further factor indicating reasonableness. (4) Fourth, and I think this is a particular striking feature in the present case, the condition, expressly by its terms, permitted the claimants to rely on written statements made by the defendants’ solicitors in replying to pre-contract enquiries or otherwise in correspondence. Thus, if the claimants wished to rely on what had been said to them orally the means for giving legal effect to that were readily available: that is, by an appropriate written pre-contract enquiry or solicitor's letter. Such a request would reveal just what the defendant vendors were prepared formally to commit themselves to.” </p>

He directed himself by reference to the three cases to which I have referred. It cannot be said either that he misdirected himself in law, or that he took into account irrelevant factors or ignored relevant ones. Although there is some force in the landlords’ argument, I do not consider that there is any ground in this case for interfering with the judge's overall assessment of the application of the test of reasonableness. Indeed, in my judgment, he was right to stress the importance of precontract enquiries in the field of conveyancing; and right in the conclusion to which he came. As the judge said, if clause 5.8 governs the landlords’ liability the important function of replies to enquiries before contract becomes worthless. Although there might be a case where, on exceptional facts, a clause which precludes reliance on replies to enquiries before contract might be held to satisfy the test of reasonableness even where those replies have in fact been relied on, I find it very hard to imagine what those facts might be. Of course, the existence of the non-reliance clause may itself be evidence of non-reliance; as was indeed the case in one of the claims that I considered in the FoodCo UK llp case [2010] EWHC 358 : see paras 116–</p>

To hold otherwise would be to deprive the term of much of its intended force and especially where if Mr Toner succeeded against THL then THL might have rights of indemnity against Bishopsgate. </p>

The same can be said of what was provided to Alexanders and it can be argued that nothing was said there about the Balcony because it was desired not to tell the prospective purchaser of the change.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.54in">However, it seems to me that there is a potential difference with regard to fraudulent misrepresentation.  If THL was fraudulent, then as THL was, at least reasonably arguably, acting as agent for all the then relevant Telford companies, including Avantgarde, then Avantgarde would be potentially liable for any fraud on the part of its agent (as occurred in Glossop v Contact 2019 EWHC 2314).  Further, Mr Toner asserts that there were common directors between the various companies, and thus there are real arguments that Avantgarde is to be imputed knowledge of the alleged fraud from which it was deriving the benefit of the Contract to which it was a party, and it is difficult to see how the mere fact of the utilisation of different companies within the same corporate group in such circumstances can be used necessarily to enable one company to escape from the consequences of a fraudulent misrepresentation from another inducing a contract to which it was a party.  Mr Moss submits that Avantgarde’s signature to the Contract was a mere formality; but I am not persuaded by that submission as Avantgarde is a genuine (and important) contracting party, and where the Contract provided for the Lease where Avantgarde has a very real role and rights and obligations.  It seems to me that Mr Toner has real prospects of success against Avantgarde. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:0.54in">The Court of Appeal in Tameside v Barlows regarded the delivery of possession as being the key determinant (absent a specific contractual provision) of when that later point in time and later cause of action arose.  That may only be particularly relevant in a case such as Tameside where the contractor (rather than the employer) had possession of the land, but that is also the case here (as the Seller had possession until completion).  Ms Proferes submits that what is important is “practical completion” but the Court of Appeal stressed “delivery of possession”, and, while they did not explain their reasoning, it seems reasonable to infer that in those circumstances it is either because the contractual obligation was to deliver possession of the buildings in a completed state in conformity with the contract or because as a matter of construction of the contract the parties could not have intended that the further cause of action would arise before then (and so that the employer would be able, and might have to sue, before obtaining possession). The Court of Appeal judgment seems, if anything, to differentiate the concept of practical completion from delivery of possession and to treat the second cause of action as accruing the latest of such points.  In relation to a contract such as the </p>

The Contract does not use the expression at all.

This could, in theory, create a further set of obligations to rectify any breach of Clause 7 within such “as soon as practicable” period (and thus giving rise to a further cause of action once such reasonable time expired without compliance).  However, in any event, Clause 14 seems to envisage an obligation to have complied with Clause 7 as at completion, and which, especially in the light of Tameside, would strongly suggest that a later cause of action for noncompliance then arose </p>

Where the builder and the Seller were the same person, there is no reason to suppose that the relevant obligation was not to have been complied with at that particular point in time.  </p>

Ms Proferes contends that the NHBC determination process concluded that many Defects did not exist and that has the effect that it is an abuse (or equivalent to res judicata) for Mr Toner to bring a  Claim that those Defects did (and do) exist.  I disagree.  The Buildmark Policy makes very clear that it is an insurance policy provided by NHBC, where NHBC insists that its Resolution Process is followed in order for a claim to exist against NHBC, and it is difficult to see why Mr Toner’s recourse in that way to NHBC should be determinative so as to prevent him bringing claims against Bishopsgate even though the Buildmark Policy may suggest (although only in a roundabout manner) that the “Builder” is in some way party to it.  Moreover, the general principle is that if a legal right is to be taken away from somebody by a contract then it should be said so expressly.  However, in any event, the Buildmark Policy makes clear in its section 2 and pages 22-23 that if the Buyer disagrees with the outcome of the Resolution Service then the Buyer can seek to have the court determine the matter.  Looking at the Buildmark Policy as a whole, it seems to me clear that using the Resolution Service does not prevent the Buyer suing the Builder if the Buyer disagrees with the outcome; but, in any event, Mr Toner has real prospects of success as to this. </p>

There is reference in the County Court Claim Particulars of Claim to clause 6 but Avantgarde are not a party to those proceedings.  It is the statements of case (and not the witness statements) which govern what is being alleged in the Claim, and it does not seem to me that any case is being raised against Avantgarde with regard to what has happened regarding the Building since the grant of the Lease.

I am not sure whether Mr Toner is seeking directly to enforcing those contractual provisions against R&amp;R (as opposed to relying upon them as background in relation to his other claims against R&amp;R).  However, R&amp;R were not party either to the Contract or to the Lease, and so did not owe any obligations to anyone under either of them.  Mr Toner has claimed in written submissions that he should have remedies for breaches of clause 6, but the law is that it is the party to a contract who is responsible to perform their obligations under it. Although the existence of the Proviso is unfortunate for Mr Toner, he entered into the Lease (with the advice of Alexanders) and although there can sometimes be consumer law challenges to such terms, any such claim would be against Avantgarde and no such case is advanced. </p>

The question whether the imposition of a duty of care would be fair, just and reasonable forms part of the assessment of whether such an incremental step ought to be taken. It follows that, in the ordinary run of cases, courts should apply established principles of law, rather than basing their decisions on their assessment of the requirements of public policy. Secondly, the decision reaffirmed the significance of the distinction between harming the claimant and failing to protect the claimant from harm (including harm caused by third parties), which was also emphasised in <span style="font-style:italic">Mitchell</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Michael</span> . Thirdly, the decision confirmed, following <span style="font-style:italic">Michael</span> and numerous older authorities, that public authorities are generally subject to the same general principles of the law of negligence as private individuals and bodies, except to the extent that legislation requires a departure from those principles. That is the basic premise of the consequent framework for determining the existence or nonexistence of a duty of care on the part of a public authority.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.54in">However, the situation seems to me to be different potentially where the alleged duty is asserted to be one not to carry out a positive physical action or is linked to a positive physical action which has been taken or is being continued by R&amp;R.  That distinction is reflected in the citation from Poole v GN.  If the relevant action is such as to affect Mr Toner in the reasonable enjoyment of his Flat, even if only by the continuance of the underlying cause which is in the control or has been the creation of the actor, then the law of nuisance potentially applies, and if the relevant action is reasonably foreseeably going to harm Mr Toner (and he is sufficiently proximate) then that is a classic situation where a duty to take reasonable care exists (being essentially the “neighbour” Donoghue v Stevenson principle).  There is no, or least not necessarily any, impermissible extension of the recognised duties of care.  It also seems to me that they may be a different position where there has been a failure to rectify the existence of a known physical or other danger to safety or health resulting in the sustaining of injury or damage to health.  Such situations have been held to give rise to duties of care where someone with control of the situation has failed to take reasonable steps to avert the danger, and, while I note that R&amp;R was and is merely a manager rather than having a property interest, I do not think that that it is sufficiently clear for summary judgment that a duty would not exist in such circumstances.  However, such claims relate to matters and damage regarding personal safety and health and not simply economic loss. </p>

As long as R&amp;R are supplying the correct figures for whatever has been expended, it is for Avantgarde to decide whether or not those amounts (or only some of them) are to be included in the Service Charge demands.  R&amp;R’s role is mechanistic, they are not involved in the relevant disputes between Mr Toner and THL/Bishopsgate (or Avantgarde) and it is not pleaded by Mr Toner that they have failed to act properly in that regard.  I do not think that Mr Toner has real prospects of success in this regard.  While it may be that Avantgarde has claims against R&amp;R in relation to the matters identified by Mr Toner (including if R&amp;R’s alleged failures had made matters worse and resulted in increased cost, and possibly for loss of amenity), and that it might be said that such should be taken into account with regard to Service Charge in some way, those (if they were capable of existing in law and fact) would be claims of Mr Toner against Avantgarde and not R&amp;R. </p>

In the former case the test usually applied was whether the matter complained of was calculated to hold the claimant up to “hatred, contempt, or ridicule”. This “ancient formula” was, however, insufficient in all cases, for a person’s business reputation may be damaged in ways which nobody would connect with “hatred, ridicule or contempt”, as, for instance, the imputation of a clever fraud which however much to be condemned morally and legally might yet not excite what a member of the jury might understand as hatred or contempt. Lord Atkin in Sim v Stretch applied the test, “would the words tend to lower the claimant in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally”. Or, in the words of Neill LJ in Gillick v BBC would the words be “likely to affect a person adversely in the estimation of reasonable people generally”. The alternative “or which would cause him to be shunned or avoided” must be added to cover such cases as an imputation of insanity. What is defamatory in one era may not continue to be so in another. The most common direction given to juries in recent times was that a defamatory allegation is one that tends to make reasonable people think the worse of the claimant.” </p>

The term “special damage” is confusing. It is often used to describe a specific and quantifiable financial loss. In that sense it can be contrasted with a general loss of business or profits which is said to be general damage. However, a general loss of profits is considered sufficient damage which would entitle a claimant to bring a slander action, provided such loss was foreseeable. The authorities are not entirely clear on the question of whether in such cases, when the special damage has been proved, damages may be recovered only for the special damage proved or in accordance with general principles. The balance of opinion appears to be that the damages are limited to the proved special damage. The special damage must not be too remote, and in particular must not result from unauthorised repetition.”  </p>

A claimant who wishes to achieve this end by swift remedial action will want his action to be heard as soon as possible. Such claims ought therefore to be pursued with vigour, especially in view of the ephemeral nature of most media publications. These considerations have led to the uniquely short limitation period of one year which applies to such claims and explain why the disapplication of the limitation period in libel actions is often described as exceptional.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.54in">I think that Mr Beresford’s first point that the words are unspecific and simply insults without reference to specific conduct has force, although perhaps less so in relation to the “chatting-up” allegation but where it is questionable as to whether such an allegation is or is not defamatory in modern culture.  On the other hand, much might depend upon the precise words and the particular context, and I think that I should be cautious to resolve matters summarily against Mr Toner on that basis.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.54in">I think also that Mr Beresford’s third point has theoretical force but again that it would be problematic to resolve matters against Mr Toner on that basis.  The County Court Claim is within time (or at least arguably so as Mr Toner states that the papers were delivered to the County Court for issue within time) and this is an alleged sequence of defamatory statements.  The full history is going to have to be considered in any event, both with regard to liability if the harassment claim continues and, in any event, with regard to loss in relation to the other claims.  I do not think that it would be right to hold that Mr Toner has no real prospects of obtaining a limitation extension under section 32A. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.54in">However, I do think that Mr Beresford is right in relation to his second point.  Slander requires proof of “special damage” and which has to be financial in nature.  The only financial loss pleaded is in Paragraphs 50d and 50e of the County Court Particulars of Claim to the effect that the resultant distress and his work on the legal case has resulted in Mr Toner being unable to earn income and that the matters would have to be declared on a sale of the Flat and would result in diminution of its value.  I do not think that this is sufficiently connected so as to amount to “special damage” caused by the slander within the meaning of the authorities, and which generally relates to the behaviour of those to whom the slander is published (or republished) acting so as to cause the victim financial loss.  Since Mr Prodromou has left, even if the slander had to be disclosed (which seems dubious), I cannot see how it would affect the value of the Flat. </p>

	      </a>), but it is not said that that those two occasions must individually, ie standing each by itself, amount to harassment. The reason why the statute is drafted in this way is not hard to understand. Take the typical case of stalking, or of malicious phone calls. When a defendant, D, walks past a claimant C's door, or calls C's telephone but puts the phone down without speaking, the single act by itself is neutral, or may be. But if that act is repeated on a number of occasions, the course of conduct may well amount to harassment. That conclusion can only be arrived at by looking at the individual acts complained of as a whole. The course of conduct cannot be reduced to or deconstructed into the individual acts, taken solely one by one. So it is with a course of communications such as letters. A first letter, by itself, may appear innocent and may even cause no alarm, or at most a slight unease. However, in the light of subsequent letters, that first letter may be seen as part of a campaign of harassment.  </p>

Having found the third letter to be arguably capable of amounting to harassment, he never went back to ask himself how the three letters were to be looked at together as a possible course of conduct. Of course, it is always feasible that a number of disparate instances are not capable of being aggregated into a course of conduct, because, for instance, they are too separated in time or subject-matter. However, that does not apply in this case (although it could have applied to the 2006 letters if Mr Iqbal had persisted in relying upon them). The three letters were close in time, all headed by reference to the Butt litigation, and at any rate arguably, connected with one another.” </p>

It is not defined in the PHA, but it constitutes genuinely offensive and unacceptable behaviour of an order of gravity which would sustain criminal liability, and it includes, but is not limited to, alarming or causing distress to another person. The action element of the crime (or tort) consists of carrying out that type of conduct. The mental element of the crime (or tort) is made out if the perpetrator knows that the perpetrator's course of conduct amounts to harassment, or if a reasonable person in possession of the same information as the perpetrator would think that it amounted to harassment. There is no requirement that harm, or even alarm or distress, be actually foreseeable, although in most cases it will be.  </p>

I am unable to see how the requirements for there to be a course of conduct which (1) amounts to harassment of another, and (2) the defendant knows or ought to know amounts to harassment of the other can be given sensible effect if there is contained within the concept of "harassment" a further mental element. Giving the word "calculated" the primary meaning advocated on behalf of ENRC and Diligence (a) would involve requiring the defendant to know that the conduct in question is conduct which the defendant intends to alarm the complainant or cause the claimant distress (or, perhaps, in respect of which the defendant is reckless as to the consequences) and (b) even more problematically, in circumstances where the defendant for some reason lacked that knowledge, would involve requiring that a reasonable person in possession of the same information as the defendant would think that the conduct in question is conduct which the defendant (subjectively) intends to alarm the complainant or cause the claimant distress (or, perhaps, in respect of which the defendant is reckless as to the consequences). This seems to me infelicitous, convoluted and unworkable. It also seems to me unnecessary. In my view, section 1 works perfectly well as I consider it to have been explained by Lord Nicholls and Lady Hale, without adding to the statutory words.  </p>

That is an issue which I am reluctant to decide on the applications which are at present before me. However, I am not persuaded that the correct meaning is "more likely than not" as opposed to a lesser or more flexible meaning such as "sufficiently likely in all the circumstances". I say this for the following principal reasons: </p>

Denying the existence of a breach, and not doing anything about it, may lead to an increase in the resultant loss and recoverable damages (and which I bear in mind would seem to mean that the material within the harassment claim is going to be in evidence and relevant to any trial on the misrepresentation, contract and breach of duty claims in any event) but I do not see how, however unreasonable or deliberate the relevant stance is, it can be said to be </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.54in">Mr Beresford submits forcefully that even if unpleasant these matters should not cross the boundary.  However, they have to be seen in the overall context and will take on a particular light in the course of the evidence given at a trial.  I do not think that Mr Toner’s case is so obviously unsustainable that reasonable grounds have not been pleaded or that he does not have a real prospect of success. </p>
