Such lack of co-operation is, as is the risk of further offending, something that is to be taken into account in determining whether detention should continue and it is plainly something which can lead to an extension of what is considered to be a "reasonable" period for detention (Lumba) and R (Kajuga) v Secretary of State for the </span>

It is a matter of common sense that if a person obstructs the deportation process and fails to cooperate with the Secretary of State then the 'reasonable' period will be longer and probably much longer. While it may not be indefinite, it may certainly extend to a period covering, if necessary, a number of years, provided the Secretary of State makes real and continuous efforts to ascertain where the detainee has come from and should be deported to.

The purpose of the power of deportation is to remove a person who is not entitled to be in the United Kingdom and whose continued presence would not be conducive to the public good. If the reason why his presence would not be conducive to the public good is because of a propensity to commit serious offences, protection of the public from that risk is the purpose of the deportation order and must be a relevant consideration when determining the reasonableness of detaining him pending his removal or departure.  </span>

I reject the characterisation of him within the records as essentially an untruthful and/or devious man who has consistently deceived people in the UK since he was 13 years old and throughout detention. It was and is a lazy and superficial analysis which fails to reflect the detailed history of his time in this country and specifically within administrative detention.    </span>

Indeed consideration of Newham’s records provided a wealth of information about the Claimant. At some stage the social services came into possession of a document, an “Attestation de Naissance”.

Also that his father died when he was a baby and he did not know what his father died of and that he had a lot of family in Zaire which included grandparents, aunts and uncles, he went to school in Zaire, and had many friends</span>

Such hyperbole is to be deprecated. It obscured the facts and also evidences a failure to consider the full details of the Claimant’s case.

Given the amount of documentation that the Defendant had access to through the information the Claimant had already provided, and the fact that he had an outstanding application for ILR, it was a rather poorly thought through attempt to deceive. Having heard his evidence it is my assessment of the Claimant (which I suspect that he may agree with) that he is neither well educated nor particularly clever and on occasions has done (in his words) some “stupid” things which he later came to regret. The claim to be from Somalia, which cannot in any way be condoned as it was a deliberate attempt to be obstructive through lying, fits into that category. When it was pointed out by the immigration officer that he stated in the past he had admitted he was from the DRC he simply stated he could not remember what he had said in the past. He said nothing in detail about Somalia other than he knew that he had been born there. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">“ So if there was indeed so much ongoing and careful scrutiny of the arrangements for release of a man still considered a flight risk and subject to bail how did the regrettable state of affairs that occurred that night possibly come to unfold without anyone realizing what would happen? Viewed objectively and given the history of the case and the conscious decision not to explain it I am sadly forced to the finding that something went very badly wrong in the decision making process. Given all the circumstances it difficult to accept that it was just yet another “administrative oversight”. I can go no further without speculation. However, what I am now satisfied happened is more than enough to cause me very real concern. Indeed viewed with no mitigation the conduct amounted to little short of contempt for his well being. Worse still the position he was placed in was likely to tempt him to abscond or seek money or food with potential consequences for members of the public. In the absence of any other information as to how events came to pass I consider it as little short of shameful conduct. The courts hear criticism of the approach of other countries to the welfare of individuals pending immigration or asylum decisions with the assumption that such conduct could never occur here. However, this case proves that all may not always be as it should be. I sincerely hope that following this judgment the circumstances of the Claimant’s release are carefully reviewed.”  </span>

I can also only repeat my view that, to say the least, it is illogical and inconsistent to have previously formed a view that given a person’s previous conviction for robbery, a lack of access to means of support would be likely to lead a detainee to financial crime if released on bail and then to release him in the evening, without accommodation or any means (not even his own prison funds) effectively onto the streets. On the Defendant’s own analysis which had justified years of detention this was putting the public at significant and avoidable risk. As luck would have it the Claimant was initially assisted by his sister. He eventually obtained section 4 accommodation</span>

It was, and is, right to pay due regard in particular to the fact that during part of the first period detention, after initial cooperation, the Claimant changed his story and lied, claiming to be Somalian for a period of 10 months. However, this self-limiting period did and does not provide what has been described by the appellate courts as a “trump card” to the Defendant to excuse prior and subsequent failures to adequately assesses and progress the Claimant’s case. By the stage that he chose to lie and not cooperate, the Claimant had already been in detention for over 14 months with the Defendant achieving no significant progress despite the information he provided. In my judgment had the case been pursed with reasonable diligence he would not have reached the stage of embarking on such ill thought through deception.  He was also showing signs of the subsequently diagnosed mental health problems. In my judgement it would be wholly wrong not to view this period when the Claimant was not only not cooperating but actively trying to deceive the Defendant, in its proper context. Further and tellingly, it also came to an end, yet thereafter the Defendant still could not progress matters through to deportation.</span>

Refusal of voluntary return does not axiomatically equate to a risk of absconding a fortiori a high one. In the Claimant’s case reviews progressed in ignorance of all the relevant factors to enable a fair and proper assessment of the risk of absconding, including, most notably the outstanding application for leave to remain, history with social services and his family connections. Also the risk of absconding was repeatedly overstated on what was known, with over reliance on one incident of a failure to report, and used as a trump card within detention reviews which at times contained formulaic justifications in relation to absconding applied without adequate consideration.</span>

On careful scrutiny, much of the relevant period was characterised by what Mr Ó Ceallaigh described as “total inactivity” and, after an initial period which would have been required for investigation and decision making, the Defendant did not come close to satisfying the high duty upon a body administratively detaining without charge to progress matters. The Claimant had extensive records which were available to the Defendant, had just basic investigative steps been taken in light of the information that he had provided. The Defendant took more than two years just to reach a decision to deport the Claimant.</span>

Had the Defendant’s case officers been pursuing matters with reasonable diligence these leads would have been followed up and cross-referenced.

It would also have produced the birth registration document and revealed that whilst the records showed that his birth/family name was Mayela Sambea that he had been known/recognised as Sam Louis from when he was a child, and this was acknowledged and indulged, by social workers. This would have put the perceived use of “5 aliases” in a completely different light and should have weighed against the likelihood of the Claimant absconding.  He had been under the supervision of a local authority since he was 13 years old and settled in a single area close to family members for years. He hoped to be granted leave to remain and had solicitors. He had obvious reasons not to abscond.

In my view this was also not a “trump card” and needed to be viewed in the context of the information.  On 27th January 2012 it was returned. It confirmed that the Claimant’s nationality was the DRC. The accompanying letter asserted that the Claimant qualified under exceptions 1 and 2 of s.33 of the UK Borders Act 2007 in that removal would breach his Article 8 rights. So the Claimant had now stated for months that he was a national of DRC and had given details of his history in the UK. As I have already set out the picture was a far cry from the facts in several of the cases cited to me of foreign nationals refusing to co-operate with the Defendant. It also further evidences the inaccuracy of the statements in the later reviews that the Claimant was completely uncooperative with any reasonable request of the UK Border Agency. In my view, given all the circumstances and the length of time already spent in detention, the Defendant should have taken no more than a month to act on the completed questionnaire. </span>

I am not satisfied that matters would have been seen as clearly as he submits. It is important to note that the representations were not certified when they were eventually addressed in 2019. In any event they needed to be addressed, and given the history of delay even when a decision was considered urgent (e.g. August 2011) this was likely to take months. In the interim they gave the Claimant hope of avoiding detention which fed into the limited risk of absconding (which he had not done for over four months) and the reasonableness of detention. On the Defendant’s own policy detention must be used sparingly and for the shortest period necessary. In my judgment the existence of the representations was part of the circumstances to be taken into account when considering the second principle.         </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">I accept that the Claimant had developed maladaptive personality traits prior to his detention. A number of incidents had culminated in the offences for which he was given a custodial sentence. He had been separated from his parents at a relatively young age, was probably exposed to very difficult things in his youth, had arrived in a new country where he did not speak the language and was shortly thereafter effectively rejected by a close family member (his brother). Thereafter he was under social services care/support, without parental assistance and attending at a school where he did not speak the language. He suffered enuresis. He had no consistent role models. Finally, there is reference to him associating with ‘a bad crowd”. However, it is very important to note the point made by Dr Qurashi that the Claimant seems to have coped very well with his period in custody for his offences. There was no reference to any mental health issues and he even appears to have benefited from the classes and behaved well. Given the pressures and challenges of prison life if the Claimant had a very strong, or even a strong, predisposition to use maladaptive strategies such behaviour over a prolonged period would be highly unlikely. This period contrasts very sharply with the detention, at times seemingly without limit, which followed from May 2011. In my view Mr McLaren placed too much emphasis on maladaptive personality traits. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">I also do not accept Dr McLaren’s view that the Claimant’s immigration status was the major stressor that led to the development of his mental illness. If so it would have been likely to have manifested itself well before February 2012. In my view immigration status was a stressor but the major stressor, and effective causative factor of his illness, was the fact of detention (seemingly without an end in sight).  Dr McLaren agreed with Mr Ó Ceallaigh that the fact that no decision to deport was taken for two years would have been a major stressor for the Claimant who was in detention and separated from his relatives. As set out at paragraph 4.10.43 of Dr McLaren’s report there came a stage when the Claimant stated he was not even bothered about his immigration status. He had “given up” caring. I also note that it does not appear that manipulative behaviour was thought at the time to be a strong element of his presentation. Indeed there was only one reference to such behaviour within the records. In my judgment the main operative cause in the deterioration in the Claimant’s health was that he was in prison/detention without the hope of imminent release.   </span>
