	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.23in">The Claimant, who was born on 24 May 1973 and is therefore now 47 years old, was injured in an accident at work on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"> </span>March 2015. At that time, he was employed by the Defendant, a company based in Chester, as their Head of IT. On the day of the accident he and another employee of the Defendant, Mr Craig Jones (who was employed at the time as a Facilities Assistant, but now is the Defendant’s Facilities Manager), were involved in removing items from the cellar of premises known as the Old Palace in Chester. These premises had been occupied by the Defendant as offices, but which were to be handed back to the landlord. It is common ground that, during the course of this work, the Claimant went to assist Mr Jones and, in so doing, struck his head on a low part of the ceiling of the cellar.  </p>

In addition, the Defendant contends that damages should be reduced by reason of the Claimant’s alleged contributory negligence in respect of the happening of the accident. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.23in">The trial took place in late February/early March 2021. By reason of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was agreed that much of the evidence and submissions should be heard remotely. However, the parties favoured the evidence of the Claimant himself being given in person. Given the serious allegations made against him by the Defendant as set out below and the importance of his credibility, it seemed to the parties that the interests of justice called for Mr Long to give evidence in person and for this reason the first day of the hearing was accommodated in the Royal Courts of Justice, with Counsel, the Claimant’s solicitor, the Claimant and the Claimant’s wife attending in person. Other people, including the Defendant’s solicitor and medical experts were able to attend remotely using the CVP system. The trial lasted in total seven days, of which a small part of the first day and the entirety of the final day was spent in dealing with submissions, the evidence spanning nearly 6 days, some of which were longer than the usual court day. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.23in">Whether it was strictly necessary for the Claimant’s evidence to be given at an in-person hearing is a moot point. Like Mr John Kimbell QC, sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Hyde et al v Nygate (One Blackfriars Limited)</span> [2021] EWHC 684 (Ch), I have found that remote hearings generally allow the Judge to have at least as good an opportunity to assess the reliability and credibility of a witness as do hearings in person. Whilst there may be other reasons to hold attended hearings when circumstances allow, I have not found any reason to think that my ability to assess witnesses in a remote hearing is less than satisfactory. It certainly did not do so in respect of the witnesses who gave evidence remotely in this case. </p>

His claim for damages is formulated on the basis that he suffered a mild Traumatic Brain Injury (“mTBI”) in the accident that has developed into a Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder (FNSD) and Neurocognitive Disorder due to TBI with Behavioural Syndrome. He contends that, but for the accident, he would not have suffered FNSD. Whilst there was a probability that the Claimant’s pre-existing fibromyalgia/somatoform symptoms would have recurred, particularly in times of stress, this would not have interfered with his ability to work in a responsible and well-paid job. Further, whilst, absent the accident, the circumstances of his being made redundant may have caused a short-lived adjustment disorder, the redundancy would not have caused a severe depressive disorder of the kind or severity that he has in fact suffered.  </p>

It is contended on his behalf that his account of the accident and its aftermath is essentially consistent. In so far as the account of his redundancy and its significance is brought into question, the Claimant contend that that the Defendant has fundamentally misunderstood his explanation of discovering the possibility that he might be made redundant. In any event, the Claimant draws attention to the failure of the Defendant to adduce any evidence to contradict his account and the fact that the Defendant compromised his claim arising out of the dismissal in circumstances that could only be consistent with a realisation on the Defendant’s part that it might be found responsible for a dismissal that was unlawful on grounds of disability discrimination.  </p>

The Defendant accepts as genuine at least some of the symptomatology of the Claimant, in so far as it is a consequence of a severe depressive disorder.

One of the most important lessons of such research is that in everyday life we are not aware of the extent to which our own and other people's memories are unreliable and believe our memories to be more faithful than they are. Two common (and related) errors are to suppose: (1) that the stronger and more vivid is our feeling or experience of recollection, the more likely the recollection is to be accurate; and (2) that the more confident another person is in their recollection, the more likely their recollection is to be accurate. </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">Underlying both these errors is a faulty model of memory as a mental record which is fixed at the time of experience of an event and then fades (more or less slowly) over time. In fact, psychological research has demonstrated that memories are fluid and malleable, being constantly rewritten whenever they are retrieved. This is true even of so-called 'flashbulb' memories, that is memories of experiencing or learning of a particularly shocking or traumatic event. (The very description 'flashbulb' memory is in fact misleading, reflecting as it does the misconception that memory operates like a camera or other device that makes a fixed record of an experience.) External information can intrude into a witness's memory, as can his or her own thoughts and beliefs, and both can cause dramatic changes in recollection. Events can come to be recalled as memories which did not happen at all or which happened to someone else (referred to in the literature as a failure of source memory). </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">The process of civil litigation itself subjects the memories of witnesses to powerful biases. The nature of litigation is such that witnesses often have a stake in a particular version of events. This is obvious where the witness is a party or has a tie of loyalty (such as an employment relationship) to a party to the proceedings. Other, more subtle influences include allegiances created by the process of preparing a witness statement and of coming to court to give evidence for one side in the dispute. A desire to assist, or at least not to prejudice, the party who has called the witness or that party's lawyers, as well as a natural desire to give a good impression in a public forum, can be significant motivating forces. </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">Considerable interference with memory is also introduced in civil litigation by the procedure of preparing for trial. A witness is asked to make a statement, often (as in the present case) when a long time has already elapsed since the relevant events. The statement is usually drafted for the witness by a lawyer who is inevitably conscious of the significance for the issues in the case of what the witness does nor does not say. The statement is made after the witness's memory has been 'refreshed' by reading documents. The documents considered often include statements of case and other argumentative material as well as documents which the witness did not see at the time or which came into existence after the events which he or she is being asked to recall. The statement may go through several iterations before it is finalised. Then, usually months later, the witness will be asked to reread his or her statement and review documents again before giving evidence in court. The effect of this process is to establish in the mind of the witness the matters recorded in his or her own statement and other written material, whether they be true or false, and to cause the witness's memory of events to be based increasingly on this material and later interpretations of it rather than on the original experience of the events.”  </span>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.23in">That is not to say that the court may or should simply dismiss witness evidence when it is inconsistent with documents. As Floyd LJ said in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Kogan v Martin</span> [2019] EWCA Civ 1645 (citing the judgment of HHJ Gore QC in <span style="text-decoration:underline">CXB v North West Anglia Foundation NHS Trust</span> [2019] EWHC 2053 as to the caution to be exercised in applying the above passage from <span style="text-decoration:underline">Gestmin</span> in the particularly in the context of non-commercial disputes), “<span style="font-style:italic">a proper awareness of the fallibility of memory does not relieve judges of the task of making findings of fact based upon </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">all</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of the evidence</span>” (emphasis in the original). This is particularly so where, as here, one is concerned with documents that are (largely) not created or attested to by the witness whose accuracy and/or credibility is an issue, but rather by third parties such as doctors who, whilst usually at least can be taken as intending to make an accurate record, inevitably introduce a degree of subjectivity into that which they record. Nevertheless, it seems to me that the court should have regard to those factors which may tend to distort witness statements, both in assessing the reliability of the witness evidence and in considering why distortions may have arisen. </p>

This is a distinction that may be more easily stated than identified, since post traumatic amnesia is often seen as involving islands of memory being formed in a sea of events in respect of which continuous memory is not laid down, whereas attrition of memory involves the contemporaneous laying down of memories of all events, but the subsequent fading of memory for less significant matters.

An example is the Claimant’s explanation as to why he states that he was running round than walking at the time of the accident. As I note at paragraph 105 below, I gained the impression at this point that the Claimant might tend to give evidence based upon a rationalisation of what occurred rather than being based on a true recollection.

However, I am conscious that the impression that a person gives in the witness box is not necessarily a fair indication of their cognitive state. Furthermore, the Claimant accepted that his condition has continued to improve and accordingly a comparison with a description of his condition, based upon an assessment more than 16 months ago, may be unhelpful.  </p>

On the vital issue as to whether the Claimant has deliberately made untrue statements, there was nothing in the Claimant’s demeanour to suggest that he was someone prone to lying or exaggerating. The issue of credibility requires careful analysis of what Mr Long has had to say various times, together with the circumstances in which he said it and a proper understanding of his medical condition. It is necessary to compare the Claimant’s evidence on a variety of issues, looking at what is supported or contradicted by other material, what is inherently plausible or implausible and what is internally consistent or contradictory. One must further look with care at the extent to which the Claimant’s reliability or unreliability on particular issues may support or undermine the credibility of his evidence more generally. None of this can be deduced from his demeanour in the witness box. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.23in">On the other hand, I note below another example of evidence given by Mrs Long (in this case relating to the Claimant stopping on a journey from Norwich to Cheshire in order to vomit) which appears to match that of her husband given for the first time by him in the witness box, yet that was not set out in her witness statement. Taking these three aspects of her evidence together, I consider it more probable than not that Mrs Long has tailored her evidence in the light of what her husband had to say. This, together with the other points made above, cause me to be cautious in placing any considerable weight upon Mrs Long’s evidence. In so far as I feel able to do so notwithstanding that causation, I identify where I have below. However, I should make clear that caution is not based upon a finding of dishonesty on her part, but rather a concern that her account tends to follow that of her husband’s rather than being based on independent recollection and is therefore unreliable. Had her honesty been a discrete issue in the case, I would have needed to explore this matter further; given that it is not, it suffices for me to conclude that I have concern about her reliability as a witness where her evidence is uncorroborated. This is not to say that I reject her uncorroborated evidence out of hand -  for example, on one issue relating to the Claimant’s alleged loss of the sense of taste and smell, I found her account convincing as noted below. </p>

I was particularly struck by the comment from his daughter during cross examination that the voluntary work at Felbrigg Hall, that had led to paid employment “<span style="font-style:italic">has helped him to get into a bit of a routine and because obviously he is very like workorientated, he enjoys working and being busy and things, so I think him volunteering and now in work it has given him like a purpose and a motivation.”</span> This spontaneous comment rang true and I accept the evidence of each of the three witnesses as to the deterioration in their father’s condition in 2015 (which is consistent with other evidence) and his recent improvement, with the proviso that, as each of them accepted, they knew very little of the detail of his health problems in around 2007-2008. </p>

His account was of some significance to the Claimant’s condition both over the two days immediately following the accident and following his return to Shavington on Sunday 29 March 2015. Rev Long was careful in answering questions. If he were seeking to support his son’s claim by giving false or exaggerated evidence, he had plenty of opportunities to add detail to his account when he was asked about events following the accident, yet he did not. Further, his measured answers gave no suggestion that he was prone to exaggeration, whatever temptation there might have been to do so out of family loyalty.

If Mr Long were in fact capable of commanding a salary in excess of £100,000 (double what he was earning at the time of the accident) or as much as £250,000 (five times what it was earning at the time of the accident), one might wonder why he was working for the Defendant in so relatively an ill paid role.

My strong impression was that all the expert witnesses were seeking to assist the court in what they found to be a particularly difficult case. For reasons that I shall deal with later, the Claimant’s descriptions of symptoms are often florid with a distinctly functional air. The accounts have to some extent developed as the litigation has proceeded. It is not surprising that an expert dealing with such evidence and seeking to give a clear explanation of their opinion as to the probable cause and nature of the symptoms will find themselves considering new theories or at least will develop existing theories in light of the merging picture. Some parts of their evidence are more convincing than other parts. In particular where opinions were expressed for the first time in the witness box or during oral evidence developed beyond what was said in the reports and joint statements, the opinions are likely to be less convincing, if only because they are less thought through and are usually less well explored.

Dr Bird agreed that one should be cautious about doing this and that it was possible to understand from the perspective of the patient how long it might be for a psychiatrist to diagnose a condition that had never been diagnosed before, simply based on a review of medical records, without any face-to-face consultation. Whilst I share the concern about the wisdom (and possibly the ethics) of preparing a psychiatric report without seeing the patient face-to-face, it does not seem to me that, of itself, this undermines Dr Bird’s evidence. I bear in mind however the argument advanced by the Claimant that Dr Bird reached a conclusion based on an assessment of the Claimant’s condition without having seen him that may have influenced his subsequent opinions in the case. </p>

However, the mere fact that the opposing party has not alleged dishonesty in his pleadings will not necessarily bar a judge from finding a witness to have been lying: in fact, judges must regularly characterise witnesses as having been deliberately untruthful even where there has been no plea of fraud. On top of that, it seems to me that where an insurer in a case such as the present one, following the guidance given in </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Kearsley v Klarfeld</span><span style="font-style:italic"> [2006] 2 All ER 303, has denied a claim without putting forward a substantive case of fraud but setting out ‘the facts from which they would be inviting the judge to draw the inference that the plaintiff had not in fact suffered the injuries he asserted’, it must be open to the trial judge, assuming that the relevant points have been adequately explored during the oral evidence, to state in his judgment not just that the Claimant has not proved his case but that, having regard to matters pleaded in the defence, he has concluded (say) that the alleged accident did not happen or that the Claimant was not present. The key question in such a case would be whether the Claimant had been given adequate warning of, and a proper opportunity to deal with, the possibility of such a conclusion and the matters leading the judge to it rather than whether the insurer had positively alleged fraud in its defence.” </span></p>

Indeed, having regard to the passage from <span style="text-decoration:underline">Howlett v Davies</span> referred to above, the court would doubtless consider preventing cross-examination in such circumstances, on the ground that fairly reaching a conclusion adverse to the Claimant and that therefore the cross-examination was inappropriate. This was the approach taken by HHJ Coe QC in paragraph 14 of her judgment in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Pinkus v Direct Line</span> [2018] EWHC 1671 (QB) and it is one with which I agree.

However, I see no unfairness in the Defendant having been allowed to explore the issue and thereafter seeking to draw an inference of dishonesty from the evidence, given that this is a central issue in the case.

He is setting up his own business and is ready to launch it in the next two weeks. He hopes that his improved financial position once he is working again will have a widespread positive effect on his life. Mr Long recently attended hydrotherapy and found it very useful. He has his own pool at home and so will continue exercises this once the pool heating is switched back on (in a month). He walks his</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">dog 1½ miles a day and has gradually build up his tolerance for walking from a starting point a year ago of only being able to walk around the block. He uses gym equipment at home once a week to maintain muscle strength. He was familiar with the principles of pacing and keeps himself steadily active but not overactive. Whilst he finds this frustrating he has accepted that jobs will now take him longer to complete. Overall I felt that Mr Long is coping exceptionally well with his chronic pain. He feels that he has only just emerged from a very difficult period and he preferred not to be discharged straight away. We therefore agreed that we would meet again in three months’ time to review his progress and building upon the gains he has made in the last months</span>…”  </p>

He has found zopiclone effective in helping him sleep at night however this is limited to 6 hours maximum per night. Although he spends time resting whilst watching television he does not actively use any relaxation techniques and is interested in learning about these. Stephen describes low motivation with regard to exercise partly because he feels he has lost so much of his previous fitness since the onset of his pain.

Whilst there may have been a tendency for the fibromyalgia to recur particularly in response to stresses, the Claimant’s post-traumatic symptoms are better diagnosed as a Functional Neurological System Disorder (FNSD), consistent with a pre-traumatic vulnerability to functional symptoms as demonstrated by the history of fibromyalgia, together with a depressive episode.

Whilst this approach may in principle be justified, the problem on the facts of this case lies in identifying precisely which elements of the medical history demonstrate such thoughts and feelings. Dr Bird commented in his oral evidence that most of the doctors from a variety of specialisms who had seen the Claimant had “<span style="font-style:italic">come to a conclusion that whatever they were being presented with was either atypical or else it was perhaps completely unexplained.”</span> The second half of this sentence is somewhat difficult to justify from the notes themselves.

The Claimant had been weaned off opiate medication in late 2012/early 2013 and was managing on Amitriptyline to deal with chronic pain issues and medication to help with sleep problems. The evidence shows that the Claimant had a good working record and was able to maintain full time employment. For example, the Defendant confirmed in a questionnaire from Scottish Provident completed after the termination of his employment that the Claimant had “<span style="font-style:italic">no previous sickness absence.”</span></p>

The Claimant has a history of somatic symptoms, probably most conveniently termed fibromyalgia, which have waxed and waned, with a period of relative crisis in the mid 2000s. This in turn led to a period of heavy opiate use, which caused its own problems but which the Claimant got over in around 2013. Since then, his condition had been largely well controlled with periods when problems have worsened and have required alterations in medication. </p>

On the first point, having viewed the photographs, I consider it perfectly possible that the Claimant could have struck his head whilst walking, given the vaulted nature of the doorways and Mr Jones’ evidence as to a slight incline into the kitchen. On the second point, whilst this may have caused some restriction invisibility, it seems to be unlikely to have had so great an effect as to prevent Mr Jones having a view that was clear enough to tell whether the Claimant was walking or running. On the third point, it is unclear where this account came from.

Mr Dignum QC drew attention to the fact that in cross examination, the Claimant appeared to concede that he probably had gone to the gym. I took that to be a concession based upon the logic of Mr Jones’ evidence that he said that he was going, rather than from any independent recall of going.

The Claimant’s apparent desire to complete his job of handing over the building is consistent with the description of his personality at various points in the evidence as somewhat perfectionist. Further, in crossexamination, the Claimant recalled some of the detail of the walkaround. It must however be noted that the evidence of Mr Jones does not suggest that there were no immediate symptoms following the accident. Both the use of paper towels and the appearance of pain are suggestive that, whether the Claimant was walking or running, this was an impact with some degree of force.  </p>

For reasons identified below, it is arguable that amnesia may be missed in particular by the non-expert observer whereas the evidence of the medics who saw him in the immediate post accident period and who identified amnesia may be powerful. That is not to say that Mr Jones’ evidence on the point is of no significance. However, it falls to be considered as part of the wider picture which is dealt with as part of Issue 3 below. </p>

The Claimant has been aware of Mr Jones making this assertion since, at the very latest, the service of witness statements within these proceedings (September 2019). It would have been the easiest thing in the world for him to have given evidence that, whilst intended to go to the gym, in fact decided not to. Whilst such evidence might have been somewhat inconsistent with the islands of memory referred to in his first witness statement, he has given evidence of other matters which suggest that the memories set out in the first statement are not complete. The fact that he has not sought to deal with the issue of gym attendance by purporting to recall and intention to go followed by a decision not to (which would have been almost impossible for the Defendant to disprove) is a pointer in the direction that he is not a dishonest witness. </p>

This bears similarity to the evidence relating to the xiphisternum and to the discussion between Mr and Mrs Long about the conversation that Mr Long is said to have had with Mr Walsh. Whilst it is again possible that the similarity of their accounts flows from them both correctly remembering the incident, given the length of time since the matters complained of, it is more probable that Mrs Long is taking her account from that of her husband.

Dr Nichols formulated the argument that it was the unguarded nature of the blow, the fact that it was unexpected and therefore no precaution was taken against it, that was the important part of the mechanism. Whilst I accept that, if one sees a blow coming and takes evasive action, impending impact may be avoided altogether or be of lesser severity. However, the fact that it was unguarded does not, it seems to me, in and of itself tell one how great the impact was. One could have an unguarded blow which was of minor severity simply because of the nature of the incident; equally one might not be able to avoid a blow that one sees coming, such that the force was considerable even though anticipated. In each case, the question must be about the degree of force. Dr Nichols said that it was not the punch that you see coming that knocks you out; I suspect that this depends on how hard the punch is thrown! </p>

I accept that the lack of other symptoms may tend to suggest that the apparent amnesia is not in fact PTA at all. But that is conceptually different from saying that PTA of short duration is in fact not capable of giving rise to mTBI. The Mayo Classification makes clear that the accepted thinking (which was not disputed by any of the Defendant’s experts) is that even momentary PTA, so long as genuine, is a sufficient symptom to justify the diagnosis of mTBI.  </p>

However, this error shows quite how inaccurate the Claimant’s recollection may be and simply adds to my caution in accepting his evidence in so far as it is not corroborated by more reliable sources. For example, I am not persuaded that he vomited during the journey from Norwich to Cheshire shortly before the second CoC attendance.

I am not persuaded that in fact such a finding would make any difference to other conclusions, but it would reasonably convincingly explain a somewhat odd symptom. If the theory is correct, it does cause one to wonder what caused the panic attack, unless it was something to do with the Claimant’s employment (which is dealt with below), it might suggest that the Claimant was panicking about the head injury he had suffered; if this is so it does suggest that the injury was of some significance to him and would contradict the suggestion that this was a trivial incident. However, I am not persuaded that this theory of Dr Bird was sufficiently well thought through to persuade me that it is probably the correct explanation for the Claimant’s condition overnight. </p>

It was only when he was in fact made redundant, after the accident but before a new group Head of IT was appointed that the extreme emotions referred to in the May 2015, that the extreme emotions referred to in the May 2015 Document were provoked. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.23in">Accordingly, it is necessary to consider the Claimant’s reaction to his finding about the risk of redundancy and in particular whether the May 2015 Document reflects his state of mind at or around the time of the accident. There are several significant pieces of evidence, independent of what the Claimant has said during this litigation. that may suggest that this is not so. </p>

This was an entirely new piece of evidence in cross-examination and, understandably, the Defendant was not able to put an argument that the witness had misremembered or mistaken things, still less that he was not honest in this account. I am cautious about laying emphasis on matters that arise in the middle of a witness’s evidence like this, since there is a risk of evidential unfairness to the opposing party when they cannot deal with the point. However, I cannot ignore that it was said and I was struck by the open fashion in which Rev Long made the point. He seemed to have a clear memory of it and on balance I accept his account that, indeed, his son arrived in the new car when he returned to the parental home in April 2015 and that the Claimant gave no suggestion to his parents that his job was at risk from redundancy. Of course, one must bear in mind other evidence as to the Claimant’s tendency to keep matters to himself. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.23in">Third, it is notable to see how the Claimant is recorded as expressing himself in the meeting on 20 April 2015. Of course this meeting shortly preceded him being, as he put it in cross examination, thrown out of the building. The note of that meeting does not suggest any of the emotion of the May 2015 Document, nor does it even refer to the previous “inadvertent discovery.” If Mr Long’s state of mind on the issue at that point was anything like was it set out in the May 2015 Document, it is difficult to understand why he did not apparently express any of that emotion or indeed anger in the meeting when redundancy is being formally addressed. If he expressed any emotion or anger, one would expect at least some reference to it in the note of the meeting. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.23in">Fourth, as Mr Grant pointed out in closing submissions, if the Defendant had any evidence to support the contention that the Claimant was showing sign of psychological illness prior to the accident, one would expect it to have adduced evidence to this effect. For example, it would be surprising if the kind of extreme reaction described in the May 2015 Document did not generate email traffic or other internal communications at the time of Mr Long’s “inadvertent discovery” if the response was so extreme at that time. The Defendant has had the opportunity to produce such evidence, yet none is forthcoming. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.23in">Fifth, as I have commented already, the May 2015 Document is itself somewhat inconsistent in tone. The document certainly states that the Claimant was upset on making the discovery on 10 March 2015, and the passage, “<span style="font-style:italic">Accidentally finding that your job is being replaced, because someone doesn’t think you are up to it, is incredibly humiliating</span>”<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>is suggestive of an extremely adverse reaction to the discovery at that time. However, the tone of the document is that what Mr Walsh had to say to the Claimant was reassuring. This apparent inconsistency might be explained by the Claimant’s case that he believed that he potentially had a future with the Defendant and that the question of redundancy was to be resolved some time in the future, when person was recruited to the new role. On this explanation, it was only when Mr Walsh essentially reneged on what he had to say in March 2015 by making the Claimant’s job redundant forthwith in May 2015 that the extreme reaction occurred. Of course the May 2015 Document by definition post-dated those events. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.23in">I find these five points taken together to be powerful evidence in support of the Claimant’s case that the May 2015 document is being misinterpreted and that his reaction to the redundancy risk only arose in May 2015. On the balance of probabilities, I accept that case. This being so, the redundancy risk was no significant stressor at the time of the accident and does not adequately explain the significant symptoms of which the Claimant complained in April 2015. </p>

The Claimant’s apparent assertion to Dr McGlashen in January 2016 that vomiting was not a feature of his first CoC visit is most probably explained as an error of memory, it being probable that his recollection now of vomiting on that first visit being a product of his memory being prompted by the notes. However, this error shows quite how inaccurate the Claimant’s recollection may be and simply adds to my caution in accepting his evidence in so far as it is not corroborated by more reliable sources. For example, I am not persuaded that he vomited during the journey from Norwich to Cheshire shortly before the second CoC attendance. Had he done so, I would have expected to see reference to it in contemporaneous documents, in particular the CoC notes on the second attendance. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.23in">Taking my finding of PTA with the other symptoms referred to above, I am satisfied that the Claimant did in fact suffer mTBI in the accident, causing vomiting and visual disturbance apparent in the immediate post-traumatic admission, as well as the developing pattern of symptoms that had become apparent by the time of the second CoC admission on 30 April 2015, which on the balance of probabilities were caused by the development of migrainous headaches in the days following the accident. As to the developing symptoms thereafter, it becomes increasingly difficult to unpick the immediate physical consequences of the head injury from other causes. Further, in so far as other symptoms that were referred to by the reporting experts are concerned, I am not persuaded that the Claimant suffered symptoms that were not contemporaneously reported in this first period. Given his admitted willingness to report what was wrong, coupled with the care that he took in reporting matters to Dr Rittman in particular, it appears to me that he is probably wrong to say that he suffered loss of the senses of smell and taste and/or photophobia in this early period, these not being recorded in the contemporaneous notes. It is more probable that the Claimant is, for whatever reason (as to which I shall consider further below) is misstating the symptoms that he suffered in this early period. </p>

A later MRI scan, performed on 29 May 2015 was normal. Dr Nichols considered that, with mTBI, imaging lacked sensitivity and therefore the normal imaging did not exclude widespread brain injury at a microscopic level. Indeed, in cross examination he added that even the more sensitive susceptibility weighted imaging (which was not undertaken here) might often be negative when such damage was present. Dr Heaney on the other hand considered the neuro-imaging to be reassuring and to provide, as he put it in the joint statement, “<span style="font-style:italic">strong weight to the view that not significant or enduring brain injury occurred.” </span>In cross examination, Dr Heaney stated the very injured brain with a lot of changes visible on MR scanning would likely involve the person having considerable neurocognitive deficit, whereas as a normal scan would typically be associated with someone who would be described as “<span style="font-style:italic">generally well</span>.” He accepted the proposition that it is possible to have a normal MRI scan yet in a person with clear neuropsychological evidence of brain injury, adding that the use of susceptibility weighted scanning would increase the prospect of picking up any signs of brain </p>

He reported a decrease of suicidal ideation and was happy to engage with the CRHT… We have not observed acute clinical symptoms of depression and it appeared that the suicidal ideation was becoming more from being fed up with his general physical presentation following hitting his head in March 2015 and remaining with poor memory and difficulties in concentration that seem to fluctuate…</span>” </p>

The only witness was the one colleague. He is unclear if he was knocked out and whilst he can remember the details prior to the accident, his next recollection is being upstairs. He reports being able to complete his work tasks, but it was overnight when problem started becoming apparent. He also managed to drive the 20 minutes from his workplace to is accommodation which was with his parents in Chester. In retrospect he describes this as "all a blur" and overnight he reports the development of strange sensations including his whole body feeling "tingly". These symptoms resulted in an admission via Chester A&amp;E, where he was kept in for observation and had a CT had scan, reportedly normal and was discharged later the same day. Vomiting was not a feature. The day after this, he drove a 4 hour journey back to Norwich on the Thursday (the head injury was on the Tuesday) and on the Sunday he drove back to Chester where he vomited overnight. He reports no second additional blow to the head. On the Monday (7 days after the original injury) he was readmitted via Chester A&amp;E and re-scanned. His hearing was checked and reported to be reduced in one year. He reported double vision and nausea, and found that turning his head quickly was uncomfortable. He stayed in hospital for 4 days and was discharged and came back to Norwich. He stayed off work for approximately 3 weeks and on the first attempt to return to work, he managed 35 minutes before feeling unable to continue and a second attempt he reports being at work for 4 hours before being made redundant and was given 3 months’ severance pay. Since this time, Mr Long has been struggling with fairly constant symptoms which he attributes to the head injury, involving day-to-day memory issues, poor concentration, headaches, double vision, impaired processing, disequilibrium on movement and intermittent tripping. He was seen by the neurology team on 30 May and an MRI scan was organised and reported as normal. He demonstrated ocular diplopia and reduced sensation in the right forehead (the blow to the head was to the left forehead) and tinnitus. It was also reported by his wife that he was angry and irritable. By the time of his next neurology review on 18 September, his mood had dropped significantly and he reported suicidal ideation, having bought a rope and having a plan for using it. This precipitated a crisis team assessment and voluntary admission… He had been started on mirtazapine which was rapidly increased to 45 mg at night. He was reviewed by a clinical psychologist, Dr Jamie Durrance-Clarke, who performed neuropsychological assessment which demonstrated: …immediate memory 16</span><span style="font-style:italic;vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span><span style="font-style:italic"> percentile, visuospatial/constructional 50</span><span style="font-style:italic;vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span><span style="font-style:italic">, language 22</span><span style="font-style:italic;vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span><span style="font-style:italic">, attention 50</span><span style="font-style:italic;vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span><span style="font-style:italic">, </span></p>

This precipitated a referral to the Colman Centre service.… Current clinical status: Mood: Mr Long reported that his mood had become more vulnerable again since New Year's Eve, with recurrence of suicidal thoughts… He was anxious about the assessment today and has been seen by the GP last Thursday.… Mr Long reported that prior to the head injury he had no previous mood issues and that he felt all his current problems were due to the bang on the head. He was upset that the Mental Health Team had been looking for previous mood issues to attribute his difficulties to and did not agree with what had been put in his discharge summary… Sleep: Mr Long goes to bed at 10.30 at night and will get to sleep after midnight. He gets up to pass urine twice per night, which is usual for him.… Headache: "all the time", from waking up in the morning to going to bed at night. Fluorescent lights are an aggravating factor… Cognitive function: "I cannot process information". Reports feeling easily overwhelmed and maths being problematic. Forgets sequences of tasks and multi-tasking impaired due to poor concentration. Reports walking into a room and forgetting why he is there. Has left the tap on within the house on frequent occasions and has also left the oven on and picked up hot objects from the oven. No other risk related activities reported. Feels memory is his main issue, with new learning being a major problem and also “knowing where to start” a task… Reports was previously a very process driven personality, rather than creative, but is finding his logical approach is now impaired… Drugs: amitriptyline 100 mg, baclofen 10 mg tds … mirtazapine 45 mg nocte, paracetamol qds, zolpidem 5 mg nocte (previously tried Zopiclone), tramadol 200 mg SR… Summary: Mr Long experienced a blow to the head in March 2015, which has resulted in symptoms in keeping with a post-concussion syndrome. This has resulted in loss of his job and his range of symptoms involve disturbed vision, headache, altered sensation, variably impaired mobility and a range of cognitive issues including difficulty with fatigue, memory, multitasking, attention and</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">processing, all of which are enduring symptoms. This precipitated a significant drop in mood with suicidal ideation including the means and plan.... I assured Mr Long that we see people in the service with this array of symptomatology and that there are things that can be done to help them improve and to offer support. Previous neuropsychological assessment has indicated difficulties in the areas as outlined.… Plan: 1. Refer to psychology for assessment and management of PCS and subsequent mood disorder; 2. Refer to occupational therapy for functional everyday support with consideration to be given to longer term activity.</span>”  </p>

It would appear that he ran into a low door frame and struck his forehead on the frame, possibly experiencing a brief loss of consciousness but the details surrounding the episode are a little unclear. He has been seen by the Neuro Rehabilitation team at common hospital and I am sure you have received a copy of their letter from January 2016, which outlines the ongoing problems in great detail. He continues to complain of memory problems, both short and long-term memory and persistent right-sided fronto-parietal headache, which is constant in nature, variable in intensity, often made worse if he is exposed to bright light or refusing a busy noisy environment. He also continues to complain of low mood and I see that his antidepressant medication has been switched from sertraline to mirtazapine and most recently to citalopram. I believe that he has had clinical psychology input from the Colman Hospital since February this year but also attended the psychiatric clinic at Hellesdon Hospital this year when his antidepressant medications were reviewed. His neurological examination today was normal, in particular his ocular movements were normal. In the limbs he had normal tone and power, his reflexes were 1 – 2+ and symmetrical throughout, both plant responses were flexor. There was no limb or gait ataxia. As you know his MRI brain scan was normal. I have tried to reassure him that there does not appear to have been any serious brain injury based upon both his neurological examination and his normal brain scan but that these sorts of problems that he is describing are not uncommon consequences of head injuries, from which people make a gradual recovery. I think he is best supported by the Neurorehabilitation environment.

From a low mood perspective, Stephen reports he is not “as bad” as previously, with less frank suicidal ideation. He will still ask himself “what is the point?” and has a sense of helplessness. Stephen reports that not knowing the endpoint regarding his recovery is difficult. On further questioning, Stephen confirmed he has no current plans for self-harm and feels he is more likely to speak to someone about any dip in mood should things escalate… Headache: Stephen reports his headaches have increased in severity. He describes them as right frontal and right sided headache, with predominantly sharp pain which is constant, with exacerbation. He is light sensitive and noise sensitive and report occasional “spots before the eyes”. Stephen gets no neck pain, but may feel anxious with the headaches. Note he has previously tried gabapentin and pregabalin for his fibromyalgia symptoms, which both induced nausea. Stephen feels the amitriptyline is helping with his fibromyalgia symptoms.… Fibromyalgia: Stephen was on meloxicam but this was changed to baclofen a while back. He is unclear if the baclofen is helping. He remains on tramadol. He reports dry eyes, which is likely due to a combination of drugs with anticholinergic side effects.… Vision: Stephen’s visual distortion is unchanged, which he describes as being 3-D overlay of one image out of line with a second deeper visual image of an object. If he shuts one eye, he reports the distortion is improved but still present, therefore unlikely an ocular control issue.… Memory: Stephen reports ongoing significant issues with his day-to-day memory and feels this is the number one issue that he would like to have resolved. We discussed that it might be more of an attentional deficit, interfering with his ability to lay down new memories… Drugs: amitriptyline 100 mg nocte, baclofen 10 mg tds, citalopram 30 mg od, paracetamol, zolpidem 5 mg nocte, tramadol 200 mg SR bd, amlodipine 5 mg od.… Discussion: As has become evident in Stephen's discussions with Dr Alison Woods, clinical psychologist, Stephen sets himself very high standards and is very self-critical if he does not maintain high standards. We discussed the notions of being alert to and spending energy and time on self-criticism was actually taking up cognitive space that could be better used in supporting his memory and other activities. If Stephen were to cut himself a little slack but not habitually get annoyed and frustrated when things do not always go to plan, I indicated that I felt this would be positive, as there would be more space and energy left the using his areas of cognitive strengths,</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">which would enable him to be more positively productive …</span>”  </p>

There is no evidence of binocular problems. His eyes are normal and he has 6/5 vision in each eye. His symptoms of multiple images are I think a post-traumatic stress type symptom. They are not organic in nature. The higher brain processing of vision I think is more at fault here.… I do not think he fits the double vision criteria that would exclude him from driving from the DVLA, but of course he needs to take that up with the DVLA and he can use this letter in correspondence with them…</span>”  </p>

However, success and outcome will be dependent upon Mr Long engaging with this type of narrative rather than viewing his impairments as organic and related to a head injury. I would therefore recommend two sessions designed to assess engagement in this type of approach it would then be possible to determine whether a course of psychological therapy would be of benefit…</span>” </p>

On balance I think it is most likely that a diagnosis of depression and anxiety are the most prominent mental state features which explain the constellation of symptoms which he describes. Certainly a head injury of the relatively mild severity that Mr Long experienced, would not explain the somatic symptoms which he has or any cognitive disturbance. Therefore I think that the most likely diagnosis is one of somatic symptom disorder and also of depression.… It would be most useful to establish a shared understanding of Mr Long’s difficulties through developing a clear psychological formulation through which he can understand his current diagnosis, the predisposing factors which make him vulnerable to this, which include pre-injury (perfectionism) as well as the ongoing maintaining factors for his symptoms.

This reports that Mr Long had attended eight sessions of psychological treatment in which he had engaged well in the cognitive rehabilitation components of treatment, although it was noted. "However, we discover that there was very little gain or benefit other than a recognition that memory and word production is better with phonetic links than semantic cues.… In terms of cognitive therapy aimed at thought patterns of perfectionism and self-criticism, Mr Long's access to cognitions is limited and he feels he lives in a present oriented bubble whereby he thinks very little about the past or future.

Whilst he understands the concept of cognitive effort or resources,</span> his <span style="font-style:italic">objective evidence is that there is ‘something going on’ and he believes his symptoms are not fully accounted for by a model cognitive demand." Mr Long himself reported that he has found psychological treatment "Okay" and that it had “helped with acceptance”… He reported that he was not "struggling with brain injury" but there remained difficulties in “moving on”. I asked him directly what his explanation of his current symptoms was. Mr Long reported that he accepts that depression is part of “what is going on.” But later acknowledged that “after three years, I am not accepting that depression is doing this”. He explained that “I just accept the diagnosis,” but when I asked him to explain what he had been told the diagnosis was, it was evident that he still continues to have illness beliefs regarding underlying neurological causes which make it hard for him, understandably, to accept the psychological formulation that Dr Swift and I have offered.… We discussed his current treatment. He is taking a low dose of amitriptyline and also 1200 mg in divided doses of carbamazepine, which are very unlikely to be making any significant impact on his mood from the perspective of depression. However, he has clearly been on multiple medications in the past… Mirtazapine (2015), sertraline </span></p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">(2015), citalopram (2016), venlafaxine (2016) and trazodone (November 2016).… Mr Long presents with multiple persisting symptoms following a head injury without significant evidence of brain injury. In my opinion, the primary maintaining factors for his ongoing presentation are in the context of his mental health and it is my view that his diagnosis is akin to one of a functional neurological symptom disorder or somatic symptom disorder alongside current depressive disorder. His pre-existing perfectionist traits are also an important predisposing factor. He has had a number of treatments for mood, although I do not have information about the maximum doses of medications that he was treated on. It would seem sensible to consider augmentation strategies… Such strategies may include evidence-based augmentation approaches, including lithium and combination treatments. During the course of psychological treatment there has not been any evidence shifting his illness belief or his understanding of his presentation in the context of the psychological formulation and I do not think there will be any significant improvement in his mental state until Mr Long is at a point in his recovery where he is able to accept the relative role of psychosocial factors in maintaining his symptoms. To this end, I would agree with Dr Swift that there is no benefit in pursuing psychological treatment until Mr Long is ready to accept that improving psychological factors may have an impact on him rather than a concern about underlying neurological disorder. This is not an unusual position to be in, and I have treated many patients who have struggled to accept psychologically mediated maintaining factors in their presentation and have not been able to make significant gains in their recovery until they have been able to do this.  </span>

Whilst I am cautious about accepting the detail of witness statements from members of the family, in circumstances where it is likely that their accounts are influenced by each other and by the Claimant himself, the consistency of complaints since May 2015 supports the contention that, whatever their cause, the Claimant has suffered a constellation of symptoms that have significantly affected his life. Whilst I do not disregard the possibility that some of the symptoms may have been exaggerated, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the Claimant has suffered (or at least perceived that he has suffered) significant symptoms. The contemporaneous medical records provide the most reliable account of the symptoms, although in point of fact the Claimant’s own account is not significantly different than what is recited in the records. As I have noted above, the loss of senses of taste and smell is the only of the Claimant’s physical complaints that is not referred to in the records. It is easy to understand why that relatively subtle matter would be lost in the fog of his describing more serious symptoms. Having read the Claimant’s statements and heard his </p>

The development of his symptoms from May 2015 into 2016 is, according to the neuropsychiatrists in their first joint report, associated with increasing evidence of depressive disorder. Antidepressant medication was prescribed in July 2015, with the dose medication being increased in August. By September, he was suicidal with hospital admission in October 2015. He symptoms came under control but low mood and intermittent suicidal ideation persisted after his discharge. The neuropsychiatrists have indicated that his mood disorder has remained “<span style="font-style:italic">symptomatic or recurrent sense”.</span> These depressive problems, coupled with his premorbid personality type and the persistence of symptoms following head injury are agreed by the neuropsychiatrists to be the explanation of the Claimant’s behavioural changes, described as “<span style="font-style:italic">a general state of avolition and anhedonia, a motivation, irritability and at times antagonistic interactions with others</span>.” Dr Bird would add to this explanation his diagnosis of an underlying Somatic System Disorder.  </p>

He has also developed SSD, but only since the accident. He considers that these particular neurological symptoms would not have developed but for the head injury, although the Claimant would have been vulnerable to developing symptoms regardless of the accident given his history of fibromyalgia. </p>

Further, they agree that, on neuropsychological assessment, the Claimant has failed performance validity testing. They suggest that the reason for this should be considered in the context of the evidence generally available and that the court should in particular bear in mind the possible contribution of psychiatric sequelae, the fabrication of symptoms in an attempt to deceive, and the exaggeration of subjectively experienced symptoms with a view to persuading people of the validity of those symptoms. </p>

These problems are exacerbated by his tendency towards self-criticism. She acknowledges that this does not exclude the possibility of some exaggeration on the Claimant’s part. </p>

Further, Dr McCulloch rejects the suggestion that depression can explain the Claimant’s poor performance given the material that shows that this would not be expected. Yet further, her report points to inconsistency in cognition testing which is suggestive of conscious exaggeration.

Whilst clearly this is a possible sequence of events, one might have expected that Dr Fletcher would himself have made a note if he had seen the Claimant again. The nursing note is also consistent with the nursing staff having reviewed the information that the scan was reassuring. If that was so, there is no evidence as to when the Claimant was reassured. On the other hand, a note from Dr Chakrabarty on 2 April 2015 states that the Claimant could be discharged after a radiology meeting to discuss his scan – that suggests that the reassuring message was not even able to the doctors until towards the end of the Claimant’s admission. </p>

Whilst Mr Dignum on behalf of the Defendant sought to draw attention to some weaknesses in the probationary reviews that had taken place, the Defendant had nevertheless felt able to offer the Defendant a permanent post shortly before the accident. Further, when the question of the redundancy arose, Ms Helen Smith said in an email to the Claimant, “<span style="font-style:italic">your performance isn’t in question.</span>” </p>

The Claimant draws this figure from the Moderately Severe category of Psychiatric Injury in the Judicial College Guidelines for the assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases, a range of £17,900 to £51,460. The Defendant agrees with this category (assuming the Claimant’s case on causation to be made out, as I find it to be) but contends for the lower figure of £35,000, given the risk of recurrent symptoms from the Claimant’s underlying fibromyalgia. Were the Claimant not to be at such risk of recurrence of some symptoms in any event, I would have agreed with the Claimant’s figure. However, given the risk of recurrence, that figure falls too high in the range of the moderately severe psychiatric condition. That said, a risk of recurrence of some symptoms from the underlying condition is of far less significance to the valuation of the claim than the actual severe symptoms that the Claimant has suffered. For these reasons, I allow the sum of £40,000 for general damages. </p>

The Claimant claims past loss of earnings on the assumption that his salary after the accident would have increased to say £80,000 per annum gross, that is £55,043 per annum net, and takes a midpoint of £46,321 net, However, the only reliable basis for the calculation of loss of earnings but for the accident is the Claimant’s actual earnings of £51,000 per annum net. For reasons I have identified above, the evidence as to potential earnings for the Claimant is both inadmissible and unreliable. It is true that the Defendant concedes a slightly higher figure of £55,000 per annum gross in its closing submissions for future loss earnings, but that is in the context of a much lower multiplier than contended of by the Claimant. However in taking a more strictly mathematical approach than the Defendant (which will lead to a higher multiplier), I calculate his loss of earnings but for the accident on the basis of the figure for his actual earning of £51,000 gross. </p>

There also falls to be discounted any earnings from the Claimant’s recent employment at Felbrigg Hall. Since that employment was only referred to in oral evidence, the Schedule and Counter Schedule do not deal with the earnings, either in terms of the amount of earnings for the period of employment. The figure put in opening by Mr Grant was of the Claimant actually earning £8,676 gross per annum from 4 January 2021. Doing the best I can on the scant information, I assume that the Claimant has earned the net equivalent annual figure of £8,500 for the period of 0.38 years between his starting employment and the date of calculation of past losses.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.23in">The Defendant then contends for a further discount from the past loss of earnings claim. Given the evidence that, even on his own evidence, the Claimant has been and remains at risk of relapse regardless of the accident, the Defendant contends that the past loss of earnings should be deducted to reflect the risk that in any event the Claimant would not have been able to work over this period. In principle, this seems to me to be a legitimate argument. The Court is unable to say what would have happened over the past 6 years but for the accident. However there is certainly a risk that the Claimant’s past ill health would have interfered with his working capacity in any event. However, I do not accept the Defendant’s argument that the appropriate discount is 51%. This seems to suppose that, because there is evidence is that such a relapse would have occurred at some point, the discount must be greater than 50% reflecting that it is more likely than not that any relapse would have affected the Claimant’s working capacity by preventing him from working between the accident and now. The evidence in my judgment does not go that far. There is some evidence that the Claimant may have suffered interference with his working capacity, but for the accident. Apart from the underlying risk of further symptoms of the underlying pre-accident condition referred to by the medical experts, Dr Bourke refers in his letter of October 2020 to the risk of the Claimant having suffered a brief adjustment disorder or acute stress reaction as a result of the redundancy in any event.  </p>

That disability will persist. I see no basis for concluding that the Claimant is less disabled than the “average” person within the categories considered in the Ogden Tables. Indeed, the various purpose of the Tables is to seek to avoid the excesses of under- or overcompensation. In <span style="text-decoration:underline">Wells v Wells</span> [1999] 1 AC 345 at 379F, Lord Lloyd said that the Ogden Tables should be “<span style="font-style:italic">the starting point, rather than a check</span>” and that “<span style="font-style:italic">a judge should be slow to depart from the relevant actuarial multiplier of impressionistic grounds.</span>” However, I agree with the Claimant’s concession that, given the Claimant was at risk of relapse of his underlying condition regardless of the accident, some discount is merited to the Claimant’s discount of 30% referred to above appears on the face of it a reasonable estimate of that risk, given that it is only a relapse that would have led to loss of earnings that needs to be factored into this calculation.

As well as being inadmissible on the ground that the Claimant does not have permission to rely on expert evidence, it is in any event unreliable given that course of the Claimant’s employment since the mid 2000s. Further, as Mr Dignum QC pointed out in closing submissions, the kind of figures cited by the Claimant and his witnesses as potential earnings are far higher than the average level of such earnings in the tables within the current edition of Facts and Figures. This indicates that the multiplicand being contended for by the Claimant would only be the level of earnings of the very highest achievers in his line of work. Given the </p>

Indeed the evidence before the court in the form of the Claimant’s actual earnings suggests that the figure conceded by him in the Schedule of £12,500 per annum net is on the high side.
