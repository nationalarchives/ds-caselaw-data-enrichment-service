	    <p style="margin-left:0.63in;margin-right:0.54in">The COVID-19 pandemic (“the Pandemic”) and its consequences have had a massive effect on public, private and business life in this country and elsewhere in the world.  This Hearing has concerned questions as to upon whom (landlords, tenants and/or insurers) certain of the resultant financial detriments should fall, and, in particular, whether tenants of commercial premises have remained responsible to pay their rents notwithstanding that they have been subject to the enforced closure of, or inability to trade from, their premises. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.63in;margin-right:0.54in">The Landlords contend that the Rents (including value added tax (“VAT”) and interest (“Interest”)) simply continue to fall due and payable notwithstanding the existence of the Regulations and their effects.  The Tenants assert that, for various differing reasons, the consequence of what has happened is that they do not have to pay all or part of the Rents.   </p>

They are associated entities being, for these purposes, entities which hold the assets of commercial property funds, essentially (although I am not concerned with the precise legal structure) on behalf of investors to whom they will owe responsibilities to seek to collect income such as the Rents.  In each case they are landlords by assignment.  They act by the same solicitors and counsel being Guy Fetherstonhaugh QC and with him (and who appeared on her own at previous hearings) Ms Elizabeth Fitzgerald. </p>

This means a claim that is more than merely arguable: ED &amp; F Man Liquid Products v Patel [2003] EWCA Civ 472 at [8]  iii) In reaching its conclusion the court must not conduct a "mini-trial": Swain v Hillman  iv) This does not mean that the court must take at face value and without analysis everything that a claimant says in his statements before the court.

Thus the court should hesitate about making a final decision without a trial, even where there is no obvious conflict of fact at the time of the application, where reasonable grounds exist for believing that a fuller investigation into the facts of the case would add to or alter the evidence available to a trial judge and so affect the outcome of the case: Doncaster Pharmaceuticals Group Ltd v Bolton Pharmaceutical Co 100 Ltd [2007] FSR 63;  vii) On the other hand it is not uncommon for an application under Part 24 to give rise to a short point of law or construction and, if the court is satisfied that it has before it all the evidence necessary for the proper determination of the question and that the parties have had an adequate opportunity to address it in argument, it should grasp the nettle and decide it. The reason is quite simple: if the respondent's case is bad in law, he will in  truth have no real prospect of succeeding on his claim or successfully defending the claim against him, as the case may be. Similarly, if the applicant's case is bad in law, the sooner that is determined, the better. If it is possible to show by evidence that although material in the form of documents or oral evidence that would put the documents in another light is  not currently before the court, such material is likely to exist and can be expected to be available at trial, it would be wrong to give summary judgment because there would be a real, as opposed to a fanciful, prospect of success. However, it is not enough simply to argue that the case should be allowed to go to trial because something may turn up which would have a  bearing on the question of construction: ICI Chemicals &amp; Polymers Ltd v TTE Training Ltd [2007] EWCA Civ 725.” </p>

So far as concerns the former contentions, the Claimant may derive some support from the “General Condition” that “the Proposal and/or the particulars in writing by which the Insured has applied to the Insurers for an Insurance in the terms stated in this Policy and which the Insured has agreed shall be the basis of this Contract shall be held to be incorporated herein.”  </p>

Mr Stuart-Smith accepted, however, as I have said that it is apparent from paragraph [46] of the Judgment that the Judge’s decision included the arguability of the Claimant’s submissions on interpretation. Furthermore, I bear in mind that the Warranties are standard terms of the Defendants’ Multiline Commercial Combined Policy, which may affect many other policyholders, and that provisions in the Warranties such as “be in full and effective operation at all times” and “put into full and effective operation at all times” are said to have even wider currency in the insurance market. In those particular circumstances, combined with the arguability of the Claimant’s points on interpretation, I can understand why the Judge considered it would also be appropriate to give the Claimant the opportunity to seek and adduce any relevant and admissible factual material available by the date of the trial.  </p>

That protection extends, in the usual course, to a right to continued renewals (at then market rents) with statutory compensation if a renewal does not take place due to assertion by the Landlord of a non-fault ground (e.g. redevelopment).  However, 1954 Act rights require the existence of a Lease and it is common-ground that they would not exist if a Lease was frustrated or otherwise avoided. </p>

Each Lease also contains provision for rent review or a quantified rent increase, including for payment of any balancing figure for the period between a review date and when a review eventually takes place.  The parties have been able to agree figures for what rents and amounts will have fallen due assuming that the defences raised fail, and which are set out in a Schedule attached.  As I say above, a discrete point exists regarding what is said to be an outstanding element of the March quarter’s rent (or rather the VAT upon it) in relation to the SportsDirect Lease (and I set out the relevant wording when I come to that below), and it is common-ground that if its defences do not fail at this point Mecca has an arguable claim to a repayment.  </p>

It also involves treating the insured peril as subject to no geographical limit at all provided only that at least one person manifests the disease within the specified area. That seems to us an improbable form of cover for insurers to provide, as well as one which would be out of line with all the other limbs of the clause. Each of the other sub-clauses covers something happening at, or a consequence of something happening at, the insured premises: for example, injury or illness sustained by any person arising from food or drink provided in the premises; or the presence of vermin or pests in the premises. Sub-clause (a) is naturally understood as operating in a similar way. The only difference from the other sub-clauses is that the risk covered is not confined solely to something happening at the insured premises but extends to something happening within a specified distance away from the insured premises.

I do not think that any party is seeking to rely upon these in any particular way, although Cine-UK has suggested that an independent head of claim by the Landlord against the Insurer might exist under it, but that this should not affect the construction of the “Murder, Suicide or Disease” provisions.  I do not accept that any claim could be made under the “Prevention of Access (Non Damage)” extensions as they contain specific exclusions for closures due to “action taken as a result of drought or diseases or other hazards to health” (2019-2020 Policy) or “where such actions or advice are directly or indirectly caused by or arise from any infectious or contagious disease” (2020-2021 Policy), and which would seem to cover COVID measures.  However, it does seem to me that the clause may have some very limited weight as to construction of the Policy which I deal with below. </p>

She took me to correspondence in May and June 2020 where CineUK had raised the existence and contents of the Code but the Landlords had simply stated that they were entitled to the outstanding rents, and contended that this was not good practice and was not a case of Landlords acting fairly and responsibly as provided for by the June Code but was rather wholly inconsistent with it.  She submitted that the turnover from which it would have been expected that Tenants would pay their rents has been destroyed by the Pandemic and the Government Regulations.  Accordingly, she submitted that there was a strong public policy in these unprecedented circumstances in favour of there being negotiations between the Landlords and Cine-UK and the other Tenants; that the Landlords had simply refused to engage in any such; and that this was of important weight in supporting the Tenants’ contention that the Landlords had not shown that there was “no other compelling reason for a trial” as required for them to obtain summary judgment (CPR24.2(b)). </p>

Therefore, this code is voluntary and presents options…”.  Moreover, the June Code recites that various industry bodies on both the landlord and tenant sides have signed up to the June Code but the Landlords are not members of any relevant body.  The Ministerial Statement does not suggest that the Code is in any way binding.  I also note that Parliament (and the Government through it) has enacted specific limitations upon various legal rights and remedies which are otherwise generally available to Landlords but no such limitation in relation to simply suing for rent (and even if that might lead to enforcement by Writ of Control). </p>

While the Court has power to stay claims for negotiation and to require even unwilling parties to attend alternative dispute resolution hearings (see CPR3.1(2)(f) and (m) and Lomax v Lomax 2019 1 WLR 6527), it would be very unusual to do so where a party was seeking summary judgment on the basis that their claim was clear and all the more so if the court had actually concluded that that was the case (and to which this Judgment is also directed) – and I note that in a different COVID context I have reached a similar conclusion.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.64in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.50in">When interpreting a written contract, the court is concerned to identify the intention of the parties by reference to “what a reasonable person having all the background knowledge which would have been available to the parties would have understood them to be using the language in the contract to mean”, to quote Lord Hoffmann in Chartbrook Ltd v Persimmon Homes Ltd [2009] AC 1101, para 14. And it does so by focussing on the meaning of the relevant words, in this case clause 3(2) of each of the 25 leases, in their documentary, factual and commercial context. That meaning has to be assessed in the light of (i) the natural and ordinary meaning of the clause, (ii) any other relevant provisions of the lease, (iii) the overall purpose of the clause and the lease, (iv) the facts and circumstances known or assumed by the parties at the time that the document was executed, and (v) commercial common sense, but (vi) disregarding subjective evidence of any party's intentions.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.64in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.50in">First, the reliance placed in some cases on commercial common sense and surrounding circumstances (eg in Chartbrook [2009] AC 1101, paras 16-26) should not be invoked to undervalue the importance of the language of the provision which is to be construed. The exercise of interpreting a provision involves identifying what the parties meant through the eyes of a reasonable reader, and, save perhaps in a very unusual case, that meaning is most obviously to be gleaned from the language of the provision. Unlike commercial common sense and the surrounding circumstances, the parties have control over the language they use in a contract. And, again save perhaps in a very unusual case, the parties must have been specifically focussing on the issue covered by the provision when agreeing the wording of that provision.  </p>

That is simply the obverse of the sensible proposition that the clearer the natural meaning the more difficult it is to justify departing from it. However, that does not justify the court embarking on an exercise of searching for, let alone constructing, drafting infelicities in order to facilitate a departure from the natural meaning. If there is a specific error in the drafting, it may often have no relevance to the issue of interpretation which the court has to resolve. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.64in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.50in">The third point I should mention is that commercial common sense is not to be invoked retrospectively. The mere fact that a contractual arrangement, if interpreted according to its natural language, has worked out badly, or even disastrously, for one of the parties is not a reason for departing from the natural language. Commercial common sense is only relevant to the extent of how matters would or could have been perceived by the parties, or by reasonable people in the position of the parties, as at the date that the contract was made.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.64in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.50in">Fourthly, while commercial common sense is a very important factor to take into account when interpreting a contract, a court should be very slow to reject the natural meaning of a provision as correct simply because it appears to be a very imprudent term for one of the parties to have agreed, even ignoring the benefit of wisdom of hindsight. The purpose of interpretation is to identify what the parties have agreed, not what the court thinks that they should have agreed. Experience shows that it is by no means unknown for people to enter into arrangements which are ill-advised, even ignoring the benefit of wisdom of hindsight, and it is not the function of a court when interpreting an agreement to relieve a party from the consequences of his imprudence or poor advice. Accordingly, when interpreting a contract a judge should avoid re-writing it in an attempt to assist an unwise party or to penalise an astute party.  </p>

When interpreting a contractual provision, one can only take into account facts or circumstances which existed at the time that the contract was made, and which were known or reasonably available to both parties. Given that a contract is a bilateral, or synallagmatic, arrangement involving both parties, it cannot be right, when interpreting a contractual provision, to take into account a fact or circumstance known only to one of the parties. </p>

I am unconvinced by the notion that service charge clauses are to be subject to any special rule of interpretation. Even if (which it is unnecessary to decide) a landlord may have simpler remedies than a tenant to enforce service charge provisions, that is not relevant to the issue of how one interprets the contractual machinery for assessing the tenant's contribution. The origin of the adverb was in a judgment of Rix LJ in McHale v Earl Cadogan [2010] HLR 412 , para 17. What he was saying, quite correctly, was that the court should not “bring within the general words of a service charge clause anything which does not clearly belong there”. However, that does not help resolve the sort of issue of interpretation raised in this case.”  </p>

The court was assisted by an earlier agreement which set out the then intended clause containing a parenthesis, of which only part had remained in the final lease. It was not clear whether the parties had mistakenly deleted words from the parenthesis, which they had intended to include, or had failed to delete the parenthesis in its entirety. But that uncertainty as to the nature of the mistake, unusually, did not matter as the outcome was the same on either basis.  </p>

	      </a>the internal context of the contract provided the answer. The sale contract provided for the payment to the vendor of a further sum on disposal of the land by the purchaser. Two of the methods of disposal required the parties to ascertain the market value of the property on disposal in calculating the additional payment and the other used the "gross sales proceeds" in calculating that payment. The purchaser sold the site at an under-value to an associated company, a circumstance which on the face of the contract the parties had not contemplated. The courts at each level interpreted the provision, which used the gross sales proceeds in the calculation, as requiring a market valuation where there was a sale which was not at arm's length. They inferred the intention of the parties at the time of the agreement from the contract as a whole and in particular from the fact that the other two methods of disposal required such a valuation. While this line of reasoning was criticised by Professor Martin Hogg ((2011) Edin LR 406) on the ground that it protected a party from its commercial fecklessness, it seems to me to be </p>

The definition directs attention to the open market value of the subjects "or the relevant part thereof as specified in the notice at the date of the notice served in accordance with clause 9.5". There is no requirement for a notice in accordance with clause 9.5 in the case of a sale. But the absence of a notice does not make the valuation exercise directed by this definition unworkable. In the case of a sale the information that a notice would provide is to be found in the contract, just as in the case of lease it seems not to have been thought necessary to identify the date as at which the subjects were to be valued in order to arrive at the Lease Value. It seems to me therefore that there would be no difficulty in implying a term to the effect that, in the event of a sale which was not at arms length in the open market, an open market valuation should be used to arrive at the base figure for the calculation of the profit share. I see this as the product of the way I would interpret this contract… </p>

It seems to me that the position here is quite straightforward. The context shows that the intention of the parties must be taken to have been that the base figure for the calculation of the uplift was to be the open market value of the subjects at the date of the event that triggered the obligation. In other words, it can be assumed that this is what the parties would have said if they had been asked about it at the time when the missives were entered into. The fact that this makes good commercial sense is simply a makeweight. The words of the contract itself tell us that this must be taken to have been what they had in mind when they entered into it. The only question is whether effect can be given to this unspoken intention without undue violence to the words they actually used in their agreement. For the reasons I have given, I would hold that the words which they used do not prevent its being given effect in the way I have indicated.” </p>

As Baroness Hale observed in the course of the argument, unlike <span style="font-style:italic">Rainy Sky</span>, this is not a case in where there are two alternative available constructions of the language used.

In other words, it can be assumed that this is what the parties would have said if they had been asked about it at the time when the missives were entered into. The parties expressly agreed that in the case of a buy out or lease the profit would be arrived at by reference to market value. Rather like counsel for the respondent bank in <span style="font-style:italic">Rainy Sky</span>, Mr Craig Connal QC was not able to advance any commercially sensible argument as to why the parties would have agreed a different approach in the event of an on sale. I have no doubt that he would have done so if he had been able to think of one. As Lord Hope says at para 17, on the appellants' approach, it would be open to them to avoid the provisions relating to the open market value of a lease by selling the subjects to an associate company at an undervalue and arranging for the lease to be entered into by that company. The parties could not sensibly have intended such a result.  </p>

I agree. If the officious bystander had been asked whether such a term should be implied, he or she would have said "of course". Put another way, such a term is necessary to make the contract work or to give it business efficacy.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.54in">However, all of the decisions are authority for the propositions that where the court concludes that an event has occurred which the parties either did not contemplate or could not have contemplated, then it is proper to search (from the admissible factors as to construction i.e. wording and factual matrix of the contract etc. but not negotiations or subsequent subjective declarations) for their objective contractual intention being as to what they intended, by the words used in the contract, to happen in that situation.  If the intention is sufficiently clear then the relevant contents (i.e. the words) of the contract can be construed as expressing it.  However, if the words used simply cannot justify that construction (e.g. there is nothing in the contract which could be said to deal with the relevant event at all), there is nothing which can be interpreted to achieve the “intended” result by the process of construction; and matters have to be left to the rules of implication (if at all).  On the other hand, the situation where it can be said that (i) the actual objective intention of the parties as to what would happen is clear from the content of the contract etc. but (ii) no words within the contract can be construed on any basis to be expressing it (“the Gap Scenario”), must be a very rare one.  What happens more often is where there is an absence of any relevant wording but it is obvious what is needed for the contract to work or obvious what would have been intended in a relevant circumstance, in which case the law of implication applies. Moreover, even in the Gap Scenario, implication will usually (as was the majority decision in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Aberdeen</span>) be available.  </p>

Moreover, that insurance would be an insurance of the relevant business (i.e. the trade) rather than of the Premises themselves, and thus would not fall foul of the Lease provisions against the tenant effecting insurance of the Premises.  Strictly speaking the liability to pay rent would be irrelevant as the insurance is actually against the diminution in the insured tenant’s trade (i.e. loss of turnover) which is not dependent upon whether or not the rent remained payable.  Rather, it  would be up to the insurer as to whether or not to include a “take account of savings in costs” clause so that if the rent ceased to be payable under the relevant Lease the tenant did not gain a double benefit. </p>

It is correct that those specified events are not immediately suggestive of resultant physical damage.  On the other hand, it is conceivable that a labour disturbance or strike could result in physical damage in some circumstances.  For example, there is the possibility of violence on a picket line leading to actual damage to premises, and the words used are surrounded by others (riot, civil commotion and malicious persons) which suggest that context.  Alternatively, a refusal to carry out maintenance or other protective operations could result in physical damage occurring. </p>

However, his approach also requires it to be clear as to what the parties would have intended (as at the date of grant) to happen in the particular unforeseen circumstances (had they known of them).

There have, of course, been many judicial observations as to the nature of the requirements which have to be satisfied before a term can be implied into a detailed commercial contract. They include three classic statements, which have been frequently quoted in law books and judgments. In <span style="font-style:italic">The Moorcock </span>(1889) 14 PD 64, 68, Bowen LJ observed that in all the cases where a term had been implied, "it will be found that ... the law is raising an implication from the presumed intention of the parties with the object of giving the transaction such efficacy as both parties must have intended that at all events it should have". In <span style="font-style:italic">Reigate v Union Manufacturing Co (Ramsbottom) Ltd </span>[1918] 1 KB 592, 605, Scrutton LJ said that "[a] term can only be implied if it is necessary in the business sense to give efficacy to the contract". He added that a term would only be implied if "it is such a term that it can confidently be said that if at the time the contract was being negotiated" the parties had been asked what would happen in a certain event, they would both have replied "'Of course, so and so will happen; we did not trouble to say that; it is too clear'". And in <span style="font-style:italic">Shirlaw v Southern Foundries (1926) Ltd </span>[1939] 2 KB 206, 227, MacKinnon LJ observed that, "[p]rima facie that which in any contract is left to be implied and need not be expressed is something so obvious that it goes without saying". Reflecting what Scrutton LJ had said 20 years earlier, MacKinnon LJ also famously added that a term would only be implied "if, while the parties were making their bargain, an officious bystander were to suggest some express provision for it in their agreement, they would testily suppress him with a common 'Oh, of course!'". </p>

Sir Thomas then explained that it was "difficult to infer with confidence what the parties must have intended when they have entered into a lengthy and carefully-drafted contract but have omitted to make provision for the matter in issue", because "it may well be doubtful whether the omission was the result of the parties' oversight or of their deliberate decision", or indeed the parties might suspect that "they are unlikely to agree on what is to happen in a certain ... eventuality" and "may well choose to leave the matter uncovered in their contract in the hope that the eventuality will not occur".

	      </a><a href="https://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2000/39.html">,</a> 459, Lord Steyn rightly observed that the implication of a term was "not critically dependent on proof of an actual intention of the parties" when negotiating the contract. If one approaches the question by reference to what the parties would have agreed, one is not strictly concerned with the hypothetical answer of the actual parties, but with that of notional reasonable people in the position of the parties at the time at which they were contracting. Secondly, a term should not be implied into a detailed commercial contract merely because it appears fair or merely because one considers that the parties would have agreed it if it had been suggested to them. Those are necessary but not sufficient grounds for including a term. However, and thirdly, it is questionable whether Lord Simon's first requirement, reasonableness and equitableness, will usually, if ever, add anything: if a term satisfies the other requirements, it is hard to think that it would not be reasonable and equitable. Fourthly, as Lord Hoffmann I think suggested in <span style="font-style:italic">Attorney General of Belize v Belize Telecom Ltd </span><a href="https://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/2009/10.html">

Fifthly, if one approaches the issue by reference to the officious bystander, it is "vital to formulate the question to be posed by [him] with the utmost care", to quote from Lewison, <span style="font-style:italic">The Interpretation of Contracts </span>5th ed (2011), para 6.09. Sixthly, necessity for business efficacy involves a value judgment. It is rightly common ground on this appeal that the test is not one of "absolute necessity", not least because the necessity is judged by reference to business efficacy. It may well be that a more helpful way of putting Lord Simon's second requirement is, as suggested by Lord Sumption in argument, that a term can only be implied if, without the term, the contract would lack commercial or practical coherence. </p>

(The difference between what the reasonable reader would understand and what the parties, acting reasonably, would agree, appears to me to be a notional distinction without a practical difference.) The first proviso emphasises that the question whether a term is implied is to be judged at the date the contract is made. The second proviso is important because otherwise Lord Hoffmann's formulation may be interpreted as suggesting that reasonableness is a sufficient ground for implying a term.

However, that does not mean that the exercise of implication should be properly classified as part of the exercise of interpretation, let alone that it should be carried out at the same time as interpretation. When one is implying a term or a phrase, one is not construing words, as the words to be implied are <span style="font-style:italic">ex hypothesi </span>not there to be construed; and to speak of construing the contract as a whole, including the implied terms, is not helpful, not least because it begs the question as to what construction actually means in this context. </p>

Until one has decided what the parties have expressly agreed, it is difficult to see how one can set about deciding whether a term should be implied and if so what term. This appeal is just such a case. Further, given that it is a cardinal rule that no term can be implied into a contract if it contradicts an express term, it would seem logically to follow that, until the express terms of a contract have been construed, it is, at least normally, not sensibly possible to decide whether a further term should be implied. Having said that, I accept Lord Carnwath's point in para 71 to the extent that in some cases it could conceivably be appropriate to reconsider the interpretation of the express terms of a contract once one has decided whether to imply a term, but, even if that is right, it does not alter the fact that the express terms of a contract must be interpreted before one can consider any question of implication. 29.

Nevertheless, Holgate J held that on the construction of that lease, the intention was that the relevant risk should be allocated to the insurance, upon which the landlord was to rely, and not a negligent tenant (see paragraphs 62, 64, 76 and 77-82). </p>

Issues would exist as to the three month period for cover and the maximum limit of £100,000 and the two different years of the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 Policies; and as to whether the various occurrences of COVID and statutory impositions and relaxations of “lockdowns” meant that there would be multiple claims to be treated separately for these purposes or on one (or more) continuous basis(es).  While I had some considerable difficulties with Ms Holland’s arguments on these various points, they are academic in the light of my other conclusions, and I might well have been concerned anyway to resolve them against the Tenants (or the Insurer who could be prejudiced by my opining on these matters without hearing from it) without (at least) a greater citation of authority on the approach to such “multiple incident” and limitation of liability questions.  </p>

The contract will be discharged if at that time a reasonable person would have taken the view that the event would lead to a sufficiently serious interference with performance to bring about discharge. It is not necessary to wait and see whether such interference actually takes place or would have taken place if attempts to perform had not been abandoned; indeed, the contract will be discharged even though subsequent events show that there would have been no such interference.” References are then made to Embriacos v Sydney Reid [1914] 3 KB 45 where a war event appeared to have disrupted a charterparty permanently but where peace was unexpectedly declared so that the interruption was actually distinctly limited; but frustration had still occurred, Mr Justice Scrutton having said that “Commercial men must not be asked to wait till the end of a long delay to find out from what in fact happens whether they are bound by the contract or not.  They must be entitled to act on reasonable commercial probabilities at the time when they are called upon to make up their minds.” In paragraph  9003 there is then cited Bank Line v Arthur Capital [1919] AC 435 as authority for the same proposition. </p>

	      </a>, the doctrine of frustration brings the whole contract to an end, and in the present case, apart from any adjustment under that Act and any statutory right to compensation under the closure order, the effect of frustration, had it been applicable, would have been to throw the whole burden of interruption for 20 months on the landlord, deprived as he would be of all his rent and imposed as he would have upon his shoulders the whole danger of destruction by fire and the burden of reletting after the interruption. As it is, with the same qualification as to possible compensation, the tenant has to pay the entire rent during the period of interruption without any part of the premises being usable at all, together with the burden (such as it may be) of the performance of the other tenant's covenants which include covenants to insure and repair. These are no light matters.” </p>

No doubt the circumstances in which the doctrine can apply to leases are, to quote Viscount Simon L.C. in the <span style="font-style:italic">Cricklewood</span> case, at p. 231, "exceedingly rare." Lord Wright appears to have thought the same, whilst adhering to the view that there are cases in which frustration can apply, at p. 241. But, as he said in the same passage: "... the doctrine of frustration is modern and flexible and is not subject to being constricted by an arbitrary formula." To this school of thought I respectfully adhere. Like Lord Wright, I am struck by the fact that there appears to be no reported English case where a lease has ever been held to have been frustrated. I hope this fact will act as a suitable deterrent to the litigious, eager to make legal history by being first in this field. But I am comforted by the implications of the well known passage in the Compleat Angler (pt. i, ch. 5) on the subject of strawberries: "Doubtless God could have made a better berry, but doubtless God never did." I only append to this observation of nature the comment that it does not follow from these premises that He never will, and if it does not follow, an assumption that He never will becomes exceedingly rash.” </p>

It will have had to move goods from the warehouse before the closure and to acquire alternative accommodation. After reopening the reverse process must take place. But this does not approach the gravity of a frustrating event. Out of 10 years it will have lost under two years of use: there will be nearly three years left after the interruption has ceased. This is a case, similar to others, where the likely continuance of the term after the interruption makes it impossible for the lessee to contend that the lease has been brought to an end. The obligation to pay rent under the lease is unconditional, with a sole exception for the case of fire, as to which the lease provides for a suspension of the obligation. No provision is made for suspension in any other case: the obligation remains. I am of opinion therefore that the lessee has no defence to the action for rent, that leave to defend should not be given and that the appeal must be dismissed.” </p>

In the instant case the lease was for a short term, and had only about four and a half years to run at the time of the alleged frustrating event - the closure of Kingston Street. The demised premises were a purpose-built warehouse, and both parties contemplated its use as a warehouse throughout the term. This use, in Corbin's words ( Corbin, Contracts , vol. 6, p. 391), "played a large part in fixing rental value," as the rent review clause shows. After the closure of Kingston Street it could no longer be used as a warehouse. No "other substantial uses, permitted by the lease and in the contemplation of the parties, remained possible to the lessee." </p>

But that is not enough. Whenever the performance of a contract is interrupted by a supervening event, the initial judgment is quantitative - what relation does the likely period of interruption bear to the outstanding period for performance? But this must ultimately be translated into qualitative terms: in the light of the quantitative computation and of all other relevant factors (from which I would not entirely exclude executed performance) would outstanding performance in accordance with the literal terms of the contract differ so significantly from what the parties reasonably contemplated at the time of execution that it would be unjust to insist on compliance with those literal terms? In the instant case, at the most favourable to the appellants' contention, they could, at the time when the road was closed, look forward to pristine enjoyment of the warehouse for about two thirds of the remaining currency of the lease. The interruption would be only one sixth of the total term. Judging by the drastic increase in rent under the rent review clause (more than doubled), it seems likely that the appellants' occupation towards the end of the first quinquennium must have been on terms very favourable to them. The parties can hardly have contemplated that the expressly-provided-for fire risk was the only possible source of interruption of the business of the warehouse - some possible interruption from some cause or other cannot have been beyond the reasonable contemplation of the parties. Weighing all the relevant factors, I do not think that the appellants have demonstrated a triable issue that the closure of the road so significantly changed the nature of the outstanding rights and obligations under the lease from what the parties could reasonably have contemplated at the time of its execution that it would be unjust to hold them to the literal sense of its stipulations.” </p>

Among the factors which have to be considered are the terms of the contract itself, its matrix or context, the parties' knowledge, expectations, assumptions and contemplations, in particular as to risk, as at the time of contract, at any rate so far as these can be ascribed mutually and objectively, and then the nature of the supervening event, and the parties' reasonable and objectively ascertainable calculations as to the possibilities of future performance in the new circumstances. Since the subject matter of the doctrine of frustration is contract, and contracts are about the allocation of risk, and since the allocation and assumption of risk is not simply a matter of express or implied provision but may also depend on less easily defined matters such as “the contemplation of the parties”, the application of the doctrine can often be a difficult one. In such circumstances, the test of “radically different” is important: it tells us that the doctrine is not to be lightly invoked; that mere incidence of expense or delay or onerousness is not sufficient; and that there has to be as it were a break in identity between the contract as provided for and contemplated and its performance in the new circumstances. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.64in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.50in">What the “radically different” test, however, does not in itself tell us is that the doctrine is one of justice, as has been repeatedly affirmed on the highest authority. Ultimately the application of the test cannot safely be performed without the consequences of the decision, one way or the other, being measured against the demands of justice. Part of that calculation is the consideration that the frustration of a contract may well mean that the contractual allocation of risk is reversed. A time charter is a good example. Under such a charter, the risk of delay, subject to express provision for the cessation of hire under an off-hire clause, is absolutely on the charterer. If, however, a charter is frustrated by delay, then the risk of delay is wholly reversed: the delay now falls on the owner. If the provisions of a contract in their literal sense are to make way for the absolving effect of frustration, then that must, in my judgment, be in the interests of justice and not against those interests. Since the purpose of the doctrine is to do justice, then its application cannot be divorced from considerations of justice. Those considerations are among the most important of the factors which a tribunal has to bear in mind. </p>

I respectfully agree. Mr Hamblen also referred to Treitel at para 16–009 (“The “theory” does not, in other words, supersede the rules which determine the circumstances in which the doctrine of frustration operates”). I would again respectfully agree, as long as it is not sought to apply those rules as though they are expected to lead one automatically, and without an exercise of judgment, to a determined answer without consideration of the demands of justice.”  </p>

That is one reason why such a “radical difference” has to exist.  Frustration does not suspend the contract, rather it terminates it and so that it does not subsequently revive.

If, for instance, the act of State consists in placing an embargo upon ships leaving the kingdom for particular places abroad, the Courts have held, even when the delay has been very considerable, that the rights under charterparties have only been suspended.

	      </a>as “a state of war must be presumed to be likely to continue so long, and so to disturb the commerce of merchants, as to defeat and destroy the object of a commercial adventure like this.” All trading with the enemy is prohibited, and that condition of things must be presumed to last for an indefinite time; it renders all contracts involving such trading illegal and impossible of further performance, and therefore they become void. In the present case if the interruption were such that the contract could not be carried out in a reasonable time, then it would invalidate the contract. If, on the other hand, the interruption is such that it does not prevent the agreement being carried out within a reasonable time, having regard to the terms of the contract itself, then a mere temporary interruption does not annul the contract. In this case the agreement was to manufacture and deliver goods within a reasonable time, no other time being specified, and the course of business between the parties shows that from six weeks to two months was the usual and reasonable time. If, therefore, an event happens which does not prevent the contract being carried out within that reasonable time and in accordance with the usual course of business between the parties, there is no reason why the contract should be thereby determined; and, having regard to the Proclamations that were issued on August 5, 10, and 20, I am of opinion that it was the duty of the plaintiffs to have waited a reasonable time for the purpose of seeing whether it were possible to fulfil their contract. If they had waited, the contract could have been carried out as usual without any difficulty; if they had waited until August 20 - a short interruption for ten or at the most fifteen days - the contract could have been carried out without difficulty. The suspension caused by the embargo on exportation was a temporary suspension for a short period and did not prevent the contract being carried out in the manner in which the parties had contemplated that it would be carried out. For these reasons I am of opinion that under the circumstances the plaintiffs were not entitled to repudiate the contract and refuse to perform it. It is a breach by them of that contract, and the defendants are entitled to recover against the plaintiffs, giving credit for the agreed sum which the defendants owed to the plaintiffs. In my opinion the appeal ought to be allowed in respect of the counter-claim, the judgment reversed, and judgment entered for the defendants.” </p>

A partial failure of consideration can be a way of categorising a particular event which has meant that a party has not received an agreed benefit under a contract, but it is then a matter of contract law (e.g. that of construction of the contract including as to interdependent obligations, the law of breach of contract or the law of frustration) as to what is the consequence (if any) of that in terms of that party’s rights and obligations.  Here I have construed the contract (i.e. each Lease) so as not to provide for that consequence and likewise applied the law of frustration and supervening events/illegality to the same conclusion.  The Tenants have failed in showing the applicability of any relevant principle of contract law; </p>

The Tenants have already been able to explain their individual situations fully in witness evidence.  The matter has been fully argued out by highly experienced and competent counsel with full citation of authority and ample time for preparation.

Hence the legal maxim, 'transit in rem judicatam,' – the cause of action is changed into matter of record, which is of a higher nature, and the inferior remedy is merged in the higher." </p>

In coming to such conclusion, I think that the first is the most likely construction, but if not then the second, in particular for the reasons set out above and because that it seems to me best fits with both the words used and the commercial and legal context with the factual matrix being (at worst for SportsDirect) neutral. </p>
