	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Wayne Mark Rooney (“WR”) is a professional footballer of international standing and repute. Even at the age of 16, he was widely perceived as a player of immense potential. At that time, he was playing for Everton Football Club; and he continued to do so after he reached the age of 17 on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2002, eventually signing full-time professional forms with the Club on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003. Since then, of course, he has been transferred to Manchester United Football Club and has become an outstanding performer for both club and country.  His success on the field has provided him with a very substantial income derived directly from his footballing activities.  But it has also provided him with a platform to enhance his earning capacity to a very substantial degree in other directions by allowing him to exploit what are termed his “image rights”. He has done so through the medium of a limited company, Stoneygate 48 Limited (“Stoneygate”), the principal Defendant in these proceedings, to which he has assigned the rights in question. Stoneygate has since entered into a number of lucrative sponsorship contracts with major companies such as Coca Cola and Nike by which they have agreed to pay substantial fees to Stoneygate in return for the right to use the Rooney “brand” in connection with the advertisement and promotion of their products. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In recent decades, it has become common for professional footballers to retain the services of agents to represent their interests and negotiate on their behalf.  Agents who represent a professional footballer in connection with his playing or “on-field” activities are regulated by rules laid down by FIFA and, in England, by the Football Association.  Such an agent must be registered with the FA and any on-field representation agreement in relation to on-field activities must be in writing and must be limited to a maximum term of two years.  A copy of any such contract must be lodged with the FA, though the evidence suggests that until comparatively recently this requirement was not rigorously enforced.  Nonetheless, the FA exercises a disciplinary jurisdiction over football agents and can impose sanctions such as suspension or fines for breach of the relevant rules.  By contrast, contracts covering off-field activities are, at present, wholly unregulated whether by FIFA or the FA. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Given WR’s considerable reputation even as a teenager, many football agents were interested in signing him up to such a representation contract.  The early winner in this regard was a Mr Peter McIntosh, who operated through the medium of a company known as Proform Sports Management Limited (“Proform”).  A representation agreement was entered into between Proform and WR on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2000, at a time when he was only a little over 15 years of age.  It was for the maximum period of two years and would, therefore, have expired on or about 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2002.  But, in view of his age, it was questionable whether this contract would have been binding upon WR unless and until he ratified it on achieving the age of 18.  As it happens, it was subsequently held that it was not enforceable by His Honour Judge Hodge QC, </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The Defendant in that action (“Proactive”) is, in fact, the Claimant in the present proceedings.  Proactive is a company which, amongst other things, provides management, agency and personal representation services to sports professionals, and in particular football players. In 2002 and for some time thereafter, its Chief Executive was a Mr Paul Stretford, who was also a director of the company and was registered in his own name as a football agent with the FA. Though Proactive came on the scene much later than Mr McIntosh, it succeeded in obtaining WR’s signature to a written contract dated 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2002 by which it was to act as his agent in respect of both on-field and off-field activities for a period of eight years.  This, of course, was at a time when he was still only 16 years of age and when his subsisting contract with Proform still had some five months to run.  To enter into an on-field representation agreement during the currency of a subsisting contract with another agent is a potentially serious breach of FIFA and FA regulations, as is entering into such an agreement for a period in excess of two years.  But both Mr Stretford and Proactive have vigorously maintained that they believed that the July 2002 contract covered only image rights and other off-field activities and that it was not for some years that they discovered for the first time that, as a matter of fact, it also provided for representation in respect of on-field activities.  It will be necessary to consider the terms of this agreement in greater detail later in this judgment. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In fact, Proactive entered into two further contracts with WR during the course of 2002, one dated 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2002 and the other dated 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2002, just after the expiration of the Proform Agreement.  Both of these agreements were in a similar form and provided for Proactive to represent the player in relation to both onfield and off-field activities.  In each case, however, in contrast to the earlier contract, they were for a period of two years only. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">By the end of 2002, therefore, if one disregards the September Agreement, there were two contracts in force between Proactive and WR; one for a term of eight years commencing on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2002; and the other for a period of two years from 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span> December 2002.  In each case, whatever Proactive and Mr Stretford may have assumed or believed, they covered both on-field and off-field activities.  So it is hardly surprising that Proactive, primarily in the person of Mr Stretford, became heavily engaged in negotiations on behalf of WR with Everton FC with a view to reaching agreement as to the terms upon which he would be willing to enter into a playing contract with the club. Agreement was eventually reached and contract forms were duly signed on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">But, at the same time, consideration was being given within Proactive to the way in which WR’s off-field earning capacity might best be exploited.  In the light of specialist tax and legal advice, it was decided that a suitable mechanism would be for WR to assign his image rights to a limited company and for that company to enter into sponsorship agreements and the like, rather than for him to do so directly.  The company used for this purpose was, of course, Stoneygate and, at some stage in January or February 2003, all the necessary documentation required for this purpose was prepared and executed. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">But, in view of the assignment of WR’s image rights to Stoneygate, it was decided that it would be necessary to execute a new Image Rights Representation Agreement between Stoneygate and Proactive by which Proactive would act on behalf of Stoneygate for the purposes of exploiting those rights.  Such an Agreement was duly signed by Mr Neil Rodford on behalf of Proactive, WR on his own behalf and his mother, Mrs Jeanette Rooney on behalf of Stoneygate. The Agreement is formally dated 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003 but there is a substantial dispute as to when it was in fact executed. This Image Rights Representation Agreement is, once again, expressed to be for a term of eight years; and it provides for remuneration by way of commission at the rate of 20%. It is this Agreement upon which Proactive relies as the basis of its claims against Stoneygate in the present proceedings. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">But there was a yet further agreement which was entered into at or about the same time as this new Image Rights Representation Agreement between Proactive and Stoneygate. It will be recalled that, in July 2002, Proactive had entered into a contract directly with WR which also, in effect, provided for image rights representation by Proactive on his behalf. There would seem to have been no obvious legal or commercial reason for maintaining this earlier Agreement in force once the new Agreement had been executed.  But, as will also be recalled, the contract of July 2002 also extended to on-field representation, albeit, it is said, without the knowledge of Proactive or Mr Stretford. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Accordingly, in circumstances which will have to be considered in some detail later in this judgment, it was decided that the earlier agreement should be varied, rather than rescinded, so as to strip out the provisions governing off-field representation so that, for the future, it would embrace only on-field representation.  This was achieved by means of a Variation Agreement prepared by Proactive’s specialist legal advisers, a firm of solicitors known as Couchman Harrington, and duly executed by Mr Stretford, on behalf of Proactive, and WR, his father, Mr Wayne Thomas Rooney, and his mother Mrs Jeanette Rooney. Once again, the document is formally dated 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span> January 2003 but the actual date of execution is very much in dispute. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The essential features of this re-organisation of the contractual arrangements between Proactive, Stoneygate and WR in early 2003 were that WR’s image rights were assigned to Stoneygate, that a new Image Rights Representation Agreement was entered into between Stoneygate and WR on the one hand and Proactive on the other, and that the original Agreement between Proactive and WR dated 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2002 remained in force and effect, albeit varied so as to cover only representation in relation to the player’s footballing activities.  Proactive’s right to represent WR in relation to his image rights was, therefore, governed by its Agreement with Stoneygate; and its rights to represent him on the playing side were, on the face of it, governed by the original Agreement of July 2002 (as varied).  Both of these Agreements were for a term of eight years. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">But there was, of course, also in existence the representation agreement dated 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span> December 2002 which covered both on-field and off-field activities but which was limited to a period of two years.  This agreement was never formally rescinded or varied, though it seems quite clear that it was never regarded as the basis of Proactive’s right to represent WR in relation to his off-field activities.  But it was apparently renewed on the same or similar terms at the end of 2004 and, again, at the end of 2006. Only a copy of the 2006 version was, however, ever lodged with the FA. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Once these contractual arrangements were in place, or perhaps even in anticipation of them, Proactive played its part with vigour and success.  The main point of contact between Proactive and the Rooney family was Mr Stretford.  Indeed, on the playing side, he had to act as WR’s agent, since a corporate body was not permitted under FA rules to act in that capacity.  But he also played a pivotal role in relation to the exploitation of WR’s image rights.  He successfully negotiated a series of highly lucrative sponsorship contracts between Stoneygate and various major commercial concerns; he was largely responsible for maintaining the relationship between WR and these commercial sponsors; and he headed a small group of other employees of Proactive known collectively as “Team Rooney” which assisted him in dealing with WR’s commercial interests.  But not only was he WR’s football agent and the man principally responsible for the exploitation of his image rights, but Mr Stretford was also a director of Stoneygate, in addition to the office which he held with Proactive.  Indeed, it had originally been envisaged that he would be the principal shareholder in Stoneygate when the new arrangements were being put in place at the beginning of 2003, though that suggestion was abandoned in circumstances about which I will have a little more to say in due course.  Be that as it may, in his capacity as a director of Stoneygate, despite the obvious risk of a conflict of interests, Mr Stretford took on the responsibility of approving all invoices submitted to Stoneygate on behalf of Proactive for commission and other fees claimed by Proactive under the Image Rights Representation Agreement or for other services rendered to Stoneygate. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">There is no doubt that over the years which have passed since the middle of 2002, Mr Stretford has built up a close relationship with WR and his family.

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">That loyalty survived an unhappy episode in which Mr Stretford was charged with various disciplinary offences by the FA arising out of the way in which the July 2002 Agreement was entered into and the terms of that Agreement.  After a full disciplinary hearing, an FA Regulatory Commission decided, on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2008, that various of these charges had been made out and imposed a substantial fine of £300,000 and suspended Mr Stretford from acting as a player’s agent for a period of 18 months, though it was directed that the second nine months would not come into operation unless he was found guilty of further breaches of the FA Rules.  Mr Stretford then appealed but his appeal was dismissed.  The period of suspension imposed by the Regulatory Commission had, however, been stayed pending the determination of the appeal; and I am informed that it eventually expired only some time in the early part of 2010. It should be noted that it was Proactive which paid the substantial fine which had been imposed by the Commission. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">But this disciplinary hearing led to the parting of the ways between Mr Stretford and Proactive. On or before 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2008, he resigned his position as director of Proactive in circumstances which were the subject of severe cross-examination during the course of the trial. Thereafter, during the course of September 2008, discussions took place with a view to agreeing terms of an amicable separation between Mr Stretford and Proactive on the basis that he would continue to represent Stoneygate and WR subject to payment of financial compensation to Proactive. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">But in early October 2008, Proactive’s attitude changed. On 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2008, a meeting was held between Mr Stretford and Mr John Lawrence and Mr Michael Wallwork on behalf of Proactive. During the course of this meeting, it was explained to Mr Stretford that Proactive had recently discovered documents on the file of Couchman Harrington, the solicitors who had acted on behalf of Proactive in connection with the arrangements which had been agreed in early 2003, and that these documents appeared to show that Mr Stretford had been aware of the nature and terms of the July 2002 agreement, contrary to the evidence which he had given at the recent disciplinary hearing. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">But no resolution was achieved at this meeting or in its aftermath and solicitors were instructed on each side.  Proactive instituted its own disciplinary proceedings against Mr Stretford and suspended him from duty.  He was eventually dismissed from his employment on grounds of gross misconduct on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2008.  But Mr Stretford has challenged this decision and contends that it was Proactive which was in repudiatory breach of his contract of employment, which he has accepted. </p>

Furthermore, he has retained the loyalty and allegiance of WR for whom he continues to act through a new company known as Triple S Limited which was, it seems, informally appointed to act as Stoneygate’s agent in relation to WR’s image rights in or about July 2009.  According to Mr Stretford, however, he has not been acting as WR’s personal football agent, no doubt because of the period of suspension imposed upon him by the FA Regulatory Commission and upheld on appeal. </p>

He is also married to Mrs Coleen Rooney, formerly McLoughlin, who has her own image rights company, Speed 9849 Limited (“Speed”), for which Proactive formerly acted, albeit without any formal contract, and which is also a Defendant in the present action.  Mrs Rooney, like her husband, is also a Defendant, though no claim is now pursued against her, save in respect of costs. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In commercial reality, the current dispute reflects the tug-o’-war between Proactive and Mr Stretford over the right to represent WR on and off the pitch.  But, in formal terms, the present action primarily involves a claim by Proactive against Stoneygate for arrears of commission said to be due to it under the Image Rights Representation Agreement and for a reasonable sum for other services provided.  In addition, however, Proactive claims damages arising out of the alleged repudiatory breach of contract by Stoneygate. It also asserts a right to recover further commission, as and when it falls due, notwithstanding the termination of the agreement, and seeks appropriate declaratory relief to that effect.  The total claim in respect of unpaid commission and invoices for other services amounts to £1,071,137.08.  But the amount of its claim in respect of further commission, as and when it falls due, is estimated to be substantially higher.  A total figure in excess of £3m was put forward during the course of the trial. </p>

But Mr Michael Wallwork, the Group Marketing Director of Proactive’s present parent company, gave an estimate of between £3 and £4m in the course of cross-examination; and Mr Mark Page, the Finance Director of Proactive’s parent company, gave a similar estimate.  This was, apparently, based upon figures provided by Proactive’s expert witness, Mr Mel Stein.  But, in the course of his closing submissions, Mr Mill QC conceded that any such claim should be capped at a sum calculated by reference to the provisions of clause 8 of the Image Rights Representation Agreement between Proactive and Stoneygate.  That is a provision which I will have to consider in more detail later in this judgment.  But, despite that concession, the claim made by Proactive against Stoneygate is plainly a substantial one. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Stoneygate, however, resists the claim, as formulated, in its entirety.  Indeed, it has raised a counterclaim seeking recovery of monies previously paid by Stoneygate to Proactive over the intervening years since the inception of the Image Rights Representation Agreement, though it is fair to say that this was not seriously pursued by Mr Chaisty QC, on behalf of Stoneygate, during the course of the trial.  There are two main planks to Stoneygate’s defence.  Firstly, it is alleged that the Image Rights Representation Agreement was void for mistake, so that there can be no claim, at least in contract, for commission due or falling due under the Agreement or for damages for breach of contract. Further or alternatively, it is contended that the Agreement is unenforceable on the grounds that it is in restraint of trade and that it has not been demonstrated that the restraints were reasonable having regard to the legitimate interests of the parties.  Various points of construction in relation to the Image Rights Representation Agreement are also raised by Stoneygate.  One of these relates to the question whether, as a matter of contract, Proactive is entitled to recover commission in the future, notwithstanding the termination of the Agreement itself. Various specific defences are also advanced in relation to claims under various invoices which have already been raised by Proactive. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">It is almost needless to say that all of these grounds of defence are very much in issue.  But, in the alternative, if the Image Rights Representation Agreement is held to be void or unenforceable, Proactive advances a claim for a restitutionary remedy by which it seeks to recover remuneration for the services which it has provided to Stoneygate on a quantum meruit basis.  Indeed, Mr Mill QC, on behalf of Proactive, effectively sought to quantify that claim by reference to the amounts which would have been payable as a matter of contract as well as by reference to what might be described as market rates.  Mr Chaisty QC, whilst accepting that a restitutionary claim </p>

He contends that the amount of the claim has not been adequately quantified on the face of the pleadings and that there is no sufficient evidence upon which the court could properly determine the appropriate figure.  He submitted, therefore, that there would have to be a separate assessment of the amount recoverable by Proactive, no doubt on the basis of any points of principle which could properly be resolved at this stage of the proceedings. </p>

It also seeks to recover payments for other services rendered to Speed.  As presently pleaded, the total amount claimed is £215,267.15, but one or two adjustments have since been sought to be made to that figure. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Proactive bases its claim either on an agency contract said to have been entered into between Speed and Proactive by words or by conduct, or on the basis of a series of individual contracts relating to specific transactions in which it acted on behalf of Speed or, it would seem, by way of a restitutionary quantum meruit.  But, as was made clear in the course of the trial, it does not advance any claim for damages for breach of contract. In effect, the claim proceeds on the basis of invoices already raised by Proactive in respect of its services, coupled with a claim for commission on any further sums which may fall due in respect of the same contracts. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">On behalf of Speed, Mr Chaisty challenges the contention that there was or must have been some form of agency agreement between Proactive and Speed.  But he could not and did not challenge Proactive’s claim for a reasonable sum in respect of services rendered. In essence, therefore, the real issue between Proactive and Speed was as to whether the remuneration payable to Proactive was to be measured by reference to the alleged contractual rate or on some other basis.  There was also, of course, an issue as to whether Proactive was entitled to any future commission or similar remuneration.  Once again, as I understood the position, it was Mr Chaisty’s contention that any question of assessment on a quantum meruit basis would have to be left over to another day. </p>

But by early 2002, WR, or perhaps more correctly his parents, were receiving many approaches from other football agents who were interested in representing their son.  It was suggested that one of these prospective agents was Proactive’s expert witness, Mr Mel Stein, who, according to Mr Rooney senior had offered a substantial fee as an inducement.  This evidence emerged for the first time during the course of the trial itself.  I have little doubt that Mr Rooney’s evidence to that effect was given to the court in good faith.  But it relates to events which took place some eight years ago and it was adamantly denied by Mr Stein himself.  On this point, I prefer the evidence of Mr Stein and, insofar as it may be material, I am not prepared to hold that he made any such approach. </p>

They were acquainted with a Mr Mick Doherty who worked for Proactive and was the father of one of their son’s teammates in the Everton Youth Team; and they were aware that Mr Stretford represented several of the Everton first team players.

A manuscript attendance note on DLA’s file appears to record the general nature of these instructions.

The letter first dealt with two legal questions which were considered to be of particular relevance.  One of these was the contractual capacity of minors and the other was the doctrine of restraint of trade.  In relation to the latter, the writer noted that it was particularly important to ensure that the contract was not too one-sided in favour of Proactive, particularly in the light of the proposed eight-year term and what was described as the proposed “liquidated damages clause for early termination”.  Reference was also made to previous case law, but the writer considered that the proposed agreement could be distinguished from earlier cases in that it was a “more balanced deal”, since it involved a payment of £50,000 to the Rooney family.  Furthermore, the earlier cases involved litigation over contracts which controlled a party’s full-time employment and livelihood.  The proposed contract could be distinguished since it related to “something that flows from Wayne’s primary livelihood as footballer and which will be set out in his normal employment contract with the football club.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The letter then provided a brief commentary on some of the clauses of the draft agreement.  Four of the writer’s comments are of particular potential significance.  Clause 3 of the draft agreement set out the contractual obligations of Proactive.  At paragraph 2.2 of the letter of 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2002, the writer asked Mr Rodford to review clauses 3 and 4 carefully.  It was also pointed out that he should recognise some of the wording of clause 3.1 from what was described as “the Shortform Representation Agreement” forwarded to DLA by Mr Rodford’s secretary earlier in the week.  That was obviously the standard form agreement to which I have already referred. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The writer of the letter then referred to clause 7.1 of the draft agreement which dealt with the duration of the contract. A specific enquiry was raised as to whether the proposed term of eight years was correct. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">This was followed by some comments on clause 8, which dealt with the consequences of termination.  This was said to provide for what would happen if WR or his parents terminated the agreement.  It was intended to ensure that Proactive could recover the sum of £50,000 which it was proposing to pay to the Rooneys.  But the writer also commented that Proactive should also consider including a right to recover “liquidated damages to reflect the potential loss of future revenue for Proactive”. </p>

It was his evidence that, following his return, Mr Rodford held a meeting with him and two other employees of Proactive and said that if they wished to sign up WR, they would have to make a payment.  That, of course, had probably already been discussed at the meeting between Mr Rodford and the Rooneys on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2002; and provisions referable to that payment had been incorporated in the draft agreement prepared by DLA.

Mr Rodford and Mr Doherty attended on behalf of Proactive and were present from the beginning of the meeting.  Mr Stretford had another engagement, as a result of which he arrived late. Mr Rodford handed a copy of the draft agreement prepared by DLA to Mr and Mrs Rooney; and they, in their turn, gave Mr Rodford a copy of the Proform Agreement.  Mr Rodford had also prepared a draft letter for Mr and Mrs Rooney to send to Proform with a view to terminating the Proform Agreement.  But, after Mr Stretford arrived, there was something of an altercation between them, since Mr Stretford was anxious to avoid any reference to Proactive in a letter of this kind, so as to avoid any suggestion that it might be guilty of the disciplinary offence of “tapping up”. So he drafted an alternative version which did not mention Proactive.  It appears, however, that by accident both versions of the letter were subsequently sent out to Proform.  It should perhaps be noted that, according to Mr Stretford, he did not appreciate at the time that a draft representation agreement had been handed over to Mr and Mrs Rooney before he arrived to join the meeting. </p>

It would be surprising if there had been no subsequent discussion between DLA and Mr Rodford.  Indeed, there is an internal manuscript attendance note from DLA’s file which suggests that DLA were concerned about the risk of possible litigation if Proactive were to induce a breach of what appeared to be a two-year exclusive agency agreement between Proform and the player.  But, if so, Proactive, or at least Mr Rodford, must have taken the view that the risk was one worth taking, since no attempt appears to have been made to recall or modify the form of agreement which had been handed over to the Rooneys at the meeting on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2002.

All  the witnesses called to give evidence on behalf of Stoneygate, including, of course, Mr Stretford, gave evidence to the effect that they did not realise that this was the position. I did not, however, hear from Mr Rodford; but it appears that in the FA disciplinary proceedings he had given evidence to the effect that he also was unaware of this feature of the Agreement prepared by DLA and ultimately signed on or about 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2002. In the present proceedings, Proactive took a neutral stance on this issue. Its only substantive relevance seems to be in connection with the plea of mistake advanced on behalf of Stoneygate in relation to the subsequent Image Rights Representation Agreement upon which Proactive bases its claims in the present litigation. It is a matter, therefore, that I will have to resolve in due course. </p>

But there is, in fact, no evidence whatever that they did so. On the contrary, Mr and Mrs Rooney denied that they had ever been advised to take legal advice of this nature or that they had done so.  It is true that, in crossexamination, Mr Rooney senior was prepared to accept that Mr Rodford may have read through the draft agreement with them at the meeting on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2002; and on that basis, Mr Mill invited me to infer that they were, in fact, advised to take independent legal advice as to the terms of the draft agreement and, indeed, that they probably did so.  But I am quite unwilling to draw any such inference against their clear denials and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary from Mr Rodford.  It is, however, the case that Mr and Mrs Rooney subsequently sought legal advice from a solicitor in relation to certain other contractual issues.  But it seems highly unlikely that this was in any way related as to the terms of the contract which Proactive was inviting them to sign. </p>

One of these was a Mr Kevin Dooley, who was then in practice with a firm known as David Phillips and Partners or DPP. It was Mr Dooley that they chose to instruct.  According to both Mr Stretford and Mr Rooney senior, the reason why they felt that they needed legal advice on their own account was in order to see whether they could extricate themselves from the Proform Agreement, particularly in view of the fact that there appeared to have been some suggestion that there might be an attempt to assign the Agreement by Proform to another football representation agency known as X8 Limited. </p>

This contract appears to have been in Proactive’s then standard form and is identical to the specimen which was sent to DLA by or on behalf of Mr Rodford when they were first instructed to prepare what ultimately became the July 2002 Agreement.  It was for a period of two years commencing on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2002.  But it was signed only by WR and not by his parents, notwithstanding that he was still under the age of 18 at the time.  Mr Stretford signed it on behalf of Proactive.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">But according to both Mr Stretford and Mr Rooney senior, Mr Stretford had a change of heart about the desirability of entering into such a representation agreement at that time.  At least according to Mr Stretford, he asked Mr Rooney for his son’s copy of the Agreement and tore it up, though Proactive’s own copy seems to have been retained on file.  The reason for this is said to have been because of the prospect of a legal dispute arising between Proactive on the one hand and Proform and X8 Limited on the other. The whole episode seems to have been a little theatrical and slightly odd in view of the advice given by Mr Newman and the retention of Proactive’s own copy of the Agreement.  But it appears that Everton FC was unwilling to engage in contract negotiations with Proactive so long as the Proform Agreement had not run its full term.  Indeed, on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2002, the Club’s Chief Executive, Mr Michael Dunford, had written to Mr McIntosh confirming that there had been no negotiations between the Club and Proactive in relation to WR and stating that, unless an agreement could be reached between Proform, Proactive and the Rooney family, negotiations would not commence until 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2002. </p>

On this occasion, however, Mr Stretford did not himself sign the contract on behalf of Proactive.  The actual signatory was, it would seem, a Mr Jonathan Stanger, another registered football agent employed by Proactive.

Accordingly, the way was clear for Proactive to become directly involved in negotiations with Everton FC with a view to reaching agreement on the terms of a new playing contract and allied benefits.  These negotiations were conducted by Mr Stretford himself.  But other aspects of the relationship between Proactive and the Rooney family still had to be worked out; and various other individuals within Proactive were involved, at least to some degree, in relation to such matters.  These included, most notably, Mr Rodford and Mr Christopher Rawlings, who was then Proactive’s Sports Marketing Manager. But there is a good deal of dispute as to precisely what part these individuals played.  Indeed, factually the most contentious issue in the case is how far Mr Stretford had any involvement in the new arrangements for off-field representation and how much knowledge he had of those arrangements at the time. </p>

He asked for the dates of birth of the three directors and for confirmation as to whether WR was to be the sole shareholder.  So it is quite clear that at that time it was already envisaged that WR’s image rights would be operated through the medium of a limited company in order to secure the tax benefits of operating in this way. </p>

DLA do not initially seem to have been aware  that Kingsbridge had already earmarked Stoneygate for these purposes and appear, therefore, to have given some consideration as to precisely what type of company would be required. On 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2002, they e-mailed to Mr Rawlings a draft Management Representation Agreement between the proposed new company and Proactive, a draft Image Rights Licence Agreement and a note regarding the tax issues involved in setting up a new company to be registered in the United Kingdom or abroad.

Be that as it may, it was decided to instruct a Mr Daniel Harrington, a partner in a London firm of solicitors specialising in sports law, known as Couchman Harrington Associates.  Mr Harrington had known Mr Rodford for some time and had met Mr Rawlings and Mr Stretford at an “away day” hosted by Proactive in Amsterdam in December 2001.  A meeting was arranged between Mr Rawlings and Mr Harrington together with his partner Mr Couchman at the Metropole Hotel in London on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> December 2002. As a result, Mr Harrington was instructed throughout the crucial period of about two months during which all the relevant documents were prepared and executed.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Rawlings’ notes are in sequence and some of them are dated.  It appears from these notes and Mr Rawlings commentary upon them that he first became involved in marketing matters relating to WR towards the end of October 2002.  From a very early stage, it is apparent that careful consideration was being given as to how best to market the Rooney brand.  An early note identifies the “team” which would be involved and briefly notes their responsibilities.  Thus Mr Rawlings himself would deal with commercial matters and Mr Stretford would act as the player’s agent with Mr Stanger in support. Curiously, perhaps, Mr Dooley is identified as the “family adviser”, though DLA were also to be instructed, it would seem, to prepare some form of confidentiality agreement.  The same note refers to certain “stock answers” which were to be given in response to any press enquiries.  These included the note that there should be “no contractual dialogue until Dec 12th”; and, on the same page, reference was also made to “commercial representation until Dec 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>”.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Shortly afterwards, Mr Rawlings made a rather more detailed note referring to the proposed company set-up and the advice to be obtained from William A Shepherd or DLA. These appear to be references to the proposed image rights company and trademark protection.  They were followed by a brief note about marketing strategy which indicate that Proactive should be looking for six or seven long-term partners in various fields including sportswear, soft drinks and computer games. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">It seems fairly clear from these notes that WR’s image rights were seen as a potentially highly marketable product and that quite extensive consideration was being given as to how best to exploit this potential.  Whilst that would obviously have come within Mr Rawlings’ remit, he emphasised that no major decisions would have been taken without Mr Stretford’s involvement and approval and that it was Mr Stretford who took responsibility for negotiating all major sponsorship deals.  Certainly, there are a number of references to Mr Stretford in the notes produced by Mr Rawlings which provide some support for his evidence that Mr Stretford was always the main point of contact between Proactive and WR and that all decisions relating to the player were made or authorised by Mr Stretford. </p>

In his witness statement, Mr Rawlings said that he could not remember who mentioned that there should be any sort of agreement lasting eight years but he assumed that this must have been Mr Stretford, as matters of that kind were outside his own purview.  But when challenged about this in cross-examination, he became, if anything, more insistent that it must have been Mr Stretford who had told him about this in the course of a meeting, since he had not seen the 2002 Agreement at that time. </p>

An attendance note on the Couchman Harrington file records that there was already in existence a “Management Agreement” between WR and Proactive but that this would be supplemented by separate assignment of all of the player’s image and related rights into Stoneygate which would in turn grant exclusive marketing and representation rights to Proactive.

That was not supplied to them until 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003. Secondly, the attendance note records an observation by the solicitors that WR might “technically” need independent legal representation in relation to the contracts which were being contemplated.

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The first task which Couchman Harrington were asked to carry out was the preparation of a report on a proposed image rights agreement with Everton FC.  Once the Proform Agreement had expired and the new Representation Agreement with Proactive had been signed on or about 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2002, Proactive, and Mr Stretford in particular, were able to engage in formal negotiations with Everton FC for the purposes of negotiating a new playing contract for WR.  But Proactive also wished to negotiate a separate image rights agreement with the club under which the club would be granted a licence to exploit the player’s image rights for certain limited purposes closely related to his playing activities, such as the promotion of replica kit and official club merchandise.  It was envisaged that the club would pay a minimum fee plus royalties in return for such a licence.  It appears to have been considered that if such an agreement could be reached under which fees and royalties were payable to a limited company rather than directly to the player himself, it would result in a more tax-efficient package of emoluments than if all payments had simply been made directly to the player. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">It was, of course, Mr Stretford who was leading the negotiations on behalf of WR with a view to reaching agreement both on the terms of a new playing contract and of any image rights licence.  But it seems to have been anticipated that there might be some reluctance on the part of the club to agree to a separate image rights licence in respect of such a young player. The report commissioned by Mr Rawlings from Couchman Harrington was intended to help to persuade Everton FC that such an image rights deal was appropriate. </p>

It is unnecessary to examine its contents in any detail.  It summarised the way in which certain elite sportsmen were beginning to exploit their image rights through the medium of a limited company.  It provided estimates of the value of such image rights in respect of a number of top footballers and gave an assessment of the value to the club of recent media coverage of WR’s career and activities.

It addressed the potential tax advantages of such an arrangement and commented on the fact that such a scheme appeared to have received the approval of the Inland Revenue.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">But what is, perhaps, most striking about the report is the way in which it seeks to emphasise the very remarkable potential of the player, despite his youth and comparative inexperience.  Those views would presumably reflect those held by Mr Stretford and Proactive. It is worth picking out one or two comments from the report.  In the very first paragraph, it refers to him as “the most promising young English footballer for many years”.  At paragraph 4.2, it refers to him as a “star player” who promised to be “one of the Premiership’s (if not Europe’s) brightest talents for many years”. Towards the end, it comments on the benefits which the club could expect from the presence of “a genuine world class star player”.  Then, in Appendix 2, it sets out a very considerable number of golden opinions which had been expressed by various players and commentators, all of which were introduced by the observation that these underline “his growing reputation as the most talented youngster in Britain”. </p>

Shepherd.  Mr Harrington then enquired when Proactive would want his firm to prepare the relevant contractual documentation and to advise on the structure of the arrangements.

In this context, it was pointed out that WR was still a minor and that he might well be entitled to terminate the contract lawfully during his minority or within a reasonable time after reaching the age of 18.  Amongst other things, Mr Harrington advised that Proactive should seek and (if commercially acceptable to Proactive) pay for independent legal and financial advice for WR prior to his signing the contract.  Any such costs should not be recoupable or repayable.  Furthermore, assurances should be sought from the independent adviser that the player had read the assignment and understood his responsibilities and obligations under it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The letter then dealt with the proposed image rights company.  That is, of course, Stoneygate. It was noted that two shares had been issued; and the obvious question was asked as to whether both would be transferred to WR.  A question was also raised as to whether it would be appropriate to change the name of the company to one more closely associated with the player’s own name.  This section of the letter also dealt with the tax treatment of the company.  In this context, it was suggested that it would be a good idea for WR to have some form of personal endorsement deal in place before the assignment.  It was also suggested that the payments for playing services should be clearly distinguished from payments for the grant of image rights, so as to avoid the risk that image rights income was simply a way of remunerating the player for his services as a player and, for the same reason, that the split between salary and payment for promotional services and image rights should be commercially justifiable. </p>

Some brief advice was given about certain of the terms.  Furthermore, what was described as an “inducement letter” was also annexed to the draft assignment which was intended to give comfort to potential licensees that WR would stand behind the obligations of the company.

He commented that Mr Stretford might already have agreed some of the key terms which might differ from these suggestions.  His e-mail went on to say that he thought, or at least hoped, that heads of agreement could be achieved by the end of the week and that a “long-form” agreement could be drafted and signed off as soon as possible thereafter.  But he noted that there were a number of corporate and tax matters which needed to be looked at carefully before the deal was finalised.  Nonetheless, he suggested that commercially-binding heads of agreement should be possible fairly quickly. He concluded by saying that he looked forward to catching up with Mr Rawlings and Mr Stretford on the following day.  This obviously referred to the fact that a meeting or meetings had been arranged for the following day, 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003, which Mr Harrington had been asked to attend.

It was his evidence that Mr Stretford read out the terms of an agreement which he wished to negotiate with Everton FC later that afternoon.

Mr Stretford referred to the fact that Mr Farnell of Eversheds was now advising Everton FC. He suggested that if Mr Farnell questioned the principle as to whether there should be an image rights agreement between the club and the player, Mr Harrington might wish to produce the advice which Mr Farnell had already given about such matters and which had been amongst the papers handed to him by Mr Rawlings on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> December 2002. In the event, however, that proved unnecessary.  But in addition, Mr Stretford stated that he would like to take shares in Stoneygate.  For his part, Mr Harrington had doubts as to whether this would be either usual or appropriate, though he was unsure whether he expressed those reservations during the course of the meeting.  As will be seen, the issue was resolved as a result of tax advice from Powrie Appleby. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">It is unnecessary, I think, to refer to Mr Harrington’s manuscript notes of the meeting save for two brief points. Underneath a brief summary of the proposed wages and signing on fee, Mr Harrington wrote down what appears to be a figure of £3,066,000, which seems to have reflected the total value of the package which was being negotiated. Secondly, he noted that, as a result of the assignment of WR’s Image Rights to Stoneygate, there would be a need for a representation agreement between Proactive and Stoneygate.  That appears to be the first reference to the need for a new agreement to replace or supplement the Agreement of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2002. </p>

He and Mr Rawlings were taken to the ground by Mr Stretford in his own car.  When they arrived, they were taken to the board room where they met Mr Dunford, the club’s Chief Executive Officer and Mr Farnell. After some initial exchanges, it was agreed in principle that the image rights agreement would proceed, whereupon Mr Farnell and Mr Harrington left the room in order to resolve the precise wordings of draft Heads of Agreement.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The parties to these Heads of Agreement were Everton FC, Stoneygate and Proactive (which was described as the “Agent”).  Amongst the recitals, it was recorded that Stoneygate, as licensor, was authorised to control, deal with and manage WR’s image rights and promotional and commercial services; and that Proactive, as agent, was authorised to advise upon and assist in the administration and management of the commercial exploitation of such rights. It also recited the fact that WR anticipated entering into a playing contract with Everton FC, indicating that, at least at that time, he had not actually done so. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The Heads of Agreement then set out the key terms of the proposed substantive agreement which granted a licence to Everton FC to use the player’s image and promotional rights for a term of three years in return for a minimum annual payment of £150,000 plus VAT. It also recorded that the parties intended to replace the Heads of Agreement with a binding long-form Agreement as soon as possible which would include standard “boiler plate” clauses, warranties and indemnities.  It was also expressly stated that the Heads of Agreement should come into effect once signed by all parties, and that the effective date should be the date of the signature of the last party to sign. As Mr Harrington pointed out, it could not come into force at once, since there had, as yet, been no assignment of WR’s image rights to Stoneygate and, indeed, that the company structure had not yet been finalised. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Harrington could not, of course, give evidence as to what happened whilst he and Mr Farnell were away from the board room.  But it was his understanding that agreement was reached in principle as to the terms of the on-field player contract.  These discussions took some time and it was early evening before they were able to leave Goodison Park. As a result, Mr Harrington missed his train and had to stay overnight in Crewe before making his way back to London the following morning. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Rawlings also had some recollection of these events, albeit of a fairly limited nature. But he was able to refresh his memory to some extent by reference to some manuscript notes which he had made in preparation for the meeting at Proactive’s offices as well as some notes which he made during the meeting itself.  The preparatory notes were set out in typescript, although he subsequently made a number of manuscript annotations upon them. At least some of these, he thought, would have been made after discussions with Mr Stretford.  Not much of significance arises out of these preparatory notes.  They indicate that he was uncertain as to how the two issued shares in Stoneygate should be re-allocated and that no banking arrangements had been set up for the Company. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Rawlings also added two further observations in manuscript.  The first reads “PS Agreement - VIII year deal”; and the other says “get all detail from Paul regarding issues - nitty gritty.”  In his witness statement, he said that he could not say whether the initials “PS” referred to Mr Stretford or to Proactive.  But I am very much inclined to think that it must be a reference to Mr Stretford rather Proactive Sports Management.  The potential significance of these entries is that, at least by this time, Mr Rawlings must have been aware that an agreement for a term of eight years was either in existence or in contemplation.  The notes also provide some support for Mr Rawlings’ evidence that any details of the arrangements with the player would have to be obtained from Mr Stretford. </p>

But he also noted one or two other matters which had not been recorded by Mr Harrington, perhaps because he was out of the room at the time.  Thus, Mr Rawlings recorded that there would be a “signatory date” of 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> February and that there should be a “formal announcement”, apparently to the effect that terms had been agreed, on the following Friday, with a press session at a later date.  This was followed by a comment seemingly attributed to Mr Stretford to the effect that this would be “OK if heads signed before Friday”. The following Friday, it should be noted, would have been 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Stretford, for his part, appeared to have only limited recollection of the events of 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003. In his witness statement, he said that he could not recall having met Mr Harrington on that occasion, though he believed he had met him once at Proactive’s offices in Wilmslow.  But in cross-examination, he accepted that he must have met Mr Harrington on the day in question at Proactive’s offices and that he must have accompanied him to the subsequent meeting at Goodison Park.  Furthermore, save in one or two very minor respects, he did not feel able to challenge any of Mr Harrington’s account of the events of that day.  He agreed that Mr Harrington’s notes of the meeting at Proactive’s offices appeared to reflect the sort of topics which would have been discussed at that meeting.  Likewise, he did not challenge the proposition that the annotations on the notes which Mr Rawlings had prepared in advance of the meeting would probably have been made after discussions in which he was involved, though he was able to pick out one or two points which he did not think would have been the subject of any discussions with him.  But he would not accept that there had been any discussion with him or in his presence about any eight-year image rights agreement.  The “nitty gritty” referred to by Mr Rawlings could only have referred to the terms of the playing contract and the payments for commercial rights but not to the wording of any documents. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Stretford did, however, accept that the Heads of Terms relating to the Image Rights Licence, as agreed by Mr Harrington and Mr Farnell, were signed during the course of the meeting at Goodison Park on the evening of 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003. That is not in fact entirely accurate. Mr Rawlings was able to produce a copy of the document as signed by the various signatories.  It appears that Mr Dunford and Mr Stretford signed on behalf of Everton FC and Proactive respectively on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003. But, as was accepted on all sides, Mrs Rooney was not present on that occasion and could not, therefore, have signed on behalf of Stoneygate.  So her signature must have been appended at a later date.  On the face of the document itself, her signature is dated 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Stretford also accepted that most of the other terms to be incorporated in WR’s playing contract were also agreed during the course of the meeting on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003. Indeed, he said that after the meeting had concluded, he had driven over to see the player’s parents to tell them the good news that he had secured agreement, no doubt in principle, to virtually all the major points which they had wanted.  But, according to Mr Stretford, there were still some matters which had to be resolved relating to the structure of the football contract and the provision of a house for the player by the club. It was his evidence, at least in cross-examination, that discussions and negotiations about these matters continued on the following day, 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003. He said that he thought he had been to see Mr Dunford and possibly Mr David Harrison, the club secretary, in the late afternoon or evening, after he had visited the manager, Mr Moyes, at the Club’s training ground.  His meeting with Mr Moyes does indeed feature in Mr Stretford’s diary, but there is no reference to any other meeting with any other representatives of Everton FC on that day. </p>

When he got back to London on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span> January 2003, Mr Harrington got on with the further work that was required.  He must have had some sort of discussion with Mr Glyn-Smith of Powrie Appleby, to whom his partner, Mr Couchman, sent a copy of a draft assignment which was attached to an e-mail dated 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003 and timed at 10.24am.  Mr Glyn-Smith was asked to review and clear the draft assignment from a tax perspective and to advise on one to two other ancillary matters.  One of these was whether it would be desirable for the Assignment to be completed before the Heads of Agreement became binding.  It was pointed out that, though they had already been signed on behalf of the Club and Proactive, they did not come into effect until signed on behalf of Stoneygate.  But, if necessary, he suggested that this could probably be “re-jigged”.  Mr Couchman asked for any reply to be directed to Mr Harrington. </p>

He asked for his opinion, from a tax perspective, on the Heads of Agreement signed the previous day.  He too pointed out that it would not come into effect until it was signed on behalf of Stoneygate. But he added that he did not think that it should be so signed until various further matters had been resolved.  The first of these related to the UK tax position; the second was concerned with the appointment of directors and the issue of shares in Stoneygate; the third was to the effect that the directors of Stoneygate should have been advised of and agreed to the company’s obligations under the contract; and the fourth was that the assignment of image rights from WR to the company would have to have been effected. </p>

He also said that the question of a change of share capital was being dealt with. He followed this up by an e-mail in the late afternoon to which were attached a number of documents.

It was addressed to Mr Rawlings and copied to Mr Harrington and dealt with the tax treatment of the proposed arrangements.  A note about these matters was attached. But, though it was directed to Mr Rawlings, it was also expressly stated to be for Mr Stretford’s attention. It appears that it had not been sent directly to him simply because Mr Glyn-Smith did not have his e-mail address.  The e-mail and the attachment summarised four possible options.  His preference was plainly for one of the less “aggressive” solutions.  But this would require evidence that WR had already obtained the right to some income from the exploitation of his image rights prior to any assignment.  The details of the various proposals are, I think, immaterial.  But the e-mail clearly shows that Mr Glyn-Smith (who had, of course, been present at the meetings on the previous day) assumed that these were matters which would be of interest to Mr Stretford as well as Mr Rawlings.

By fax dated 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003 and timed at 11.25, someone at Proactive had sent Couchman Harrington a copy of the Agreement of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2002.  As Mr Stretford himself acknowledged in the course of cross-examination, it is highly likely that this was because it had been mentioned during the course of the meetings held on the previous day, though he said that he could not remember anything being said about it.  In fact, such a discussion would be entirely consistent with the manuscript note made by Mr Harrington himself during the course of the meeting at Proactive’s offices in which he referred to the need for a “Representation Agreement between Proactive and Stoneygate”. </p>

The first of these was a letter dated 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003 from Mr Farnell of Eversheds to Mr Stretford and Mr Rawlings dealing with certain matters arising out of the meeting which had taken place on Wednesday 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003. He asked for a copy of the Assignment of WR’s image rights to Stoneygate, commenting that Stoneygate would not be in a position to enter into any licence with Everton FC if it had not received an assignment of those rights from the player, so that the Heads of Agreement would not be validly constituted.  Once he had had the opportunity of looking through the Assignment he would be in a position to advise the club as to whether it was valid.  He also asked for confirmation as to the status of Stoneygate including details of the directors, secretary and members and evidence that it was validly incorporated and had the power to enter into the transaction in question.  Once the Heads of Agreement had been confirmed, he said that it would then be possible to move towards agreeing the terms of a long-form agreement.  In a later fax, Miss Yemm forwarded to Mr Harrington a copy of a pre-existing sponsorship agreement with Umbro International Limited which had been signed by WR and his father on or about 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2000. This was obviously intended to address one of the points which had concerned Mr Glyn-Smith. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Indeed, the Umbro Agreement must have been sent or forwarded to Mr Glyn-Smith, who circulated an e-mail timed at 15.01 on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003 confirming that, in his opinion, this should be sufficient to show that the player had been running a business prior to any assignment.  This e-mail appears to have been sent to Mr Stretford as well as to Mr Harrington and Mr Rawlings.  So it would seem that Mr Glyn-Smith must have obtained Mr Stretford’s e-mail address some time after his e-mail to Mr Rawlings on the previous day in which he said he did not have it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The e-mail is addressed to Mr Stretford by name.  It refers to the meetings at Proactive’s offices and at Goodison Park on Wednesday 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003 and to subsequent discussions with Mr Rawlings and with Kingsbridge with a view to putting in hand all the arrangements necessary to complete WR’s image rights contract with the club on a sound footing. The e-mail then continues by dealing with a number of matters under seven separate headings.  The first of these deals with the Heads of Agreement signed on behalf of Proactive and Everton FC on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003. Mr Harrington points out that they were designed to be replaced by a longform agreement as soon as possible.  In the meantime, however, the Heads of Agreement would become binding only when signed on behalf of Stoneygate which, as he pointed out, was not yet technically in a position to sign it.  Accordingly, there was not yet any final binding Heads of Agreement relating to image rights and there were a number of steps which needed to be taken before that could be achieved. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Harrington then summarised the tax advice given by Kingsbridge before going on to deal with what he referred to as “company issues”.  He noted that Kingsbridge had sent to Mr Stretford the relevant forms and documents in relation to the appointment of directors of Stoneygate and the transfer of shares.  He also noted the proposal that Mr Stretford should be appointed a director, in addition to Mr Rooney and his mother, that the share capital should be divided into two classes and that Mr Stretford should become the owner of the Class A shares and would, therefore, have effective control of the company in view of the voting rights attached to those shares. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">But Mr Harrington expressed some concern about these proposals.  Firstly, he pointed out that this might give rise to problems if those involved ceased to get along well together; and this might give rise to a “possible restraint of trade issue”.  He assumed that Mr Stretford would be anxious to minimise the chances of any such problems in the future. Secondly, he pointed out that any potential licensee of the player’s image rights would be likely to want to satisfy himself that it was the player who controlled the company.  Accordingly, he advised that the shares should be allotted to the player.  That accorded with his experience of other similar transactions; and, in his opinion, it would maximise the chances of claiming the appropriate tax relief.  He did, however, suggest various ways in which Mr Stretford’s rights as a director might be entrenched without the need for him to hold any shares in the company. </p>

Since Wayne is now to transfer his commercial rights into Stoneygate 48 Limited, we need to vary the original Agreement to reflect this and then enter into a new Representation Agreement appointing Proactive to represent Stoneygate (as the new owner of the commercial rights).  The simplest way to do this is to vary the terms of the Representation Agreement and draw up a new Agreement between the company and Proactive.  This does leave us with two considerations upon which I would like your instructions. </p>

On the one hand, Proactive is appointed by Wayne Rooney personally to look after his playing career and negotiate transfers and playing contracts on his behalf.  On the other hand, following the assignment of rights from Wayne into Stoneygate 48 Limited, Proactive will be appointed by Stoneygate 48 Limited to represent Wayne’s commercial interests.  This raises the question therefore of whether or not the commercial rights Variation Agreement should automatically terminate upon the termination for any reason of the playing service’s Representation Agreement.

	    <p style="margin-left:1.83in;margin-right:0.03in">The original Representation Agreement was expected to last for an 8 year term.  As I understand matters, FIFA licensed agents can only represent a player for a maximum of 2 years in relation to his playing contract and transfer activities. Since once the Variation Agreement is entered into, the original Representation Agreement will only relate to playing contracts and transfer activity, there may be an issue regarding that fact that it is stated to be for an 8 year term. Have you previously taken advice on this point?  Furthermore, even if the player contract Representation Agreement and the Image Rights Representation Agreement are to continue for an 8 year term, the length of the Agreement could possibly expose Proactive to a claim that it is trying to bind Wayne (in the case of the Player Representation Agreement) and Stoneygate 48 Limited (in the case of the image rights Representation Agreement) to a set of arrangements that could possibly be deemed to be in restraint of trade.  Once again, I should be grateful if you would let me know whether you have previously taken advice on this point, as, if not, there may be some steps that we can take to minimise the risks on this front. </p>

In the next paragraph, he referred to the letter from Mr Farnell of Eversheds addressed to Mr Stretford and Mr Rawlings and dated 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003 in which Mr Farnell asked for a copy of the assignment and for details of the incorporation of Stoneygate and details of its directors and members.

According to Mr Stretford, this press conference has been set up at fairly short notice, though he could not say precisely when that was.

It is the Schedule which bears the signatures of the player, Mr Dunford (the Chief Executive of the Club), and Mr Stretford on behalf of Proactive.  Despite the date typed in at the head of the Agreement, I have no real reason to doubt that it, or at least the Schedule, was signed on or before 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003 prior to the press conference. </p>

There was no direct evidence on the point, but internal indications suggest that it may have been signed subsequent to the Schedule. Thus, there is no reference to the Addendum in the Schedule itself, the Addendum provides for further increases in salary (linked to appearances) over and above those set out in the Schedule, and the Addendum is signed only by Mr Dunford and WR and not by Mr Stretford or by the witness who also signed the Schedule.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The Addendum does, however, include certain provisions which should be noted.  In addition to increases in salary, performance bonuses and international appearance bonuses, it records an agreement on the part of the club to provide accommodation free of charge to the player and his family and that the Club had also agreed to discharge a fee of £50,000 plus VAT which WR had agreed to pay to Proactive for the work undertaken in negotiating the playing contract.  In each case, it was recorded that these would constitute benefits in kind for tax purposes. These may well be the matters which, according to Mr Stretford still had to be agreed after the meeting at Goodison Park on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In addition, the Addendum dealt with the proposed Image Rights Agreement under which the club would be entitled to use the player’s image for certain purposes in return for the payment of fees and royalties.  Somewhat curiously, there is no mention of the Heads of Agreement which were, of course, agreed and signed on behalf of Proactive and the club on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003, though it seems highly unlikely that the terms set out in the Addendum would have been agreed on any earlier occasion. </p>

This rather suggests that it was drafted before the long-form Image Rights Agreement between Stoneygate and Everton FC had been agreed and executed. The wording also tends to suggest that these provisions were drafted after the assignment of the player’s image rights to Stoneygate.

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.00in">“As you know we now have to ensure that the representation agreement is modified or replaced to cover the fact that Wayne is transferring his commercial rights to Stoneygate.  The solution we have initially prepared involves varying the terms of the initial agreement - by deleting all references to commercial rights - and entering into a separate agreement between Stoneygate and Proactive for representation of the commercial rights.  This is fine insofar as it goes but it does leave one potential loose end: The original 8 year representation agreement would be left valid but the representation would be for an 8 year term for transfer and playing contract negotiations.  You will appreciate there is something of a confusing situation here:  This is because under one contract Proactive is appointed to be Wayne’s player agent for 2 years (in line with FIFA regulations) and under a separate contract Proactive is appointed to advise on player contract and transfer negotiations for an 8 year term.  The two situations are inconsistent and it is open to doubt which contract actually governs your agreement with Wayne regarding his playing services - not to mention that the 8 year term may not be compliant with FIFA regulations. </p>

You will recall that I advised you that in the unlikely event of a falling out with the player - i.e. if the player agency contract is terminated/not renewed and Proactive continues to represent Stoneygate’s commercial rights against the wishes of the player - then Proactive could face an action for restraint of trade, given the length of the term of the agreement and the relative commercial sophistication of the parties.  I confirm your instructions that you are prepared to live with this risk and that we are to include contractual clauses in the representation agreement to attempt to minimise the risk.  I would draw your attention to the fact that if the player wishes to break his contract by claiming restraint of trade in the future (however unlikely that seems at present), then such contractual wording is not by any means a guarantee that the restraint of trade will fail - at best it will give us arguments that may be used to support our position.” </p>

But it was also contended on behalf of Proactive that the letter showed that, even on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003, some of the documents intended to implement the new arrangements had not been finalised and could not, therefore, have been signed on the previous Friday. It was also suggested that the letter demonstrated that Mr Stretford not only knew about the eight-year term of the original Agreement of July 2002, but that he was also well aware of the proposal that a similar term should be adopted for the purposes of the new Image Rights Representation Agreement between Proactive and Stoneygate and that he was prepared to accept the risk that this could give rise to a challenge to the enforceability of the contract on the grounds of restraint of trade. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Harrington had little independent recollection of the matters referred to in this letter. But he insisted, with some obvious force, that he would not have referred to a discussion with Mr Stretford on Friday 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003 if he had not, in fact, had such a conversation. On the other hand, however, at least in his witness statement, Mr Stretford said that he could not recall having had any such conversation with Mr Harrington, but that if he had, he would have challenged him if he had been told that the Agreement of July 2003 covered on-field, as well as commercial, representation.  He also asserted that Mr Harrington had, in fact, been present at the signing ceremony at Goodison Park on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003 but that, so far as he could recall, he did not speak to him save perhaps to exchange pleasantries. </p>

The letter was, it will be recalled, addressed to Mr Stretford at Proactive’s offices and was said to have been sent both by fax and post.  But it seems that the attempt to send it by fax transmission was unsuccessful, as the transmission record appears to show. Nonetheless, it was Proactive’s case that the hard copy sent by post must have been received by Mr Stretford, since, so it is said, the original was found in his office by Mr Wallwork when he was clearing out Mr Stretford’s office after he had left Proactive’s service.  Those are, of course, factual issues which I will have to resolve later in this judgment. </p>

Mr Rawlings replied almost immediately to Mr Harrington’s e-mail without making any comment about the letter.  In fact, his response is not particularly clear.

It referred to a conversation with Mr Rawlings earlier on the same day dealing with some suggested amendments to one of the clauses of the long-form Image Rights Agreement with Everton FC and attached a draft of a revised version of the clause.  His later e-mail timed at 12.48 was directed only to Mr Rawlings.  It referred to yet another conversation with him on the previous day and stated that drafts of the Variation Agreement, the Assignment and the Image Rights Representation Agreement were attached.  It very briefly summarised the nature of each document and asked Mr Rawlings to review and circulate “this document” to the “relevant parties” at Proactive and come back to him with any further comments or suggestions for amendment.  It is not entirely clear whether “this document” was a reference to all three of the attached documents or only to the Image Rights Representation Agreement.  The e-mail concluded by saying that Mr Harrington hoped to be able to send the draft long-form Image Rights Agreement with Everton FC to Proactive later that day. </p>

Indeed, the only further light cast on this issue by the contemporaneous documents is to be found in an exchange of emails on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003 between Mr Rodford and Mr Rawlings.

He had clearly seen drafts of the Variation Agreement and the new Image Rights Representation Agreement.  He raised a number of queries and observations in relation to both of them.  He asked how the first Agreement (presumably the Agreement of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2002) would work with the Variation Agreement. In particular, he raised questions as to whether the sum of £25,000 provided for in the original Agreement would still be payable and, if so, whether it should be paid to WR personally or to Stoneygate.  He also commented on the fact that the original Agreement had incorporated what he described as “termination and exit clauses” over the period of the contract, in order to protect Proactive, particularly in view of the fact that WR was a minor.  He asked whether these were still relevant and whether, they should not be increased, “bearing in mind his increased value”.  In relation to the new Image Rights Representation Agreement, he asked who was to manage the financial administration of Stoneygate and whether this should be referred to in the Agreement.  Insofar as Proactive was likely to be involved, he also asked whether the Agreement should make provision for an annual service charge. Finally, he asked whether the Agreement was correct in providing for the costs to be borne by both parties. </p>

The same point appears to be raised by the next paragraph of his email, which is in these terms: </p>

Having considered the points made by Mr Rodford, he said that he had made certain amendments to the Variation Agreement and the Representation Agreement between Stoneygate and Proactive.  One of these amendments was intended to ensure that the second payment of £25,000 due to WR on his 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday under the original Representation Agreement of July 2002 would be vested in Stoneygate rather than the player himself.

But, perhaps most significantly, a new Clause 8 was also introduced under the heading “Consequences of Termination”, which largely mirrored the similar provisions of Clause 8 of the original Representation Agreement of July 2002.  In his e-mail of 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003, Mr Harrington asked Mr Rawlings to check the amount of the proposed liquidated damages and advised that “the greater the damages, the more likely it is that Proactive could face a restraint of trade issue should differences arise later”. </p>

In his e-mail, Mr Harrington raised various specific points in respect of which he said that he would welcome any comments from Mr Rawlings or his colleagues, observing that he would like to get the draft to Mr Farnell as soon as possible.

The long-form Agreement for the grant of an Image Rights Licence between Everton FC and Stoneygate was also still in draft form. That entirely accorded with Mr Harrington’s evidence in relation to the Variation Agreement and Representation Agreement.  But there was some degree of uncertainty in relation to the Assignment Agreement by which Mr Rooney vested his image rights in Stoneygate.  It will be recalled that the first draft of this Agreement was sent to Mr Stretford and Mr Rawlings as an attachment to Mr Harrington’s e-mail of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003, together with drafts of the other documentation which he had prepared.  Further drafts were sent to Mr Rawlings by Mr Harrington, by way of e-mail, on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003. The documents in question included, once again, a draft Assignment, as well as drafts of the Variation Agreement and Image Rights Representation Agreement.  But the Assignment was not the subject of any specific comment in the exchange of e-mails between Mr Rodford and Mr Rawlings on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003. Unsurprisingly, therefore, in his response of 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003, Mr Harrington commented that he assumed that they had no further comments on this document.

It was Mr Harrington’s evidence that he had amended the initial draft by incorporating within it a new clause 6.4 which expressly provided for the assigned rights to revert to the player in the event of a termination of the Assignment Agreement.  That clause does not seem to have been incorporated in the initial draft of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003 though it understandably formed part of the Agreement as ultimately executed.

He promised to get on with tracking them down. But he does not seem to have done so and on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2003, Mr White sent a further e-mail to him in which he noted that Mr Harrington had spoken to Mr Glyn-Smith, who had informed him that the two shares in Stoneygate had been transferred to WR on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003.

The player signed on his own behalf and his mother signed on behalf of Stoneygate, though for some reason the company is inaccurately named against her signature as “Stoneybridge 48 Limited”.  On this occasion, however, it was Mr Rodford and not Mr Stretford who signed the agreement on behalf of Proactive. </p>

In particular, it recites the assignment of various rights by WR to Stoneygate and the Variation Agreement by which the terms of the original Representation Agreement of July 2002 had been altered. The brief summary of the original terms of the July 2002 Agreement refers only to representation of the player in connection with his commercial and business affairs.  In itself, therefore, the recitals would not alert a reader to the fact that the earlier Agreement also incorporated provisions for representation in relation to his on-field activities. </p>

Likewise, at clause 4.5, Stoneygate was required to direct to Proactive all enquiries which it received or opportunities of which it became aware in connection with itself or the player; and by clause 4.7, it agreed to honour to the best of its ability any contracts, agreements or arrangements procured on its behalf by Proactive and to procure that the player fully complied with the terms of any such contacts, agreements or arrangements and fully performed his obligations thereunder. </p>

In particular, the provisions of clauses 7 and 8 closely followed the equivalent provisions of the earlier Agreement, save for the substitution of Stoneygate as the relevant party and the restriction of the amount repayable on termination under Clause 8.1.1 to the sum of £25,000 rather than the slightly more complex provisions of the equivalent sub-clause in the earlier Agreement. </p>

Proactive also clearly sought to represent WR’s commercial interests at the time of the negotiations with Everton FC.  Until the corporate structure of Stoneygate had been determined and put in place and there had been a formal assignment of the image rights to that company, Proactive could only have been acting under the terms of the original Agreement of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2002.

But by the time the long-form Agreement between Everton FC and Stoneygate was executed, on or about 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2003, it seems quite clear that the new arrangements, and in particular the new Image Rights Representation Agreement, would have been already in place. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">It appears that Proactive received payments totalling £75,000 directly from Everton FC by way of remuneration for the part which it played in negotiating the terms of the playing contract between the Club and WR himself and the Image Rights Licence Agreement between the Club and Stoneygate.  But the precise basis upon which these payments were made is somewhat obscure.  The undated Addendum to the playing contract recorded that WR had agreed a fee of £50,000 plus VAT with Proactive for work undertaken in negotiating the contract and that the Club had agreed to discharge this liability on behalf of the player, though it was to be treated as benefit in kind for tax purposes. But there was no similar provision in relation to the negotiation of the Image Rights Licence, either in the Heads of Agreement dated 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003 or in the long-form Agreement subsequently executed on or about 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2003. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In fact, however, two further documents were produced during the course of the trial recording agreements between Proactive and Everton FC for the payment of the sums in question. They are both set out under Proactive’s letterhead, are both dated 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span> February 2003 and are both signed by Mr Dunford on behalf of the Club and Mr Stretford on behalf of Proactive.  The first of these records an agreement that the Club would pay to Proactive the sum of £50,000 plus VAT “in respect of its commission and fee for acting as an intermediary in respect of the signing of the player”.  But payment was subject to confirmation by the FA and the Premier League that WR had been duly registered as a player with Everton FC; and the terms of the Agreement were said to be strictly confidential and were not to be divulged to any third party except to the appropriate football authorities and various other specified organisations. The other document records an agreement by the Club to pay £25,000 plus VAT for advice given in relation to the Image Rights Agreement.  This was payable within seven days of the finalisation of the relevant Agreement.  Once again, terms were stated to be strictly confidential and were not to be divulged to any third party without the consent of both, subject to certain exceptions, which, in this case, did not include the relevant football authorities. </p>

But there appears to be no mention in that contract of the additional £25,000 payable in respect of the Image Rights Agreement.  The latter document looks rather like some form of side agreement negotiated separately from the Image Rights Agreement itself.  But I do not consider that the evidence allows me to come to any conclusion as to how and why these agreements between Proactive and the Club were negotiated or how the amounts in question were calculated.  Nor do I know how, in fact, they were treated for tax purposes as between the player and Club. </p>

In fact, the signing on fee set out in the Schedule to the playing contract was £800,000, though it was payable in four annual instalments.  A commission at the rate of 10% of this signing-on fee would, of course, amount to £80,000, though it might justifiably be discounted if it was all paid up front. On the other hand, the Representation Agreement of July 2002 provided for a commission of 2½ % of the gross sums payable under any playing contract. The total consideration payable under the playing contract with Everton FC would have been very close to £3m, taking into account the signing on fee, all the wages payable over the term of the contract and a figure of about £10,000 a year to reflect benefits in kind attributable to the provision of a house.  Indeed, it was suggested to Mr Stretford in cross-examination that the whole package represented a “£3m contract” and that the sum of £75,000 must have been calculated at the rate of 2½ % based on the provisions of the Representation Agreement of July 2002. </p>

He referred to a provision in the draft prepared by Mr Harrington which provided that the costs of the Image Rights Representation Agreement would be borne by each party.  This would appear to be a reference to Clause 16 of the Agreement which did, indeed, provide that each party should pay its own costs and expenses in relation to the negotiation, preparation, execution and implementation of the Agreement.  It will also be recalled that Mr Rawling’s reply was to the effect that the assumption had been that Stoneygate would bear the costs of its legal work.  But he directed a question to Mr Stretford as to whether he was still happy with this. </p>

The first of these invoices was dated 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2005 and was in the sum of £10,845.84.  But this invoice replaced an earlier invoice dated 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2003 in the same sum which had been directed to Proactive.  However, by letter dated 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2003, Mr Rawlings asked Mr Harrington to arrange for it to be directed to Stoneygate. Mr Harrington duly obliged and a credit note was issued and the new invoice raised two days later.

Mr Stretford headed this small group of individuals, who were collectively known as “Team Rooney”, and took the leading role in negotiating commercial deals as well as his playing contracts.

But a number of lucrative sponsorship deals were also arranged with Nike, Coca Cola and Electronic Arts, relating to sportswear, soft drinks and electronic games respectively.  In addition, he has an Image Rights Licence Agreement with Manchester United FC, similar in kind to the one negotiated with Everton FC in January and February 2003.

But that would no longer seem to be directly relevant, at least at this stage of the proceedings, in view of the twin concessions made by Mr Mill QC on behalf of Proactive, namely, that clause 8 is an unenforceable penalty clause but that it sets a cap on the amount of any damages to </p>

When a payment became due to Stoneygate from a third party, such as one of the major sponsors, one of this team would raise an invoice addressed to the third party and, at or about the same time, would also raise an invoice from Proactive addressed to Stoneygate for the amount of the commission due to Proactive in respect of the third party payment.  When the third party invoice was paid, Proactive’s invoice would be referred to Mr Stretford who would authorise payment of the commission to Proactive.  It should perhaps be noted that VAT was invariably added to the amount of the commission claimed by Proactive and was invariably paid and accounted for by Proactive in the usual way. </p>

I have not been provided with a copy of this contract, but it appears from the cross-examination of Mr Melvin Stein that it provided for a modest signingon fee of £10,000 and for an annual payment of £350,000 to Stoneygate, with additional bonus payments related to such contingencies as scoring a goal for England. The figures are material, since Mr Stein had relied upon the modest level of the signing-on fee in support of his opinion that the player’s potential was not fully appreciated at the time and that Proactive was taking a commercial risk in paying him a signing-on fee of £50,000. But he was either unaware of, or overlooked, the very substantial annual payments provided for by the contract with Nike which, as Mr Stein had to accept, would, in itself, have resulted in a commission which would have more than covered Proactive’s initial outlay. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Some further evidence as to the nature of the relationship between Nike, WR, Stoneygate and Proactive was given by Mr Graham Bartlett, the Sports Marketing Manager for Nike in the United Kingdom and Ireland.  He confirmed that the original 2003 contract was also for a term of 10 years.  That was not Nike’s standard term for such contracts.  In this particular case, however, Nike wished to negotiate what it described as a “very long-term contract”.  He also explained that WR was one of a small group of players who featured in Nike’s global advertising campaigns.  In relation to such players, Nike’s strong preference (which he considered would be shared by the other main sponsors) was that the number of sponsorship deals should be of a high quality and limited in number.  The main reasons for this preference were to prevent the dilution of the player’s “brand” and to avoid undue demands being made on a player who would inevitably have a crowded schedule and many other commitments.  Mr Bartlett did, however, acknowledge that the only contractual restraint upon Stoneygate’s freedom to enter into other sponsorship deals was in relation to products similar to those manufactured and distributed by Nike itself. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Bartlett also commented on the role of the agent, as seen from the perspective of a sponsor such as Nike. He vigorously challenged the suggestion that the agent’s role was largely confined to finding and negotiating suitable sponsorship deals.  He referred yet again to the very many other demands which were inevitably made upon a player of this calibre and dismissed as wholly unrealistic the suggestion that the sponsor could or should deal directly with the player in relation to such matters as advertising shoots, public relations appointments and other personal appearances.  On the contrary, in his experience, managing such a player’s commitments is a complicated and ever-changing responsibility requiring a detailed knowledge of all the various demands made upon the player with a view to delivering the best possible results and avoiding conflict between those involved. Managing these demands is, in his experience, the responsibility of the player’s agent.  Furthermore, it is with the agent that a sponsor such as Nike collaborates in order to develop the value of the brand. </p>

But there was only a fairly limited challenge to Mr Bartlett’s evidence on these matters and I see no reason why I should not accept that evidence in its entirety.  It does, of course, relate only to Mr Bartlett’s experience of the way in which Nike conducts its business.  But the practical realities which he describes would no doubt reflect the experience of other major sponsors. </p>

As Mr Stretford pointed out, sponsors tend to operate by reference to important dates in the footballing calendar, most notably the World Cup.  It can be anticipated, therefore, that these sponsors would wish to renegotiate and extend the terms of any sponsorship deal at or about the time of the 2010 World Cup.  The same may, of course, also apply even where a sponsorship contract extends well beyond the World Cup. </p>

By this contract, Stoneygate granted a licence to the Club to use and exploit WR’s image for certain purposes, insofar as it related to him as a player for the Club, and the right to require certain personal appearances on certain occasions and at certain events. But Stoneygate reserved the right to enter into sponsorship and merchandising agreements with third parties which concerned the player, subject to certain restrictions, most notably a provision limiting the number of sponsorship agreements to a maximum of five in relation to certain specified categories of product, including, sportswear, soft drinks and computer, video and interactive games.  Those, of course, covered the sort of products for which sponsorship contracts had already been agreed.  A similar limit of five was placed upon the number of merchandising contracts which the player was entitled to enter into and which required his active support. In consideration for the rights conferred upon the Club, remuneration was payable to the player on an annual basis at a fairly handsome level.  The contract was specifically stated to be for the same term as the playing contract between the Club and WR. </p>

I rather agree with that assessment.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The essential point to be derived from all this is that the Image Rights Agreement with Manchester United PLC imposes restrictions on the number of sponsorship deals which Stoneygate could enter into for the benefit of WR.  At least on one interpretation of clause 3.4.1 of the contract, Stoneygate would not be entitled to enter into any more sponsorship deals without the consent of the Club, since there are already five such agreements in place.  But on another interpretation, he could still enter into at least four others, taking into account the Tiger Beer agreement which has been entered into since the Agreement with Manchester United FC.  In any event, however, there are further contractual restraints which are likely, in practice, to limit the number and type of such third party agreements which he might be able to enter into. Furthermore, I can see no reason not to accept the evidence of Mr Gill and Mr Stretford, to the effect that, whatever the strict contractual position, may be it is unlikely that, in practice, Stoneygate would be prepared or permitted to enter into further significant contractual commitments beyond those which he has at present. </p>

As Mr Stretford pointed out - and as is well known - the wives and girlfriends of professional footballers attract a good deal of media attention and some, such as Mrs Rooney, achieve celebrity status in their own right.  It was not particularly surprising, therefore, that she turned to Proactive and Mr Stretford to provide assistance in developing the commercial opportunities which began to come her way. It seems that Mr Stretford initially helped her to arrange some sort of contract for television; and Proactive charged commission at the same rate as was applicable under the contract between Proactive and Stoneygate, namely 20% of the fees payable to Mrs Rooney. Thereafter, early in 2004, Speed was set up, apparently at the suggestion of Proactive and Mr Stretford, to act as a vehicle for exploiting her image in much the same way as Stoneygate was used for that purpose by her husband.  But, so far as I am aware, there was no formal assignment of any rights by Mrs Rooney to Speed. More importantly, perhaps, there was no written agreement between Proactive on the one hand and Mrs Rooney or Speed on the other hand under which Proactive was appointed to act as agent for the exploitation of her image rights or was entitled to any commission or other remuneration for any services which it provided in that regard. </p>

The commercial relationship between Proactive, Speed and Mrs Rooney (whatever its precise legal basis) appears to have been highly successful and lucrative.  According to Mr Page, over the period 2005 to 2008, Speed made gross profits in excess of £2.3m after paying commission to Proactive of £592,000. </p>

Thus, on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2006, Speed and Proactive entered into a written contract with HarperCollins Publishers Limited by which Mrs Rooney was to contribute to two books for publication by HarperCollins. Speed’s address at the head of the agreement was stated to be “c/o Proactive Talent Management a division of Proactive Sports Management Limited”; Speed itself was described as “the Lender”, Proactive as the “Authorised Representative” and Mrs Rooney as “the Author”.

According to Mr Stretford, Proactive simply acted as agent for Speed and Mrs Rooney on a “day to day or job to job basis”.

Since then, she has acted in a similar capacity as an employee of Triple S.  She confirmed, that so far as she was aware, there was no agreement, whether oral or written, between Mrs Rooney or Speed on the one hand and Proactive on the other by virtue of which Proactive acted as agent for Speed or Mrs Rooney. On the contrary, Mr Stretford acted simply on a “contract to contract basis” in negotiating the contracts for Mrs Rooney via Speed. </p>

Furthermore, in cross-examination, she was taken to an exchange of e-mails between Mr Anthony Burr and a Mr Ian Monk of Ian Monk Associates and Mr Stretford dating from early October 2008 from which it is fairly clear that Mr Stretford insisted on exercising control over the commercial opportunities undertaken by Mrs Rooney. Miss Aspinall also agreed that the understanding or arrangement was that Proactive would receive a commission of 20% on all contracts and that these arrangements had been in place before she started to work for Proactive. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Nonetheless, Proactive contended that there was or must have been some form of agreement between Proactive on the one hand and Speed and Mrs Rooney on the other by virtue of which it had the exclusive right to represent Speed and Mrs Rooney for the purposes of exploiting any commercial opportunities on her behalf.  It was unable, however, to adduce any direct evidence on the point.  Mr Page nonetheless expressed his belief that there was a contractual relationship between the parties which was identical, at least in terms of exclusivity and level of commission, to that subsisting between Proactive and Stoneygate.  In support of this belief, he pointed to the fact that Mr Stretford was a director of Speed, that the invoicing arrangements were identical to those adopted in relation to Stoneygate, that commission at the rate of 20% was invariably charged by Proactive, that its position as agent was expressly referred to in at least some of the contracts negotiated by Proactive and that Proactive had prepared Speed’s accounts from the date of its incorporation until the severance of relations. He also asserted that it was always “generally accepted and understood” by all those involved in Team Rooney that Proactive had exclusive rights of representation in respect of Speed and Mrs Rooney. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">It certainly seems that, in practice, Mr Stretford appears to have acted as if he and, presumably, Proactive, were the exclusive agents for Speed and Mrs Rooney.  Commission was also charged at the same rate as in the case of Stoneygate.  Furthermore, though Mr Stretford denied it, it seems that the reference to Proactive as the exclusive representative of Mrs Rooney was incorporated into the draft agreement with Northern and Shell PLC by solicitors retained on behalf of Proactive who reported to Mr Stretford. But the relevant exchange of e-mails was not, I think, put to Mr Stretford, no doubt for the very good reason that it was only in re-examination that he stated that the relevant agreements had all been drafted by the other party, that there had been no process of negotiation in relation to them and that he had not himself read them.  Nevertheless, on the face of it, Mr Stretford was holding out Proactive as exclusive agent for Mrs Rooney in the latter part of 2008. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">It also seems quite clear that Proactive provided at least some accounting services to Speed, though this was, at least initially, firmly denied by Mr Stretford.  Mr Stretford’s denial was set out in fairly unequivocal terms at paragraph 241 of his principal witness statement.  In response, Mr Page made a supplemental witness statement in which he challenged this denial, giving details of various accounting documents which had been handed over to the solicitors for Speed and Stoneygate towards the end of 2008 and exhibiting various e-mails.  None of this supplemental evidence was challenged in cross-examination.  I think I need refer only to an e-mail dated 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2007 to Mr Page and Nita Patel, who is said to have been responsible for preparing Speed’s accounts.  The e-mail is headed “Speed Year End Account” and was obviously triggered by an earlier e-mail from the accountancy firm, Grant Thornton. It is a perfectly sensible and measured e-mail in which Mr Stretford made some observations about certain problems in relation to the management accounts. The e-mail then continues as follows: </p>

Mr Stretford was one of the principal witnesses for the prosecution and had signed a witness statement which represented the culmination of a number of drafts.

In those circumstances, counsel decided to offer no further evidence on behalf of the prosecution and the Jury was presumably, therefore, directed to enter formal verdicts of not guilty.

As he himself acknowledged in that witness statement, these are matters which essentially go to his credit as a witness. He sought to anticipate such an attack by stating that both of the Agreements in question had already been provided to the police officer in charge of the investigation, Chief Inspector Hindle.  He exhibited, in support of that assertion, two witness statements made by Mr Hindle in connection with the subsequent investigation by the Football Association.  In the earlier of the two statements, Mr Hindle asserted unequivocally that both of the Agreements in question were recorded in a Schedule of unused material and that it had been decided, in consultation with counsel, that all of the items listed in the Schedule should be served on the defence. Mr Stretford also pointed out, no doubt correctly, that the decision to offer no further evidence had been taken without any consultation with him and without having given him any opportunity to refresh his memory or to provide an explanation. </p>

He asked Mr Stretford when it was that he had first become aware that WR had signed an on-field Representation Agreement with Proactive in July 2002.

His explanation was that he had not actually seen it but that it was in a box of documents which had been put together under Mr Rodford’s direction and handed over to the Police.  The July 2002 Agreement, since it was to do with Image Rights, would have been retained by Proactive’s Sports Management division and not by him.

The point which Mr Stretford was no doubt trying to make in this passage in his witness statement is that he did not feel that he had anything to hide. None of those draft witness statements prepared for the criminal trial were, it would seem, available for the purposes of the present action.  But Mr Mill suggested to him that he was not telling the truth in asserting that he had referred to the earlier Agreements in any of the draft statements, praying in aid a finding to that effect by the FA Regulatory Commission.

In the event, the Commission found that the majority, but not all, of the charges against Mr Stretford were made out.  In the course of its factual findings, it rejected the evidence of Mr Stretford and Mr Rodford to the effect that the Agreement of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2002 had not been intended to cover on-field representation, that the relevant provisions had been incorporated in the Agreement by mistake and that they had not become aware of this mistake until a much later date.  The Commission also found that the witness statement prepared by Mr Stretford for the purposes of the Warrington trial was false and misleading in certain respects, as was his oral evidence to the effect that no on-field representation agreements had been entered into prior to 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2002. </p>

But he nonetheless insisted, in answer to Mr Mill, that somewhere amongst the many drafts he had referred to an Image Rights Agreement which he understood to be that of July 2002.

According to Mr Stretford, he had been asked during the course of the proceedings whether he had any objection to the disclosure of the Couchman Harrington file to the FA.  He stated that he had responded by saying that he personally had no objection to the production of the file but that he was no longer a director of Proactive, so that any request would have to be directed to the Company rather than to him personally.  The point which Mr Stretford was presumably wishing to make was that he did not feel that he had anything to hide which might be revealed by an examination of the file.  But it was suggested to him by Mr Mill that he had deliberately chosen to resign as a director of Proactive so as to be able to give precisely such an answer to any request of this kind.  In effect, he sought to turn against Mr Stretford the very point which he had made in his own favour. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">According to Mr Stretford himself, he resigned as a director of Proactive on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2008 which appears to have been right in the middle of the hearing before the Commission, which took place on a number of separate days between 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2008 and 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2008. But in his oral evidence, Mr Stretford sought to resile somewhat from what he had said in his witness statement, asserting that the date he had given in his witness statement, namely 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2008, was probably when the appropriate form was lodged at Companies House.  He could not, however, say when he had, in fact, resigned. But he was also asked why he had chosen to resign as a director of Proactive at that time, whether or not it was on that specific date.  His explanation was that he no longer had any confidence in the people that he was working with.  He did not specifically respond to a further question as to how that could be the case, given that Proactive was standing “four square” behind him in the proceedings, and paying the costs. Nor did he give any very clear answer to a supplemental question as to how his colleagues on the Board of Proactive had responded to his decision to resign. </p>

In addition to imposing a substantial fine of £300,000, the Commission directed that Mr Stretford should be suspended from acting as a player’s agent for a period of 18 months, with the second half of the term being suspended.  Mr Stretford subsequently appealed, albeit without the support of Proactive; but the appeal was subsequently dismissed on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December 2008.  The period of suspension came into effect, it would seem, after the dismissal of the appeal, with the result that it was only in February 2010 that he became free, once again, to act as a footballer’s agent. </p>

The e-mail gave brief reasons and expressed sympathy for the position of Mr Stretford, offering moral but not financial support if he decided to pursue an appeal.  Mr Stretford responded by an e-mail dated 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2008 in which he sought to place much of the blame for the outcome of the proceedings on Mr Rodford and pleaded with Mr Lawrence for support in his proposed appeal. But all this was to no avail.  Nonetheless, it seems that towards the end of September and the beginning of October 2008, some discussions took place with a view to reaching an amicable agreement for the severance of Mr Stretford’s commercial interests from those of Proactive. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">But the relationship between the parties took a serious turn for the worse in early October. According to Mr Page, in January 2007, Halliwells, the solicitors then acting for Mr Stretford and Proactive, had obtained and reviewed the Couchman Harrington file in connection with the FA disciplinary proceedings.  At some stage, a request from the FA for production of the file was considered and turned down by the directors of Formation Group and Proactive, apparently on grounds of legal privilege.  There followed some discussions involving Mr Lawrence, Mr Rodford, Mr Page and Halliwells as a result of which it was decided that someone ought to look through the Couchman Harrington file.  Halliwells were asked to provide a copy of the file, but it seems that they declined to do so.  In their witness statements, both Mr Wallwork and Mr Page attribute this to the exercise of a lien by Halliwells, though Mr Page seemed somewhat doubtful as to whether that was the reason when he came to give oral evidence on the point. </p>

Mr Lawrence read out a prepared note, the tenor of which was that the Couchman Harrington file contained evidence which showed that Mr Stretford was aware of the existence and nature of the Agreement of July 2002 at the time when the Variation Agreement was being prepared in January 2003 and that this was the contrary to the evidence which had given at the Crown Court trial at Warrington and during the FA disciplinary proceedings.

When asked about this meeting in cross-examination, Mr Stretford gave the slightly odd answer that he was no longer working for Proactive. That answer is odd for two reasons. Firstly, he remained a director of Stoneygate and Speed and it was in that capacity that he had, in the past, always authorised payments to Proactive; secondly, he continued, it would seem, to authorise payment of other invoices. </p>

It need only be noted that there was continued resistance to payment of any of Proactive’s invoices, at least without the provision of further documentation and information, that the existence of any contractual relationship between Proactive on the one hand and Speed or Mrs Rooney on the other was put in issue and that, in any event, any such contractual relationship had been terminated.  In view of this continuing impasse between the parties, the present proceedings were issued out of Leeds District Registry on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd </span> December 2008, and subsequently transferred to the Manchester Mercantile Court. </p>

The factual foundation of these claims covers a good deal of the ground which has had to be explored in the present litigation; and the sums claimed are very substantial. It is perhaps only necessary to note that it appears to be common ground in that action that the Agreement of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2002 was intended to cover only image rights but, by mutual mistake, also extended to on-field activities. </p>

Notwithstanding his assertion in his defence that the inclusion of onfield representation in the July 2002 Agreement was the result of a mutual mistake, his Part 20 Claim against Mr Rodford proceeds on two alternative footings: namely that Mr Rodford was, in fact, aware of the true nature of the Agreement in question (as was, of course, the finding of the Regulatory Commission), in which case it is alleged that he was not acting in good faith in the best interests of Proactive; or, secondly, if he did not know the true nature of the July 2002 Agreement, that he failed to discharge his responsibilities with reasonable skill and care. </p>

In those circumstances, Mr Chaisty QC invited me to draw adverse inferences from Proactive’s failure to call him as a witness.  Until the very end of the trial, no explanation had been advanced for his absence.  But at the very last moment, a letter was produced from Cobbetts LLP, who are, it would seem, instructed on his behalf in relation to the Part 20 Proceedings brought against him by Mr Stretford.  In that letter, they say that both they and counsel had advised him not to provide a witness statement, on the footing that the two sets of proceedings were connected and that Mr Rodford might, therefore, be cross-examined in the course of the present proceedings on issues which could have a bearing on his Part 20 Claim in the other action, without having the benefit of representation by solicitors or counsel.  Whether that is a sufficient reason to resist Mr Chaisty’s invitation is a matter to which I shall return when I consider whether an adverse inference might otherwise be justified on any particular issue as a result of the failure to call Mr Rodford as a witness in the present trial. </p>

Whether or not it was willing to continue to provide the services set out in the Image Rights Representation Agreement with Stoneygate, Proactive itself was plainly unable to do so without the co-operation of Stoneygate and WR; and it would similarly have been unable to act on behalf of Speed or Mrs Rooney.  In relation to WR’s on-field activities, it would seem that there was no longer any form of agreement in place as between Proactive and WR.  A new agreement for a period of two years was, apparently, entered into in 2004; but the evidence seemed to show that this was not renewed in 2006. Nonetheless, it is fairly obvious that Proactive, through Mr Stretford, continued to act as Mr Rooney’s agent for footballing purposes up until the time of Mr Stretford’s departure. </p>

It was only in or about June or July 2009 that Triple S was incorporated or at least started to operate as a sports agency company.  At the present time, it would seem that there is no formal written agreement in place between Triple S, WR, Mrs Rooney, Stoneygate or Speed; and that the relationship is governed by informal arrangements agreed between Mr Stretford, WR and Mrs Rooney. It would seem, however, that the rate of commission charged by Triple S is the same as that charged by Proactive under the Image Rights Representation Agreement, namely 20%. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">There was one final development prior to the trial which has a bearing upon the nature of the relief sought by Proactive.  On 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2008, Hill Dickinson, on behalf of their clients wrote a formal letter giving notice to terminate the Image Rights Representation Agreement of January 2002.  It was expressed to be without prejudice to the contention that the Agreement was “void, invalid, unenforceable and of no effect”. The basis upon which the notice was served was not set out in the letter.  However, it was treated by Proactive as a repudiation or renunciation of the contract; and by letter dated 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2009 it accepted or purported to accept this repudiatory breach.  Accordingly, it is contended that, at least from that date, Proactive is entitled to damages for breach of contract, though it continues to assert that it is entitled to pursue a claim for commission in respect of payments which have fallen due or may fall due in the future under any contracts between Stoneygate and third parties which were negotiated prior to the date of the notice. </p>

In fact, much the most important issue arises in connection with the question of mistake.  Though it is not the only aspect of the defence of mistake advanced on behalf of Stoneygate, the fundamental factual question which must be resolved is whether the parties to the Image Rights Representation Agreement dated 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003 were, at the time when it was entered into, labouring under a common misapprehension that the earlier Agreement of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2002 extended only to image rights and did not cover on-field activities.  The resolution of this issue would seem to turn principally upon precisely what Mr Stretford knew about the Agreement of July 2002 and when he knew it.  But there were, of course, three parties to that Agreement, namely Proactive, Stoneygate and WR himself.  So, though the inquiry may start with Mr Stretford, it does not necessarily stop with him. Consideration may also have to be given to whether other senior members of Proactive’s staff, and in particular Mr Rodford and Mr Rawlings, were labouring under a mistake as to the scope of the July 2002 Agreement.  Likewise, it may be necessary to consider whether WR himself or, for that matter, his mother, Mrs Jeanette Rooney (who signed on behalf of Stoneygate) were also labouring under a similar misapprehension. </p>

But I regret to have to say that, at least in certain respects, I did not find him to be a truthful and reliable witness. The main reason which has led me to that conclusion is my analysis and assessment of the evidence in relation to the central factual issue as to whether he knew that the July 2002 Agreement extended to WR’s on-field activities at the time when the new Image Rights Representation Agreement was negotiated and concluded in January 2003.  To some extent, those reasons have been foreshadowed in my previous factual narrative; but I will have more to say on this topic at a later stage. </p>

That conclusion is not based solely on inferences to be drawn from the contemporaneous e-mail correspondence and his pivotal role in the relationship between Proactive on the one hand and Stoneygate and Mr Rooney on the other.  The fact is that he was the one who approved the relevant invoices by which the fees in question were recharged to Stoneygate. It is true that there were a number of other invoices which were approved at the same time; but I cannot accept that they simply “slipped through” as he suggested, having regard to the fact that they were much the most substantial of the invoices in question. </p>

But they seem to show an unwillingness to make any concession, once he had committed himself to a particular assertion, even in the teeth of strong evidence to the contrary.  In fact, much the most important example of this is to be found in his evidence as to his knowledge of the scope of the Agreement of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2002. Having committed himself, both in the FA disciplinary proceedings and in the present action, to an assertion that he did not know that it extended to on-field activities until a much later date, he was quite unable to make any admission or concession which might tend to undermine that stance. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In the circumstances, I feel bound to approach his evidence on other contested factual issues with a considerable degree of circumspection.  A further reason for caution in assessing his evidence arises from the actual or potential conflict of interests to which he has been exposed over the period leading up to the trial.  At least until his resignation as a director of Proactive, he was acting in a dual role, both on behalf of Proactive and on behalf of Stoneygate, though that potential conflict has not, in fact, given rise to any substantive claims against him.  More important, for present purposes, is the fact that, at least since October 2008, he has been acting in his own interests, in opposition to those of Proactive.  So there is a risk that his evidence about events prior to his departure from Proactive’s service may be tainted by what might now seem to be in the interests of himself, Stoneygate and WR and his family.  That might affect, for example, his evidence as to whether the Rooney family were ever advised to take independent legal advice at the time when any of the relevant agreements were in the course of negotiation.  Fortunately, however, the areas of potential evidential conflict of this kind are slight. </p>

Though he left Proactive’s service some time ago, he is a personal friend of Mr Rodford, as well as a former business associate.  But, apart from obvious hesitancy and lack of recollection, there was nothing in his evidence or the manner in which he gave it which led me to believe that he was being untruthful or partisan.  Whilst I did not always feel confident that his recollection of matters and detail were always accurate and reliable, I see no reason not to accept his evidence about matters of a more general nature, including, of course, the role played by Mr Stretford in relation to Proactive’s dealings with WR and his family. </p>

Mr Rawlings gave another example of the way in which Mr Stretford could, if necessary, become involved in matters of detail, exhibiting to his witness statement some manuscript comments made by Mr Stretford on a draft contract with Nike in early 2003. But, however willing or unwilling Mr Stretford may have been to deal with detailed matters of this kind, I see no reason not to accept Mr Rawlings evidence that all major decisions in relation to WR would have been made or approved by Mr Stretford. </p>

The only serious and specific challenge to his evidence was in relation to the letter from Mr Harrington dated 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2002 which, according to Mr Wallwork, he found in Mr Stretford’s office after Mr Stretford had left Proactive’s service. The foundation of the attack was that Proactive was unable to produce the original or, indeed, any copy of the letter which Mr Wallwork said he had found. According to Mr Wallwork, it has simply been mislaid and, despite intensive searches, could not be located.  That is singularly unfortunate; and it was submitted on behalf of Stoneygate that Mr Wallwork’s evidence on these matters was beyond belief. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">But it was also contended by Mr Chaisty that Mr Wallwork had throughout adopted an unduly partisan attitude towards Mr Stretford and, indeed, that his principal role as a witness was to act as some form of proxy for Mr Rodford.  He invited me to consider an e-mail which he had circulated to the non-executive directors of Formation Group on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2008 in the aftermath of the decision of the FA Regulatory Commission, suggesting that this exemplified a spirit of hostility towards Mr Stretford. I have re-read that e-mail.  It is clearly supportive of Mr Rodford and critical of some of the comments which Mr Stretford had made about his role within Proactive. But I do not regard it as being manifestly unfair or hostile towards Mr Stretford or to reveal such a degree of animosity towards him as to lead me to suppose that he might give deliberately untruthful evidence in relation to Mr Stretford. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In his closing submission, Mr Chaisty also picked up and passed critical comment on a number of exchanges in the course of Mr Wallwork’s evidence under crossexamination.  Some of these were directed to the issue of Mr Harrington’s letter of 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003. That is a matter which I shall have to resolve in the next section of this judgment.  Most of the other points made by Mr Chaisty do not, in my judgment, seriously undermine Mr Wallwork’s reliability or credibility.  But, throughout his evidence, he was undoubtedly supportive of Mr Rodford and, in particular, his evidence before the FA Regulatory Commission to the effect that he had been unaware of the true scope of the Agreement of July 2002.  That evidence was, of course, rejected by the Commission; and I will have to consider whether the evidence adduced before me in the present proceedings does or does not justify any inference as to Mr Rodford’s state of knowledge. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Page joined Formation Group in February 2002 and became a director of Proactive on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2003. So he was involved in the affairs of Proactive, to some degree, throughout the period with which I am concerned in this litigation.  But his role was that of Finance Director; and he had little or no involvement in any of the negotiations with the Rooney family or any third party sponsors.  As in the case of Mr Wallwork, it was contended that Mr Page was hostile to Mr Stretford and supportive of Mr Rodford. He undoubtedly was of the opinion, as he said in his principal witness statement, that Mr Stretford had been “hostile” to Proactive since his departure from its service.  But I did not consider that this view tainted his evidence so as to render it unreliable. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">He was also supportive of Mr Rodford in the sense that he accepted Mr Rodford’s evidence before the FA Regulatory Commission to the effect that he had signed the Representation Agreement of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2002 under a mistaken apprehension as to its scope and contents. But I have to say that I felt at the time that he seemed somewhat uncomfortable and hesitant when he was pressed to say whether or not he believed Mr Rodford’s assertion that he had signed the Agreement under a mistaken apprehension as to its contents. Indeed, it would be surprising if he had not felt at least some doubts about the matter in the light of the findings of the FA Regulatory Commission.  But doubts are not the same as knowledge; and it was never suggested to Mr Page or, for that matter, to Mr Wallwork that, not only was Mr Rodford’s evidence to the Commission untrue, but that he must have known that it was untrue. So, whatever my findings as to the extent of Mr Rodford’s knowledge, I am not prepared to infer that Mr Page was being untruthful about these matters. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Accordingly, I do not consider that the evidence of Mr Wallwork or Mr Page is tainted by undue partisanship or that there is any indication that they were being deliberately untruthful in any of their evidence.  In making that general observation, I take into account the question whether Mr Wallwork was telling the truth about the discovery of the letter from Mr Harrington dated 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003. Though there are some odd features of his account of those matters, I have come to the conclusion that his evidence on the point should be accepted.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Rodford, of course, was not called to give evidence.  According to Mr Wallwork, Proactive had simply chosen not to call him.  But, as previously noted, a letter was produced at a very late stage from solicitors acting on his behalf stating that he had been advised not to give evidence in the light of the Part 20 proceedings brought against him by Mr Stretford. Furthermore, neither side sought to adduce hearsay evidence from him as, for example, by way of his statement in the FA disciplinary proceedings.  There may have been good procedural and tactical reasons for this, in view of the provisions of Part 33 of the Civil Procedure Rules 1998. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">But, as previously noted, Mr Chaisty invited me to draw adverse inferences from Proactive’s failure to call an individual who, on the face of it, would have had extensive knowledge of many of the matters in issue. He relied on the well known case of <span style="font-weight:bold">Wisniewski v Central Manchester Health Authority</span> [1998] P.I.Q.R. 324 in which the Court of Appeal sanctioned such a course.  It is true that the Court of Appeal specifically considered the effect of any explanation proffered for the failure to call the witness. The position was summarised in the head-note to the report to the effect that if some “credible explanation” had been given, even if it was not wholly satisfactory, the potentially detrimental effect might be reduced or nullified.  But it should be noted that, at page 340, Thomas LJ made the further point that if the reasons for the witness’s absence or silence are satisfactory, no adverse inference could properly be drawn. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In the present case I do not regard the explanation given as wholly satisfactory.  It came very late in the day even though Mr Chaisty made it quite clear from the outset of the trial that he would be commenting on the lack of any evidence from Mr Rodford. Furthermore, the letter from Mr Rodford’s solicitors does not say when the advice was given and does not enlarge in any way upon the reasons.  I do not find it easy to see what justifiable apprehension Mr Rodford might have had in giving evidence in the present proceedings, though he might well have been subjected to robust cross-examination about his role in the preparation of the Representation Agreement of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2002 and the subsequent Agreements drafted by Couchman Harrington in January 2003 and about his knowledge of their contents.  Furthermore, other witnesses in the present action will presumably have to give evidence at the trial of the other action. Yet they do not seem to have felt any difficulty in giving evidence in the present action. But I am conscious that I do not know all the factors which may have led to the decision not to call him. I take the view, in those circumstances, that I can, if necessary, draw adverse inferences from his absence but that I should exercise caution before doing so. </p>

In the end, at paragraph 21 of his closing written submissions, he set out a shopping list of issues upon which, he submitted, Mr Rodford could have assisted the Court. Many of these seem to me to be no more than what they purport to be, namely a list of issues, rather than specific inferences.  Some of them relate to matters which are, at least theoretically, in issue but in respect of which the evidence already plainly favours Stoneygate. I refer, for example, to the question whether the Rooney family </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Perhaps the most important single item in the list relates to the knowledge and involvement of Mr Stretford at the time of the execution of the July 2002 Agreement and his knowledge of its contents at the time when the subsequent Image Rights Representation Agreement was entered into.  Mr Stretford’s case, of course, is that he had no real involvement in the production of the earlier Agreement and that he knew nothing about its contents until long after the later Agreements were in place.  Presumably, therefore, Mr Chaisty’s point is that I should infer that Mr Rodford, if he had been called, would have supported that evidence.  I am prepared to accept that this is a factor to which some weight might possibly be given in relation to the preparation and execution of the July 2002 Agreement itself.  It is much less easy to see what weight, if any, it could have in relation to Mr Stretford’s knowledge of the true position at the time when the later Agreements were executed unless, perhaps, the evidence on that issue was finely balanced which, in my judgment, it is not. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">But, apart from any possible adverse inferences which might be drawn from his absence from the witness box, the fact remains that Mr Rodford did not give evidence and that he is not, therefore, in a position to challenge any inferences in relation to his own activities which might properly be drawn from other evidence.  If, therefore, I were to conclude that the proper inference from the documentation is that he must have known that the July 2002 Agreement extended to on-field activities as well as those of a commercial nature, there is no direct evidence from him to rebut any such inference. That, is, of course, a matter which I shall have to return in due course. </p>

But they had only very limited recollection of the events which had given rise to the present litigation.  Upon one or two points, I think they were clearly mistaken, as will be apparent from my narrative of events; and, in general, their evidence did not provide a great deal of illumination and clarification in relation to the contested issues. Mrs Coleen Rooney did not, of course, give evidence before me, though she had provided a witness statement for the purposes of the trial.  I was not specifically invited to draw any adverse inferences from her absence from the witness box. But, as it seems to me, the only point upon which that might be appropriate would be in relation to the contractual arrangements between herself and Speed on the one hand and Proactive on the other. </p>

However, Mr Mill then put to him a statement dated 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2009 which Mr Stretford had made and signed in connection with a complaint made by Formation Group to the Legal Complaints Service about the conduct of its solicitors, Halliwells, in connection with the Couchman Harrington file.  The purpose of that witness statement seems to have been  to confirm that Mr Rodford had been aware of the contents of the Couchman Harrington file well before the hearing before the FA Regulatory Commission.  After referring to a discussion between Mr Diaz-Rainey of Halliwells and Mr Rodford in March 2008, Mr Stretford said this at paragraph 5 of the witness statement: </p>

Somewhat reluctantly, he accepted that he had received and seen certain documents from the file, though he insisted that it was only during the preparation for the trial of the present action that he had gone through it in its entirety.  When pressed, he accepted that the documents which he had been shown included the e-mail from Mr Harrington of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003 and his subsequent letter of 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003.

Indeed, the clear impression gained from the statement which he made in connection with the complaint from Halliwells is that all those involved were anxious to avoid disclosure of the file to the Football Association.

His witness statement of 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2009 undoubtedly lends some colour to that suggestion.  But, in the end, I do not think it would be right to infer that that was indeed his motive.  Mr Rodford, after all, also gave evidence before the Commission; and he remained a director of Proactive throughout.  Furthermore, though Proactive remained supportive of Mr Stretford throughout the FA proceedings, I am far from confident that the tensions which eventually led to Mr Stretford’s departure from Proactive were not already present when he stood down as director.  Yet further, no doubt for good reason, given the adversarial nature of these proceedings, neither Mr Page nor Mr Wallwork were asked about the reasons for Mr Stretford’s resignation as a director; and, of course, Mr Rodford did not give evidence in the present proceedings, even though, according to Mr Stretford’s witness statement of 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2009, he was heavily involved in discussions as to how to deal with the Couchman Harrington file. </p>

On the contrary, even on his own reluctant admission, he must have seen the e-mail of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003 and the letter of 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003 some time prior to March 2008 at the latest; and, having gone through the file with the assistance of a solicitor in connection with the FA disciplinary proceedings, he must have appreciated their potential significance.  It does not necessarily follow, of course, that he had seen and assimilated them at the time when they were originally sent. But the fact that his evidence as to when he first saw the file was shown to be untruthful was obviously material to the assessment of his evidence about earlier matters. </p>

That is the clear implication of what he had to say at paragraphs 171 and 174 of his principal witness statement.  When he was asked in cross-examination as to when he had first become aware that the July 2002 Agreement included on-field representation, he said that he only became “fully aware” of this after the collapse of the Warrington trial. He explained that Mr Rodford had come to see him and that this was the first time that he had seen the July Agreement “in its entirety or at all”.  It was in the context of cross-examination on this point that Mr Stretford sought to explain that the Agreement had, in fact, been amongst a box of papers which had been delivered to or collected by the Police in the course of the investigation which led up to the trial at Warrington.  I have already dealt with the evidence about these matters; and it seems fairly clear that a copy of the Agreement was, in fact, in the possession of the Police, whether or not it had been made available to counsel at the trial itself. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">But the challenge to Mr Stretford’s protestations of ignorance do not depend solely upon these documents.  Most importantly, Mr Harrington’s letter of 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003 refer specifically to a telephone conversation with Mr Stretford on Friday 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003. Whilst Mr Stretford denied having received or at least read the e-mail of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span> January 2003 or the letter of 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003, he did not challenge the fact that he must have had a conversation with Mr Harrington on Friday 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003, as stated in Mr Harrington’s letter of 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003. All he could say is that he could not remember any such conversation.  In fairness, Mr Harrington himself had no independent recollection of the conversation in question, though, as he observed, he would not have referred to it if it had not taken place. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The implications of this conversation are quite separate from and independent of the question whether Mr Stretford received the letter of 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003 in which Mr Harrington referred to it.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">I accept, of course, that the attempt to send the letter to Mr Stretford by means of facsimile transmission appears to have failed.  But the letter itself states that it was sent by post as well as by fax. Mr Harrington said that he had adopted this procedure, rather than merely sending an e-mail message, because he wished to draw Mr Stretford’s attention to the matters which he raised in a more formal manner.  Though Mr Stretford denies ever having received or seen it, this must be set against the evidence of Mr Wallwork who asserts that he recovered the original of the letter from Mr Stretford’s offices after his departure from Proactive, though the document has since been mislaid. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">There were undoubtedly certain odd features about Mr Wallwork’s account of finding the letter and subsequently losing it.  It remained unclear as to precisely what drew his attention to it and what he did with it after he had found it.  But there was no suggestion that he could have been mistaken about the identity of the document which he found; and I am not prepared to hold that his account was, in effect, a fabrication.  Letters do normally arrive at their destination; and it was addressed to Mr Stretford personally. I think it is unlikely that it was never received at Proactive’s offices; and, if it was received, I think it is unlikely that it did not reach Mr Stretford.  Accordingly, I conclude that, despite his denial, Mr Stretford must have received the letter in question. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">If the letter had been received in the ordinary course of post, even allowing for a little delay within Proactive’s offices, Mr Stretford would almost certainly have received it before the end of the working week commencing on Monday 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003. That would have been before the final draft of the Image Rights Representation Agreement which, for reasons which I have already given, did not come into existence before 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span> January 2003.  Presumably, on receiving the letter, Mr Stretford would have gone on to read it. If it had not been received by Proactive before 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> January 2003, it is a little odd that Mr Rawlings did not ask for a copy from Mr Harrington when he received the e-mail of that date from Mr Harrington in which he specifically referred to the letter and asked for instructions from Mr Stretford on certain questions raised in the letter. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Once he had read the letter, as I think he must, Mr Stretford could not have been left in any doubt but that the Agreement of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2002 had covered on-field as well as off-field activities.  That is set out in terms on the first page of the letter; and Mr Harrington then went on to deal with the proposed Variation Agreement, pointing out that this would still leave the July 2002 Agreement in force for a term of eight years in relation to playing contracts, contrary to FIFA Regulations.  The solution which he suggested was to revoke the 2002 Representation Agreement in its entirety and he expressly asked for Mr Stretford’s instructions on the point before finalising the Agreements.  One might have thought that nothing could have been plainer. </p>

It is highly unlikely that Mr Harrington would have proceeded without specific instructions on the point.  So the question arises as to who was responsible for those instructions.  At one level, the answer is reasonably clear. On 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003, Mr Rawlings forwarded to Mr Harrington the e-mail exchanges between Mr Rodford and himself on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003.  This e-mail exchange, it will be recalled, appears to represent the only recorded intervention by Mr Rodford in relation to the Agreements which were being drafted by Mr Harrington. It does not specifically address the question as to whether the Agreement of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2002 should be revoked, rather than varied.  But Mr Rodford picked up various other points in the Variation Agreement; and Mr Harrington, perfectly understandably, appears to have treated the exchange as authority to continue with the preparation of the proposed Variation Agreement, as is apparent </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">But I find it almost inconceivable that Mr Stretford was unaware of the fact that Mr Harrington was proceeding with the original plan for a variation of the earlier Agreement, with at least the implicit approval of Mr Rawlings and Mr Rodford, even if he was not himself personally responsible for giving any necessary instructions to Mr Harrington. Not only did Mr Harrington’s letter of 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003 expressly ask for Mr Stretford’s instructions on this point, but Mr Harrington followed this up with an e-mail to Mr Rawlings dated 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> January 2003 specifically asking him to speak to Mr Stretford in order to let him know how Proactive wished to deal with the issues relating to the Variation Agreement raised in his letter of 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003.  Though, in his reply, which he sent to Mr Harrington a few minutes later, Mr Rawlings said that he would try to deal with the matter at the Board meeting which was due to take place that day, I do not know whether Mr Rawlings did, in fact, speak to Mr Stretford on the same day.  But Mr Stretford was copied in to the e-mail exchange between Mr Rodford and Mr Rawlings on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003; and it was he who subsequently signed the Variation Agreement. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Stretford, however, denied having received or at least seen any of these e-mails.

It is true that there is no direct evidence to show that he received and considered the e-mails in question.  Furthermore, some modest support for the proposition that he might not have been willing to agree to a mere variation of the original Agreement of July 2002 may perhaps be found in the observations which Mr Harrington made in his letter of 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003 about the conversation he had had with Mr Stretford the previous Friday in which, it seems that Mr Stretford had mentioned that the eight-year Representation Agreement should not include the right to represent WR in relation to his playing contract or transfer negotiations. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">But the very fact of that conversation is fundamentally inconsistent with Mr Stretford’s evidence that he knew nothing about any of these matters at the time.  Furthermore, there is a strong inference that Mr Stretford must have considered and acted upon at least one of the points raised in the e-mail exchange between Mr Rodford and Mr Rawlings. I refer to the question as to whether Couchman Harrington’s costs should be borne by Stoneygate, which was a question specifically directed to Mr Stretford by Mr Rawlings in his reply to Mr Rodford.  Mr Rawlings’ evidence was that a decision to recharge these fees to Stoneygate would not have been taken without Mr Stretford’s knowledge and approval.  I accept that evidence; and as I have already pointed out, it was Mr Stretford who ultimately approved the recharge, as he must have appreciated, despite his assertion that it must simply have “slipped through”. </p>

He denied it, Mr Rodford did not give evidence and Mr Rawlings appeared to have no specific recollection.  But it seems to me to be highly likely that he must have done so, rather than simply acting as a recipient of the letter and the e-mail exchange.  No major decision of this kind in relation to WR is likely to have been taken without Mr Stretford’s involvement, whether or not he had any misgivings about the course of action proposed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In summary, therefore, I think it is highly likely that, in addition to the letter of 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span> January 2003, Mr Stretford received and read the e-mail exchange between Mr Rodford and Mr Rawlings of 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003. I think it is likely that he must have specifically discussed these matters with either Mr Rodford or Mr Rawlings.

Furthermore, the telephone discussion referred to in Mr Harrington’s letter must be set in the context of the e-mail which Mr Harrington had sent to Mr Stretford and copied to Mr Rawlings on the same day, though it will be recalled, that Mr Stretford denied having received or at least read that e-mail.

It shows that he fully appreciated that the original Agreement of July 2002 covered both on-field and off-field representation and that he was well aware of the fact that the proposed Variation Agreement would leave the original Agreement in force in relation to on-field activities for the rest of the original term of eight years, contrary to FIFA Regulations.

But it specifically refers to Mr Stretford’s comment that the eight-year contract should not incorporate any rights to represent the player in relation to on-field activities.

He attempted to support his assertion that he had never received, or at least read, the e-mail by reference to the circumstances in which he found himself on that day.  It was his evidence that he had an appointment with Mr Moyes, the Manager of Everton FC, at Goodison Park between 6pm and 6.30pm, followed by a press conference at the ground scheduled to begin at 7pm. </p>

These were, of course, all dated 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003, which led Mr Stretford to surmise that they were so dated because agreement had been reached with Everton FC on that day as to the terms of WR’s playing contract. Be that as it may, Mr Stretford’s evidence, as set out in his witness statement, was consistent with Stoneygate’s pleaded case, though in its ReRe-Amended Defence, Stoneygate resiled from assigning a specific date to the execution of the Variation Agreement, stating simply that the Rooney family did not recall signing it on any date other than 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003. </p>

But he simply had no answer to the questions which were put to him by Mr Mill QC on the basis of the Couchman Harrington file, as clarified by Mr Harrington himself in the course of evidence.  No doubt that was why he said that he was not sure when at least some of the agreements were signed.  But he adhered tenaciously to the assertion that he had signed the Variation Agreement on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span> January 2003 and that, on the same occasion, he had probably signed the other documents which bore his signature. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">It is quite clear that, in fact, none of these Agreements were finalised and signed until a later date. I have set out the chronology in some detail earlier in my judgment.  They could not have been signed prior to 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003, but it is probable that they were signed shortly thereafter.  In fact, Mr Rooney’s form 288A, by which he consented to act as director of Stoneygate, appears to have been signed on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st </span> January 2003; and WR’s playing contract with Everton FC was formally dated 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st </span> February 2003. According to Mr Stretford’s appointments diary, he was due to meet the Rooney family on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> February 2003. Neither WR nor his parents had any recollection of when and in what circumstances these Agreements were signed; but it seems to me to be quite likely that this would have been the occasion on which this took place. As for the long-form Image Rights Agreement with Everton FC, the evidence suggests that this was signed only on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2003, even though it was formally dated 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> February 2003. </p>

The negotiations over the essential terms of WR’s playing contract appear to have been brought to a successful conclusion on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003; and the Heads of Terms in relation to the Image Rights Agreement with Everton FC had been signed by Mr Stretford on behalf of Proactive and Mr Dunford on behalf of the Club on the same day, even though WR’s mother may well have signed it on a later occasion.  Indeed, according to Mr Stretford, though the meeting finished late, he went to see the Rooney family to tell them the good news that the Club had accepted virtually all of the major points which they wanted.  It is true that he also said that negotiations went on till late on the following day.  If so, that would presumably have been when any remaining loose ends would have been tied up. </p>

It was initially envisaged that the shares should be divided into two classes, one with voting rights and one without, and that those with voting rights would be vested solely in Mr Stretford, who would also become director.  Mr Harrington’s advice, as set out in his e-mail, was that all the shares should be vested in WR, though he suggested that, in addition to a permanent seat on the Board, Mr Stretford might be given equal voting rights with the other directors and a casting vote in relation to certain matters. </p>

But much the more obvious inference is that a speedy decision was taken in the light of the advice given by Mr Harrington in his e-mail.  It was, after all, quite important for the company structure to be in place prior to the execution of the various agreements to which Stoneygate was a party. Furthermore, this was not a point which Mr Harrington felt it necessary to raise when he wrote his subsequent letter of 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003. </p>

Even if he had not previously been aware of the scope of the Agreement of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2002, it seems to me that he would have realised that it must have extended to both on-field and off-field activities even on a fairly hurried reading of the e-mail.  But, in any event, he could scarcely have remained under any such misapprehension once he had discussed these matters directly with Mr Harrington.  So he must have known the true scope of the Agreement of July 2002 well before he signed any of the Agreements prepared by Mr Harrington; and I reject his evidence to the contrary.  In those circumstances, I cannot accept his evidence that he did not understand the purpose and effect of the Variation Agreement when he signed it, or, if he did not, why he did not ask for clarification and advice. </p>

In the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, I find it difficult to see how someone such as Mr Rodford could possibly have been unaware of the fact that the Agreement prepared under his instructions and signed by him on behalf of Proactive extended to both on-field and off-field representation. At the risk of repetition, Mr Rodford himself was not called as a witness and could not, therefore, give any evidence to rebut this obvious inference. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">But there are one or two further specific points which provide support for this inference. Firstly, it seems that Mr Price of DLA spoke initially to Mr Rodford and was provided with what was referred to as Proactive’s “standard” Representation Agreement and was asked to “beef it up”.  This standard form of agreement, a copy of which remained on DLA’s file, quite clearly extended to both on-field and off-field representation. It is almost impossible to suppose that Mr Rodford would have been unaware of the terms of the standard agreement which he wanted DLA to beef up.  Furthermore, it seems quite clear that, from the outset, they were instructed to draft an Agreement which would last for a period of eight years. </p>

One of these was the legal doctrine of restraint of trade, in which connection Mr Helm drew Mr Rodford’s attention to the length of the contract and what he described as the “proposed liquidated damages clause for early termination”.  Indeed he subsequently asked specifically whether the eight-year term was what was, in fact, required. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">But, more importantly for present purposes, he also drew Mr Rodford’s attention to certain specific provisions of the draft Agreement.  One of these was clause 3.1, which set out some of Proactive’s obligations under the draft Agreement which, as Mr Helm himself noted, followed the model of the “standard” Proactive Agreement which had previously been sent to DLA. Clause 3.1 of the draft retained the substance of the equivalent provisions of Proactive’s “standard” Agreement which provided for it to represent the player in relation to both on-field and off-field matters. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">As if that were not enough, Mr Helm also drew attention to Clause 5, which dealt with remuneration and which Mr Helm described as “probably the most important clause in the Agreement”.  Clause 5.3 of the draft provided for payment of commission at a proposed rate of 10% of the gross sum payable under any contract of employment with any football club and a higher rate of 20% of the gross sum payable under any contracts or arrangements of a promotional nature.  In his covering letter, Mr Helm asked for specific instructions in relation to certain parts of Clause 5. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In the event, as the final draft demonstrated, appropriate instructions must have been given, since the relevant provisions (now renumbered as clause 5.4) differed from the earlier draft. The changes are significant.  The percentage commission payable under any contract of employment with any football club was reduced to 2½ %, as against the 10% referred to in the draft, and an express provision to the effect that those sums would include any signing-on fee and salary was deleted. The only possible inference is that Mr Rodford must have given instructions for these amendments. </p>

According to Mr Stretford, he joined the meeting only after it had been going for some time.  If, as he subsequently assumed, Mr Rodford handed the final version of the draft agreement prepared by DLA to WR’s parents during the course of this meeting, this must have been done before he arrived. But Mr Stretford was admittedly aware that WR’s parents had produced a copy of the Agreement which had previously been entered into with Proform.  Indeed, a copy of this Agreement was retained by Mr Rodford and copied to DLA for comment later on the same day. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">According to Mr Stretford, on reading this Agreement, Mr Rodford had drafted a letter which he proposed to send to Proform.  It was Mr Stretford’s evidence that he strongly disagreed with the wording of the letter and that this led to an argument between the two men which culminated in Mr Rodford storming out of the meeting.  Mr Stretford then produced his own version of a suitable letter for Mr and Mrs Rooney to sign. It was suggested to Mr Stretford that no purpose would have been achieved by writing to Proform at that stage if he and Mr Rodford had truly believed that the draft Representation Agreement drafted by DLA was confined to Image Rights. If that had been the case, there would have been no conflict between the two Agreements, since the Proform contract was limited to on-field representation.  So the fact that it was felt to be necessary or desirable for a letter to be sent to Proform at that stage and, it would seem, to seek advice or comment from DLA about the Proform contract suggests that they must have realised that there was a potential conflict between the two Agreements. </p>

His only answer was that it was approaching the time when WR’s professional football contract would have to be negotiated and that Mr and Mrs Rooney very much wanted their son to be with an agency which could handle both on-field and off-field representation.  I think I must accept that this is a possible explanation of what occurred; and in itself I would place little weight on this particular point.  But it is entirely consistent with other evidence which tends to show that Mr Rodford was well aware of the true scope of the 2002 Agreement. </p>

He was also aware that Mr Rodford was willing to offer a financial inducement of £50,000 to the Rooneys if they were willing to enter into a contract with Proactive.  When asked about this payment in cross-examination, he initially agreed that it seemed to be Mr Rodford’s intention to pay this sum for the right to sign Mr Rooney up for both on-field and off-field representation.  But he immediately qualified what he had said by describing it as a purely “ethereal” discussion as to what Proactive should do if the Rooneys were free to sign up with it.  But he accepted that he became aware in July or August 2002, that a contract had been signed and that Mr and Mrs Rooney had agreed that a fee of £50,000 was to be paid, though he continued to insist that, so far as he was aware, the contract dealt solely with Image Rights. </p>

He denied ever having seen a copy of the Agreement.  If so, his information must presumably have come from Mr Rodford.  But, as I have already held, Mr Rodford must have been perfectly well aware of the nature and scope of the July 2002 Agreement.  The only obvious reason why he might have wished to keep Mr Stretford in ignorance of the terms of the Agreement might have been to protect him, as a registered agent, from any involvement with an eight-year on-field Representation Agreement which would have been contrary to FIFA Regulations.  But one of the reasons Mr Stretford suggested as to why Mr Rodford might have signed up to an agreement of this kind was that he might not have realised that it would have been in breach of FIFA Regulations. </p>

Indeed, I would be surprised if he had not been provided with a copy, though he denied ever having seen it until a much later stage.  I do not know whether he was entirely happy with the Agreement.  Indeed, one possible interpretation of Mr Harrington’s comment in his letter of 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003 is that Mr Stretford may have expressed some reservations about including on-field representation rights within an eight-year Representation Agreement and that he might have been happier if the July 2002 Agreement had been revoked in its entirety. But, for obvious reasons, that was not a matter which was investigated with Mr Harrington; and, as I have found, Mr Stretford was, at the least, willing to go along with the proposal for a variation of that Agreement which meant that it remained effective in relation to on-field representation. </p>

The first of these was undoubtedly signed by Mr Stretford on behalf of Proactive; and it appears from his witness statement that it came into being at his initiative in the light of legal advice as to the enforceability of the Proform Agreement.  It was in Proactive’s standard form and, therefore, covered both on-field and off-field representation, albeit for a period of two years only.  It was suggested to him that he had procured this contract simply in order to have a document which Proactive could, if necessary, produce to the Football Association without revealing the fact that there was already in existence an on-field Representation Agreement for a term of eight years.  That is no doubt possible.  It is also possible that Mr Stretford procured the September Agreement at a time when he did not appreciate that the earlier contract provided for on-field representation in addition to covering Image Rights. But, at the very least, he was aware that there was already an eight-year Image Rights Representation Agreement in force.  So it is not easy to see why the September contract also included Image Rights representation for a term of two years. </p>

In relation to both Agreements, Mr Stretford’s explanation for the fact that it covered off-field, as well as on-field activities was that he had simply overlooked the fact that this was the effect of the standard form of agreement then used by Proactive. </p>

The calculation is not precise, there is no reference to a 10% commission in any of the contemporaneous documentation, and the sums involved could just as equally relate to a different commission structure or, indeed, a simple ad hoc negotiation. </p>

In relation to the July 2002 Agreement, he relied upon his parents to do what they thought was best for him and so he left the arrangements to them.  In his witness statement, he nonetheless said that he understood that the Agreement in question related solely to Image Rights.  His reason for saying this seems to have been that Mr Stretford had decided to wait until the end of his contract with Proform before entering into any on-field representation agreement.  But that seems to refer to later developments, once it became apparent that the Proform Agreement was still in force.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Rooney senior clearly had difficulty in recalling the circumstances in which he was given the 2002 Agreement by Mr Rodford.  He agreed with Mr Mill that he and his wife had decided that they wanted Proactive to act as agent for their son and that if Proactive, presumably in the person of Mr Rodford, produced an Agreement which he said he wanted their son to sign, that would be good enough for them.  He agreed that they simply signed the document as requested, though they could not remember anything about where and when it was signed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In relation to the subsequent Agreements of early 2003, it was similarly clear that he had very little recollection of the facts and circumstances which led to their execution or whether Mr Stretford had explained their nature or terms. It was quite possible, he conceded, that they would have been signed in just the same way even if they had believed that the earlier Agreement was, in some way, “not right”.  He accepted that they wanted to do the best for their son and that, so far as they were concerned, it was Proactive which was able to provide the best.  It should be noted, however, that in his second witness statement, he said that if he had known that the new Representation Agreement was for eight years without a break, he would not have signed it.  That was not a point on which he was specifically challenged. </p>

In relation to the later Agreements, she said very simply that at a meeting which she did not identify, they were just handed some documents and told where to sign.

She pointed out, no doubt correctly, that she and her husband were not used to dealing with contracts and did not understand them.  Though her evidence was not entirely clear, she seemed to be saying that she and her husband had assumed that the various contracts that they were asked to sign were the same for all professional footballers, but that, if they had appreciated that an eight year contract was wholly out of the ordinary, they would not have agreed to it. </p>

The reality, in my judgment, is that they had decided that Proactive was the right agency for their son and that they trusted Mr Rodford and, in particular Mr Stretford to do the right thing for them.  In those circumstances, they were prepared to accept the documentation presented to them by Proactive without independent legal advice and without any real explanation or analysis. I am not persuaded that they were, in fact, mistaken as to any of the terms of any of the agreements in question, in the sense that they believed them to be something different from what they actually were.  But even if they were mistaken about any such matters, I think it is highly likely that they would have signed them in any event. </p>

The extent to which he has been actively involved more recently in handling the affairs of such players was not explored or explained in any great detail; and I was left without any very clear picture of the nature of his role with First Artist Corporation Plc or the extent of his direct involvement with the players which it represents.

The true position is that very substantial sponsorship deals with Nike, Coca Cola and Electronic Arts were secured in 2003 and that the amount payable under the Nike contract was well into six figures during each year of its term.  I have set out the details earlier in this judgment.  Furthermore, though it is obviously correct that the first Image Rights contract with Manchester United was obtained only after his transfer to that Club, a fairly lucrative Image Rights Licence Agreement had already been put in place with Everton FC pursuant to the Heads of Terms which were agreed on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003, to be followed in due course by the long-form Agreement concluded on or about 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2003. </p>

He was manifestly protective of the interests of professional footballers and was quite clearly of the opinion that WR had been financially exploited when, at the age of only 17, he was tied in, through Stoneygate, to an eightyear Image Rights Representation Agreement.  I think he felt it difficult to be wholly objective about some of the matters upon which he had been asked to express an opinion; and he seemed on occasions to be expressing views about what he considered ought to be the case, rather than on what it actually was. </p>

Furthermore, it seems to me to be fairly likely that, given his position, he would have gained some knowledge about the sort of contracts which his members were entering into in relation to image rights even outside the context of a specific request for advice or assistance.  </p>

In their principal reports, both men suggested that the usual range would lie somewhere between 2½% and 10%. When cross-examined on the basis of his book, “How to be a Sports Agent”, Mr Stein agreed that, in his view, 10% would be fairly “outrageous”.  It is of some interest to note that 10% was the commission rate specified in Proactive’s standard representation agreement.  It was the rate provided for in the onfield Representation Agreement with Mr Rooney dated 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2002; and the same rate had been adopted in the early drafts of what became the Representation Agreement of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2002, though it was reduced to 2½% in the final version. </p>

That was Mr Stein’s firm view; and it was not seriously challenged in cross-examination, possibly because it had become clear that this was the rate which had been agreed between Stoneygate and Triple S since it had, in effect, taken over the management of WR’s Image Rights.  Furthermore, it gained some support from what I was told was a standard form of Representation Agreement approved by the Football Association, a copy of which was annexed to Mr Stein’s Report, which provided for a fee of 20%, plus VAT, of the gross income arising out of the exploitation of a player’s commercial rights, as opposed to a rate of 5% in relation to on-field activities. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">During the course of cross-examination, Mr Taylor, for his part, somewhat qualified the opinion which he had set out in his report and the joint statement.  The explanation which he gave was that his figure of between 10% and 15% was, in effect, an average. For a young, unproven player, it might very well be the case that 20% would be agreed at the outset. But, in his experience, such a contract might provide for a lower rate or rates of commission if a certain level of sponsorship income was achieved.  That was a common feature of the agreements he had come across. He also pointed out in his report that a highly successful and established player such as WR might well be able to negotiate from a position of strength and agree a significantly lower rate of commission than a player at the start of his career. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Stein was asked about these further points raised by Mr Taylor.  He agreed that a higher profile player, such as WR now is, would be in a strong negotiating position if he was free to enter into a new Representation Agreement.  He would be much sought after both by agents and prospective sponsors.  Furthermore, in his book, he had raised the possibility of a sliding scale of commission, of the kind envisaged by Mr Taylor, so as to reduce the rate where certain income thresholds were surmounted. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">I conclude that a rate of 20% is widespread within what is probably a fairly limited market and is likely to be the ordinary default rate unless the player was in a stronger than usual negotiating position. Of course, as a player’s career progresses, his negotiating position may become much stronger.  If he was tied in to an exclusive agency for a comparatively short period of time, say two years, he would always be in a position to re-negotiate the percentage at the time of renewal, if necessary by transferring his allegiance to a new agent. In the case of a longer-term of contract, however, even a comparatively unproven player might well be able to negotiate a sliding scale of commission to cover the possibility that his career might prosper to such an extent that his earnings from sponsorship deals might far exceed the norm. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">It would, no doubt, as Mr Stein opined, all be a matter of negotiation.  But, if a young player was an exciting prospect and was well advised, I would have thought that some sort of sliding scale of this kind could easily be agreed.  So, whilst 20% may well be the norm, as asserted by Mr Stein, the actual rate of commission in any particular case would depend upon the outcome of negotiations between the player, or his representatives, and the agent, and would be influenced by factors such as the reputation and prospects of the player and the length of the proposed contract. </p>

Both experts considered the reasons why commission rates at these levels were commonly agreed in relation to commercial activities.  Whilst, unsurprisingly, neither attempted to justify any particular rate of commission with mathematical accuracy, both pointed to the distinction between the lower rates normally charged in respect of on-field activities and the higher rates commonly agreed in relation to commercial matters.  They sought to explain this distinction on the basis of the difference between the work which the agent had to do in order to earn his commission.  But the precise nature of the explanation which each gave, at least as it was ultimately articulated, differed in a highly important respect. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In his initial report, Mr Stein justified high rates of commission in relation to commercial and marketing activities on the basis that they were largely generated by the agents’ own endeavours, whilst on-field commission was primarily generated by the player’s own footballing abilities and the consequent interest of the clubs, so that playing contracts were “almost a by-product of deals between clubs for the transfer of players”. In his own report, Mr Taylor did not dissent in substance from these observations made by Mr Stein.  Indeed, he expressly agreed that on-field activities were much more dependent on the ability of the player and his success on the field. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">But Mr Taylor placed even greater emphasis on a different aspect of the agent’s normal responsibilities.

He suggested that Nike, for example, would have its own internal team with specific responsibility for dealing with high profile sportsmen with whom it had a sponsorship contract, so that the agent, whilst remaining an important point of contact, would not have to be available at all hours on every day of the week. </p>

But he struggled to find very convincing examples of the way in which this might operate in practice.  Nonetheless, he suggested that the role of the agent was not exactly “brain surgery”; and he pointed out that the commercial interests of Mr Paul Gascoigne had been looked after by himself, as a practising solicitor, his accountant and one other person. </p>

Mr Stein was also asked about the high level of costs which, according to Mr Page, Proactive had incurred over the years in handling WR’s commercial affairs.

Even Mr Wallwork, though initially a little reluctant, agreed that the commitment involved was substantial.  Perhaps even more significantly, Mr Bartlett, the Sports Managing Director of Nike, disagreed firmly with Mr Stein’s evidence from the perspective of a major sponsor; and Mr Bartlett’s evidence about these matters was scarcely challenged in cross-examination. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">On this issue, I do not feel able to accept Mr Stein’s evidence, at least as it was progressively refined in his supplemental statement and in cross-examination.  I am satisfied that the normal role of an agent who represents the commercial interests of a player goes well beyond the core function of finding commercial opportunities and obtaining sponsorship contracts for the player.  A successful agent can be expected to foster, build up, enhance and protect a player’s image and brand and so increase his commercial value. In addition, he must ensure that the player’s commercial commitments are managed with skill and efficiency so as to maintain a happy working relationship with the sponsor and, in so doing, reconcile the various other demands on the player’s time, most notably his playing career and his family life.  Whilst the agent could be expected to play this role in respect of any player on whose behalf he acted, it seems obvious that, the more high profile the player, the greater the demands which will be made upon the agent. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In reality, I find it difficult to see how the agent’s role in securing contracts can readily be separated from the need to nurture the player’s image in order to increase his attractiveness to sponsors and in servicing the contracts once they have been secured. It seems to me that the careful nurturing of a player’s image and the successful management of sponsorship contracts on his behalf is likely to lead to a virtuous circle in which the player becomes ever more attractive to sponsors resulting in even better and more lucrative sponsorship opportunities.  But this, of course, must be subject to a highly important caveat.  A player’s commercial value will ultimately depend, in all but perhaps the most exceptional case, on his abilities and success in his chosen sport.  Nonetheless, assuming a sufficient degree of success on the pitch, it seems to me to be difficult to separate the different aspects of an agent’s role in relation to image rights.  The money is in the sponsorship deals.  But these do not materialise out of thin air; nor do they manage themselves.  So long as it is not treated as a mathematically precise formula, I do not think that I could do better than to adopt the words used by the experts themselves at paragraph 4.1.3(d) of the note of their </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Both experts agreed that it was normal and highly desirable for any sports agency agreement to be exclusive.  Exclusivity means that negotiations with both club and prospective sponsors can be conducted in the secure knowledge that the agent is the sole person or body entitled to negotiate on behalf of the player or his image rights company and in the reasonably confident expectation that the agent will deliver what he has promised.  It also prevents a player being de-stabilised by constant approaches from other prospective agents seeking to persuade him to let them act on his behalf.  The downside, of course, is that during the term of the agreement, the player cannot simply decide to appoint someone else to act on his behalf without, at least, having to pay compensation, which may, of course, be substantial. </p>

There is clearly no reason in legal principle why a player should be represented by the same agent in relation to both on-field and off-field activities.  It seems that there are at least some instances in which a player has separate agreements with different agents in relation to each of these separate fields of activity.  Mr Stein thought that this was not uncommon and not, in itself, undesirable. Mr Taylor, however, took a different view.  I disregard for these purposes the inevitable need for separate agreements where the players image rights have been assigned to a company such as Stoneygate in the present case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">For my part, I rather doubt whether this particular point is material to the substantive issues which have to be determined in this action.  I think the essential point sought to be made was that long-term image rights agreements are undesirable because of the two-year limit on playing agencies.  Be that as it may, Mr Taylor argued that, unless one agent was clearly subordinate to the other, there would be likely to be competition between the two, with each hoping to take over from the other, to the potential detriment of the player himself.  Mr Stein countered this by observing that, if there were two agents, they would each have to co-operate with the other as a matter of commercial necessity. Insofar as there was an element of competition in the relationship, that would likely to work to the benefit of the player rather than the contrary. I have come to the fairly unsurprising conclusion that dual representation of this kind remains uncommon and that how well, or badly it operates in practice depends upon all the circumstances and the personalities of those involved. </p>

The issue addressed by the experts was whether, in ordinary commercial practice, an agent would be entitled to commission arising out of contracts negotiated by him during the contract period where the payment upon which commission was calculated, or the event which gave rise to it, occurred after the end of the contract period.  The obvious example would be where a sponsorship agreement, such as those between Stoneygate and Coca Cola or Nike, provided for annual payments over a number of years stretching beyond the end of the period of agency, whether that expired by effluxion of time or by the prior determination or discharge of the contract. </p>

According to Mr Taylor, he had never known an instance in which an agency had sought all continuing commission on lengthy contracts after the player had left to join another agent.

He pointed out that the agent’s responsibilities would normally extend to the servicing of any contracts procured for the player during the continuance of the agency agreement.  If the player decided to move to a new agent, Mr Taylor considered that it would be unreasonable for the former agent to continue to receive remuneration in the form of commission when, ex hypothesi, he was no longer providing such services; and, by the same token, it would be unrealistic, in his opinion, to expect a new agent to provide services of this kind without receiving any commission in respect of the contracts which had to be serviced. </p>

Accordingly, he took the view that there was, in reality, no real risk of a player, whether personally or through his image rights company, being required to pay double commission if he moved from one agent to another.

In such circumstances, I do not doubt that agents will often assert a right to post-termination commission and that any such claim will be taken into account in any negotiated settlement.  I do not see that this is likely to help me to decide whether the invariable or, at least general, expectation, on both sides, is that an agent acting under an image rights representation Agreement would be entitled to post-termination commission of the kind claimed in this action.  Notwithstanding Mr Stein’s evidence, I am not prepared to hold that there is such a general expectation on both sides, even though such a claim may often be asserted by agents in the event of dispute.

On the one hand, it might be said that the legitimate commercial interests of the agent could only properly be protected if he was entitled to receive post-termination commission on contracts which he had negotiated. Otherwise, it might be said, he might find himself in a situation in which he had successfully negotiated a highly lucrative, long-term commercial sponsorship agreement just before the end of his contract only to find that his client immediately transferred his business to another agent, thus depriving the original agent of any proper remuneration for the work which he had done. </p>

There is really no doubt, on the evidence before me, that a term of this length for an agreement of this kind was not merely unusual but unique.  I need not rehearse the evidence in any detail.  Proactive itself was able to produce 62 image rights agreements of which, I was told, 60 were for a period of two years and only two extended a little longer.  Mr Harrington could recall having seen about 20 such agreements of which, he thought, only one was for more than two years.  So the debate between the experts largely focused on three ancillary issues: firstly, just how exceptional an eight-year term was compared with the length of other agreements of a similar nature; secondly, how much of a fetter such a term imposed, in practice, on the player’s freedom to exploit his own image rights; and thirdly what was the commercial justification for a term of this length. </p>

Likewise, under, I think, both FIFA and FA Regulations, the maximum term of a playing contract is three years for a player under the age of 21 and five years in the case of any other player.  Furthermore, according to Mr Taylor, the average length of a professional footballer’s career in this country is no more than about eight years.  As an average, that figure will presumably take into account those many footballers whose career is brought to an early end by injury or a lack of success on the pitch.  But, in the case of a player such as WR, who started to play professional football at a very young age and whose prowess on the field is not in doubt, a significantly longer professional career could be anticipated, provided, of course, that he remains free of serious injury. </p>

Mr Stein stated that he had come across agreements of this kind lasting four or five years, though he did not provide any detailed particulars of the contracts in question.  He did not agree that there was any reason why commercial agreements of this kind should be limited to a term of two years by analogy with on-field agency agreements.  He pointed out that commercial agreements were not regulated by FIFA or the FA and that it was unlikely that they would be regulated in the near future.

Indeed, he went a little further, suggesting that some individuals or companies might try to conclude commercial agreements for a period of four or five years in order to give them a negotiating “edge” in securing on-field representation rights for the same player when the original on-field representation agreement expired at the end of its maximum term. </p>

No example of a contract for a longer period was produced at trial and none of the witnesses claimed to have seen or even heard of a contract for a longer period than five years, other than the Image Rights Representation Agreement between Proactive and Stoneygate which has given rise to this litigation.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">But Mr Stein nonetheless contended that the eight-year term did not unduly restrict the freedom of WR and Stoneygate to exploit his image rights through some other agency. The essential argument which he advanced in his written reports was to the effect that the Image Rights Representation Agreement did not tie Stoneygate to Proactive for a fixed term of eight years, since there was a provision for early termination.  The clause which he invoked to justify this proposition was, of course, clause 8 which, it will be recalled, was headed “Consequences of Termination”.  This clause provided that, in the event of termination by Stoneygate prior to the expiry of the eight year term, certain monies would become payable forthwith to Proactive.  The sums in question were £25,000, representing part of the monies paid by Proactive, in effect, as a form of signing-on fee, what were described as “liquidated damages” calculated by reference to the sum of £37,500 multiplied by the number of complete years of the unexpired term of the agreement, and, finally, a sum equivalent to Proactive’s total costs and expenses properly incurred from the date of the Agreement until the date of the termination notice.  Mr Stein proceeded, it would seem, on the assumption that this clause was apt to confer on Stoneygate and WR a unilateral option to determine the contract at any time on payment of the stipulated sums.  In effect, it set out the price at which he could buy himself out of the Agreement. </p>

Mr Stein set out an analysis of what he described as the “exit fee” in the form of a Schedule to his supplemental report.  The signing-up fee of £25,000, of course, remained constant year on year. The liquidated damages, however, went down by the sum of £37,500 </p>

Basing his calculations on Mr Page’s estimate of the relevant costs and expenses incurred by Proactive, Mr Stein’s Schedule shows that over the five years from January 2004 to January 2008, the net exit fee payable under this clause would have increased from £357,240 to £705,832.  So, the longer the contract went on, the more, it seems, Stoneygate would have to pay to buy itself out. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">But Mr Stein’s reasoning was severely shaken by the forensic decision of Proactive and its legal team to abandon any argument that clause 8 conferred an option upon Stoneygate and WR to terminate the Agreement on payment of the specified sums.  It seems that he was informed of this only shortly before the commencement of the trial.  Whatever the position may have been on the pleadings, it was Proactive’s case at trial that clause 8 was not apt to confer an option of early termination on Stoneygate but merely sought to provide for the consequences of any breach of contract on its part.  As such, it was to be regarded, as a penalty provision rather than a true liquidated damages clause, so that Proactive would be entitled to claim damages at large for breach of contract.  Accordingly, the alternative claim made by Proactive to recover the sums set out in clause 8 was no longer pursued.  That remained Proactive’s position until after the conclusion of the evidence, when Mr Mill added a further refinement by way of a concession that the sum set out in clause 8 should act as some sort of “cap” on the damages which Proactive could recover.  That was, of course, without prejudice to its claim for post-termination commission. </p>

As he explained in his supplemental witness statement, this would, in his view, represent good business for the new agent, since, in his view, he could very quickly generate enough income from new contracts to cover his initial expenditure and move into profit, even without being entitled to commission on inherited contracts. </p>

Accordingly, as a matter of commercial reality, WR and Stoneygate could, at any time, bring the agreement to an end, albeit at the expense of rendering themselves liable to a claim for damages from Proactive.  The amount of those damages would, therefore, in effect, constitute the price at which WR could buy himself out of the contract. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">I am prepared to accept that Mr Stein’s argument is soundly based in law, though I was not specifically addressed on the question whether the court might, in some circumstances, be willing to grant injunctive relief to restrain a breach of an exclusive agency, particularly where the agreement is not directly with an individual.  But, as Mr Stein recognised, the damages which would be payable in those circumstances would, at least in the present case, be higher, and probably much higher, than the sums provided for by clause 8 of the Agreement.  The amount of those damages in the present case has not yet been properly quantified; and it is accepted that, if the damages claim is held to be sound in principle, there will have to be an assessment at a later date. But Mr Wallwork and Mr Page gave estimates of between £3m and £4m.  As I understand the position, that is in addition to the amount of any post-termination commission to which Proactive claims to be entitled. </p>

The amounts involved are obviously substantial.  Assuming 20% commission, new sponsorship deals in excess of £20m would have to be found by any putative new agent; and it must be recalled that, in Mr Stein’s opinion, it would be Proactive, rather than the new agent, which could expect to continue to receive the commission on any contract which had been procured during the subsistence of its agency. </p>

Not only would it, in his opinion, represent a good business deal (provided, no doubt, that the term of the new agreement was sufficiently lengthy), but the very fact that the new agency would have a player of such repute on its books would be likely to attract even more business.  As he put it, WR’s name would act as an admirable “calling card” for the agency in question. </p>

But he was much more doubtful as to whether anyone would be prepared to take the commercial risk of buying out his contract, particularly at the sort of figures which had been suggested.  He pointed out that there were both practical and, it would seem, contractual limitations on the number of major sponsorship deals which Stoneygate could accept in addition to those which were already in place.  So there would be only limited scope for a new agent to negotiate contracts on which he could expect to obtain commission.  Nonetheless, he accepted that there might be commercial opportunities of this kind in such fields as luxury clothing and watches. </p>

The former proposition is obviously correct; and, in practice, it appears that sponsorship deals are indeed regularly re-negotiated before they come to an end, as was indeed the case with both Nike and Coca Cola. No doubt the new agent would then be entitled to receive commission on these re-negotiated contracts.  But, insofar as any such re-negotiation took place within the eight-year period of the Image Rights Representation Agreement between Proactive and Stoneygate, Proactive would presumably wish to assert a claim to damages for the loss of opportunity to </p>

So I rather doubt whether the prospect of earning commission on new or re-negotiated sponsorship contracts prior to the end of the eight-year term of Proactive’s contract with Stoneygate would make such a buy-out any more potentially attractive. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Given the amount of money which has poured into sport and, in particular, football, in recent years and the potential value of the Rooney “brand”, I think that Mr Stein is probably right in expressing the opinion that there would be a small number of agencies willing to pay a high price to buy out Proactive’s contractual rights.  But even Mr Stein accepted that there would come a point at which such a deal would simply not be viable.  Though the evidence is really somewhat unsatisfactory, I am prepared, albeit with some hesitation, to accept Mr Stein’s opinion that there would probably be sufficient interest from a small number of agencies to ensure that Proactive’s contractual rights could be bought out by a new agency, at a price which would reflect the level of damages suggested by Mr Page and Mr Wallwork. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">But, for my part, I would have thought that any new agent would only be interested in doing a “clean break” deal under which any claim by Proactive for post-termination commission would have to be surrendered.  Much more importantly, of course, any such buy-out could only be effective with the whole-hearted consent of Stoneygate and WR himself.  None of the agencies which Mr Stein thought might be willing to bid were ever specifically identified by name.  I have no idea whatever as to whether any of them would be acceptable to WR.  The whole argument, therefore, seems to me to be entirely speculative.  In reality, I simply do not know whether the scenario envisaged by Mr Stein could, in practice, come to pass. </p>

The mere fact that the only realistic remedy may be a claim for damages rather than for an injunction or specific performance cannot alter the nature of the parties’ obligations.  Nor, in my judgment, can it be relevant that some third party might be willing to pay a sum equivalent to the damages in question or some other negotiated figure.  At most, Mr Stein’s analysis means that the sanction for breaking the contractual tie would be financial rather than penal. But, assuming the contract was otherwise valid and enforceable, the measure of that financial sanction would be the length of the eight year tie. </p>

Mr Stein addressed this question briefly in his initial report, most conveniently at paragraph 28.  He considered that there were only three unusual features about the Agreement, which he identified as its length, the “break clause” (as he then assumed it to be) and the obligation on Proactive to use its best endeavours to represent Stoneygate and, therefore, indirectly, </p>

Some of them are quite clearly and demonstrably wrong.  Thus, subparagraphs (a), (b), (d), (e), (f) and (g) are all linked by the theme that Proactive had made a substantial initial investment, in the form of signing-on fees amounting to £50,000 in a young and unproven player, that there was no certainty that its investment would be repaid and that, in any event, no return could be expected until some years in the future.  But the initial outlay was more than recouped as soon as he signed his professional forms with Everton FC; and lucrative sponsorship deals were obtained within a matter of months.  It was in this context that Mr Stein made the quite serious error as to the amounts payable under the initial Nike sponsorship contract and the amount of commission which it generated for Proactive. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The point can be made very clearly by reference to two specific matters.  Firstly, Proactive’s own internal documents demonstrate that, from a very early stage in its relationship with WR, Proactive was planning a long-term marketing campaign involving a dedicated team of employees.  It is unlikely that this would have been the case if he had not been regarded as an outstanding prospect.  Secondly, the report prepared by Couchman Harrington and dated 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2002 presents the player’s prospects in encomiastic terms which I need not repeat.  I appreciate that this was, in effect, a marketing document, intended to assist in securing an Image Rights Licence Agreement with Everton FC.  But even making some allowances for the purpose of the document, it seems to show quite plainly the way in which Proactive regarded the prospects of the player. </p>

He added the qualification, however, that, in his opinion, any payments under clause 8 would not come close to representing Proactive’s real loss. At paragraphs 5(o) and (p), he made the supplemental point that, in the event of a falling-out between player and agent, commercial necessity would normally impel both sides to seek a financial compromise which would not necessarily be based upon the strict contractual terms of the agreement between the parties.  For my part, that seems fairly obvious; but I do not see that it adds much, if anything, to any analysis of the interests which might legitimately be sought to be protected by an eight-year tie. </p>

But I do not see what it has to do with the issue under consideration.

More importantly perhaps, if one were to follow Mr Stein’s example and adopt a highly commercial approach to these contractual provisions, I rather doubt that such an obligation would turn out to be of any great significance in practice. If a player’s career developed in the way demonstrated by WR himself, it would obviously be in the commercial interests of both parties to try to exploit his image as best they could, whatever the precise nature of the contractual obligations owed by the agent. If, on the other hand, a player’s career never took off, or was cut short by injury, it is unlikely that any significant commercial sponsorship deals could be obtained, notwithstanding the best endeavours of the agent to obtain them. </p>

Otherwise, the agent would no doubt be hoping and expecting to renew any image rights agreement at the expiration of its term, just as he would in relation to an onfield agency agreement, limited, as it must be, to a maximum term of two years.  After all, I doubt if Mr Stein himself short-changed any of the players whom he represented, such as Mr Paul Gascoigne, despite the absence of any long-term contractual commitment.  Nonetheless, I can see some force in the point that a longer period of exclusivity might provide added security for both agent and player so as to allow a longer term strategy to be developed and implemented. </p>

I find this argument difficult if not impossible to assess, since there was no attempt in this litigation to analyse the return which Proactive might hope to make across its entire book of clients. I nonetheless beg to doubt if Proactive would be likely to make a loss on many of the players whom it represented, at least in relation to on-field activities, whatever the position may be in relation to image rights. </p>

Indeed, I do not readily see that it would necessarily be in Proactive’s interests to deploy profits from a highly successful venture in order to subsidise unsuccessful contracts.  One might have thought that its business interests might better be served by a more discriminating and selective approach on its part.

I do not think it is necessary to do anything other than to pick up one of the points arising out of cross-examination.  This related to the comparative youth of WR at the time when he and Stoneygate entered into the Image Rights Representation Agreement.  Mr Stein suggested that, in his view, it might be more advantageous for such a young player to enter into a longer term contract, since he would have a longer career ahead of him and such contract would facilitate a long-term “game plan”.  But he did add the caveat that this was on the assumption that the player had had the benefit of independent legal advice.  He also acknowledged that even a four or five year agreement would allow for strategic planning of this kind. </p>

He pressed him, however, on the desirability of an agent being able to take a long view of the development of a player’s commercial brand, particularly in the case of a young footballer who might take some years to achieve his full commercial potential.  Whilst Mr Taylor was inclined to agree with the proposition that a long-term strategy was to be desired, he questioned whether it was necessary to lock a player into a long-term contract in order to achieve that objective. </p>

When asked about this plan, Mr Taylor came very close to accepting that a four-year plan of this kind might be reasonable for a player of WR’s age.  But he clearly still had reservations based, in part, on the lack of flexibility, if things were to go wrong, in the form of some kind of “get-out” clause and, in part, because of his view that on-field and off-field representation contracts should, if at all practicable, be for the same period and with the same agent.  Nor was he willing to agree that, if the representation agreement was only for a short period, at least if there was a good relationship between the player and his agent, there would be a serious risk that the agent might put his own interests ahead of those of the player and recommend sponsorship deals which were unsuitable simply in order to earn his commission before the expiration of the term. </p>

Mr Taylor was unwilling to be drawn, commenting that the issue was far from straightforward.  But the point which Mr Mill sought to develop was that if, having taken a long-term view, a contract negotiated by an agent was likely to come up for re-negotiation or renewal after the end of the agency agreement, that might be a reason for seeking a longer term contract in the first instance, particularly if the contract did not confer a right to post-termination commission on the agent in such circumstances.  Mr Taylor did not give a clear answer to this question; and I have some sympathy with him. I rather doubt whether it is really a matter of admissible expert opinion. </p>

So the prayer for declaratory relief is strictly in respect of its claim for post-termination commission falling due after that date. Any commission falling due prior to 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2009 is specifically claimed as a liquidated sum or alternatively as damages in the same amount.  Secondly, the basis of the alleged right to post-termination commission is almost entirely unparticularised.  The only real light cast upon it is to be found at paragraph 11(5A) of its Re-Amended Reply which re-asserts the claim and alleges that an entitlement of this kind is “usual in contracts of agency and/or sports representation” where, as in the present case, or so it is said, the “main value and work in such representation lies in identifying appropriate third parties, negotiation with those third parties and obtaining satisfactory agreements with those third parties”.

The damages in question are said to fall under two heads.  The first of these is based upon the alleged loss of a chance to negotiate or re-negotiate valuable image rights agreements during the remainder of the term of the Image Rights Representation Agreements.  It should be noted that no similar claim is expressly advanced in relation to the period prior to any alleged repudiatory breach on the part of Stoneygate, notwithstanding the withdrawal of co-operation with effect from the end of October 2008.  The second head of damages alleged at paragraph 9F is directed to the possibility that Proactive may not, in fact, have a continuing contractual entitlement to commission.  In that event, it is alleged that it is entitled to damages in the equivalent sum. </p>

Leaving aside, for present purposes, their fundamental attack on the validity or enforceability of the Image Rights Representation Agreement, it is denied that they were ever in breach of contract or that Proactive suffered any loss in consequence of any such breach.  But Stoneygate’s case on the issue of post-termination commission is articulated somewhat indirectly.  At paragraph 64A(b) and (c) of the Re-Re-Amended Defence and Counterclaim, it seeks a declaration that, as a matter of construction, Proactive’s right to commission ceased when it ceased to provide  services under the Agreement or alternatively upon termination of the contract, or, alternatively, a declaration that there was an implied term to the same effect “by reason of obvious inference or business efficacy”. </p>

But the bundle of contracts produced during the course of the trial shows that a provision to that effect began to be incorporated in its representation agreements from about February 2003.

He approached the question as involving a point of construction.  I add the observation that the most recent and authoritative commentary on the basis of the implication of terms into contractual documents makes it clear that the processes of implication and interpretation are closely related.

Before discussing in greater detail the reasoning of the Court of Appeal, the Board will make some general observations about the process of implication.  The court has no power to improve upon the instrument which it is called upon to construe, whether it be a contract, a statute or articles of association. It cannot introduce terms to make it fairer or more reasonable.  It is concerned only to discover what the instrument means.  However, that meaning is not necessarily or always what the authors or parties to the document would have intended.  It is the meaning which the instrument would convey to a reasonable person having all the background knowledge which would reasonably be available to the audience to whom the instrument is addressed: see <span style="font-style:italic">Investors Compensation Scheme Limited -v- West Bromwich Building Society</span> [1998] 1 WLR 896, 912-913.

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.50in">The question of implication arises when the instrument does not expressly provide for what is to happen when some event occurs.  The most usual inference in such a case is that nothing is to happen.  If the parties had intended something to happen, the instrument would have said so.  Otherwise, the express provisions of the instrument are to continue to operate undisturbed.  If the event has caused loss to one or other of the parties, the loss lies where it falls. </p>

The event in question is to affect the rights of the parties.  The instrument may not have expressly said so, but this is what it must mean.  In such a case, it is said that the court implies a term as to what will happen if the event in question occurs. But the implication of the term is not an addition to the instrument.

It will be noticed from Lord Pearson’s speech that this question can be re-formulated in various ways which a court may find helpful in providing an answer - the implied term must “go without saying”, it must be “necessary to give business efficacy to the contract” and so on - but these are not in the Board’s opinion to be treated as different or additional tests.

The condition, he argued, which gave rise to the right to commission was the sponsorship contract itself.  If that was secured for Stoneygate during the term of the Agreement, Proactive, he contended, would have an accrued right to commission even if the sums on which the commission was calculated became payable or were paid after the end of the contract period.  Indeed, he submitted, rather adventurously, as it seemed to me, that Proactive would have been entitled to its commission on all sums payable over the entire term of the sponsorship contract as soon as Stoneygate had entered into the contract in question. </p>

Thus, he prayed in aid the example of an agent who had successfully secured a lucrative and long-term contract for the benefit of his client immediately before the expiration of his agency agreement.  There would, of course, be no problem if the entire consideration for the contract was in the form of a capital sum payable at the outset.  But why, asked Mr Mill rhetorically, should the agent be deprived of any future commission if the contract provided for substantial payments on a regular, periodic basis, rather than in the form of a lump sum?  Underlying these arguments, though not set in their forefront, was Mr Stein’s evidence that, in his opinion, a right to continuing commission was something that he considered went without saying. </p>

He also sought to support his argument by counter-examples of the commercial consequences of construing the contract in the way contended for on behalf of Proactive.  Thus, he pointed out that, if Proactive were entitled to commission on long-term sponsorship contracts entered into near the end of the contract period, it would mean that Stoneygate would have to carry on paying commission at the substantial rate of 20% over a period of many years without Proactive having to provide any further services under the Image Rights Representation Agreement.  This would represent a continuing drain or charge upon Stoneygate’s income, even though it would have to find another agent to provide the services which were no longer being provided by Proactive. There would, therefore, he submitted, be a real risk that Stoneygate would find itself in a position in which it had to pay double commission, once to Stoneygate and once to a new agent. </p>

Thus, by clause 3.1.1, the exploitation of the image rights is said to include “media (including television, radio, press and internet) and publicity relations and negotiations”. That would seem to embrace public relations of a more general nature. The point is made perhaps even more clearly by the wording at the end of clause 3.1 by which Proactive was to carry out “such other tasks as the Client may from time to time request, and as the Company shall consider prudent and in the interests of the client from time to time.” </p>

Clause 3.6 required Proactive to accompany representatives of Stoneygate to “promotional events, meetings, negotiation sessions and any other occasions as the Client may from time to time reasonably request.”  This would seem, at least in part, to cover the servicing of the contracts once they had been obtained.  Finally, clause 3.8 required Proactive to “assist and advise the Client generally in respect of such of its business interests as it may request from time to time,” including, as necessary, referral to other experts or professional advisers. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Chaisty’s other major point was based upon the provisions of clause 8 of the Image Rights Representation Agreement.  It will be recalled that this provided for certain payments to be made to Proactive by Stoneygate and, it would seem, WR himself, in the event that the Agreement was terminated by Stoneygate prior to the expiry of the eight-year term.  I shall have some further brief observations about clause 8 in due course. But Mr Chaisty’s argument was that, whether or not it was to be regarded as conferring a unilateral option on Stoneygate to determine the contract on the payment of the specified sums or as an attempt to quantify any loss and damage arising out of a repudiatory breach of the Agreement, it made no mention of any continuing obligation to pay commission after early termination. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">On either view, he submitted, what was clearly intended was to allow for a commercial divorce on a “clean break” basis.  That could not be achieved if there was a right to continuing commission as now asserted on behalf of Proactive.  But none of the payments set out in clause 8 seem apt to provide any form of compensation for the loss of a potentially highly lucrative right to continuing commission; nor is there any provision reserving any rights of this kind.  So, it is said, both the wording and the commercial structure of clause 8 appear to be based on the assumption that there would be no continuing right to commission on early termination.  And if there was no such right in those circumstances, the question necessarily arises as to why the position should be different if the contract ran its course and came to an end at the expiration of its eight-year period. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">For my part, I do not consider that the word “payable” in clause 6.2 of the Image Rights Representation Agreement can bear the weight which Mr Mill seeks to place upon it. The obvious purpose and effect of adopting this particular expression is to ensure that Proactive’s right to commission crystallises at the time when any sum due from a third party under any relevant contract or arrangement falls due for payment rather than when it is actually paid.  Furthermore, I cannot accept Mr Mill’s submission that, somehow or other, the wording of clause 6.2 means that Proactive was entitled to payment as soon as any third party sponsorship contract was entered into, with the result that it would have been entitled to the entirety of its commission as at that date, no matter how far in the future any relevant payments might actually become due.  The practice of the parties was to the contrary; and I consider that this practice reflected the terms of the contract rather than being a matter of concession or grace on the part of Proactive. </p>

The word “all” in this context is largely stylistic in nature.  It could as well have been replaced by the word “any” or even by the definite article.  In a professionally drawn contract, the choice of the word “all” in this context seems to me to be a highly indirect and uncertain way of providing for post-termination commission, if that was what was intended. In those circumstances, one might have expected some specific wording to that effect, such as “whether before or after the termination of this Agreement”, to be inserted after the word “payable”.  But, of course, no such words appear in clause 6. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Underlying Mr Mill’s argument, as it seems to me, was the proposition that the Image Rights Representation Agreement was to be treated, in effect, in much the same way as other forms of agency, such as a contract with an estate agent for the sale of a property or with a commercial representative seeking orders for a particular product.  Up to a point, the analogy is a sound one, at least if the agent is to be remunerated by way of commission.  In such cases, it is always necessary to determine the event which gives rise to the right to commission. Once that event has occurred the agent’s right to remuneration has accrued and cannot be taken away by the subsequent termination of the agency agreement.  But if it does not occur, no right to commission arises; and the court will not normally imply any other right to remuneration. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Accordingly, the resolution of disputes in such cases commonly requires the court to determine the event or circumstances which give rise to the right to commission and to decide whether those circumstances have, in fact, arisen. In estate agency cases, that will normally be a successful sale of the property as a result of an introduction by the estate agent; and in the case of a commercial sales representative, it will often be the introduction of a customer who goes on to place an order for the goods in question. </p>

For a start, it imposes positive obligations upon Proactive to perform the various services set out in clause 3. In addition, it does not expressly limit Proactive’s right of commission to those contracts or arrangements with third parties which it was responsible for negotiating and procuring.  That might not be particularly surprising, given the fact that the contract provided for an exclusive agency and required Stoneygate, in effect, to direct all relevant business opportunities to Proactive.  But, of course, as I have already recorded, Mr Mill conceded that Proactive would have to have been the effective cause of the contracts or arrangements which gave rise to the payments in respect of which commission became payable. </p>

As it happens, however, it seems to me that the Image Rights Representation Agreement would be perfectly workable in the particular circumstances of this case, even without the implication of some such term or proviso.  I can see no reason in principle why an agent such as Proactive could not agree to provide a range of services for its client in return for a percentage of the income receivable by the client during the subsistence of the agreement.

If one looks to the Agreement in order to determine what Proactive must do in order to earn its remuneration, the answer must obviously be that it must provide the Services as defined.  It is the provision of the Services, in my judgment, which gives rise to the right to remuneration, even though that remuneration is measured by reference to the income receivable by Stoneygate. The linkage of remuneration to income is unsurprising.  It represents the most obvious measure of the success of the relationship over the longer term; and given the fact that it was an exclusive agency, it was virtually inevitable that the individual contracts which generated the income would have been procured through the efforts of Proactive.  But, despite Mr Mill’s concession to the effect that Proactive must have been the effective cause of the income-generating opportunity, it does not follow that all that Proactive had to do to earn its commission was to procure the contracts or arrangements in question. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In my judgment, therefore, whatever may be the case under other contractual arrangements, Proactive’s right to commission arose out of the provision of the services over the whole of the contract period and not merely as a result of the procurement of the contracts or arrangements upon which commission was calculated.  In those circumstances, I have little difficulty in reaching the further conclusion that its right to commission would terminate at the expiration of the contract period and that its entitlement would be limited to sums which had become payable during that period. In effect, Proactive was entitled to a percentage of Stoneygate’s income during the subsistence of the Agreement but no further. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In reaching this conclusion, I bear in mind that this was not some informal contract between well-informed businessmen but a detailed Agreement which was professionally drafted by solicitors instructed on behalf of Proactive and accepted by commercially unsophisticated parties without any independent legal advice.  If a right to post-termination commission was to arise under the Agreement, one would have expected express provision to that effect to have been included within it.  In a case such as this, Lord Hoffman’s observations in <span style="font-weight:bold">Attorney General of Belize -v- Belize Telecom Ltd</span> [2009] 1 WLR 1988 at paragraph 17 seem to be very much in point:  “If the parties had intended something to happen, the instrument would have said so”. </p>

I refer to <span style="font-weight:bold">Explora Group Plc -v- Hesco Bastion Limited</span> [2005] EWCA Civ 646, and in particular to paragraphs 64, 65 and 68 of the judgment of Rix LJ.  But it seems to me that the decision in that case turned on its very particular facts under which commission was claimed in respect of orders generated as a result of a contract effectively procured by the agent.  Though various points of law arose, some of which I will refer to hereafter, it does not seem to me that the Court of Appeal was laying down any general proposition of law which is inimical to the conclusion which I have reached in relation to the terms of this particular contract.  If it were necessary to do so, I would emphasise in just the same way, that my conclusions as to the interpretation of this particular Agreement would not necessarily have any bearing upon the different terms of different contracts entered into in different circumstances. </p>

It was only in December 2009, after receipt of the termination letter dated 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2009 that it decided to treat the contract as discharged and accepted what it regarded as a repudiatory breach by letter dated 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2009. In fact, of course, it now appears that Stoneygate and WR had appointed Triple S as its agent some months earlier than this exchange of letters.  Since the Image Rights Representation Agreement was an exclusive agency, supported by the various duties on the part of Stoneygate set out at clause 4 of the Agreement, that would seem to have been a serious breach of contract, though it appears that Proactive was not fully aware of the appointment at that time. </p>

But, of course, it has always been Stoneygate’s own case that clause 8 did not confer any such unilateral right of termination but was an ineffectual liquidated damages clause which was to be treated as a penalty.  On the other hand, at least until a very late stage, Proactive was advancing a contrary case in relation to clause 8 and, indeed, was seeking to recover, as an alternative to other heads of relief, the sums payable in accordance with the provisions of the clause. </p>

This was put in a variety of ways in various separate passages of the Re-Re-Amended Defence.  In essence, it appears to be contended that, if, contrary to Stoneygate’s primary case, clause 8 conferred a right of early termination and was not a penalty, the letter of 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December must be treated as an exercise of that right, even though there was no express reference to any particular clause.

I refer to paragraph 50C(a) of the Re-ReAmended Defence.  Mr Chaisty cited no authority for this novel doctrine.

In essence, the argument was to the effect that, at the time when the Image Rights Representation Agreement was entered into, all parties assumed that it could be terminated at any time under clause 8, subject to payment of the relevant sums.  Alternatively, the alleged estoppel is said to arise out of various allegations made by Proactive in its pleadings to the effect that Stoneygate was entitled to terminate at any time under clause 8, subject, of course, to payment of the requisite sums.  The relevant allegations are set out at paragraph 50C(b)-(g) of the Re-Amended Defence. </p>

By withdrawing co-operation and refusing to make any further payment to Proactive, it seems to me that Stoneygate and WR had made it impossible for Proactive to perform its own side of the bargain, thus entitling it, if it had so chosen, to bring the contract formally to an end by treating their conduct as a repudiatory breach and accepting it. </p>

Likewise, as I have already noted, the appointment of Triple S as agent in place of Proactive would also seem to have been a clear and fundamental breach of the exclusivity provisions of the Image Rights Representation Agreement.  In its Re-Re-Amended Particulars of Claim, Proactive relies upon this as a justification of its decision to treat the contract as discharged, it being alleged that it did not have sufficient knowledge of this development until after 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2009. </p>

On the contrary, it seems to me that the better view is that the parties’ approach is correct.  I can deal with it briefly.  Clause 7 deals expressly and specifically with duration and termination.  Indeed that is the heading under which the relevant provisions appear.  Clause 7.1 provides that, subject to clause 7.2, the Agreement should continue for eight years “unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions of this clause 7”. Those words in themselves seem fairly unequivocal.  The expression “this clause 7”, though rather clumsy, is commonly used to demonstrate without qualification that the relevant provisions are to be found in the clause referred to and nowhere else.  Clause 7.2 then provides for limited mutual rights of termination in the event of a material breach of the Agreement which remains unremedied or in the case of bankruptcy or insolvency.  On the face of it, therefore, there would appear to be no room for any other right of termination. </p>

The introductory words of clause 8.1 refer to termination by the Client prior to the expiry of the term set out in clause 7.1 otherwise than in accordance with clause 7.2 and go on to provide for the various payments set out in the following subclauses. Taken in isolation, that might be regarded as somewhat equivocal.  But, of course, one must have regard and give due weight to the seemingly unequivocal provisions of clause 7. </p>

Clause 8.1.2 provides that, in the event of early termination, Stoneygate or WR is required to pay to Proactive, in addition to the other sums payable under the clause, a sum by way of “liquidated damages”.  It must be recalled once again that both this Agreement and the earlier Agreement upon which it was based were drafted by solicitors.  In a professionally drawn instrument of this kind, the expression “liquidated damages” has a clear and obvious meaning.  It refers to compensation for breach of contract in an ascertained and agreed amount. On the face of it, therefore, the phrase is wholly inapt to describe a sum payable as the price of an option to terminate a contract, rather than a provision intended to quantify the damages payable in the event of breach. </p>

That, of course, is subject to the concession made by Mr Mill on behalf of Proactive to the effect that the amounts set out in clause 8 are to be treated as setting a “cap” on the amount of any damages recoverable by Proactive. </p>

But in the light of my finding that there was no contractual right to post-termination commission, the cut-off point for assessing the value of the lost opportunity must be the end of the contract period itself.  Furthermore, since it is a claim for damages, account must be taken of the fact that Proactive would not have to incur any further cost or expense in providing the services in return for which the commission would have become payable.  The claim is for the net loss not the gross loss of commission. It is, of course, common ground that the Court is not in a position to assess those damages at this stage and that the quantum will, if necessary, have to be determined at a later hearing.  I need, therefore, say no more about it. </p>

Accordingly, the obligations of the parties continued to be governed by the terms of the Agreement until that date, notwithstanding the breakdown in relations between the parties. In accordance with orthodox contractual principle, therefore, it might be thought that Stoneygate would remain liable to pay any commission falling due prior to the date of discharge and that Proactive’s right to recover any such commission would not be affected by the discharge of the contract.

But in consequence, of course, Proactive was relieved of the financial burden of providing the services in question.  In those circumstances, it might be asked why Proactive should be entitled to the full amount of its remuneration, without giving any credit for any savings, simply because it did not elect to accept what would seem to have been a clear repudiation or renunciation of the Image Rights Representation Agreement by Proactive and Mr Rooney. </p>

It was orally agreed that he would be paid commission at the rate of 2½% on orders from customers introduced by him.  The agency was then terminated by the Defendants who offered to pay three months’ commission.  He refused and sued for an account of commission due to him as agent and damages for breach of contract.  At the trial, it appears to have been agreed that three months’ notice was appropriate for the purposes of terminating the agency; and the Defendants contended that the Plaintiff was entitled to nothing after the expiration of the three months’ notice.  He, however,, contended that he was entitled to commission on all orders already received and to be received in the future from customers who had been introduced or “revived” by him.  The judge made a declaration that he was entitled to such commission and ordered an account of the amount due since termination of the agency.

But he did not accept that the appropriate relief was a declaration and an account.  He considered that, at least in most cases of this kind, a declaration was inappropriate.  In the particular circumstances of the case, he found two specific reasons for so holding. One was because the Plaintiff was under a duty to visit and entertain customers at his own expense, so that once the agency had been terminated, the Defendants would have to incur the costs for themselves.  The other was that the Plaintiff was entitled to continue to canvass the same customers for his own benefit, so that the Defendants might have to retain another agent to carry out similar work on their behalf.  His conclusion, as set out in pages 595-6 of his judgment was as follows: </p>

In cases such as the present (when the defendants repudiated any obligation to pay) damages is undoubtedly the right description. But it may not always be the right description.  Quite often there may be no repudiation but only a difference as to the amount of commission.  In such cases it would not be damages as such, but an award by way of restitution.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Firstly, at paragraph 64, he pointed out that it illustrated what he described as a “critical question” as to whether the commission was earned on introduction or on orders. If it was the former, it did not matter that the orders, let alone their execution and payment for them might not arise until after the termination of the agency.  Secondly, at paragraph 65, he dealt with the marketing responsibilities of the agent.  If the commission was earned on introduction, the mere fact that it was impossible to carry out marketing activities after the termination of the agency did not mean that commission had not already been earned.  He rejected a submission on behalf of the Defendant that it was a condition of the right to commission that the agent should carry out its marketing responsibilities.  Thirdly, at paragraph 66, he dealt with a further, related argument to the effect that, if the agent itself had repudiated its obligations shortly after the initial introduction, it would be “unimaginable” to think that it could go on taking commission over a number of years in respect of orders which its marketing had done nothing to secure.  In this context, he pointed out that <span style="font-weight:bold">Roberts -v- Elwells Engineers Limited</span> demonstrated, amongst other things, that, on any assessment, it might be found that orders during the relevant period were not effectively caused by the initial introduction and that various allowances would have to be made to reflect savings made by the agent or additional costs incurred by the principal. Fourthly, at paragraph 67, Rix LJ observed that the earlier decision showed that, at least in some circumstances it would be legitimate to have regard to the course of dealing between the parties to supplement the express terms of the agency agreement.  That may have some bearing on the relationship between Proactive and Speed; but I do not think it could be readily applied to the relationship between Proactive and Stoneygate which, on the face of it, is governed by the provision of a detailed written contract. </p>

Longmore LJ also agreed, save in relation to the particular question as to the agents’ entitlement to commission on orders received after the termination of the agreement.  He considered that the agent could not have an accrued right to commission on an order which had not then been placed, unless a term could be implied to that effect.  In the circumstances, he held that no such term should be implied.  It should, however, perhaps be noted that, at paragraph 126, he expressed the following view: </p>

That is, I consider, the rationale of <span style="font-style:italic">Roberts -v- Elwell</span> in which either side was entitled to terminate the contract by giving 3 months’ notice to the other and this court held that commission was payable on repeat orders for the same goods after such a notice had been given.

He emphasised that, in his view, the condition which gave rise to the right to commission was the introduction.  If it had depended only on orders, he accepted that an implied term would be necessary if the agent were to be entitled to commission after termination.  Jonathan Parker LJ specifically stated that, on this point, he agreed with Rix LJ, rather than Longmore LJ.  I note, however, that in the passage cited, Longmore LJ distinguished between the sort of approach which might be appropriate in the case of a contract with short notice period and that which might as appropriate in the case of a long-term agreement. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In any event, it seems to me to be fairly obvious that, by withdrawing co-operation in October 2008, Stoneygate and WR had effectively renounced their obligations under the Image Rights Representation Agreement, thereby giving rise to a right to damages on the part of Proactive, even if it had not elected, at that time, to treat the contract as discharged. No claim of this type is, however, expressly pleaded.  But, as previously noted, at paragraphs 6 and 9 of the Re-Re-Amended Particulars of Claim, it is alleged that Proactive had suffered loss and damage by reason of the refusal by Stoneygate to </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">But I do not think that anything of substance turns on a pleading point of this kind.  The claim remains one for restitution or damages rather than for a series of liquidated sums.  In principle, therefore, there would have to be an assessment of the amount recoverable for the period between the end of October 2008 and 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2009, just as in the case of the claim for damages in respect of the period subsequent to 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span> December 2009.  On such an assessment, similar factors might have to be taken into account. But this was not a point which was ever asserted on behalf of Stoneygate (or, for that matter, Speed) by way of partial defence.  In the circumstances, it seems to me that I should hear further submissions from the parties as to whether Proactive would be entitled to the full amount claimed, provided the other specific defences are resolved in its favour, or whether I should direct an assessment of compensation or damages, coupled, it may be, with an order for an interim payment. </p>

Since that contract is not, in itself, in issue, it is relevant only insofar as any mistaken belief as to its terms, validity and enforceability might have vitiated the subsequent Image Rights Representation Agreement.  So there are two aspects of Stoneygate’s case in relation to the earlier Agreement: firstly, whether there was indeed any mistake of the kind alleged; and, secondly, whether any such mistaken belief still affected the minds of the parties at the time when the later agreement was entered into. </p>

As for WR and his parents, I very much doubt if they gave any real thought to the precise terms of the 2002 Agreement and I am unpersuaded that they believed that it was limited to off-field representation.  I can see no satisfactory evidential basis, therefore, for concluding that there was any form of common or mutual mistake as to the scope of the 2002 Agreement.  In any event, whatever WR and his parents may have thought or assumed, by signing the Agreement, they agreed to its terms, which plainly and unequivocally referred to both on-field and off-field activities.

But none of this persuades me for one moment that, as a matter of fact, there was such a mutual mistake.  A somewhat different point was, however, taken by Mr Chaisty, who submitted that these pleaded allegations may give rise to some form of estoppel.

The writer went on to say that he considered this to be particularly important in respect of the proposed term of the contract, namely eight years, and the proposed liquidated damages clause for early termination.  The reference to the “proposed liquidated damages clause” has been inserted in manuscript and it appears in the final version of the letter of advice dated 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2002.

Indeed, though Mr Chaisty did not draw my attention to it, various drafts of the Agreement appear to have had more extensive provisions for termination than finally appeared in clause 7.  One of these drafts specifically provided for termination by either side on one month’s notice in writing. As it happens, it was in the same draft that what later became clause 8 first appeared, though it was so drafted as to apply only in the event that WR or his parents exercised their right to terminate on one month’s notice. </p>

In the case of both the 2002 Agreement and the subsequent Image Rights Representation Agreement, all the relevant terms were set out in writing and the document was signed by all the relevant parties. If they did so under a mistaken belief as to its terms, they have only themselves to blame and must be deemed to have taken the risk that the legal rights and obligations created by the contract might turn out to be somewhat different from those which they had anticipated.  In my judgment, Mr Mill is correct in his submission that, in cases of this kind, the only remedy would be rectification, if the stringent conditions of that remedy could be made out.  Finally, insofar as Stoneygate relies upon an alleged erroneous assumption as to the validity and enforceability of the earlier Agreement as rendering the later Agreement void for mistake, I cannot accept that this would amount to a fundamental assumption which would render impossible the performance of the later contract, as contemplated by the parties to that contract.</p>

But if Stoneygate’s challenge is successful, it will be necessary to consider the consequences of such a finding and, in particular, whether Proactive can nonetheless assert a contractual right in respect of sums which have allegedly already fallen due and whether, in any event, it is entitled to pursue a restitutionary quantum meruit claim. </p>

There will always be certain general categories of contracts as to which it can be said, with some degree of certainty, that the “doctrine” does or does not apply to them.  Positively, there are likely to be certain sensitive areas as to which the law will require in every case the test of reasonableness to be passed: such an area has long been and still is that of contracts between employer and employee as regards the period after the employment has ceased. Negatively, and it is this that concerns us here, there will be types of contract as to which the law should be prepared to say with some confidence that they do not enter into the field of restraint of trade at all. </p>

But the development of the law does seem to show that judges have been able to dispense from the necessity of justification under a public policy test of reasonableness such contracts, or provisions of contracts as, under contemporary conditions may be found to have passed into the accepted and normal currency of commercial or contractual or conveyancing relations.  That such contracts have done so may be taken to show with at least strong prima (<span style="font-style:italic">facie</span>) force that, moulded under the pressures of negotiation, competition and public opinion, they have assumed a form which satisfies the test of public policy as understood by the courts at the time, or, regarding the matter from the point of view of the trade, that the trade in question has assumed such a form that for its health or expansion it requires a degree of regulation.  Absolute exemption for restriction or regulation is never obtained: circumstances, social or economic, may have altered, since they obtained acceptance, in such a way as to call for a fresh examination: there may be some exorbitance or special feature in the individual contract which takes it out of the accepted category: but the court must be persuaded of this before it calls upon the relevant party to justify a contract of this kind.” </p>

The importance of this point is, of course, that in such cases the necessary threshold condition has not been fulfilled so that the party in whose favour the restriction operates is not required to satisfy the court as to its reasonableness.  Furthermore, exclusive supply or agency agreements were amongst the examples given by their Lordships of cases in which the doctrine might not normally apply.  But it nonetheless seems quite clear that no absolute exclusion of such contracts from the ambit of the doctrine was contemplated by the House.  Indeed, in the <span style="font-weight:bold">Esso</span> case itself, the doctrine was held to apply to what was, in effect, an exclusive contract for the purchase of petrol; and it was held that a 21-year tie had not been shown to be reasonable.  </p>

Whether any particular contract of this kind will be held to be in restraint of trade so as to require justification will depend upon a number of factors.  These will include the question whether it is a contract of a kind which has become a common and accepted form of commercial arrangement.

Under the influence of Bentham and of laissez-faire the courts in the 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th-</span>century abandoned the practice of applying public policy against unconscionable bargains to contracts generally, as they had formerly done to any contract considered to be usurious; but the policy survived in its application to penalty clauses and to relief against forfeiture and also to the special category of contracts in restraint of trade.  If one looks at the reasoning of 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>-century judges in cases about contracts in restraint of trade one finds lip service paid to current economic theories, but if one looks at what they said in the light of what they did, one finds that they struck down a bargain if they thought it was unconscionable as between the parties to it and upheld it if they thought that it was not. </p>

In the latter category of cases, where restraints are imposed upon one party, the courts must be astute to ensure that this is not the result of superior bargaining power resulting in an unconscionable bargain. </p>

Leaving aside the initial imbalance arising out of the commercial inexperience of WR and his family and the lack of any independent advice, the particular matters picked out in the pleading relate primarily to the length of the exclusive tie, having regard to the absence of any effective right on Stoneygate’s part to terminate the Agreement prior to the end of the eight-year term.  Reference is also made to the fact that commission was payable at the rate of 20% during the term of the Agreement, and to the right asserted by Proactive to receive post-termination commission at the same rate notwithstanding the cessation of any obligation on its part to provide the contracted services.

Stoneygate was the vehicle through which he had chosen to exploit his image rights; and those rights had been assigned to Stoneygate “on a perpetual exclusive worldwide basis”.  By virtue of the Image Rights Representation Agreement, Stoneygate itself appointed Proactive as its sole and exclusive representative for the purposes of the Services set out in the Agreement; and it agreed that, during the continuance of the Agreement, it would not negotiate or enter into contracts with any other agent or representative or competitor and would direct all enquiries or opportunities in connection with itself or WR to Proactive.  WR, in his turn, similarly agreed not, without Proactive’s prior consent, to negotiate or enter into contracts with any other firms or agents or representatives or persons or any other businesses which might reasonably be regarded as competitors of Proactive or might wish to exploit his intellectual property rights. </p>

As was agreed at the Bar there was no right on his part to determine the Agreement prior to the end of this period, except in certain specific circumstances.  In effect, therefore, unless Proactive was in breach of contract or became insolvent, its exclusive rights would last until February 2011, by which time WR will be 25 years of age.  Even allowing for a long footballing life, therefore, the contract would probably cover about half of his career. </p>

The same flat rate was payable whether Stoneygate’s income from the exploitation of the image rights was £10,000 or £10m.  Indeed, if I had held, as Proactive contends, that it was entitled to post-termination commission, this right to commission might continue for many years after the end of the eight-year period, notwithstanding that Proactive was no longer under any obligation to provide any services under the Image Rights Representation Agreement. </p>

On the contrary, it was unusual in many respects and unique in its duration. If there had been free and equal negotiations, with proper independent legal advice on each side and, it may be, real competition from other prospective agents, I very much doubt if an eight-year contract at a flat rate of commission of 20% would have been the outcome.  It is true that, in contrast to the <span style="font-weight:bold">Schroeder</span> case, there were quite extensive obligations on the part of Proactive which, as I have found, went beyond merely obtaining and negotiating income-producing opportunities. Particular emphasis was placed on the “best endeavours” provision by Mr Stein, in the course of his evidence, and by Mr Mill in his opening and closing submissions.  But a breach of such an obligation might well prove difficult to establish and, as Lord Reid observed in the <span style="font-weight:bold">Schroede</span>r case, it might, in truth, have been “of little use” to WR. </p>

Couchman Harrington, the solicitors who were responsible for drafting the Image Rights Representation Agreement itself, and DLA, who had prepared its 2002 predecessor, were both concerned that the Agreements in question might be regarded as being in restraint of trade and warned Proactive accordingly.  In my judgment, they were right to do so. On the face of it, I am satisfied that the Image Rights Representation Agreement comes within the scope of the doctrine so as to require justification by Proactive. </p>

It is true that it is his footballing skills and attainments which have made possible the exploitation of other commercial opportunities. Indeed, it seems that he still earns significantly more from purely footballing activities than from sponsorship and endorsements.  Mr Mill submits, therefore, that he is able to make a very good living indeed from his primary skills so that, in reality, his earning capacity is not sterilized. </p>

Even in the classic case of post-termination restrictions in a contract of employment, the former employee will not be prevented from earning his living in fields other than those to which the contract relates.  In this case, Proactive’s exclusive rights prevent WR from exploiting a whole range of highly lucrative commercial activities except through the agency of Proactive.  I can see no reason why that restraint should not be subject to the critical appraisal of the court in accordance with the principles to which I have referred. </p>

I do not think, however, that in this particular context, Mr Mill sought to make any real play of the involvement of a limited company.  Indeed, he made a somewhat different point, to the effect that it was simply a re-organisation of the mutual rights and obligations which had been initially embodied in the Agreement of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2002. These are matters on which I will have a little more to say in subsequent paragraphs of this judgment.  But, as I have already noted, restrictions are placed upon WR himself under the Image Rights Representation Agreement; and, in any event, it seems to me that the Court must look at the substance of the arrangements in order to determine whether the effect of the contractual obligations is to impose a restraint which requires justification.

That was a case which Mr George Michael, the international recording artist, performer and songwriter sought a declaration that certain recording agreements made in 1988 were void or unenforceable as being in unreasonable restraint of trade. The 1988 Agreement effectively replaced an earlier Agreement concluded in 1984 as part of a compromise of proceedings to which Mr Michael was a party.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">There was, in fact, no specific allegation on behalf of Stoneygate or WR that the 2002 Agreement was void or unenforceable as being in unreasonable restraint of trade.  Furthermore, the new arrangements entered into in early 2003 were clearly largely modelled on the earlier Agreement, albeit with the interposition of an image rights company between Proactive and the player.  But Proactive’s claim was based upon the 2003 Agreement which was, of course, challenged as being in restraint of trade.  If the point now made by Mr Mill was a fatal objection to this defence, I would have expected it to have been raised by Proactive itself in its Re-Amended Reply.  But it was not. The absence of any positive averment to the contrary in the Defence should be seen in that light. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In any event, I struggle to see how the proceedings would have been conducted in any different way had the point been raised on the pleadings on either side.  As Mr Chaisty observed, all of the arguments marshalled in support of the attack on the 2003 Agreement would seem to apply with equal force to the earlier contract.  I cannot imagine for one moment that any additional lay evidence would have been adduced on such an issue. In particular, it seems highly unlikely that Mr Rodford would have been called as a witness for this purpose. Mr Mill suggested that the earlier contract might well have been treated differently from the later Agreement because WR was six months younger and his potential was somewhat less obvious, so that Proactive would have been taking a significantly greater commercial risk than it took in January 2003. That may be so, but it seems to me that any distinction would be minimal. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">I conclude that I cannot accept Mr Mill’s argument on this point.  It seems to me that it was up to Proactive to raise the issue in its Reply rather than for Stoneygate to preempt it in its Defence.  But, whether or not it should have been pleaded, and on whichever side the burden of doing so lay, I cannot think that the course of the trial would have been altered in any way or that there would have been any significant difference in the application of the doctrine of restraint of trade to the two Agreements.  If it were necessary to do so, I would hold that the earlier Agreement was manifestly in restraint of trade for precisely the same reasons as the later Agreement. </p>

The reason why such a device would not, in my judgment, be effective is because restraint of trade is a matter of public policy out of which the parties cannot contract.

Indeed, even if I had been so constrained, I do not consider that the supposed fact that they had taken such advice would in any way have affected my conclusion that the Agreement was in restraint of trade having regard to the other features of the Agreement to which I have already made reference and, in particular, its length.  Nor do I consider that the confirmation that the terms and conditions of the Agreement were “reasonable” can prevent the Court from determining whether Proactive has, in fact, discharged the burden of showing that the restraints were reasonable.  It might be contended, I suppose, that, at least between the parties such a declaration might eliminate the need for justification of the restraints by reference to the interests of the parties themselves. But even that step in the process is ultimately founded on public policy.  Indeed, the very fact that such a provision was included in the draft Agreement serves to emphasise the doubts which had been expressed to Proactive as to the enforceability of the Agreement and to demonstrate the artificiality of any attempt to rely on such a provision to eliminate that risk.  Accordingly, I reject Mr Mill’s argument that clause 24 suffices to exclude the Image Rights Representation Agreement from the scope of the restraint of trade doctrine. </p>

It is obviously correct that he was appointed as a director of Stoneygate on or before the date when the Image Rights Representation Agreement was executed.  But he was, of course, also a director of Proactive at the time and held that office until a few months before the rift with Proactive.  Furthermore, in the light of my factual findings, he must have been aware of Mr Harrington’s advice that there was a risk that the Agreement might be held to be in restraint of trade. </p>

There are thus two strands in Mr Mill’s argument:  firstly, that Mr Stretford’s knowledge is to be imputed to Stoneygate; secondly, that, by continuing to operate the contract despite that knowledge, Stoneygate has affirmed it. </p>

The case in question was the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-weight:bold">Belmont Finance Corporation Limited -v- Williams Furniture Limited</span> [1979] 1 Ch. 250. That was an interlocutory appeal in a case in which a company claimed that it had been defrauded by a number of its own directors who, acting together, had arranged to buy all the shares in the company immediately after arranging for it to acquire the shares in another company at a substantial overvalue, thereby, it was said, contravening the statutory prohibition on a company providing financial assistance for the purchase of its own shares.  In the course of the action, which was commenced by the liquidators of the company, it was alleged that these arrangements amounted to an unlawful conspiracy on the part of the defendant directors.  At first instance, however, the judge held that the company itself must be deemed to have been a party to the conspiracy and could not, therefore, pursue its claim against the directors by reason of illegality. The Court of Appeal, however, allowed an appeal against this decision. </p>

He was undoubtedly faced with a serious conflict of duty in his capacity as director of Proactive whilst also being a director of Stoneygate.  In the former capacity, it seems to me that he would have been under a duty to retain in confidence the legal advice which had been tendered to Proactive and which was no doubt privileged.  At the same time, he may well have been under a duty to disclose the substance of the advice to the other directors of Stoneygate. But, as a matter of fact, there is no suggestion that he ever made such disclosure to his fellow directors.  Indeed, it seems to me to be fairly plain that, at least until after the FA disciplinary proceedings, his primary loyalty was always to Proactive and that his position as a director of Stoneygate was essentially intended to facilitate the payment of commission by Stoneygate and for other administrative purposes. </p>

Where it would be practically unjust to give a remedy, either because the party has, by his conduct, done that which might fairly be regarded as equivalent to a waiver of it, or where by his conduct and neglect he has, though perhaps not waiving that remedy, yet put the other party in a situation in which it would not be reasonable to place him if the remedy were afterwards to be asserted, in either of these cases, lapse of time and delay are most material.  But in every case, if an argument against relief, which otherwise would be just, is founded upon mere delay, that delay of course not amounting to a bar by any statute of limitations, the validity of that defence must be tried upon principles substantially equitable.  Two circumstances, always important in such cases, are the length of the delay and the nature of the acts done during the interval, which might affect either party and cause a balance of justice or injustice in taking the one course or the other, so far as relates to the remedy.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.00in">Affirmation generally appears in a pleading as a defence to a claim that a contract has been discharged by breach, that is to say in cases where the plaintiff is faced with a choice between either (a) accepting the defendant’s breach of contract as a repudiation and treating the contract as discharged on that ground, or (b) allowing the contract to continue.  However, I can see no distinction in principle between on the one hand a case in which a contracting party is faced with a choice whether or not to bring the contract to an end by accepting the other party’s breach as a repudiation, and on the other hand a case in which a contracting party is faced with a choice whether or not to bring the contract to an end by claiming that it is unenforceable.  If affirmation is available as a defence in the former case, I can see no reason in principle why as a general rule it should not be available also in the latter. </p>

That being so, I can see no reason in principle why special defences arising from the surrounding circumstances - what I may describe as <span style="font-style:italic">in personam </span>defences - should not run in such cases against a restraint of trade claim.

The Defendant was a rock musician who was, unhappily, a drug addict as well as being dyslexic.  In 1994, the Plaintiffs instructed their solicitor to draw up a management agreement between themselves and the Defendant.  For his part, the Defendant being unable or unwilling to concentrate on paperwork, instructed a solicitor to act on his behalf.  A draft agreement was prepared and the Defendant’s solicitor proposed a number of significant amendments which were not, however, accepted on behalf of the Plaintiffs.  Notwithstanding these exchanges, one of the Plaintiffs persuaded the Defendant to sign the Agreement, at a time, it would seem, when the Defendant was under the influence of cannabis, without any reference to the proposed amendments or any explanation as to the contents of the agreement. </p>

Thereafter, he and the Plaintiffs worked hard together to foster the Defendant’s career and, indeed, when a dispute first arose the solicitor sought to rely upon and deploy the management agreement on his client’s behalf.

Indeed, I note that the decision does not appear to feature in the current edition of Chitty on Contracts.  The learned judge, therefore, had to determine the point as a matter of general principle.  He did so by analogy with the rule that a party to a contract who has a right to treat the contract as discharged by reason of a repudiatory breach by another party may nonetheless elect to affirm the contract.

Even then, contractual rights and obligations arising prior to discharge remain valid and enforceable, though the parties are released from further performance and the primary obligations of the party in breach which remain unperformed are replaced by a secondary obligation to pay damages to the innocent party.  By contrast, a contract in restraint of trade is unenforceable from the outset.  The parties may, of course, choose to honour their engagements; and if they do so, the courts will not intervene. For my part, I cannot see how any right of election can arise in such a case requiring a party to choose in some way between treating the contract as subsisting (which it is not) and treating it as having come to an end.  In my judgment, the two situations are quite distinct and the analogy is, with the greatest respect, contrary to orthodox principle. </p>

I recognise, of course, that, in a sense, a party to such a contract may have to decide, at some stage, whether to take the point that the contract is unenforceable.  But, if a failure to take such a point, once a party knew it might be available to him, meant that he could not thereafter do so, it would wholly undermine the public policy basis of the restraint of trade doctrine. </p>

Would that mean that the court could not entertain a subsequent challenge to the restraints on the part of the employee?  For my part, I think not.

Once a party becomes aware of his right to treat himself as discharged by another party’s repudiatory breach of contract, he must elect whether to accept the repudiation, though he will normally have a reasonable time in which to make up his mind.  If he fails to do so and takes any step inconsistent with his right to treat himself as discharged, he will be held to have affirmed the contract and to have lost his right to treat himself as discharged.  The comparative strictness of this principle is quite different from the considerations which are likely to arise when the court has to determine whether a party to a contract in restraint of trade may be estopped from asserting such a point in the way contemplated by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-weight:bold">Nicholl -v- Ryder</span> [2000] EMLR 632.

But in my judgment, the risk was minimal in view of the player’s extraordinary potential and the arrangements which were already in place with Everton FC.  The point can be well demonstrated by the fact that substantial sponsorship contracts were obtained within a matter of months after the Image Rights Representation Agreement came into effect. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The second factor was the further substantial investment in terms of money and resources arising out of Proactive’s obligation to use its best endeavours to represent Stoneygate in all aspects of image rights exploitation.  This is, of course, based upon the provisions of clause 3.1 of the Agreement. Whilst I accept that a best endeavours provision of this kind is, at least in theory, significantly more onerous than one limited solely to reasonable endeavours, like Lord Reid in <span style="font-weight:bold">A. Schroeder Music Publishing Co Limited -v- McCauley</span> [1974] 1 WLR 1308 at 1313, I doubt if it would have been of any real benefit in practice.  If WR’s career came to an early end, through injury or otherwise, or if, contrary to all expectations, he never came anywhere near fulfilling his apparent potential, I simply do not see that a contractual provision of this kind would require Proactive to chase illusory prospects or incur any significant expense.  If he turned out to be a failure, it is unlikely that they could have done anything for him, no matter how hard they might have tried.  On the other hand, if he fulfilled his potential, it would be in Proactive’s commercial interests to do its best for him. In my judgment, in commercial reality, the best endeavours clause would provide little, if any, additional burden upon Proactive or any significant additional benefit to Stoneygate or the player himself. </p>

As I observed in the course of my analysis of the expert evidence, it is very far from obvious that it is reasonable to expect a player such as WR to subsidise marketing efforts on behalf of other, less successful, players. But, assuming nonetheless that this is a relevant factor, I simply have no evidential basis upon which I can judge its reasonableness in the instant case.  I do not know whether a significant number of the players on Proactive’s books are unsuccessful; nor do I know its overall rate of gross return or its profitability across its entire book. I am simply not persuaded that, at least in the circumstances of the present case, an eight-year term could be justified by reference to this particular factor. </p>

As I have previously indicated, I accept that the proper development of a player’s brand, particularly perhaps in the case of a very young player, requires a strategic approach rather than one based purely on short-term considerations.  For those reasons, I accept that it is likely to be in the interests of both agent and player for an agency agreement to extend for a sufficient period to allow proper strategic planning and to help prevent the player from being de-stabilised by offers or inducements from individuals or companies who were somewhat disparagingly referred to during the course of evidence as “predatory” agents. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">But the burden lies upon Proactive to demonstrate that considerations of this kind are sufficient to justify the very lengthy - indeed, apparently unique - period of exclusivity provided for in this case.  I would have little difficulty in accepting that a two-year tie, running in synchrony with an on-field agency agreement, would be entirely reasonable, provided, no doubt, that the agreement did not contain any other particularly onerous terms.  Indeed, I might well have been persuaded that a four or even a five-year term might be regarded as reasonable.  That appears to have been the sort of timescale initially envisaged within Proactive for the development of the brand; and it may be the case that, as Mr Stein suggested, a practice may be emerging under which terms of this length are becoming more common.  But I can see no justification on this ground for an exclusive tie lasting for a full eight years.  So the point does not, in my judgment, provide any form of escape-hatch for Proactive. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The fifth point pleaded at paragraph 11(3) of the Re-Amended Reply is that, as a matter of commercial reality, if Stoneygate or WR wished to bring the Agreement to a premature end, this would occur only if another agent was willing to buy out Proactive’s rights, thereby, in effect, providing WR with an exit mechanism.  This, of course, is a matter which I have considered in some detail in connection with the expert evidence.  Proactive could not compel Stoneygate or WR to adhere to the terms of the Image Rights Representation Agreement, whether by injunction or otherwise.  But, in the event of a repudiatory breach of contract, Proactive would have a right to damages.  As I have previously explained, those damages would be substantial, assuming, of course, that the Agreement was not unenforceable as being in unreasonable restraint of trade.

For my part, however, I am quite unable to see how this can convert a contract which is, ex hypothesi, in unreasonable restraint of trade into one which is reasonable.  The respective rights of the parties would still fall to be determined by reference to an exclusive tie which is, in my judgment, in restraint of trade.  Even if, contrary to the common position adopted by all parties at trial, clause 8 conferred an effective right of termination, the cost to Stoneygate of exercising any such rights would have been very substantial and would have acted as a serious disincentive against the exercise of any such option. In the circumstances, therefore, I do not find that this is a factor which can suffice to justify the length of the tie. </p>

If any such damage were to be sustained, it would, in my judgment, be entirely self-inflicted by reason of Proactive’s own decision to seek and obtain and Agreement for a term of eight years. </p>

But, as I have also previously noted, given the length of the tie of this case, the lack of any cap on commission does, in my judgment, add to the onerousness of the tie.  It is true that the absence of any taper or cap on the commission payable to Proactive was not specifically pleaded by Stoneygate. But the Re-Re-Amended Defence at paragraph 37(a), specifically relied upon the fact that commission at the rate of 20% was payable throughout the term; and Mr Chaisty did, of course, cross-examine Mr Stein in some detail on the point. In the circumstances, I do not consider that Proactive has, in fact, shown that commission at a level rate of 20% throughout the eight-year term was reasonable, even though the particular line of attack adopted at trial was not specifically flagged up in Stoneygate’s pleadings. </p>

Whether or not it could have been anticipated that such contracts would be as long as they have ultimately turned out to be, I consider that it must have been within the contemplation of the parties that, if the agency was successful, Proactive would have taken a substantial slice of the available cake by the time the Agreement came to an end, leaving only what remained for any new agent.  That would also tend to restrict the freedom of Mr Rooney and Stoneygate to move to a new agent, whether the Image Rights Representation Agreement with Proactive had run its full term or came to end prematurely.  But it is a factor which is inherent in agency relationships of this kind and it is material only insofar as it adds to the onerousness of a long-term agreement of the kind with which I am concerned. </p>

These expressions need to be handled with great care.  Agreements can be vitiated and struck down by the law for widely differing reasons, and questions regarding them arise in widely differing circumstances.  An agreement to commit a murder is unlawful.  The same may be said of an agreement unreasonably restricting the activities of a former employee who wishes to set up a competing business.

The agreement does not give rise to legally-binding obligations, and in that sense it is void.  But in this context, and whatever may be the position regarding contracts of which the law disapproves for other reasons, being void does not mean that the agreement will be disregarded for all purposes and that the law will proceed as though there never had been an agreement between the parties.  On the contrary, the law will countenance the existence of such an agreement.  If the parties wish to implement it, they are at liberty to do so.  They would not be acting illegally or unlawfully.

He did so by deploying the concept of accrued rights. He submitted that since the parties had voluntarily performed the contract up until the end of October 2008 or thereabouts, Proactive had become entitled to commission on all third party contracts which it had secured for Stoneygate prior to that date, even if the sums in question would only have fallen due subsequently. </p>

That was a case in which a builder had entered into an oral contract with his client which was unenforceable by reason of a statutory requirement that any such contract should be in writing.  The majority of the High Court held that he was nonetheless entitled to a restitutionary remedy based upon the acceptance by the client of the benefits afforded by the performance of the contractual services.  The judgments are lengthy and learned, involving a detailed analysis of the old common law system of pleading.  Though it is unnecessary, I think, to cite from the report at length in order to illustrate the core principles accepted and applied by the Court, it may be helpful to refer to two particular passages, since they may cast some light on certain points canvassed in the present proceedings.

So, if all the plaintiff had to prove was that he had fully executed the contract on his part and that he had not been paid the contract price, there would be some force in the suggestion that the proceeding amounted to an indirect enforcement of the contractual cause of action. However, when success in a <span style="font-style:italic">quantum meruit</span> depends, not only on the plaintiff proving that he did the work, but also on the defendant’s acceptance of the work without paying the agreed remuneration, it is evident that the court is enforcing against the defendant an obligation that differs in character from the contractual obligation had it been enforceable.” </p>

What the concept of monetary restitution involves is the payment of an amount which constitutes, in all the relevant circumstances, fair and just compensation for the benefit or “enrichment” actually or constructively accepted.  Ordinarily, that will correspond to the fair value of the benefit provided (e.g. remuneration calculated at a reasonable rate for work actually done or the fair market value of materials supplied).  In some categories of case, however, it would be to affront rather than satisfy the requirements of good conscience and justice which inspire the concept or principle of restitution or unjust enrichment to determine what constitutes fair and just compensation for a benefit accepted by reference only to what would represent a fair remuneration for the work involved or a fair market value of materials supplied.  One such category of case is that in which unsolicited but subsequently accepted work is done in improving property in circumstances where remuneration for the unsolicited work calculated at what was a reasonable rate would far exceed the enhanced value of the property.  More relevant for present purposes is the special category of case where restitution is sought by one party for work which he has executed under a contract which has become unenforceable by reason of his failure to comply with the requirements of a statutory provision which was enacted to protect the other party.  In that category of case, it would be contrary to the general notions of restitution or unjust enrichment if what constituted fair and just compensation for the benefit accepted by the other party were to be ascertained without regard to any identifiable real detriment sustained by that other party by reason of the failure of the first party to ensure that the requirements of the statutory provision were satisfied.” </p>

The facts of that case were complex and, I think, largely immaterial for present purposes.  It appears that Mr Benedetti’s primary claim was to enforce his rights under an agreement and that the claim on a quantum meruit basis arose only if he failed to do so.  The judge dealt with the quantum meruit claim at paragraphs 527-575 of his judgment. The particular point for which Mr Mill cited the judgment is because of the weight which the judge considered that it was appropriate to place on the parties’ own valuation of the services in respect of which the claim was advanced.  After stating succinctly that the court’s task was to put a value on these services which he had performed, the judge continued as follows at paragraph 528: </p>

But regard must also be had to any prior negotiations or agreement between the parties which indicate that they put a particular value on the services in question.  This may be the best evidence of what constitutes reasonable remuneration for the services rendered and, as a matter of principle, there is some judicial support for the view that the price agreed should be the ceiling for any award.” </p>

But, as Mr Chaisty, in his turn, emphasised, the judge appeared to draw a distinction between cases in which the agreement which it was sought to use as a yardstick for measuring the value of the services had been ineffective and those in which it had, in effect, been abandoned. The relevant passage appears at paragraphs 533 and 534 which read as follows: </p>

It is, however, important to note that these are all cases where the agreement between the parties could not be enforced either because it failed to attain the degree of certainty and finality necessary to create a binding contract (<span style="font-style:italic">Way -v- Latilla)</span>; or because of some formal defect (<span style="font-style:italic">Scarisbrick -v- Parkinson</span>); or due to some supervening event (<span style="font-style:italic">B.P.

But for these problems, the agreements would have been enforceable between the parties according to their terms and it is not difficult to see why, in these circumstances, the value placed upon the services by the parties themselves should be given great weight in any determination by the court of the value which should be attributed to the arrangements between those same parties. 534. But in a case where the evidence shows that the contract or agreement was abandoned as the basis of the parties’ dealings then the reasoning in <span style="font-style:italic">Way v- Latilla</span> ceases to apply.  If the correct view is that the parties ceased to regard the original contract price as an appropriate value for the services then there is no justification for the court imposing it as a measure of value unless it can be justified by other evidence as the market value of the services at the time when they were performed.  There is a clear difference between an ineffective agreement and one which the parties have effectively jettisoned.” </p>

Underlying the approach urged upon me by Mr Mill is the assumption that the contractual rate of remuneration represents the best evidence as to the value which the parties themselves had placed upon the services in question. But, in this particular case, I do not think that that is necessarily a fair inference or assumption.  As I have pointed out before, WR and his family were utterly inexperienced in matters of this kind and received no independent legal advice when the Image Rights Representation Agreement, or its predecessor, was entered into. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">It is true that the evidence shows that commission at a rate of 20% is widespread in the marketplace.  Perhaps Mr Mill’s best point is that WR and Stoneygate appear to have entered into a new agreement with Mr Stretford and his company, Triple S, on the basis of remuneration at that same rate.  But, as I have already pointed out, if Stoneygate and WR had received proper, informed legal advice before they entered into the Image Rights Representation Agreement, I would have thought there would have been a strong case for inferring that they would have negotiated a reduction in the level of remuneration once certain income thresholds had been reached, even if they had still been willing to enter into a long-term arrangement.  Furthermore, whatever his relationship with Mr Stretford, it seems to me that, if he had been free to re-negotiate the terms of any agency contract in the latter part of 2008, his bargaining power would have allowed him to drive down the level of any remuneration payable by Stoneygate to a new agent. </p>

Indeed, at the outset of his cross-examination by Mr Chaisty, Mr Stein very fairly stated that he did not regard it as having been within his remit to address any of the factual issues to which the court might have to have regard in determining the amount of any quantum meruit.  Yet further, there are other aspects of the quantum meruit claims which the parties have not yet had an opportunity to argue fully at least in this particular context. Thus, I have already held that, even if the Image Rights Representation Agreement had been entirely valid and enforceable, Proactive would not have been entitled to post-termination commission, though it would have been entitled to compensation or damages for the loss of the opportunity to earn commission up to the end of the eight-year term.

He held, however, that, since the work was carried out in anticipation of a binding agreement, the party who made the request for it to be carried out would be under an obligation of a restitutionary nature to pay a reasonable sum for the work in question. </p>

The Claimant asserted that it was entitled to a longer period of notice and commenced proceedings seeking appropriate relief on the basis of both contract and estoppel.

At paragraphs 17 to 21, he analysed the authorities as to the circumstances in which a contract might be implied from conduct and concluded that the judge did not apply the wrong test. He then turned to consider the facts and expressed the view that the real question in the case before him was whether the obligations arising from the alleged implied contract would be sufficiently certain to be contractually enforceable.  After analysing the authorities, at paragraph 30, he concluded that the alleged obligation on the part of Marks &amp; Spencer to acquire garments from Baird was insufficiently certain to found any contractual obligation “because there are no objective criteria by which the court could assess what would be reasonable either as to quantity or price.” </p>

The judge at first instance held that no such long-term contract had in fact been entered into but that the parties had by conduct concluded an interim contract terminable on six months’ notice. The decision that there was no long-term contract was upheld by the Court of Appeal; but the judge’s decision on the interim contract was overruled, it being held that the proper conclusion was that there was no contract whatever between the parties. The Court of Appeal rejected an argument pressed, in fact, by Mr Chaisty, that such an interim contract could be implied from conduct, since it was not necessary to do so.

The passages demonstrate the following matters of relevance to the analysis required in this case.  First, while parties are negotiating a contract under which they will, if the contract is concluded, enter into reciprocal obligations binding each other as to future performance, it is highly unlikely that by conduct they will conclude in the interim an executory contract containing terms still the subject of negotiation [see 510b-f].  Second it is more likely that they will have entered into what Goff J. refers to as an “if” contract i.e. a contract under which if one party supplies, the other agrees to pay a reasonable remuneration. Third even an “if” contract will not have been entered into if important terms such as those relating to standard of performance are still under negotiation, and in such cases the proper answer is no contract but a restitutionary remedy to the extent that one party has been unjustly enriched [see page 511]. </p>

In some measure, any problem of certainty in the present case may simply reflect a lack of satisfactory evidence.  But it seems to me that an implied agreement by which Proactive was to provide Speed and Mrs Rooney with services similar to those it provided to Stoneygate and WR in return for commission at the rate of 20% is a perfectly workable commercial arrangement, even if it is not possible to determine the precise scope of those services on the evidence presently available. From an objective standpoint, it seems to me that they must be regarded as having agreed at least these essential terms. </p>

Insofar as Proactive relies on any other contractual rights against Speed, it has failed to establish any such terms.  Thus, I cannot think that it would be right to imply any term or terms as to exclusivity, still less any provision for an eight-year term.  But that can have no bearing on the claims asserted in this action, since Mr Mill made it plain that Proactive did not seek to recover damages for any alleged breach of contract by Speed or Mrs Rooney; and, of course, Mr Chaisty did not seek to attack any such contract on the grounds that it was in unreasonable restraint of trade. </p>

But Proactive has failed to satisfy me that it is necessary or appropriate to imply any term which would entitle it to commission on income recoverable by Speed after the relationship between the parties had come to an end, even if that income was derived from contracts negotiated or procured by Proactive during the subsistence of the relationship.  Even if the proper analysis were that Proactive, Speed and Mrs Rooney intended to adopt all the terms of the Image Rights Representation Agreement between Proactive and Stoneygate insofar as they related to remuneration, there would be no right to post-termination commission in the light of the conclusion I have reached as to the true construction of that agreement.  Proactive’s right to remuneration would, therefore, come to an end when it ceased to provide any services for Speed and Mrs Rooney. </p>

The question would then arise, of course, as to whether this could properly be assessed by reference to a commission of 20% on income received or receivable by Speed.  Obviously, some weight must be given to the fact that, throughout their mutual dealings, Proactive, Speed and Mrs Rooney appear to have accepted that a commission at the rate of 20% on income received or receivable by Speed was appropriate.  Furthermore, not all of the countervailing factors would apply in her case as might be material in the case of her husband and which might tend to reduce the level of remuneration which might be considered to be reasonable. </p>

Furthermore, the value added tax element in the invoices was apparently always paid without demur by both Stoneygate and Speed.  It is a matter of some regret that this is now the subject of a challenge by Stoneygate which alleges that Proactive was not entitled to charge value added tax on top of its commission, at least in relation to the sums payable by the three main sponsors, and that this element in the invoices was paid by Stoneygate to Speed under a mistaken belief that it was liable to do so.  Accordingly, it now counterclaims for repayment of the amounts in question. </p>

Furthermore, though I invited Mr Chaisty to provide further written submissions, if he felt it appropriate to do so, as to the statutory framework governing the charge to value added tax and any relevant case law on the topic, none were, in fact, received.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">I start from the premise that both Proactive and, it would seem, Stoneygate were registered for value added tax. The supply of services by Proactive to Stoneygate within the United Kingdom would inevitably, as it seems to me, constitute a chargeable supply for the purposes of the Value Added Tax Act 1994, so that Proactive would be obliged to charge value added tax on that supply pursuant to section 4 of the Act and would have to provide a VAT invoice to Stoneygate and account for the amount of the tax to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs.  Whether the tax chargeable is to be added to the consideration payable in respect of the taxable supply, or whether the tax is to be treated as part of the total consideration, is essentially a matter of contract between the parties. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In this particular case, as I have pointed out, there does not appear to be any challenge to the proposition that Proactive was, in general, entitled to add value added tax to the substantive amount of the commission in respect of which invoices were raised.  That entirely accords with the consistent practice of the parties.  So far as I am aware, there was never any challenge to the addition of value added tax in this way until the Defence and Counterclaim were served in the present proceedings.  In any event, at least as between two parties both of which were apparently registered for value added tax, I would have thought that a term to that effect would readily be implied. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">On the basis of this analysis, it seems to me that the question whether value added tax was chargeable or charged by Stoneygate on monies payable by the sponsors is wholly irrelevant to the separate question as to whether Proactive was obliged to charge value added tax on the services supplied to Stoneygate and entitled to add the appropriate amount to its own invoices to Stoneygate.  Once the question is formulated in this way, it seems to me to be quite clear that value added tax was chargeable on those services and that Proactive was entitled to add the amount to the contractual consideration set out in its invoices.  It is unnecessary, in the circumstances, to speculate as to the reasons why Stoneygate may not have charged value added tax on its own invoices to the three major sponsors in question, still less as to whether this was correct or incorrect. </p>

By the same token, therefore, Stoneygate cannot recover any amounts which it has paid on account of value added tax to Proactive.  Its counterclaim for repayment must, therefore, be dismissed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">But, in any event, it seems to me that the simple answer is that given by Mr Page in his principal witness statement where he points out that the invoice to Stoneygate would have been raised on the same occasion as the invoice raised by the same team in respect of the sum due from Plum Pictures.  As I have already held, the Image Rights Representation Agreement does not provide for payment of commission on a “pay when paid” basis.  Strictly, if the contract had been enforceable, Proactive would have been entitled to its commission when the third party payment was itself due and payable. In the absence of any more detailed evidence on the point, it seems to me that the proper inference is that the sum in question was payable by or on behalf of Plum Pictures on the date of the invoice, well before the commencement of this action on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December 2008. But, even if it was not, I can see no sufficient justification in principle for disallowing the claim for a payment of a recurrent nature because it may have fallen due after the commencement of the action.  Accordingly, if I had found that Proactive was entitled to enforce the rights conferred upon it by the Image Rights Representation Agreement, I would have held that this sum would have been recoverable. </p>

On its face, the invoice states that this was a fee which had been agreed with WR. Nonetheless, in its Re-Re-Amended Defence, the claim is met by a simple denial that any such accountancy services had been provided. According to Mr Page, Stoneygate’s accounts were initially prepared by Powrie Appleby but, at some stage, it was decided to deal with the accounts for both Stoneygate and Speed on an “in house” basis, after which Proactive itself became responsible for the preparation of accounts and various ancillary services, such as sales and cash management.  Furthermore, Mr Page stated that he had been told by Mr Stretford that he had agreed with WR that Stoneygate would pay £5,000 a year for these accountancy services.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Furthermore, it seems fairly clear that services of this kind fell outside the scope of those which Proactive was obliged to provide under the Image Rights Representation Agreement dated 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003. Indeed, this was the subject of the specific proviso at clause 6.3 which found its way into the Agreement as finally signed by all parties. But it is unnecessary to consider this particular provision in any more detail, as I am satisfied on the evidence that there was, indeed, a separate agreement for the payment by Stoneygate of an annual fee of £5,000 to Proactive in return for the provision of these services.  That finding is material, since it means that Proactive does not have to rely upon an unenforceable contract in order to recover the sum in question. I conclude, therefore, that Proactive is entitled to recover the sum of £5,000 plus value added tax from Stoneygate under this invoice. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Invoice 18284</span>: this is an invoice dated 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> November 2008 in respect of commission due on a gross sum of €150,000 payable to Stoneygate by Electronic Arts.  The commission of €30,000 was converted at the time of the invoice into a sterling equivalent of £23,737.94, to which value added tax of £4,154.14 was added, bringing the total to £27,892.08. The only point specifically pleaded in relation to this invoice in the Re-Re-Amended Defence is that Proactive was not entitled to charge value added tax on top of the commission.  That of course is a matter which I have already dealt with and resolved in Proactive’s favour. But, in view of a point taken elsewhere, there may be a suggestion that an incorrect exchange rate was chosen.  If that is indeed the case, the simple answer would surely have been that Proactive would have been entitled to judgment in euros, if it so chose, or the sterling equivalent at the time of judgment or enforcement if, contrary to my findings, it had been entitled to enforce its rights under the Image Rights Representation Agreement.  But, in any event, I see no reason why Proactive would not have been entitled to the amount in euros as shown on the face of the invoice. As Mr Page explained in his principal witness statement, the conversion rate would have been taken by one of Proactive’s account team from a suitable website as at the date when the invoice was raised. </p>

In the Re-Re-Amended Defence, it is alleged that Speed did not provide any relevant contribution in July 2008 so that no payment was due to it from Emap.  Once again, as Mr Page pointed out, the invoice would have been raised on the same occasion as an invoice to Emap in the sum of £5,000.  Apart from that, there is simply no evidence on the issue.  Indeed, it will be recalled that Mrs Rooney herself did not choose to give evidence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The evidential position is wholly unsatisfactory.  The question is whether Proactive has done enough to discharge the burden of proof on this particular issue.  In the circumstances, I am just prepared to hold that it has managed to do so.  At the time when the invoice was raised, the same accounting team would still have been working for both Proactive and Speed. They would have had sufficient information available to them to know whether any payment was due from Emap.  Accepting, as I do, Mr Page’s evidence that an invoice to Emap would have been raised at the same time as the corresponding commission invoice to Speed, I think that the issue of the invoice to Emap is just enough to justify the inference that it related to a sum which was, in fact, due. If necessary, I would be prepared to draw an adverse inference in support of this conclusion from the unexplained failure of Mrs Rooney herself to give evidence. </p>

On its face, it states that this was in accordance with an agreement between Proactive and Miss McLoughlin as Mrs Rooney was at the time.  The only point taken in relation to this invoice is that the accountancy services in question were never in fact performed. It is on that basis, and on that basis alone, that it is denied that the amount claimed is not due and payable.  According to Mr Page, the arrangements for provision of accountancy services to Speed were precisely the same as those agreed in relation to Stoneygate. I see no reason why I should not accept that evidence; and I have no hesitation in rejecting Mr Stretford’s evidence that no such services were, in fact, provided. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The only real question is whether, as in the case of Stoneygate, there is sufficient evidence of an actual agreement between Proactive and Speed for the payment of an annual fee of £5,000 in respect of those services.  Once again, the evidence is tenuous in the extreme.  But, as in the case of Stoneygate, the invoice, on its face, refers to an agreement with Mrs Rooney; and there is no evidence or suggestion that this was ever challenged. On that admittedly flimsy foundation, I am prepared to infer that there was such an agreement for the payment of an annual fee; and, once again, I derive some support from the adverse inference which I feel it is appropriate to draw from the fact that Mrs Rooney did not herself give evidence at the trial.  As in the case of Stoneygate, this seems to be to be an entirely separate matter from the generality of the services which appear to have been provided by Proactive to Speed.  Accordingly, I conclude that Proactive is entitled to judgment against Speed for the amount of this invoice plus value added tax quite separately from the outcome of its claim for commission. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Proactive’s case is that this is simply incorrect.

The first of these is to be paid on or before 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> August “in each calendar year of the Term” and the second on or before 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March in each calendar year. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">It is submitted on behalf of Proactive that, having regard to the definition in clause 3, “calendar year” in this context must mean the year from 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> August to 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July, so that the first instalment is payable on or before 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> August and the second on or before the following 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March. That, of course, accords with the order in which clause 5 provides for payment.  Accordingly, the first instalment of the year ending immediately prior to 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> August 2010 would have fallen due on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> August 2009. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">That argument seems to me to be entirely correct; and, consistently with this analysis, the invoice itself refers to the first instalment for year 4 of the Coca Cola contract.  There is no suggestion that the contract in question has not been carried out in accordance with its terms.  Accordingly, in my judgment, if I had found that Proactive was entitled to enforce its contractual rights under the Image Rights Representation Agreement, I would have found that it would have been entitled to judgment for the amount claimed under this invoice. </p>

It is in the sum of €30,000 together with value added tax of €4,500. But in the Re-Re-Amended Defence no admission is made to the appropriate conversion rate.  As I have previously noted, it was Mr Page’s evidence that this conversion rate would have been taken from an appropriate website as at the date upon which the invoice was raised on Electronic Arts itself in respect of the substantive payment on which commission was claimed.  That was not challenged and I see no reason why Proactive should not be entitled to claim on the basis of the conversion rate prevailing at that time.  The alternative, as I have previously observed, is that Proactive would be entitled to judgment in euros or the sterling equivalent at the time of judgment or execution.

That was supported by a letter from Harper Collins which was not challenged by Mr Mill on behalf of Proactive.  Accordingly, he limited Proactive’s claim for relief to a declaration that it is entitled to payment if and when any sum becomes payable to Speed under the relevant contract with Harper Collins.  But, for reasons which I have already set out, I do not consider that Proactive would be entitled to commission on any such payment and I decline to make any declaration to that effect. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Despite the length of this judgment, I can summarise my conclusions quite briefly.  The Image Rights Representation Agreement dated 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003 is not void for mistake but is unenforceable by Proactive as being in unreasonable restraint of trade.  Proactive cannot, therefore, recover, as a matter of contract, any sums which remain unpaid but which would otherwise have fallen due to it under the terms of the agreement had it not been unenforceable.  Nor can it recover any further commission in respect of income receivable in the future by Stoneygate under contracts procured by Proactive or pursue any claim for damages for breach of the Image Rights Representation Agreement. It is, however, entitled to a restitutionary remedy in respect of those services which it has provided to Stoneygate and in respect of which it has not yet received any remuneration.  That must be the subject of an assessment at a later stage in respect of which I will give directions in due course. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Even if I had found that the Image Rights Representation Agreement was valid and enforceable, I would have held that Proactive’s claim for commission was limited to those sums which had already fallen due at the time when the relationship between the parties broke down at the end of October 2008. In respect of the subsequent period prior to its acceptance of Stoneygate’s repudiatory breach of contract on or about 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span> December 2009, Proactive would have been entitled to compensation or damages to be assessed in accordance with the principles laid down in <span style="font-weight:bold">Roberts -v- Elwells Engineers Ltd</span> [1972] 2 QB 586. Thereafter, it would have been entitled to recover damages in respect of the loss sustained as a result of the premature determination of the Agreement. But on what I consider to be the true construction of this particular contract, it would have had no right to commission on sums receivable by Stoneygate from third parties after the expiration of the eight-year term; and any claim for commission in respect of sums receivable prior to that date, but after the breakdown in relations between the parties, would have formed part of its claim for compensation and damages and would have had to be taken into account in the assessment of the appropriate sums. </p>
