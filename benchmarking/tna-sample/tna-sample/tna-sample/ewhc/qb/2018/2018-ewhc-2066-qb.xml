In a short statement dated 20 October 1952, but not for publication before 00:30 hours BST on 21 October 1952, the Colonial Office Information Department said: </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">“A state of emergency was declared in Kenya tonight (Monday, October 20, 1952) throughout the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya. This action has been taken to enable the police to detain the persons believed to have been mainly responsible for organising disorder and lawlessness in the Colony during recent months. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Whereas previously Mau Mau perpetrated their crimes at night and by stealth, the situation became progressively worse during September and early October. The assassination of one of the most revered African chiefs, Senior Chief Waruhiu, on the High Road – in broad daylight – shows the length to which the Mau Mau are prepared to go to carry their campaign of terrorism. It became obvious that action must be taken to detain the persons who are behind this organisation but the measures could not be put into operation until adequate forces were available to maintain law and order and to discourage outbreaks of violence by Mau Mau supporters. The timing of the operation was therefore arranged to coincide with the arrival of troops (from the Middle East and from Uganda and Tanganyika). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On 12 January 1960 the State of Emergency ended. Two constitutional conferences took place in London in 1960 and 1962 and, after elections leading to Jomo Kenyatta being invested as Kenya’s first Prime Minister on 1 June 1963, Kenya became independent from Britain as a constitutional monarchy on 12 December 1963. On 12 December 1964 Kenya became a republic with Jomo Kenyatta as the first President.</p>

They could not all be sent back to Nairobi because that would negate the point of the exercise.  They could not be sent back to the reserves because there were too many of them, and the loyalists in the reserves understandably objected that it did not help to transfer the problem from Nairobi to the reserves.  </p>

		<p class="FootnoteText" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.10in">with Sir Frank Kitson. He was a Military Intelligence Officer (MIO) during the Emergency. At para 7 of the attendance note it says: “if the MIOs were given a prisoner we could talk to them, if we wanted to keep them we would need to get authority to do so and if not they would be handed to CID. FK saying he was not interested in what crimes prisoners may have committed, FK saying he was interested purely in the intelligence angle e.g. who was in what gangs and where were these gangs and what were their intentions”.</p>

	      </authorialNote> the learned Judge refused the Defendant’s application to strike out the claim on the basis that no claim could properly be brought against the UK government.  Of course, the procedural principles governing striking out a case are very different from deciding an issue at trial.  This point is still a live one in the present proceedings and I have heard evidence and some argument upon it.  It is not yet to be determined, and will fall for consideration when I hear final submissions on generic issues.

The only matter before the court was whether the discretion under Section 33 of the Limitation Act 1980 should be exercised in the Claimants’ favour.

	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="MediumShading1-Accent31" style="margin-left:1.00in">During the Emergency Period widespread violence was committed by both sides, and most of the victims were Kenyan. Many thousands of Mau Mau members were killed, while the Mau Mau themselves were responsible for the deaths of over 2,000 people including 200 casualties among the British regiments and police.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="MediumShading1-Accent31" style="margin-left:1.00in">Emergency regulations were introduced: political organisations were banned; prohibited areas were created and provisions for detention without trial were enacted. The colonial authorities made unprecedented use of capital punishment and sanctioned harsh prison so-called ‘rehabilitation’ regimes. Many of those detained were never tried and the links of many with the Mau Mau were never proven. There was recognition at the time of the brutality of these repressive measures and the shocking level of violence, including an important debate in this House on the infamous events at Hola Camp in 1959.</p>

	    <p class="MediumShading1-Accent31" style="margin-left:1.00in">However I would like to make clear now and for the first time, on behalf of Her Majesty’s Government, that we understand the pain and grievance felt by those who were involved in the events of the Emergency in Kenya. The British Government recognises that Kenyans were subject to torture and other forms of ill treatment at the hands of the colonial administration. The British government sincerely regrets that these abuses took place, and that they marred Kenya’s progress towards independence. Torture and ill treatment are abhorrent violations of human dignity which we unreservedly condemn.</p>

The Government will also support the construction of a memorial in Nairobi to the victims of torture and ill-treatment during the colonial era. The memorial will stand alongside others that are already being established in Kenya as the country continues to heal the wounds of the past.

We do not believe that claims relating to events that occurred overseas outside direct British jurisdiction more than fifty years ago can be resolved satisfactorily through the courts without the testimony of key witnesses that is no longer available. It is therefore right that the Government has defended the case to this point since 2009.</p>

	    <p class="MediumShading1-Accent31" style="margin-left:1.00in">The settlement I am announcing today is part of a process of reconciliation. In December this year, Kenya will mark its 50th anniversary of independence and the country’s future belongs to a post independence generation. We do not want our current and future relations with Kenya to be overshadowed by the past. Today we are bound together by commercial, security and personal links that benefit both our countries. We are working together closely to build a more stable region. Bilateral trade between the UK and Kenya amounts to £1 billion each year, and around 200,000 Britons visit Kenya annually.</p>

I trust that this settlement will support that process. The ability to recognise error in the past but also to build the strongest possible foundation for cooperation and friendship in the future are both hallmarks of our democracy.”</p>

More importantly, it requires a shift of focus so as to concentrate on whether it is equitable to allow the remaining (now much more limited) claims to proceed and whether they have been proven, subject to the generic issues. Had the court been deciding on the wide raft of previous claims - based on lengthy detention, forced labour, living in fear for a number of years and damage to/destruction of property - the core allegations to be determined would have been on a much broader canvas<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="19">

If a TC does not prove that a claim arose after 4 June 1954, I must find that it is absolutely time-barred.  Nevertheless, given that the point has been reserved for argument in the Supreme Court, I will, where pre-4 June 1954 events arise in the Test Cases, decide whether I would have exercised my discretion under section 33 and, if so, whether the Claimant has proved his/her case in respect of those events.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Clearly, if a Claimant or witness adopts in his or her oral evidence the whole or any part of a pleading (e.g. Part 18 responses) then they are evidence in the trial.  Otherwise, the evidence from a Claimant is only that contained in his or her witness statement verified in oral evidence, together with such oral evidence as the Claimant/witness gave on oath/affirmation. I do not accept the Claimants’ submissions. First, they say that refusing to consider as evidence at trial matters verified in a statement of case elevates a general rule into a statute. It does not. It is the clear effect of a procedural rule, made under Statutory Instrument, as to how facts are to be proved. Secondly, they say that in the above authorities, there was nothing from the parties that assisted their case and the issue was whether evidence existed, not how statements were to be classified, adding: “Here the facts exist. D’s complaint is that because they are in the wrong place, they should be categorised as something other than facts”.  This is not the point. Rule 32.6 is clear that “<span style="text-decoration:underline">any fact</span>…is to be proved….at trial by their oral evidence given in public” (my underlining). That is why witnesses specifically adopt statements in their oral evidence, thus proving them for purposes of the trial. If facts have been proved as required by Rule 32.6, then there is no need to attempt to rely on Statements of Case; if they have not been so proved, then, at trial, the Statements of Case (unless adopted in oral evidence) do not prove those facts.</p>

	      </authorialNote>; the reasoning set out in those paragraphs is still valid, but, at this stage of proceedings, where the more wide-ranging allegations have fallen by the wayside, the effect of imprecision or inconsistency as to dates must be measured in that context. So, the potential prejudice to the Defendant of an inaccurate timeline would be greater when claims for time in detention and forced labour over long periods were still live. That is not to say that there is no enduring potential effect on the core allegations; that will depend on the effect on the cogency of TC34’s evidence and the Defendant’s ability to meet the case, especially as regards the Defendant’s investigations and possible witness or documentary evidence. In respect of these, the question must be asked whether inconsistency as to the main dates pleaded for where TC34 says he was at the time of the core allegations can be said to have affected the availability or presentation of evidence or the fairness of the trial. It will become apparent later in this judgment that, despite massive efforts by the Defendant, there is no piece of documentary evidence and no witness specific to TC34’s core allegations, or even as to his presence in the various camps in which he says he was detained. This is a position common to the other TCs. </p>

The effect of date changes on TC34’s reliability requires attention to the detail. It must be said that in general terms it would be understandable if a witness such as TC34, at this remove of time, was uncertain on dates or made errors. Indeed (a) it would be surprising if he did not and (b) that is one of the reasons why the Defendant says it is too late to have a fair trial and it is not equitable to allow the action to proceed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On 24 November 2016 I handed down the translators’ judgment.  In this I refused the Defendant’s application to require the translators utilised by the Claimants for witness statements and Part 18 responses provided by the TCs, to attend court for cross-examination.  The reason for the application was “so that the Defendant and the court can understand the process by which documents were created and make judgment as to the reliability and accuracy of the documents in portraying the true account of the witness.”</p>

	    <p class="MediumShading1-Accent31" style="margin-left:1.00in">“12 At a CMC in December 2014 it became apparent that the procedure for taking the witnesses’ evidence had been that the lead solicitors prepared English statements first, checked the accuracy of the document by reading the English version back to the witness in the witness’s own language and then corrected errors in the English version. As no native language statement had been taken from the witness, the Defendant agreed that checking the accuracy of the statement with the witness and producing a native version statement and correcting any errors in the English version was the most appropriate way to proceed. The lead solicitors confirmed that that was what they were to do and have since confirmed that that is what they did.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The first point was who created the documents?  The Defendant said that the person verifying the translations declared that the translations exhibited were accurate, and did not say that they themselves created the translations by translating the witness statements or Part 18 responses.  My response to this was that, while it is correct that CPR 32PD 23.2 requires the translator to make and file an affidavit, this could properly be addressed by a witness statement/affidavit from the translators.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Defendant’s second point was that there were spelling/grammatical errors in the verifying affidavits.  The Defendant gave examples and said that they caused concern in terms of the translators’ ability accurately to translate.  My response to this was that in such a vast mass of translation, the errors could not possibly, by themselves, merit the cross-examination of the translators and that the Defendant could make submissions in closing its case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Defendant’s third point was that there was a lack of information regarding the translators’ qualifications and experience.  I referred to CPR 32PD 4.1 and said that the requirements of the Practice Direction could be fulfilled ex post facto.  I added that information about the translators’ experience or qualifications was not required by the CPR or the Practice Direction, but should in this case be provided.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Defendant’s fourth point was that there were discrepancies in the Part 18 responses.  My response was that some of the discrepancies appeared to be of relatively little import; also, discrepancies could have been put to the Claimants when they gave their evidence.  I said that matters were capable of being dealt with by the Claimant and/or the court interpreter.  Some had been so dealt with.  I added “further, or alternatively, they are matters for comment/submission in due course.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Defendant’s fifth point was as to the meaning of particular words or phrases.  Two specific examples were given.  The first was the translation of “njoni”.  This word had been translated as “British military”, “British officer” or “British soldiers”.  The Test Claimants had been asked what they meant by the word and had given a variety of answers.  The second example was the word “muthigari”.  The issue here was whether it meant “police officer” or a “prison guard” or a “guard” or “home guard” or “prison officer”.  I was of the view that cross-examination of the translators would not add anything of substance on this point.  I said “the differences of meaning have been explored with the TCs and with the court interpreter.  Final submissions can address the weight I give to this.”</p>

This is because of the sentences in the witness statements which say that the translated Kikuyu version of the statement was translated from English by a member of the Miller &amp; Co Advocates translation team.  The evidence from the individual translators is then that they were involved in the process of converting the documents from English into Kikuyu, and “a Kikuyu statement that I verify with a Claimant may not necessarily have been translated from English into Kikuyu by me.”</p>

The Part 18 request asked for details of the man and the recorded response is “it was a Home Guard. He cannot remember his name.”  The Wolfestone translation is “he was a guard and the claimant cannot remember the name. No. The claimant does not have any other information apart from what he said before. The claimant does not know whether they had been employed by the British government, the rest is an argument of law.”  The Defendant says that given the identity and employment status of alleged perpetrators are material issues in the case, the Claimant’s translation contains a material addition, i.e. the “Home Guard”, and a material omission, namely ignorance as to employment status.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have carefully considered the two material differences and also read the remaining differences in the schedule relating to TC34’s Part 18 responses.  Although I can see some merit in the Defendant’s concerns, as to pure translation matters, these do not weigh heavily on my mind.  The two referred to are of some relevance, but many are much less so.  The second one is mentioned later in this judgment when I come to the Gikuni core allegation. In any event, the Defendant has had the relevant documents translated by Wolfestone and, if necessary, any benefit of doubt might, depending on the circumstances, be given to the Defendant on these translation issues.  In summary, in TC34’s case, I do not consider the discrete matter of translation of witness statement and Part 18 response from the Kikuyu to English (both of which we have) to be an outstanding matter of real significance.</p>

The perpetrators, or alleged perpetrators of the assault on the claimant are dead or untraceable, and so too are the senior colonial government officials who were responsible for the villages and camps where the Claimants live. They cannot answer the factual allegations made by the Claimant and they cannot give instructions to the Defendant’s counsel during the course of this trial. The Defendant has not found or been provided with contemporaneous documents which could clarify what happened to the individual Claimants, such as whether they were moved from their homes, and if so, when and why. All of this makes cross-examination of them extraordinarily difficult. It means that when asking questions the Defendant cannot advance its own alternative narrative of events, except at a level of generality, to contradict or undermine the factual allegations made by the Claimants in their evidence.</p>

The parties agreed that the Defendant would serve on the Claimants the documents upon which it relied in order to ask cross-examination questions, but that the Defendant would not be required to ask the witness to look at the documents.

This was because Father M died in 2004. The allegations had never been put to him. There was no way of the Defendant knowing – unless it uncritically accepted the evidence of the Claimants, and that evidence was consistent – that the abuse had occurred. Directly to challenge accounts of abuse which may well have occurred ran the risk of aggravating an injury which had already been caused. The Church could not in conscience cause this further pain. This did not, however, mean that the accounts which F and S gave were accepted as true: Mr Fewtrell invited me to conclude that, after this passage of time, the evidence was insufficiently reliable to justify any findings that the abuse had probably occurred, even if it </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;color:#000000">might</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> </span><span style="color:#000000">have happened.</span></p>

However, there are features of the accounts which are unusual and might have merited close examination to see if, and to what extent, they stood up to close scrutiny: for instance…I must bear these circumstances in mind in my overall evaluation of the case, but cannot, without close testing of the evidence, take them significantly into account when considering whether the evidence now available is a reliable basis for a fair conclusion as between the parties”</p>

	      </authorialNote>, the Claimants could not look at the documents.  They were unable to read them, had no context against which to assess their contents, and lacked the ability to bring themselves to a point where they could sensibly comment.  Their vulnerability left them (as both parties agree) able to rely only on recollection (and, occasionally, a map they had marked with the assistance of their legal representative) whilst giving evidence.  The Claimants suggest that this means that they were disadvantaged as opposed to the Defendant.  There is some force in this, but there is also force in the fact that they could not be cross-examined on documents.  To what extent that would have been relevant in any event, given the lack of documents which pertained specifically to them, is difficult to assess.  Further, the Claimants say that when the TCs’ recollections do correspond with the documentation, that provides a high degree of confidence that the evidence is reliable and accurate.  This will need to be considered on a case by case basis.</p>

There is no Defendant witness who is an alleged perpetrator of any tort on any TC. In TC34’s case there is no witness from either side, who can give direct evidence of any of the core allegations or of anything at all about him.  The lack of documentation relevant to a particular Test Claimant means that the ability to test or respond to the Claimant’s oral evidence against any contemporaneous documents, coupled with the fact that the Defendant was not in a position to put a positive case to any Test Claimant, means that the potency of that evidence is reduced.  The Defendant did call some witnesses, but it was very rare for a witness to have been the author of a document such that the document could properly be put into context by that witness.</p>

Further, the beatings alleged by TC34 (apart from possibly at Hola) would, on his account, have been witnessed by hardly anybody else. The Claimants postulate an extreme case: even if TC34 had been beaten every day at Manyani, that would amount to no more than 300 beatings; if each beating had been witnessed by 20 different people, only 6000 people would have ever witnessed TC34 being beaten there; if all were alive, the odds would be heavily stacked against finding a corroborative witness to a beating. I accept that it is likely to be difficult to trace any such person, even if still alive. Whatever the chances, however, (a) no evidence was given by the Claimants of any attempts to trace such witnesses; (b) if TC34 had been able to call substantial credible evidence which directly corroborated his account of the core allegations, that would have been a factor in his favour in the determination of whether there can still be a fair trial, and, consequentially, whether it is equitable to allow his claims to proceed;<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="54">

Whether or not they could now have been found and called as witnesses, the position in relation to at least some core allegations, e.g. those at Ngong Forest and Gikuni, is that they were said by TC34 to have been witnessed by people not engaged by the Administration. In the absence of any direct evidence, the chances of those witnesses being available to give evidence must have diminished over time.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="56">
		<p class="FootnoteText" style="text-align:justify"> The Defendant suggested that TC34 could have called friends or family members also to give previous consistent statements by him. For example, that when he left the camps he told them many years ago of the core allegations.

Such evidence would have carried little, if any, weight in my judgment.</p>
	      </authorialNote> It may also be that, had this trial taken place much nearer the time when TC34 says he suffered the assaults, he could have identified and obtained evidence from (for example) other detainees who witnessed those assaults in Manyani, MacKinnon Road and Hola.

We accept Mr Faulks’ submission that it is not sufficient for the court simply to hear the evidence of the Claimant, and indeed any other evidence now available, and to decide the issue of limitation on the basis of it, without considering what evidence would or might have been available at an earlier stage…”<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="62">

It was not seeking to prescribe a formulaic template for the construction of a judgment; it was leaving the judge to decide the best way to write the judgment which would expound the analysis that the law required”</p>

The Court may allow the whole or part of the claim to proceed. But it cannot be doubted that if a judge concluded that it would be equitable to allow the claim, or part of the claim, to proceed having regard to the relative prejudice to the parties, he should do so.  The breadth of the discretion comes from the untrammelled evaluation of relevant factors that a judge may take into account, and the weight he gives to each.

Whether or not it will be possible for defendants to investigate these sufficiently for there to be a reasonable prospect of a fair trial will depend upon a number of factors, not least when the complaint was first made and with what effect. If a complaint has been made and recorded, and more obviously still if the accused has been convicted of the abuse complained of, that would be one thing; if, however, a complaint comes out of the blue with no apparent support for it… that would be quite another thing. By no means everyone who brings a late claim for damages for sexual abuse, however genuine his complaint may in fact be, can reasonably expect the court to exercise the section 33 discretion in his favour.

No doubt it was in order to investigate the latter that the NRPB studies were commissioned.  We accept that there has been no public investigation into the adequacy of the precautions taken.  We note that there does not appear to have been a Coroner’s inquest into any veteran’s death which raised these issues.  If it were thought that there should be an investigation, an attempt should be made to persuade the governments to order a public enquiry or some other form of investigation.

	    <p class="MediumShading1-Accent31" style="margin-left:1.00in">“The argument in favour of the proposition that dilatoriness on the part of the plaintiff in issuing his writ is irrelevant until the period of limitation has expired rests upon the proposition that, since a defendant has no legal ground for complaint if the plaintiff issues his writ one day before the expiry of the period, it follows that he suffers no prejudice if the writ is not issued until two days later, save to the extent that, if the section is disapplied, he is deprived of his vested right to defeat the plaintiff's claim on that ground alone.  In my opinion, this is a false point.  A defendant is always likely to be prejudiced by the dilatoriness of a plaintiff in pursuing his claim.  Witnesses’ memories may fade, records may be lost or destroyed, opportunities for inspection and report may be lost.  The fact that the law permits a plaintiff within prescribed limits to disadvantage a defendant in this way does not mean that the defendant is not prejudiced.  It merely means that he is not in a position to complain of whatever prejudice he suffers.  Once a plaintiff allows the permitted time to elapse, the defendant is no longer subject to that disability, and in a situation in which the Court is directed to consider all the circumstances of the case and to balance the prejudice to the parties, the fact that the claim has, as a result of the plaintiff's failure to use the time allowed to him, become a thoroughly stale claim, cannot, in my judgment, be irrelevant.”</p>

		<p class="FootnoteText"> I asked for clarification on this during the hearing. The Claimants researches are that Section 7 of the Legal Aid Act 1949 seems to allow anyone to obtain advice in England to sue in England, subject to Regulations. Regulation 3 of the Legal Aid (General) Regulations provided that people desiring legal aid for any claim could apply for a certificate to a local committee in London if they were not resident in the UK. They had to provide proper information and documentation. On that basis legal aid would not have been available to the Claimants between 1949 and 1962, unless they came to the UK. From 1962 until CFAs were introduced in the 1990s, it is possible it would have been available to the Claimants.</p>

They say that this had a psychologically debilitating effect upon their ability to speak openly, or in some cases even privately, about what had happened to them. By way of example, Mrs Mara has still not felt able to discuss these matters with her husband. They are supported in this by expert psychological reports. While this factor does not constitute a “disability” within section 33(3) (d) of the Act, it is submitted (in my judgment correctly) that it is one relevant factor in the overall balancing exercise for the court.</span>”</p>

It is also unsatisfactory to be asked to draw inferences when Claimants have given written and oral evidence and have said nothing on the reasons for their delay.  Indeed, drawing inferences in such circumstances, when the matter could, and on the authorities should, have been addressed, is something which should only be done if the inferences are compelling. It may be the case that the Claimants were in the position for which their lawyers contend, but in the absence of direct evidence it would be wrong to infer that all, or any, were.

There is no evidence before the Court as to when TC34 first instructed solicitors. Further, at paragraph 51 of the Reply it is said, verified by the Statement of Truth: “this Claimant was told not more than 5 years ago by people at the Chief’s Camp where he lived that he could claim for what happened to him during the Emergency.  He had not considered making a claim before.  He signed some forms which were taken away.  Then about 2 years ago he was told to go to the Offices of Miller &amp; Company in Nairobi where he signed some more forms and was told he could make a claim.” The Reply is dated 18 March 2016.

There, one of the pleaded reasons for the delay was “the Defendant’s professed determination to contest liability in each and every case brought against them, and their publicly stated refusal to concede that they were manufacturing an addictive product…”. As recorded previously in this judgment, Wright J said that on the evidence of the individual plaintiffs, it was only the willingness of the plaintiffs’ Solicitors and Counsel to act under CFAs that had any material impact on their individual minds at all.  He later made reference to the further pleaded case that the reason for the delay was the Defendant’s professed determination to contest liability and their public refusal to concede that smoking was dangerous to human health.  Again, the Judge focused upon the evidence from the individual plaintiffs.  He said:</p>

They say that this “is exactly what D avoided cross-examining about here”, adding “D created its own forensic prejudice by its cross-examination of TC34. In its efforts to limit the damage the evidence might do, D simply did not ask questions about key events and did not ask for explanations of inconsistency. This seems to have been deliberate, and a number of such instances are addressed herein. Equally, D chose not to help its own witnesses by showing them documents.” These points are not matters of ‘conduct’ section 33(3)(c).

There is no need for reference to public international law to assist this concept.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:-0.50in">(a)<marker name="tab"/>The Court has emphasised the importance of the availability of the alleged primary tortfeasor in highly fact sensitive cases.  In <span style="text-decoration:underline">Bowen</span>, a priest, now dead, had pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting the Claimant.  Before his death he had provided evidence to the church in connection with his petition to leave the priesthood.  In that evidence he said that he had pleaded guilty for reasons other than having actually committed the offences.  The account he had given was consistent with the Claimant having consented to the alleged assault.  Burnett LJ, rejecting a submission that the availability of the alleged perpetrator would have added little, if anything, on the question of consent said at [39]-[40]:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.29in">“39 In my opinion, the overall delay in bringing the proceedings relating to the mid to late 80s had a profound impact on the evidence and the ability of the Archbishop and the Scouts to discharge the burden upon them to show that Fr Laundy was wrongly convicted. Mr Levinson submits that the convictions were important. They provided strong evidence that Fr Laundy committed the offences (including those alleged between 1990 and 1999) and the evidence to undermine them was weak. In making that submission he reminds us of Lord Brown's observations in paragraph 86 of the A v Hoare case (quoted above) that if there has been a conviction, I paraphrase, the problems of investigating antique events may be of less consequence. In the overwhelming majority of such cases that may be so because the conviction proves the tort. That is not to say that there might be great difficulty in exploring the consequences of an assault, or series of assaults, and other reasons why the limitation period should not be disapplied. </p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.29in">40 This case is different. The question of consent was at the heart of the defence run by both appellants and was supported by evidence from Fr Laundy. Even without any oral evidence from Fr Laundy, or any detail in a witness statement, the judge concluded that the appellants had discharged the burden in proving that the sexual touching was consensual during JL's adulthood. On his behalf, it is submitted that Fr Laundy's evidence would have added little, if anything, on the question of consent. I regard that submission as being unrealistic. Consent is the live issue in countless allegations of criminal sexual misconduct in respect of which juries hear both sides of the story, and ordinarily need to hear both sides to make the necessary judgments. Whilst the fact of sexual touching would not have been in issue, the immediate circumstances in which each event occurred would have been highly material to the question whether that touching was consensual. Moreover, and importantly, JL's case was a general one that his dealings with Fr Laundy over a period of about eight years before the assaults began resulted in his will being overborne. The court was deprived of evidence from Fr Laundy relating to that matter altogether, as well as other evidence that would possibly have been available if the trial had come on much earlier. The absence of Fr Laundy, in the context of a reverse burden of proof, was highly prejudicial to the appellants. In my view this is all the more apparent in view of the findings of the judge that JL was in many respects an unreliable witness, prone to exaggeration and with a number of significant inaccuracies apparent in the core accounts he had given.”<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="114">

These were described as “legacy” documents. Documents which did not fulfil either of those functions could be destroyed.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.00in;text-indent:0.5in"> In respect of documentation in the UK, apart from the Hanslope archive documents, Mr. Deane referred to Colonial Office practice by reference to the present FCO policy.  He said he thought that, at the initial weeding out, Colonial Office files would have left anything of material substance.  The initial weeding would typically take place within three years of the file being closed.  The exact practice would vary, but that would be the guideline.  It would be highly unusual for it to be less than three years; it would be three years or perhaps somewhat more, depending on the backlog in the registry, the number of staff available etc. Therefore, it seems that the probabilities are that anything in the UK in the early 1960s would not have been weeded until the mid 1960s at the earliest. However, even if the claims had been filed soon after the initial weeding exercise was completed, the Defendant would potentially have been able to speak to those handling the records in the Colonial Office and in Kenya to establish what had been destroyed.  Mr Deane said that the registry clerks who did that job would have been able to say what sort of thing had gone. So, had the claims been brought within the limitation period, or within 3 years of independence, again the probability is that documents which were initially weeded would have been available. Even if not all still available, the Defendant may well have been able to find out from the registry clerks what had been weeded and so what was missing. This would have presented a much clearer picture. This picture will undoubtedly have progressively become less clear as the years progressed, people have moved on and memories, particularly collective memory, have been lost.</p>

Pages 3-4 of this document describes the process by which District Commissioners should follow when preparing Delegated Detention Orders in this context. The process described suggests that the practice was for multiple copies of such Delegated Detention Orders to be kept, several of which were unsigned. I also note that it is specified that the original copy of the Detention Order was to be given to the detained person.

However, some of the Defendant’s prejudice arises at first base in this litigation. Often, in a section 33 case, a Defendant can point to a document lost or destroyed, or to a material witness who has since died. On the core allegations and many other potentially important contextual matters, the Defendant does not know the names of any witness, or any means of beginning a process of identifying, much less tracing, them.  The passage of so many years in this case entails that the Defendant cannot even begin any proper investigation of the core allegations. It does not know who allegedly carried out the assaults or when. It knows nothing about TC34 apart from what he himself has said.   To put the matter at its lowest, fifty plus years ago, the Defendant potentially could have found documents which could potentially have led to information about TC34 and to potential alleged tortfeasors or witnesses. At the very least it probably would have known which documents had been kept and which had been lost/destroyed. All these are, at a minimum, realistic possibilities; some are probabilities. After all these years, the position is that, apart from certain prejudice that the Defendant can prove, there is further prejudice in that it has been deprived in certain aspects from proving specific prejudice arising from lack of documentary or witness evidence.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is this which I have previously described as the prejudice in proving prejudice. It is of importance since one of the Claimants’ responses was that prejudice must be dated. In general terms this is correct. If a key witness dies within a limitation period then there may be no force in any contention by a Defendant that its evidence is thereby less cogent if a claim is then started late. However, if, for example, documents which may have given, or led to potentially material evidence, no longer exist/can be found despite serious endeavour, and, as a result of the passage of time, the Defendant can show that it does not know what happened to them, in circumstances where in the 1950s/1960s, the investigation would have been at least begun, and with a realistic prospect of a positive result, that in itself is prejudice proven by the Defendant.</p>

The Period this is to be kept after completion is said to be “1 Year” and the Method of Disposal is “Destroy”. Hence, say the Claimants, which staff were on duty and where is unlikely to have been available, even if the claims had been brought in time, or in the 1960s.

This is an assertion and it is not one I accept as being supported by evidence. It is of course a possibility that some were so destroyed. However, as summarised above, documentary records evidencing detention of the TCs (assuming they were detained): (a) could have been destroyed at the time of the Watch policy as not being useful for the functioning of the successor government or for the proper recording of the past, (b) could have been destroyed or lost by the Kenyan government, (c) might have been weeded out at the first (or subsequent) weeding by the registry clerks as not being matters of any real import worth preserving – it being perfectly comprehensible that such documents may well not have been considered as broad policy direction material, or of particular importance in the formulation of British Government policy, (d) might still exist and have not been located, or (e) might possibly have been in the lost ‘Top Secret’ files.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="149">

Absent litigation or other requirement to preserve documents, if a claimant does not bring a claim timeously and documents are destroyed or lost, then there is no factor weighing against the Defendant by reason of such destruction. It must be remembered (a) that a vast number of documents has been preserved and (b) this would have been only a proportion of what would have had to be destroyed in circumstances where it is not possible to retain everything. The Claimants have not been able to prove the breach of any duty in this case.</p>

This I find wholly unacceptable. If it is still the case I believe the Defendant should reconsider the policy immediately. It shows a cavalier disregard for the rights of patients to have access to their records. How anyone could think that the x-rays were not part of the patient's medical records is beyond me.

It says that Kenya records sent to London consisted of over 1500 files and 307 boxes occupying 123 feet of racking. There is then the entry that the vast majority of the files concern the Emergency “e.g. intelligence reports and summaries, African Associations, activities of Africans, unrest in the Districts, collective punishment, detainees and detention camps, Corfield report working papers.” It is also said that the remainder include what is then set out in a list lettered from (a) – (o). The last such category is “a complete set of Provincial and District Intelligence summaries for the Colony and Protectorate from March 1953 – August 1961 when the series went clean. The summaries deal with the “grass roots” of Administration and Intelligence and cover the Emergency years in some detail.” The Claimants say that, given that Mr Deane is satisfied that nothing has been missed in London (this somewhat overstates his evidence), it may be all these files are/were among the Top Secret files that were destroyed or lost.

That said, there is nothing in those classes of documents which suggests on the balance of probabilities that they would have included DDOs, or specific detainee records for individuals including TC34. It is a possibility, but no more, that the author of the 1982 document was referring to specific records of detainees; even if he was, there is no information as to how many of these there were in the documents. </span>

They said this is not an imputation on Ms Lohia, and arises from the privilege claimed by the Defendant as to the selection criteria for witnesses. I responded in open court that I was intending to draw an inference on the material placed before me. The inference was that the Defendant would not have put the case in the way it had, if the selection criteria authorised the discarding of a witness who could give material evidence on a Test Claimant, on the basis that the evidence would be unhelpful to the Defendant’s case.

That would also fit with the person being a Home Guard/Tribal Policeman in a small village, which was TC34’s home village.

It may be that TC34 did never know the names of the perpetrators, though this cannot be said with any degree of confidence. In respect of those at the camps, he may have heard their names referred to and, had this claim been brought in time, have remembered those names. There is evidence that some guards in camps had nicknames. Whether the alleged perpetrators had nicknames, whether those nicknames were known to TC34 and whether, if so, those nicknames would have enabled the Defendant to trace those people 50 plus years ago, we will never know. Similarly, it is possible that TC34 might have heard, and remembered for a time, the name of those at the Ngong Forest. In addition, the passage of time can properly be said to have had these effects:</p>

There is no detail as to how often the alleged assaults took place, or any description of any of the persons responsible – something which TC34 would have been in a better position to recall 50 years ago; also, this type of allegedly regular abuse could have been addressed by officers in Hola, who could have given evidence of the incidence/prevalence of unlawful violence in the period when TC 34 alleges he suffered it. To some extent this type of evidence may have been relevant to the one-off allegations at Manyani and Mackinnon Road. However, here its main importance would be to respond to the general corroborative evidence which TC34 relies upon to suggest that, because there were other incidents of violence at those camps, there can be a fair trial of his core allegations.</p>

It may be that, in common with others according to some documents, he was not; or that, given that there were over 2000 appeals, he was so aware at the time; or that he was informed of it at some camp(s) but not at others. His memory some 60 years later is not a reliable indicator of this.

That is not to say that, on occasions, there are matters in the medical evidence which go beyond mere recording of history and to which the Court should have regard. An example is this from Professor Mezey: “the incident involving the intestines was particularly vivid, and clearly for him, but also in my mind, just because of the very dramatic change in his persona when he<span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:15pt"> </span>was talking about it, he was virtually retching in front of me”<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="177">

This is correct but it must be recalled that, in terms of proportionality, the court required jointly instructed medical experts and limited them to two per TC, one an expert in General Medicine and the other a psychiatrist. In the former category, for all the TCs two were consultants in Emergency medicine and two were physicians.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="180">

	      </authorialNote>. The court does not approach or adopt any evidence in the case uncritically; the Court does properly evaluate that evidence as to what it is/is not capable of proving, taking into account the fact that these were jointly instructed experts, who (a) were sent a jointly drafted and agreed letter of instruction (b) were the subject of detailed Part 35 questions and (c) gave oral evidence – unusual for joint experts, but to which both parties agreed and which, in the circumstances of this case, I accepted as necessary and proportionate. I will comment if and when appropriate when I deal with the detail of TC34’s evidence. However, in no sense is Mr. Heyworth’s evidence to be regarded as generally unreliable or flawed.</p>

It is also possible that those notes referred to one or more of the assaults he says he suffered – either confirming or casting doubt on his present account. It is also possible that there were other entries which would have been relevant to assessing the reliability of the core allegations. It cannot be put any higher than that.

Specifically in relation to the matter of TC34’s identity card, I have to take into account that it is a legal requirement to have such in Kenya.  It does record what TC34 says is a historic untruth.  The effect of that (admitted) lie in the circumstances in which it was given, could be taken into account generally in terms of TC34’s credibility, though I must say that it does not really affect my assessment.  There was little exploration in cross-examination of the detailed background to the identity card. Nor was it suggested that TC34 might not be who he said he was. The inference seems to be that he had had an identity card for a number of years and had lied about his birth date so as to avoid the Kikuyu tax at the time of the Emergency.  This suggests that his name has remained constant since that date and his photographs have been renewed.  If that is so then, save as to the birth date, the probabilities are that his identity on the card has been consistent since the 1950s (at least).  It has also been consistent since 1996 when the present identity card was issued.  Further corroboration of identity comes from the, albeit scanty, medical records, namely an “endoscopy service investigation report” dated April 2011 from North Kinangop Catholic Hospital and a “patient card” from the Karangatha Health Centre dated February 2012.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the initial arrest and detention, the closing submissions state that TC34 pleads that these were sometime in 1955 [14], but aver that he was probably arrested between September 1954 and March 1955. They also say that his arrest was sometime in the summer of 1954 [97], though, in oral submissions, Mr Myerson distanced himself from that statement.  The closing submissions say that the documentary evidence enables more precision and put matters in this way: TC34 is likely to have been sent to Manyani after September 1954 [14a]. His arrival was perhaps sometime after October 1954 [14b]. TC34 thought he was there for about a year [14b]; in evidence, he said he was there for not quite a year [14d]. TC34 arrived at Langata before 31 March 1955, as no new detainees were accepted after that [14c]. </p>

He says he was assaulted by a Home Guard there [117], after which he was taken to a court approximately ten miles away from Gikuni [121].

Alternatively, that it is wholly unclear when he was arrested and when he arrived in Manyani. It could have been before June 1954, and the alleged assault at Ngong could have pre-dated 4 June 1954.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The allegations are that the Claimant was driven to Ngong Forest from the CID which was near the Supreme Court in Nairobi.  He was placed in a Land Rover with a young Kikuyu girl aged 18 to 20 years.  At the Ngong Forest the Claimant was handcuffed to a tree.  There were three British Officers present with guns.  The Claimant was questioned about the whereabouts of some guns.  One of the British Officers fired a gun just missing the Claimant’s head.  The Claimant was slapped on his face by a British Officer.  The impact caused him to start to lose the sight in his right eye.  His handcuffs were removed and he was forced to kneel down.  His hands were tied in front of him and his trousers removed.  A British soldier forced soil into TC34’s anus with a stick and he was then hit with the butt of a gun on his hip, ankle and knee.  </p>

The Claimant witnessed this as he lay on the ground, causing him further distress.  He feared for his life.</p>

There are no witnesses, just TC34’s account and the evidence of the doctors. The Claimants say that male sexual assault was not uncommon and cite an allegation by TC27 at Manyani. I regard this allegation of an assault by different people, at a different place, and in wholly different circumstances, as of no significance in supporting TC34’s allegation. Further, the Claimants say, in relation to TC34’s account of the sexual assault alleged on the girl, that there is a reference to a similar assault at the Makadara Home Guard Post, some 15 miles from Ngong. This, too, is of not of any significance in circumstances where that latter allegation was not an allegation against the CID and was in another place. Further, it was investigated by the CID, (Mr Duncan MacPherson, the Assistant Commissioner of Police). On 11 January 1955, he wrote a report to the Commissioner of Police, copied to the Attorney-General. In it he concluded<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="203">

He adds some more detail about the investigation and proceedings against the assailants etc. Inter alia he says that none of the alleged female assailants had any right of arrest at all; in effect they were nothing to do with the Security Forces; they were “prostitutes of the hardest type. Some of them decided to throw their lot in with the Government having seen the strength of the Security Forces in the Locations”.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="204">

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Makadara incident illustrates an aspect of the general difficulty in having a fair trial many years later without potential key witnesses, even where that witness may not be the primary tortfeasor. Assume that the victims of the Makadara assault had been TCs and only Mr. Macpherson’s letter had been found. One can see how easily the discretion to allow the action to proceed might have been exercised in the Claimants’ favour, even absent any witness for the Defendant. Their evidence would have corroborated each other and also would have been seemingly well corroborated by Mr. MacPherson’s letter. With the knowledge of Mr. Small’s letter, the Court may well come to a different conclusion, namely that a fair trial on whether somebody for whom the Defendant was potentially vicariously liable had committed the assault would be not be possible without contextual witness evidence, e.g. from Mr Small himself, so as to explain the circumstances which would raise a potential defence, and to have his evidence tested. I merely cite this as an example of the sort of problem that can arise where full documentation may not be found and/or witnesses who might put allegations into context are no longer available. How to exercise the discretion in respect of each of the core allegations must be looked at on its own merits.</p>

In the Claimants’ written Opening he is relied upon as somebody who attempted, despite hostility, to bring abuses to light.  Yet, on TC34’s account, the CID under Mr MacPherson’s command was using the same horrendous tactics on a young woman at about the same time he wrote condemning the Makadara incident.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="205">

I cannot place too much weight on Mr Kearney’s recollection because (a) it is so long ago (b) he was not posted in Nairobi at the time TC34 says he was first interrogated (c) it is uncorroborated by other witnesses (d) it is uncorroborated by the type of record and investigation to which he refers. If a court had been able to find that Mr Kearney was probably correct in his description of TC34’s evidence as to the severed heads, then this may well of itself had a serious impact on the remainder of his allegations. If there had been other similar witnesses in relation to the core allegations or surrounding matters in TC34’s evidence, the assessment of TC34’s case may well have been radically affected.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The following matters need to be highlighted. In TC34’s witness statement at [19] he said “I was slapped on my face and hit violently on my eye.  This was so severe I started to suffer from eye problems from that time.  I suffered an injury that led to me losing my good sight in my right eye.  My vision is blurred.”  As to this:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:2.01in;text-indent:0.5in"> TC34’s closing submissions [148] accept that the medical evidence does not support permanent damage, adding: “his belief will add to his distress.”  Thus it was suggested that TC34 honestly believes that he has permanent right eye damage even though he has not and should be taken into account in assessing quantum<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="216">
		<p class="FootnoteText"><span> </span>I understand that this is no longer maintained after exchanges during oral submissions.</p>
	      </authorialNote>. This is an apparent explanation also of the rather confusing and apparently contradictory part of the particulars of injury in the AIPOC which continues to refer to permanent blurring of vision, <span style="text-decoration:underline">particularly</span> in his right eye….” and “<span style="text-decoration:underline">impairment of vision from assault lasted about two months”</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:2.01in;text-indent:0.5in">In his medical report Mr. Heyworth said that TC34 reported that he was slapped violently to the face resulting in loss of vision affecting both eyes, particularly in the right eye.  He also reported significant continuing impairment of vision affecting both eyes for a period of two months following this event.  Mr. Heyworth’s opinion was that it was reasonable to consider that the blurring of vision followed the assaults; examination did not elicit any major structural injury affecting the eyes, though there were cataracts visible.  Mr. Heyworth said that on the balance of probabilities it was reasonable to consider that the current and ongoing impairment of vision reported by TC34 is the result of changes associated with advancing years.  In evidence he said that he thought the duration of symptoms was probably about a two-month period.  He said that this could be caused by a mechanism including a condition known as hyphaemia, a collection of blood in the anterior chamber of the eye associated with a blunt blow.  He accepted that such an injury would usually be unilateral.  It would be unusual to have it in both eyes unless there were bilateral blows.  He said that a hyphaemia could only be determined by an ophthalmological examination.    </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">From the above there is certainly an inconsistency that, from TC34’s evidence which suggests unilateral long term loss of vision in the right eye, the claim is now bilateral eye injury lasting two months, on the basis that the only explanation for blurring is cataract.  There is no suggestion in TC34’s evidence that his vision was affected for a period and then the blurring came on later in life.  Further, there is no evidence from TC34, apart from what was reported to Mr. Heyworth, that there was significant blurring for a period of two months following the event.  Whatever other decision there is to be made in this case, it would not be open to the Court, in my judgment, to find on the balance of probabilities any more than a very short term blurring to the right eye<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="217">
		<p class="FootnoteText" style="text-align:justify"><span> </span>See also, as noted in the Medical evidence section above the fact that TC34 told Mr. Heyworth that he suffered injury to his eye at Mackinnon Road and went to hospital as a result. This was not pleaded and is not claimed for. This is a further confounding report about the eyesight problems.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">With regards to the consequences of the sexual assault, TC34’s evidence was that he was in agony and screamed.  It was very humiliating.  It went on for 3-5 minutes.  It was very painful for him to relieve himself for about a week and he had to use his fingers to scrape out the soil that had been inserted.  This was over a period of days.  As set out above, the amended pleading amplifies this evidence by referring to extensive bleeding.  It also refers to full recovery within 6 months.  In Mr. Heyworth’s medical report at paragraph 10 it states: “the pain continued for a period of six months.  During this period (TC34) continued to experience significant pain whenever he opened his bowels.”  Therefore there is an inconsistency in the period during which TC34 experienced pain when relieving himself.  Such an injury, if inflicted, would be distressing and humiliating.  It would also no doubt be very painful and probably cause bleeding.  The inconsistency may well relate to the difficulties of recollection but, again, it would not be open to the court, on the balance of probabilities, to find that the period of time for which TC34 could recover for this injury would be more than about a week.  </p>

	      </authorialNote> allege that a white solider used the butt of his gun to hit/smash his hip joint and to hit his ankle and knee.  At the end of his witness statement [74] he says that he uses a walking stick whilst walking, this being the result of beatings on his back.  TC34’s submission [153] alleges ongoing intrusive pain around the sacroiliac and hip joints which is not solely accounted for by degenerative change.  It is said that this is “probably properly regarded as being at a nuisance level by now, given the contribution of degenerative change in any event”.  There is no reflection of this assault in Mr. Heyworth’s report, though there is the record: “(TC34) also reports that he was beaten with sticks to his body.  There was severe pain at the sites of the blows sustained and subsequently extensive bruising developed.”</p>

The headlines are: First, the Defendant could not put a positive case.  Secondly, the Defendant is entitled to point to inconsistencies on the face of the Claimants’ own documents and jointly instructed medical evidence.  Thirdly, I have to take care in taking them into account where TC34 was not given an opportunity to comment on them. It would certainly be wrong for me to draw any conclusion on the balance of probabilities that TC34 was not being truthful. Indeed the Defendant does not suggest this. What can properly be said in respect of these inconsistencies is: (i) they may well illustrate confusion and difficulty of recollection at this remove of time (ii) if it were necessary to determine which of different versions (e,g on duration of symptoms) is to be accepted on the balance of probabilities, the Defendant would generally be given the benefit of the doubt.</p>

They submit that these details serve no purpose if not true.  This is very much a “makeweight” point.  It does not follow by any means that, because a witness gives such details, the evidence is reliable.</p>

I refer back to the previous sections in this judgment dealing with documents and witnesses. In summary, documents and witnesses would probably have been available. Enquiries and investigations could have been made. The Court would, in all probability, not have been faced with anything like the present situation, namely having to rely on the uncorroborated account of TC34 devoid of any proper context. TC34’s own recollection would have been far fresher, and therefore more reliable. For obvious reasons in relation to witnesses, and for reasons previously given in relation to documents, the foregoing would also probably have been the case if the claim had been brought in, say, the mid-1960s. Further, or alternatively, the passage of time has caused the Defendant to suffer prejudice in not being able to prove some specific aspects of prejudice.</p>

By the time he left he said there was not one death.  On this basis the Claimants say that the documents about typhoid at Manyani are likely to be incomplete or unreliable because they suggest the first epidemic ended in January 1955, long before Professor Khan arrived.  They say that Professor Khan is likely to be accurate, that he was not challenged on this and it is unlikely that he would forget an epidemic.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="224">
		<p class="FootnoteText" style="text-align:justify"> These were matters where it may well have been helpful if Professor’s Khan’s evidence had been further elucidated.</p>
	      </authorialNote>  The Defendant responds that, after he had given the figure of 40 to 50 deaths a day, Professor Khan was taken to his annual report.  He was asked about many things in it, but not the number of deaths.  As regards those other matters, he said that his report was a fair portrait of what happened in the year.  The Defendant says that it is likely that the documents are correct and that Professor Khan’s recollection about the number of daily deaths when he arrived is wrong.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="225">

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.00in;text-indent:0.5in"> In summary, there is a difficulty about Professor Khan’s recollection in oral evidence and there is some merit in the Claimants’ submissions that he is unlikely to have forgotten an epidemic when he arrived.  Nevertheless the documents indicate to the contrary, and it is difficult to explain this discrepancy by suggesting that there may be missing or unreliable documents.  In particular, Professor Khan’s annual report for 1956 recording 23 deaths in Manyani for the whole of that year, and the documents as to deaths across the estate, tend to suggest that Professor Khan’s memory as to deaths was incorrect. I add in passing that is noteworthy that the Claimants’ primary case for much of this litigation is that the documents speak for themselves and would not be substantially bettered, or contradicted by oral evidence. On this point, where I have heard the oral evidence and can evaluate it against the documents, I agree. It also shows how, even when somebody like Professor Khan was doing his best to assist the court, on the balance of probabilities his memory appears to be wrong on something as noteworthy as the scale of deaths in the camp when he arrived.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.00in;text-indent:0.5in"> The Claimants respond by saying that TC34’s recollection of conditions, and in particular the number of deaths, at Manyani suggests that he arrived there in the latter months of 1954, which accords with considerable numbers of detainees shown on the documents as being transferred from Langata to Manyani in this period, the numerous documents evidencing the typhoid epidemic and the higher rate of deaths at the end of 1954, prior to January 1955.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="226">

I could see the persons being beaten, but I do not know any of their names. They were being beaten with sticks, shaped liked handles of a hoe. They were beaten by prison warders. I do not know any of the warders. There would be no Europeans present…..Apart from this I saw no other ill-treatment at Manyani” [This was in Compound 12 and related to hard-core detainees who refused to be screened. Gichini also said he never heard of detainees complaining they had been beaten by screeners. He also refers to people being aware of appeals and exercising that right]. Next, Mr Kimani, at Manyani November 1955 to January 1957, says that on arrival if persons did not walk fast enough, the warders hit them with their rifles and with canes; he did not see anyone injured as a result of this; in another incident, recaptured escapees were beaten with canes<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="238">

That may be so, but (i) they are all Claimants bringing claims for abuse during the Emergency and so are in effect a self-selected cohort (ii) TC34’s allegation is not one that is of any particular type, or which has any hallmark shared by the others – a suggestion that he was beaten, in common with TC17, TC26 and TC31 during forced labour or for making a mistake, is of some consequence but does not amount to a distinctive feature of real significance (iii) while I have not heard full submissions on the evidence from the other TCs, I understand that it suffers generally from the same problems of lack of documentation and witnesses as TC34’s, and therefore cannot be properly investigated or tested.</p>

In Mr Myerson’s reply in oral submissions he introduced some further critical analysis of the report. He said that there are 88 witnesses in Jack, but a total of 183 people are named in the report. Of those named 50 were interviewed. These 50 were part of the total 88 interviewed. Therefore 133 were not interviewed. Of the 88 interviewed, there are 67 occasions when people say they cannot remember or do not know the name of somebody, though it is not clear how many of those relate to Manyani. Mr Myerson also said that the evidence is that Manyani had about 2,500 African staff and 60 European staff; of the latter only 31 are named in the report because Jack asked for names and received 31 names. 28 of these names were provided by Mr Thatcher and 11 by Mr Kenyari, there being overlap save as to 3 names. Therefore the submission was that this was suggestive of the fact that even then staff lists/rotas were not exactly readily available and that documents were not exactly easy to find, because when Jack went to Manyani it was still open. </p>

Mr Jack is no longer available to explain his modus operandi in the light of what is said, or to comment on the conclusions I am asked to draw. What we do know is that, despite the comments in the Preliminary section, Jack was investigating specific allegations made by Shuter. There is also a substantial difference between this type of inquiry and full-blown adversarial litigation. Had the Defendant been investigating TC34’s claim as part of a massive claim by over 40,000 former detainees in, say, the 1960s, it probably would have left as few stones unturned as possible, as it has done in this case. Had it been investigating TC34’s case alone at that time, his memory would have been fresher, he would have been more accurate as to dates; staff lists and other relevant documents may well have been available. In fairness to Mr Myerson, he did not overstate the case. He said about the staff lists: “That is, we submit, rather suggestive of the fact that staff lists weren’t exactly readily available.” That is not, of course, to say that they may not have been found by the Defendant at the time, or even in the 1960s. Therefore, for both relevant witnesses and documents, what Jack and his assistant Superintendent Page refer to, is not convincing as to what may well have been available at the time to a fully resourced legal team facing an adversarial claim for damages such as this one.</p>

I have not done that analysis myself, but there appear to be quite a number. This is in contrast to TC34 who now cannot provide any names; it is unknown whether 50 plus years ago he could have done so, or at least provided descriptions, or other information, leading to identification of potentially relevant witnesses. There must at least have been a real prospect of this.</p>

First, at most it is potential corroboration of the fact that TC34 experienced a horrible incident with intestines falling on his face. It is not direct corroboration of a beating, but of what TC34 says was the immediate precursor to a beating. Secondly, I am sceptical as to the faith that Professor Mezey puts in what she saw on examination. I am not saying that the incident described by TC34 did not occur, nor that Professor Mezey may not be correct. What I am saying is that I do not find it to be very convincing evidence of what TC34 says occurred<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="252">

This is true even of so-called 'flashbulb' memories, that is memories of experiencing or learning of a particularly shocking or traumatic event. ……External information can intrude into a witness's memory, as can his or her own thoughts and beliefs, and both can cause dramatic changes in recollection.

It does not indicate that there was abuse in Manyani on anything like the scale alleged. He may be mistaken, he may not have seen what was really going on and the majority of detainees may not have been brought to him for treatment. Nevertheless, his witness statement in the Jack report is perhaps the nearest that one gets to an independent overview of Manyani at the time he was there. That said: (i) even in 1959, there were some details he had forgotten, (ii) his evidence is background only, (iii) it is from one perception only. It would be wrong to place substantial weight on it. What it does do, however, is give an insight into the fact that, many years ago, there may well have been a number of other witnesses who would have had a very different narrative from the one I am being asked to find is fair and convincing as corroboration of TC34’s case. </p>

The reference is to Mr Heyworth’s evidence, but that was specifically in relation to MacKinnon Road where TC34 himself had reported a period of pain for a period of four months following the incident<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="254">

I accept what the Claimants say, namely that there would be an acute phase of pain and (probably) bruising, swelling and inflammation of soft tissues, followed by a recovery period. Absent any evidence, I cannot infer that, on the balance of probabilities, the recovery period would have been more than days, rather than weeks or months. To find a recovery period of more than some days would require evidence, of which there is none. This is not a matter of proportionality; it required no more than a line in TC34’s evidence. </p>

The Court would, in all probability, not have been faced with anything like the present situation, namely having to rely on the account of TC34, devoid of any proper context or of any corroboration of real weight. TC34’s own recollection would have been far fresher, and therefore more reliable. For obvious reasons in relation to witnesses, and for reasons previously given in relation to documents, the foregoing would also probably have been the case if the claim had been brought in, say, the mid-1960s. Further, or alternatively, the passage of time has caused the Defendant to suffer prejudice in not being able to prove some specific aspects of prejudice. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In his witness statement TC34 describes his arrival and initial interrogation at MacKinnon Road.  He says that the detainees alighted from the train and were paraded in a line.  Prison guards stood on both sides guarding them.  There was an army truck which followed from behind which went at speed and which made them run four miles to the camp.  There they were questioned and put into groups.  There were three groups namely black, white and grey and they were given a bracelet which was the colour they had been graded.  If you were grouped black you were regarded as a criminal and were detained.  TC34 was initially grouped as black.  He was questioned about the Mau Mau oath, where the guns were and how they carried them.  He did not confess.  He was not assaulted while being questioned.  This happened twice.  </p>

Taking all matters into account, although there is uncertainty about the dates, in my judgment it is probable that TC34 was detained for a period at Mackinnon Road.  I appreciate that there are no documents supporting this.  Nevertheless, I find no reason to doubt TC34’s reliability on the broad proposition that he was detained there for some time.  Further, his description of being classified as black and therefore detained until he was released, and then reclassified as grey, fits in with the general picture.  So, for example, in the Defendant’s Outline Response to the Claimants’ Written Opening:</p>

Around this time (Spring 1955), it appears that Manyani and Mackinnon Road became the main camps for holding category “Z” detainees because such detainees were being transferred there from other camps where attempts to rehabilitate them had been unsuccessful, or where they had otherwise revealed themselves as representing the “hard-core” Mau Mau element.

All these were (Assistant) Superintendents of prisons. MacKinnon Road was under the supervision of prisons department officials. They would have been a starting point to evidence of what happened on the ground at MacKinnon Road. They could have dealt with whether a British soldier was in charge, as TC34 alleges. The witness and document trail potentially would have led to the person in charge at the time of the alleged assault, the British soldier who, according to TC34, came and told the guards not to beat him, and to the alleged perpetrator(s).</p>

Enquiries and investigations could have been made. The Court would, in all probability, not have been faced with anything like the present situation, namely having to rely on the uncorroborated account of TC34, devoid of any proper context. TC34’s own recollection would have been far fresher, and therefore more reliable. For obvious reasons in relation to witnesses, and for reasons previously given in relation to documents, the foregoing would also probably have been the case if the claim had been brought in, say, the mid-1960s. Further, or alternatively, the passage of time has caused the Defendant to suffer prejudice in not being able to prove some specific aspects of prejudice. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Nevertheless, the injury claim in the closing submissions [179] states: “he sustained two blows to the right shoulder with a gun butt.  He was violently slapped and subjected to repeated beatings, including blows from sticks, being kicked and blows from the butt of a gun.”  As previously stated, based on the pleadings and evidence, only the two blows to the right shoulder could possibly be the subject of damages.  There was no application made to amend the alleged additional assault/injuries.  Unsurprisingly, the Defendant says that had it been made, it would have been opposed.  Thus, any recovery for the core allegation at Gikuni would be limited; no adverse effects, other than the initial pain from being struck, have been evidenced either by TC34 or in Mr. Heyworth’s report.  </p>

The Defendant suggests that this implies that TC34 was taken to a Tribal Court, though in evidence he explained that he was taken to the Law Courts in the town of Kikuyu, which he said was about 10 miles from Gikuni. There he appeared before a white Judge, pleaded not guilty to assaulting the Home Guard, and was acquitted by the Judge.  He was then arrested outside the court building by the police and detained. The Claimants submit that it is consistent that, having been involved in a local incident after having been released from detention, notwithstanding his acquittal, TC34 was re-detained. This is because TC34 was Mau Mau and the authorities may have considered him not safe to be released back into the community.</p>

I refer back to the previous sections in this judgment dealing with documents and witnesses. In summary, documents and witnesses would probably have been available. Enquiries and investigations could have been made. The Court would, in all probability, not have been faced with anything like the present situation, namely having to rely on the uncorroborated account of TC34, devoid of any proper context. TC34’s own recollection would have been far fresher, and therefore more reliable. For obvious reasons in relation to witnesses, and for reasons previously given in relation to documents, the foregoing would also probably have been the case if the claim had been brought in, say, the mid-1960s. Further, or alternatively, the passage of time has caused the Defendant to suffer prejudice in not being able to prove some specific aspects of prejudice. </p>

The four acres would be divided into 8 pieces and we had to harvest all the cotton.” He says that whilst harvesting the cotton on the large plantation, they were whipped on their backs and buttocks, because the guards would think that they had not done the work required. He went to speak with the District Commissioner for Tana River district, who was a white officer, and asked him to allow families to be brought to the plantation to assist to harvest. He also says he made some furniture for him. The families were brought and TC34 was allowed to bring his wife and two children. He had two wives, though he was only allowed to bring one. He says “I think I was at Hola camp as a detainee for 6 months before I lease (sic) the 4 acres and was freed to be able to work on 4 acres that had been allotted to me.” After release he stayed at Hola from 1960-1963.

The Claimants seek general damages for likely multiple whippings over the same sites aggravating the pain.

For obvious reasons in relation to witnesses, and for reasons previously given in relation to documents, the foregoing would also probably have been the case if the claim had been brought in, say, the mid-1960s.

He was then asked how many oaths he had taken and he said two.  He said he took the second oath because of the anger that was within him.  He took it in his village with very many young men.

It would have been more helpful if this had been so explored. For that reason I do not place great weight on it. However, such an omission from the witness statement and pleadings, in the context of the documents which suggested that he had nothing to do with Mau Mau, must be another cause for concern as to the reliability of the evidence-taking process and/or of TC34’s evidence. I do not know why there are these omissions. Mr Myerson urged on me that, at worst, TC34 was telling the whole truth in oral evidence. That may be so, in that regard. But misleading information in witness statements and other documents signed with a statement of truth cannot be totally airbrushed out in this way. It must have some effect on the court’s overall assessment of TC34’s evidence, though this is limited given that TC34 did not have the matter specifically put to him for his comments.</p>

If true, it seems to amount to an allegation that the Colonial government’s central police administration in the capital, under the leadership of Mr MacPherson, was arranging for, or accepting, the beheading of corpses, and collecting their heads in a drawer in an office or an interrogation room so as to produce them to intimidate suspects. Where the corpses came from, what happened to them, how long the heads would, or could, be kept in the drawer, who would have had to be complicit in such an arrangement and to what level of officer – the answers to all these questions, and no doubt others, are unknown. </p>

As for John Grounds (Defendant’s witness) confirming that the Kenyan African Rifles (KAR) cut off hands for identification purposes, and the McLean enquiry in 1953 reporting that sometimes soldiers cut the hands off dead Mau Mau fighters – this evidence does not in any meaningful way corroborate TC34’s severed heads account.

He added: “of course, I cannot speak as to what the uniforms were before, or after, my time working in the camp.”  In his statement at [10] Mr. Aspinall says Mukoe was a camp for reformed Mau Mau who had confessed.  The Defendant says that TC34 does not suggest he confessed. Finally, Mr Aspinall said that it would have been very unusual for someone to be sent to Mukoe and then to Hola, though this evidence seems at odds with the later November 1958 document referred to above.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally, there is the matter of assault at Mukoe.  There is no claim for an assault there.  In his witness statement TC34 says he was not assaulted at Mukoe.  He stated this also to Professor Mezey.  TC34 saw Professor Mezey on the same day as he saw Mr Heyworth. Mr. Heyworth said that TC34 reported that during the course of his detention at Mukoe he was subject to repeated beatings, which included assaults with sticks, batons and being kicked.  He sustained blows all over his body and reported significant pain associated with these blows at the sites of the injuries sustained.  The Claimants submit that confusion is the most likely explanation for this.  However, confusion or not, it cannot be wholly ignored and is something which is be taken into account in evaluating TC34’s reliability as a witness.  It cannot weigh heavily against TC34 since he was not given the opportunity to comment on it.</p>

Presumably, there were also those who wanted nothing more than to get on with their lives, but who were caught up in it all. As time went on, so the colonial government took control, but for a long time problems remained. These included who could be trusted for release, and how they could be safely re-settled in the Kikuyu, Embu and Meru communities.</p>

In so deciding I must have regard to all the circumstances of the case and in particular to those in subsections 33(3)(a)-(f).

The prejudice to be addressed is that which affects the Defendant's ability to defend. That involves considering what evidence might have been available to the Defendant if a trial had taken place earlier or it had learned of the claim earlier.  It is not sufficient for the court simply to hear the evidence of the Claimant, and indeed any other evidence now available, and to decide the issue of limitation on the basis of it, without considering what evidence would or might have been available at an earlier stage. That would be to overlook the possibility that, had the Defendant been in a position to deploy evidence now lost to it, the outcome might have been different.</p>

The problems with the timeline go further than that, as detailed earlier in this judgment. It is highly likely that 50 plus years ago TC34’s recollection as to dates and periods spent in the camps would have been more accurate. So would his recollection as to the dates of the Ngong Forest and Gikuni allegations. In relation to the core allegations, TC34 has been consistent as to locus and as to sequence.  Nevertheless, I must bear in mind the undoubted confusion as to dates and length of periods and the consequences of this when evaluating the cogency of TC34’s evidence. There are few extraneous objective facts by which properly to measure the reliability of his evidence. The greater accuracy and precision which there would have been if the claim had been brought, say 50 plus years ago, would have assisted the Defendant’s investigations in locating relevant documents and witnesses against which TC34’s evidence could have been tested.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Having examined the core allegations in detail, I very briefly summarise the loss of cogency on other evidence. Important contextual witnesses, e.g Mr MacPherson for Ngong and Mrs. Henley-Colgate for Hola (among several others) can be identified as having died many years ago, but also many years after the limitation period expired. On the core allegations and other important or potentially important contextual matters, the Defendant does not know the names of any witness, or have any means of beginning a process of identifying, much less tracing, them.  The passage of so many years in this case entail that the Defendant cannot even begin any proper investigation of the core allegations. It does not know who allegedly carried out the assaults or when. It knows nothing about TC34 apart from what he himself has said.   To put the matter at its lowest, fifty plus years ago, the Defendant potentially could have found documents which could potentially have led to information about TC34 and to alleged tortfeasors or witnesses. At the very least it probably would have known which documents had been kept and which had been lost/destroyed. All these are, at a minimum, realistic possibilities; some are probabilities. Here, after all these years, the position is that, apart from the clear prejudice that the Defendant can prove, there is further prejudice in that it has been deprived in certain aspects from proving specific prejudice arising from lack of documentary or witness evidence. For example, documents which may have given, or led to potentially material evidence, no longer exist/cannot be found despite serious endeavour to find them; as a result of the passage of time, the Defendant can show that it does not know what happened to them. In the 1950s/1960s, the investigation could have been at least been properly embarked upon, and with a realistic prospect of a positive result. That in itself is prejudice proven by the Defendant.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In short, the strong probability is that the Defendant would have been in a very substantially better position to defend the core allegations well into the mid-1960s.

There would in the past have been many witnesses who could have given real context to the reliability of TC34’s evidence in the way that Mr Kearney’s evidence begins to do. Similarly, Professor Khan’s evidence on alleged abuse at Manyani gives an insight into the fact that, had the Defendant had the opportunity to investigate TC34’s case when the allegations were reasonably fresh, there may well have been a number of other witnesses who would have given a very different narrative from the one I am now being asked to find is fair and convincing as corroboration. Such witnesses may well have radically affected the assessment of TC34’s reliability and the core allegations.</p>

It merely means that he is not in a position to complain of whatever prejudice he suffers.  Once a plaintiff allows the permitted time to elapse, the defendant is no longer subject to that disability, and in a situation in which the Court is directed to consider all the circumstances of the case and to balance the prejudice to the parties, the fact that the claim has, as a result of the plaintiff's failure to use the time allowed to him, become a thoroughly stale claim, cannot, in my judgment, be irrelevant.”</p>

	      <span style="font-family:Times">“It should be remembered that the reason for limitation provisions is to protect defendants from the injustice of having to meet stale claims. And a judge, when considering whether to disapply under section 33, particularly where, as here, there is difficulty in testing old and unsupported complaints, should not form a concluded view on their validity for the purpose of determining the existence and extent of potential prejudice to claimants of being deprived of a remedy. Such allegations are so easy to make and so difficult to refute that the danger of injustice is acute. Here, the Judge had to bear in mind the possibility of them being fabricated or exaggerated for financial gain in the wake of publicity about Bryn Alyn and about other care homes where similar conduct had been alleged. Yet his findings, both on the substantive issues and the effect of delay on cogency were based mostly on the strength of the claimants' evidence alone and without rigorous testing by way of cross-examination derived from instructions or contemporaneous records, or of possible contradictory evidence that might have been available if the claims and the trial had been earlier. It was, as he acknowledged in his opening remarks on the section 33 issue, an inherently difficult task, involving inevitable prejudice to the defendants in attempting to meet uncorroborated claims of this sort so long after the event…..”</span>

Nevertheless, the unfairness to the Defendant in defending TC34’s core allegations would have still outweighed the prejudice to TC34.

Further, save for occasional references to the appearance of uniforms, the test case Claimants have largely failed to identify the basis upon which they recognised certain persons to be member of the British Army: indeed, at times the test case Claimants seem to assert that a given individual was a member of the British Army by reason of the mere fact of that individual's race alone. As such, the Defendant has been confronted with the need to identify which regiments were active in relevant parts of Kenya during the relevant periods. Where the locations named in the test case Particulars of Claim are inconsistently spelled, poorly described, or imprecise, this task has been made very difficult.

If the service number of a particular soldier is known then it is a considerably less onerous task for the MOD to try to ascertain whether that soldier is known to be alive or dead, and if alive where living.
