	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The human hip is a ball and socket joint. Over time, it may become damaged and require replacement in consequence of natural wear and tear, which may be exacerbated and escalated by certain medical conditions, the most prevalent being osteoarthritis. Total hip arthroplasty, the reconstruction of the natural hip joint with an artificial prosthesis, has become a common operation. Approximately 100,000 such operations are performed annually in the UK. A successful total hip arthroplasty can make a huge difference to the patient’s quality of life by improving their mobility and relieving them from debilitating pain.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">No surgery is without risk, but the risks associated with a total hip arthroplasty are relatively small. It carries the same general risks as any other form of major invasive surgery. Hip-specific risks include infection, dislocation, leg length inequality, nerve injury, and femoral fracture. A small proportion of patients continue to report hip symptoms even after apparently satisfactory replacement surgery. Nevertheless, it is generally considered to be a very safe, durable and reliable operation. </p>

Prostheses have a smaller head and acetabulum than the natural hip. The “bearing” in a total hip arthroplasty refers to the articulation between the femoral head component and the acetabular component. The latter will either be a monobloc cup, which articulates against the femoral head, or a modular cup with a liner inserted into it, whose surface articulates against the femoral head.  </p>

This litigation is not concerned with devices used in resurfacing arthroplasties. </p>

The femoral head will be made of metal or ceramic material; the liner may be made of polyethylene, ceramic or metal. Of these, polyethylene is the softest material, and therefore most prone to wear; but in recent years scientists have developed tougher and more durable forms of material by cross-linking the polyethylene with gamma radiation to produce cross-linked, and subsequently highly cross-linked polyethylene (“HXLPE”). The various combinations of articulation are: </p>

Over time, the product designers and manufacturers developed modular prostheses with separate cups and liners, and modular stems, which would allow the surgeon to better reproduce each individual patient’s anatomy. Modular stems and heads were well established components by the 1990s, and it was also possible to have a cup and liner combination, although the facility to use different types of liner with the same cup was not developed until around the late 1990s/early 2000s.  </p>

The designs vary, but the aim is for the implant to be press-fitted into the bone, allowing biological fixation over time, which, if achieved, can usually be considered lifelong. It is now possible for surgeons to use a combination of fixation techniques and to use a cemented stem in conjunction with an uncemented cup (“hybrid fixation”), or vice versa (“reverse hybrid fixation”), though the latter combination is relatively rare. </p>

Dislocation is a painful event which reduces the patient’s confidence and may lead to a need for revision surgery – that is, surgery to replace all or some of the components used in the primary operation. It can cause damage to surrounding tissues with an ongoing impact on function, giving rise to a risk of further dislocation. The risk of dislocation is related to head size; the smaller the components, the greater the risk. The advantage of using a large femoral head (one with a diameter of at least 36mm) is that it brings increased stability to the joint by increasing the distance that the head must lift out in order to dislocate. </p>

The Pinnacle system is an uncemented modular system, within which different articulating surface combinations were available. Surgeons could select the materials from which the femoral head and liners to the acetabular cup were made, to produce the combination of materials which they thought best suited the patient. The liner materials were conventional and, later, cross-linked and highly cross-linked polyethylene, metal, and ceramic. The metal acetabular liner in the Pinnacle system was called “Ultamet”.

However, as with the term “ARPD” (adverse reaction to particulate debris), it is not used consistently among orthopaedic surgeons, and the inconsistent use of this and other terminology is a factor I have had to bear in mind when reviewing the relevant literature. DePuy’s expert, Professor Hemant Pandit, rightly stressed that the term “ARMD” includes the word “adverse”, in the sense of harmful, or damaging, and Mr Whitwell agreed in cross-examination that the inclusion of the word “adverse” was important.

This is agreed by the experts to be a more common reaction to polyethylene debris than to metal debris.

Thus, even if there is a cytotoxic reaction to debris (of whatever sort), the death of cells may not lead to an adverse clinical consequence in the form of the death of tissue.  Tissue is not just a collection of cells; it contains blood vessels, collagen, and other components. When there is tissue necrosis, all of these will be dead.

The presence of significant quantities of dead cells in tissue is a sign of pathology and a cause for concern, because it suggests that something is causing those cells to die. Sometimes the histopathologist can discern a layer of dead cells, or dying cells, next to a layer of normal cells, which may suggest a progressive necrotic process within that tissue. However, a histopathologist can only speak to the state of the tissue he sees on the slide at the time of examination.

Cuffing is not specific to the type IV hypersensitivity reaction or to MoM bearings, but where there is a type IV hypersensitivity reaction to metal debris, the lymphoid response may be far more pronounced. In his supplemental expert report, Professor Athanasou agreed with Dr Nelson that perivascular lymphocytes and lymphoid aggregates, as well as a macrophage infiltrate, can be seen in a patient with osteoarthritis, although he said that in such a patient the macrophage infiltrate is not as marked as in ARMD.  He added that the features one would expect to see in a case of ARMD were “<span style="font-style:italic">extensive necrosis associated with deposition of Co-Cr particles, a heavy foreign body macrophage and an ALVAL response.</span>” </p>

Other features they noted in some patients were drop-like inclusions in the cytoplasm of the macrophages (though Professor Athanasou said he has never seen these), areas of cell necrosis, often large, and extensive fibrin exudation.

However, the fact that an ALVAL response may be seen by a histopathologist when examining tissue taken from a patient does not necessarily mean the patient has ARMD (in either sense). A significant lymphocytic infiltration <span style="font-style:italic">may</span> be consistent with the histological finding or the clinical diagnosis of ARMD, particularly if it is accompanied by significant tissue necrosis and the presence of metal debris in and around the dead or dying cells. However, Mr Whitwell accepted that the mere fact of an ALVAL reaction does not mean that there has been an <span style="font-style:italic">adverse</span> reaction in clinical terms. It depends on the nature and extent of the ALVAL response and any other relevant features. </p>

This was consistent with Professor Athanasou’s evidence and is also borne out by the histological findings in two of the lead cases, those of Mr Haley and Mrs Emery. Professor Nelson was referring to a scoring system for ALVAL that was developed by a team headed by Dr Patricia Campbell, on which he was the pathologist, by ranking the multiple features described in the Willert study. The Campbell system was originally used as part of a study of the correlation between the incidence of ALVAL and the amount of prosthetic wear measured in explants from patients who had had revisions (not just of total hip arthroplasties but of resurfacing arthroplasties). A different scoring system for ALVAL, used for a similar purpose, but focusing on the lymphocytic infiltrate, was developed in Oxford by Dr Grammatopoulos and a team including Professor Athanasou and Professor Pandit.   </p>

If there is ARMD without ALVAL it is most likely to be the patient’s innate immune system that is driving the reaction, and the condition has probably been brought about by a quantity and concentration of metal or metal products sufficient to bring about a cytotoxic effect.  </p>

When asked if he would expect to see extensive tissue necrosis in a patient with ARMD, Professor Athanasou said he would expect to see that commonly in cases where there is a pseudotumour, but that it had been found in a significant number of patients without a pseudotumour. Most patients with failed implants will generally have extensive necrosis, but they may have less. He said that whilst minimal necrosis <span style="text-decoration:underline">can</span> be seen in ARMD (in the histological sense), there is a spectrum of histological findings and it is more common to see more extensive necrosis.

The Directive makes it clear that the balance is struck by providing for no-fault liability if a defective product causes damage, subject only to a limited number of clearly defined defences.

The reference in Article 13 of the Directive to the rights which an injured person may rely on under the rules of the law of contractual or non-contractual liability must be interpreted as meaning that the system of rules put in place by the Directive (in particular under Article 4) does not preclude the application of other systems of contractual or noncontractual liability <span style="font-style:italic">based on other grounds </span>(than defect), such as fault, or a warranty in respect of latent defects. Thus, for example, in the <span style="font-style:italic">Gonzalez Sanchez </span>case, the CJEU decided that Article 13 must be interpreted as meaning that the rights conferred under the legislation of a Member State on the victims of damage caused by a defective product under a general system of liability having the same basis as that put in place by the Directive, may be limited or restricted as a result of the transposition of the Directive into the domestic law of that State. </p>

The court held that the wording of s.4(1)(e) of the Act did not suggest, as the Commission alleged, that the availability of the defence depends on the subjective knowledge of a producer taking reasonable care in the light of the standard precautions taken in the industrial sector in question.

A producer is only liable under Article 1 for damage caused by a defect in his product. If there is no defect, the claim must fail. Section 2 of the Act sets out what the claimant must prove, consistently with Articles 1 and 4 of the Directive. Section 3 of the Act sets out the yardstick of safety by which a defect is established.

The approach advocated by the claimants is circular, because it requires the identification of a “harmful characteristic”, which in and of itself suggests a defect, and then asking whether in all the circumstances that harmful characteristic does constitute a defect. Moreover, making the first step to “identify the harmful characteristic which caused the injury”, as Burton J did in <span style="font-style:italic">A v NBA,</span> would be to identify the primacy of causation before any investigation of defect, which is contrary to the Act and the Directive. It involves reasoning backwards from the harm (or incidence of harm) to find a defect in a normal characteristic of the product, even though that harm may have occurred without the product being defective.

I consider the claimants’ primary approach to be directly contrary to the spirit and objectives of the Directive and the Act, which require the Court to move away from the concept of a “defect” being some flaw or failing in the product, and to concentrate instead on whether in all the circumstances the product meets the requisite objectively assessed safety standard.  </p>

The effect of that combination is something that on the most advanced state of scientific knowledge at the time drug X was put on the market was unknown and could not have been discovered by the producer.  If the “defect” is characterised as the propensity of drug X to cause a stroke, the producer would have no development risk defence, because that propensity was known.

I agree, but that proves DePuy’s point. The combination giving rise to the elevated risk is not part of the circumstances to be ignored in characterising the defect. If there is something that increases an inherent risk to the point that an otherwise safe product falls below the standard of safety that persons generally are entitled to expect, the defect is not the inherent risk, but whatever gives rise to the abnormal, or increased, risk.

The CJEU was simply referring to a straightforward application of the test in Article 6 of the Directive to a pharmaceutical product, in that case, a vaccine, by pointing out that if a legitimate inference can be drawn from the evidence that the vaccine was the most likely cause of a patient suffering abnormal and particularly serious damage, it may well be held to fall below the particularly high standard of safety that the public is entitled to expect of a vaccine. What made the product defective in that hypothetical example was its unknown potential to cause <span style="font-style:italic">abnormal</span> damage, in the form of a particular disease, which was self-evidently not among the safety risks that the public generally might be expected to accept when being vaccinated. There is nothing in <span style="font-style:italic">Sanofi Pasteur</span> that supports the suggestion that when identifying the defect, one can or should take out the abnormality.</p>

The case concerned a motorcycle accident which was caused by the front brake of the claimant’s relatively new motorbike seizing without warning. The reason for the seizure was found to be galvanic corrosion, which the judge at trial decided must have been due to a fault in the design or manufacturing process.  The defendants challenged that finding on the basis that there was insufficient evidence to support it. At [36] Hamblen LJ stated that “<span style="font-style:italic">the defect found was </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">a susceptibility for galvanic corrosion to develop</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in the front brake system </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">when it should not have done,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> i.e. after limited and normal use and notwithstanding proper servicing, cleaning and maintenance</span>” and again at [39], “<span style="font-style:italic">the brakes were defective in </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">that they allowed galvanic corrosion to develop following</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">normal use</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in circumstances where </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">standard non-defective brakes would not have</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">done</span><span style="text-decoration:underline">”</span> (emphasis added). </p>

Mr Oppenheim submitted that the fact that the corrosion occurred when it should not have done was part of the relevant circumstances, and the defect was correctly characterised as the potential for galvanic corrosion. That submission ignores the abnormality that was the essential aspect of their condition that made those brakes unsafe – the elevated risk of corrosion leading to early failure. The case does not support the proposition that the normal propensity of a product to cause harm, or the inherent risk of causing a particular type of harm in normal use, can be legitimately characterised as a “defect”. </p>

If it is established on the evidence that the Pinnacle Ultamet prostheses did indeed have a materially greater risk of early failure and revision, when compared with an appropriate comparator prosthesis or prostheses that was or were on the market at the relevant time, the “defect” is not the natural propensity of the product to cause ARMD, but its abnormal risk of failure for ARMD leading to early revision when measured against that comparator, which is the claimants’ alternative case.

The issue in this litigation, as it was in <span style="font-style:italic">Wilkes, </span>is whether it is legally permissible for the Court, when evaluating whether the safety of a product was that which the public generally is entitled to expect, to take into account any benefits it brings (other than benefits directly related to safety) when such benefits would be factually relevant to that evaluation, or whether the Court is constrained simply to look at the risks the product poses. </p>

I accept, as Burton J accepted, that it is not a defence under the Directive or the Act for the producer to demonstrate that the risk was unavoidable, and that there may be situations in which a producer will be held liable for defects that he could do nothing to prevent. </p>

Inquiring whether there was fault or absence of fault on the part of the producer is not the same thing as considering whether, as a matter of fact, the risk of injury could have been eliminated or reduced, and whether that has any impact on what the public generally was entitled to expect in terms of its safety.  </p>

It is nothing to the point how the contaminant came to be in the product, if the presence of the contaminant (with or without the absence of warnings) would be sufficient to make the product fall below the yardstick of safety set by s.3. Once it falls below that yardstick, then it is defective, and then it will be for the producer to establish any defence, such as the development risk defence. Likewise, if a product which a patient has no choice but to use has been contaminated by something inherently harmful that one would not expect to find in it, obviously the way in which an <span style="font-style:italic">uncontaminated</span> product would behave and the benefits that a blood transfusion could confer is unlikely to be informative of the safety of the contaminated product (save possibly as a comparator). </p>

The respondent was contending that a specific product can be considered defective only if the product is more generally found to be unsafe: see [85] and [89]. That would require the claimant not only to prove that the product he used was defective but that there was a generic defect in all products of that type or batch. Addressing that argument, the Advocate General understandably concluded [at 88] that imposing such a requirement would amount to creating new conditions of liability.

The problems with <span style="font-style:italic">A v NBA </span>lie in the passages that appear to lay down rigid rules of more general application pertaining to the circumstances that fall to be legally excluded from consideration when evaluating safety (at least in a nonstandard product) because they are somehow deemed to undermine, or run counter to, the no-fault basis of liability. Burton J took the view that without excluding such matters, subject only to the development risk defence, the Directive would not only be toothless but pointless. I respectfully beg to differ. Dictating that certain circumstances can <span style="font-style:italic">never</span> be considered relevant in law or taken into consideration (however relevant they may be in fact), undermines the flexibility of the Act and the Directive, which caters for the fact that the suitable approach for one product may be inapposite for another. </p>

It seems to me that an analysis which throws up problems, whether insurmountable or not, is best avoided, especially if it is unnecessary.

In evaluating a claim made under the Act by a patient who has been harmed by suffering from that side effect, if the Court simply looked at the harm the drug could cause, and excluded its particular benefits, namely, the better prospect of successfully treating the cancer, it is difficult to see how it could properly evaluate the level of safety that the public is <span style="font-style:italic">entitled</span> to expect of that drug. Indeed, if the enquiry is so constrained, it might be difficult to avoid the conclusion that the product was defective, because whilst the use of the drug for chemotherapy would be taken into account, the Court would be excluding from consideration the features of the drug that make it more effective than other chemotherapy drugs which did not have that side effect.  </p>

I cannot accept those submissions. The nature of the standard or regulation, the body setting it and the information on which it relied may have some bearing on the weight, if any, to be placed on compliance or noncompliance, but that does not involve the Court in second-guessing a regulatory decision, let alone considering questions of fault. The Court will not allow the parties to introduce factual disputes that will divert it from consideration of the safety of the product.  </p>

In other cases, it may be higher, for example if the product complied in all material respects with particular safety features required by the regulatory regime, but there was some additional feature that made it unsafe; or where the generic products complied with the regulatory regime but there was a faulty batch that would have failed the safety assessment, as in <span style="font-style:italic">Boston Scientific</span>. The weight to be placed on such compliance is a matter of fact and degree in the individual case, and it may be of no relevance at all.

Hickinbottom J said, and I agree, that in an appropriate case compliance with such standards will have considerable weight, because they have been set at a level which the appropriate regulatory authority has determined is appropriate for safety purposes.

However, the application of the “but for” test is not entirely straightforward in a case where the defect is an abnormal or increased risk of an early failure which could occur even if there was no defect. On the face of it, in order to establish causation, each of the claimants would have to prove that they developed ARMD, that that was the reason for (or at least made a material contribution to) the early revision, and that they would not have had an early revision but for the fact that they developed ARMD.

Mr Oppenheim submitted that it was important for the Court to be astute not to impose a causal requirement that made the exercise of a claimant’s rights extremely difficult in practice. He submitted that damage is established if there was a revision caused in whole or in part by ARMD, but that in order to prove causation, the Court has to ask what would have happened if the prosthesis implanted in the claimant did not have the identified abnormal potential for damage. Therefore, he submitted, the correct question for the Court to ask is whether a claimant would have suffered ARMD (and not whether the claimant would have undergone a revision for an early failure) if he or she had had an implant that did not create the abnormal potential for damage of that type. He submitted that because the adverse reaction manifests itself in soft tissue damage, and for causation purposes the Court is concerned with the causal connection between <span style="text-decoration:underline">that</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">defect</span> and the damage of which the claimant is complaining, the question is whether, if the claimant had a different type of prosthesis implanted, they would have been revised for ARMD. </p>

However, that is not the reason why Mr Oppenheim’s formulation is wrong in principle. The correct question for the Court to ask is whether, on the balance of probabilities, the claimant would have suffered the damage complained of, i.e. undergone an early revision, if the hip had not carried with it the increased risk of early failure which made it defective.

In any event, it is unnecessary for me to reach a conclusion on this issue, as the problem of proving causation was unlikely to arise in the present litigation if the claimants proved that the Pinnacle Ultamet prosthesis carried with it a materially increased risk of early revision (on their case, three to five times greater) than a relevant comparator prosthesis.  </p>

Rather like the first generation of MoM implants, despite some initial optimism, its early performance was very mixed. Problems arose from a relatively high fracture rate, as well as difficulties with aseptic loosening. Professor Pandit likened the fracture of a ceramic hip to a broken vase where it is difficult to see all the shards and remove them. Mr Whitwell explained that from a surgical perspective, the fracturing of a ceramic head or cup can cause very serious practical difficulties, not only because of the challenge for the surgeon in removing all the parts of the shattered component, but because of the risk that any parts left behind might interfere with the revision prosthesis. He said the lesson that it was necessary to do a very good clearance around the hip to get those particles out had unfortunately been learned from the incidence of early revision failures in patients who had experienced ceramic fractures. Both he and Professor Pandit also referred to a problem of squeaking, possibly caused by edge loading of the ceramic bearing, which for some patients could be intolerable (and lead to them requesting a revision). </p>

Whilst the incidence of fracture decreased, they continued to suffer from aseptic loosening. A second generation of MoM bearings were developed in the latter half of that decade. The Swiss company, Sulzer, produced a design which used 28 mm and 32 mm femoral heads made from a Co-Cr-Mo alloy. Meanwhile, the designers of MoP articulations experimented with the intentional structural cross-linking of conventional polyethylene through irradiation to produce a harder wearing material, which it was also hoped would be less likely to degrade over time. </p>

The length of time before such failure occurred would depend on multiple factors, including how active the patient was, and the nature of the activity, though there would be a degree of degradation in the body irrespective of activity.

He said his experience of the incidence of failure due to osteolysis was shared by many other orthopaedic surgeons. It was a major focus at meetings of professional associations of surgeons at which the topic of polyethylene wear was discussed year after year. Patients with osteolysis were largely asymptomatic in the early years, and problems would only become apparent if they started to experience pain, or the prosthesis started to loosen. Mr Whitwell’s evidence was consistent: osteolysis was something that developed over time, but if the hip was not subject to periodic X-ray follow-up, and it was well fixed, the consequences of the adverse reaction to the polyethylene debris would not become manifest until the hip began to loosen and the patient began to suffer symptoms.

Designers of implants began to focus on improvements to wear rates, so as to reduce the volume of wear debris. This led to a move away from conventional MoP towards alternative articulations. A third generation of CoC implants were developed and introduced during the 1990s, but concerns about potential fracture remained, and the size of the components meant that these prostheses were unsuitable for patients with smaller anatomies. At around the same time, experiments began with structural crosslinking of polyethylene through gamma or beta-ray irradiation, and the use of antioxidant agents such as Vitamin E to stabilise the material, producing early examples of cross-linked polyethylene. </p>

The conference brought together people with clinical and scientific experience who had already undertaken research or had a specific interest in evaluating MoM bearing technology for total hip arthroplasty. The conference generated a “consensus statement” on the current state of knowledge in the industry, which was published in a leading orthopaedic journal, “Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research”, in 1996.  </p>

Despite noting that histological features seen with failed MoM components differed from those seen around MoP components, and express identification of the issues of metal ion and particle toxicity (and even potential carcinogenicity), the statement concluded that MoM technology was a worthwhile subject of further research and development as an alternative articulation, to address the problem of polyethylene wear particle-induced osteolysis. </p>

In this judgment, I shall adopt the same shorthand as was used throughout the trial and refer to Dr Malchau’s paper as “the SHAR 2000 report”; however, it is not to be confused with the annual report published by SHAR (in Swedish only), in that same year. SHAR, which was established in 1979, is the longest-established national joint registry. The data referred to the entire patient cohort (169,419 primary procedures and 13,561 revisions) and it was the only available data at the time on long-term survivorship rates. The orthopaedic community’s general view of survivorship of hip prostheses was largely informed by this registry. The SHAR data showed that younger and more active patients, particularly those aged under 55, were at greater risk of revision in all diagnostic groups.  </p>

I consider the findings of SHAR in detail in Chapter 4 of this judgment (section 4.3) when evaluating the statistics. At this juncture, I note only that the Swedish data indicated that the survival rate of MoP prostheses declined rapidly after 10 years, especially in younger patients, a problem starkly illustrated by the graphs in the report. The rapid decline has been appropriately described as a “cliff edge” phenomenon. The SHAR 2000 report continued to drive the search for alternative, harder-wearing bearing surfaces. </p>

The prevailing MoP articulation worked reasonably well in such patients by providing improved function and pain relief. Their activity levels tended to be low, and so the demands on the prostheses were relatively modest. The standard advice given to such patients was that such a prosthesis might last 10 to 15 years. In practice, as the evidence of Dr Hass illustrates, there would be those that failed earlier, including much earlier, and those </p>

This was borne out by the data in the SHAR 2000 report. Mr Whitwell said that for younger patients who were sufficiently symptomatic, clinicians would still make the decision to replace; but they would generally try to keep the patient going with injections and/or physiotherapy until they fell within the elderly, less active group. He said that at that time, in such cases, orthopaedic surgeons lacked confidence that they had an implant which was going to outlive the patient. </p>

The maximum size of components in the bearing of the prosthesis is limited by the strength of the materials comprising the liner. Stronger materials can be thinner, and so accommodate a large femoral head within the same size acetabular cup. Metal liners allowed for the largest size heads with the thinnest liners. At all material times relevant to this litigation, a patient who received a 50mm acetabular cup could only have a 28mm or 32mm head size if they wished to have a polyethylene or ceramic liner, but they could have a 36mm head size with a MoM articulation. Over time, larger sizes have been developed for ceramic and HXLPE; this was an ongoing process throughout the 2000s. </p>

DePuy’s alternative bearings team was a multidisciplinary team comprising among others, surgeons, scientists, and engineers.  Dr Haas, who was the surgical consultant on the MoM hip project, took the view that large diameter MoM components were a viable alternative to conventional MoP prostheses, which could address the problems of the dislocations and high revision rates for patients, especially those who were younger and more active. It was the evidence of Dr Haas and also that of Dr Richard Farrar, who was one of the senior project Bioengineers working within the research and development team on that project, that DePuy had much better manufacturing techniques than were available with the historic MoM prostheses.

Additional reasons for the introduction of these implants included the improved stability of the hip joint (and therefore the reduction in the dislocation rate) which was potentially beneficial for the elderly patient as well.

The vast majority of cemented implants have MoP articulations. For uncemented implants, MoP was overtaken in popularity by the latest generation of CoC articulations in 2010, though only for a short time. After reaching a peak in 2011 the use of CoC started to decrease, whilst MoP articulations again became predominant.

He agreed that studies indicated the initial results for HXLPE were largely encouraging in terms of survivorship, with a reduction in wear rates. He referred to a study carried out by a colleague of his in Oxford, Dr Glyn Jones, on one of the specific HXLPE products, which gave very encouraging ten-year data in terms of very low volumetric and linear wear rates measured in vivo. The study stated that there was no evidence as yet that these findings will result in lower revision rates or improved functional outcomes (in the longer term), but, whilst stressing the need for caution, Mr Whitwell said that as an orthopaedic community “<span style="font-style:italic">we are hopeful</span>.” He accepted that there may be different long-term performances for the different types of HXLPE that had been introduced on the market over the past 17 years. The orthopaedic community did not yet know the long-term benefits of the stabilisation techniques used on the material, and he was aware that some studies suggested that HXLPE has a higher inflammatory potential than conventional polyethylene. </p>

The first problems that were identified were with hip resurfacing components, rather than with total hip arthroplasties. Mr Whitwell’s own experience since becoming a consultant in 2005 largely related to resurfacing arthroplasties. He was involved in the Oxford Hip Research Group that published widely on the field of MoM arthroplasty, after operating on one of the first patients recognised to be suffering from ARMD in 2005 – that patient had a resurfacing arthroplasty. It was in the resurfacing context that ARMD was first reported in a national orthopaedic conference in 2008. Over the next few years, scientific publications in peer-reviewed journals helped to increase awareness of it in the orthopaedic community.  </p>

A few weeks after this, on 22 April 2010, the MHRA issued specific guidance relating to all MoM hip replacements following reports of revisions of such hip replacements involving soft tissue reactions associated with hip pain. The guidance made no distinction between hip resurfacing arthroplasties and total hip arthroplasties. It advised that patients be followed up at five years post-operatively and more frequently in the presence of symptoms. Patients with <span style="text-decoration:underline">painful</span> MoM hip replacements should be investigated, specifically tested for Co and Cr ion levels in the blood and given an MRI or ultrasound scan. If either Co or Cr ions were elevated above 7 parts per billion (ppb), then a second test should be carried out in three months. If the imaging revealed soft tissue reactions, fluid collections or tissue masses, revision surgery should be considered. The purpose of this guidance was to enable those patients who had ARMD to be identified sufficiently early to enable them to undergo revision surgery at a time when there was the best opportunity to produce a good result. </p>

This could manifest itself in heightened anxiety, causing patients to monitor themselves more closely, and in patients noticing and remembering symptoms that they might otherwise have missed or disregarded. It could also lead to a subjective perception of increased pain and/or a loss of function; a misattribution of pain; and/or an increased willingness on the part of some patients to seek help, or to consent to revision surgery.  </p>

As Mr Whitwell pointed out, extensive soft tissue necrosis presents specific challenges for the surgeon which can be much more difficult to overcome than damage to the bone, particularly if muscle damage occurs. Knowledge of this is bound to have affected surgical attitudes and made some consultants more willing to revise than they might have been if, for example, the problem was potential osteolysis. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The expert psychologists agreed that the sensationalist media reports probably did have some effect both in increasing the rate of, and accelerating the timing of MoM hip implant revisions, though they were unable to express a view on the degree to which this impacted on the reported revision rates. They very fairly pointed out that any tendency towards increased rates of revision may have been opposed by the availability of objective measures and guidance to apply these before deciding to revise. However, the problem was that there were no clear diagnostic criteria for ARMD. The MHRA guidance suggested that the results of cross-sectional imaging would influence the decision to consider revision, but it shed no light on how the consultant should approach a case in which that imaging revealed nothing of concern, other than by continuing to monitor the patient annually. Much would depend on the attitude of the treating clinician, and the extent to which he or she placed emphasis on the subjective experience of the patient.  </p>

At least one of the lead claims falls into this category. Professor Pandit’s evidence of the impact on the surgical community of reports of systemic problems with MoM prostheses was to similar effect. He referred to the selffulfilling prophecy whereby panic engendered by the sensationalist media reporting increased the revision rates, and higher revision rates, once known, cast further doubt on the prosthesis, and thus prompted surgeons to offer revision more readily and patients to accept revisions more readily.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">As the evidence in the lead claims demonstrated, the 2010 MHRA guidance was not consistently followed. In practice, some surgeons (or centres) adopted a more conservative approach and used lower thresholds for surveillance and surgical intervention. There were some centres around the country in which all patients with MoM prostheses were tested for blood metal ion levels, irrespective of whether they were symptomatic. There were patients who were subjected to more extensive investigations even if their Co or Cr levels were less than the MHRA surveillance threshold of 7ppb. Local guidelines in certain areas adopted a lower threshold of 4ppb, and some orthopaedic consultants took the view that even that threshold was too high. Four of the surgeons who performed revisions for the six lead claimants used a lower threshold for investigation and revision than the MHRA guidance. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Even Mr Whitwell adopted a more cautious approach than that recommended by the MHRA. His view could be summed up as “if in doubt, revise”, and that included the situation in which the imaging showed a collection round the trochanter. He was only prepared to leave and monitor the smallest of collections of around 5cm<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">3</span> and below, and then only if the wall of the collection was thin. Given that Mr Whitwell worked in a tertiary centre and therefore saw the worst types of case, his unwillingness to wait and see how things developed is understandable. His attitude was also based on his personal experience that when imaging revealed a collection, the patient was not truly asymptomatic because even if they initially denied symptoms, close questioning would normally reveal some evidence of pain or discomfort which they had grown to live with.  Mr Whitwell was far from alone in adopting this ultra-cautious approach. Indeed, it was an approach that Mr Whitwell shared with colleagues to whom he gave lectures, and is likely to have influenced their thinking. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The strong impression that I received from the evidence, particularly in relation to the lead claims, was that once awareness of the phenomenon of ARMD spread, the orthopaedic community tended to act out of an abundance of caution. Ironically, the design of the Pinnacle modular system which made it relatively straightforward to swap the head and/or liner had a part to play in this. There were undoubtedly some surgeons who would investigate and/or revise a patient merely because he or she had a MoM hip and some unexplained pain: Mr Herlekar, who revised the hip of the lead claimant Mr Woods, was one example. Others, faced with the possibility that ARMD might develop, decided to swap the head and/or liner on the basis that it was better to be safe than sorry. Yet in both types of scenario, the patient’s hip may well have lasted for more than 10 years, without the patient experiencing any adverse soft tissue damage. Although this ultra-conservative approach will have resulted in some patients who had ARMD being diagnosed earlier than they otherwise would have been, it also resulted in revisions being carried out on some patients who were not suffering from ARMD at all. </p>

Mr Whitwell said that when the MHRA guidance first came out, there were specific clinics run in Oxford to monitor the patients, but as the understanding of the ARMD phenomenon in the orthopaedic community improved, patients with MoM prostheses were brought back into routine clinics for follow-up. He and his colleagues would now only intensively monitor high risk patients, (which definition included any person with a large head MoM prosthesis), and that monitoring would be annual. </p>

So not all revisions are failures, and not all failures are revised. However, they contended that it is appropriate to use revision as a proxy for implant failure, because (a) the incidence of revision for other causes is very low and (b) it is safe to assume that the incidence of revision for other causes and failure to revise because of health factors or refusal by the patient is broadly the same across all categories of prosthesis. </p>

So too is the improved stability that a large MoM head provided. They pointed to the agreement by the generic orthopaedic experts in their joint statement that when the new generation of MoM products was introduced there was an expectation of potential benefits or improvement in various respects, in comparison with the products that were already in use. Mr Whitwell acknowledged that the Pinnacle Ultamet achieved a range of such benefits, apart from the concern over its short-term survivorship.

Since the first Pinnacle MoM hips were implanted in 2002 before the NJR existed and the data on which the claimants rely began to be collected, there would be hardly any data indicating their <span style="text-decoration:underline">actual</span> survivorship levels beyond 10 years which, DePuy said, would have some bearing on whether they out-performed the existing prostheses that they were designed to improve upon. The claimants’ case is based on statistical probabilities. On the face of it, there is some force in that objection: if, for example, 20% of metal on conventional polyethylene prostheses failed within 15 years of implantation, but only 10% of MoM prostheses failed within the same period, the latter would appear to be a considerable improvement on the former, and the comparative performances at 10 years would only reveal part of the picture. </p>

At the time when the Ultamet was introduced, it was generally expected that a hip prosthesis would last for about 10 years, at least, before requiring revision, though it was also expected that there would be some incidence of earlier failure, and that the incidence would be greater in younger and more active patients. The expectation of 10-year survivorship was reflected in the advice given to patients, and it was based on clinical experience and on data from SHAR relating to the performance of MoP prostheses. The 10-year period was the period that the orthopaedic community were trying to improve upon by developing alternative, harder wearing materials than conventional polythene for use in the bearings. It was also the period of survivorship used by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (“NICE”) over which the performance of a hip prosthesis was measured, in order to set a benchmark for the best performing products that NHS consultants used as a reference for the selection of implants.  </p>

If they would not use the existing prostheses on such patients unless they felt they had no choice but to carry out an arthroplasty, they would not have used an alternative implant in any patient if the alternative was far more likely than the existing ones to fail within 10 years.

The soundness of that assessment may be a matter of fact and degree, because a slightly higher risk of failure in the short term might well be objectively regarded as a trade worth making if the alternative were enduring many years of pain whilst waiting to reach the age where a consultant was willing to perform primary surgery. However, the claimants’ case is postulated on there being a materially higher risk of early revision. The prospect that the CRR for the different prostheses might converge at some later period, for example, after 15 or 20 years, which was the subject of some debate at trial, has no bearing on the issue of defect when the defect is legitimately defined as an abnormal propensity for early failure. Although I accept that there is a degree of artificiality about using a 10-year period, I consider there is a sufficient justification for it. </p>

The data in the NJR on which the claimants relied are informed by the views of the operating surgeon as to the need and reason for the revision. If and insofar as the decision was taken to revise for ARMD, there is and was no accepted consensus about the factors that would lead to that diagnosis. Moreover, when faced with particular symptoms or test results, one clinician might decide to wait and monitor the patient, whereas another might take a more precautionary approach and decide to operate straight away, so as to avoid the prospect of worse damage arising later.  </p>

If that information had been known in 2002 I agree that it is likely that surgeons would not have chosen the Pinnacle Ultamet in preference to one of the other types of articulation, as it would not have been regarded as sufficiently clinically effective; but it does not necessarily follow from this that the Ultamet was defective within the meaning of the Act.  </p>

This calculation was not part of any expert report or the subject of any expert evidence. Mr Oppenheim said the methodology used was the same as the methodology used in a calculation put in cross-examination to Professor Pandit as a criticism of the analysis of the statistical evidence in a paper by a team headed by Professor Matharu published in December 2016, to which Professor Pandit was a contributing author. He submitted that no issue had been taken with Ms Smith in cross-examination as to that methodology, and that the exercise was an appropriate one.

However, she said she also had some concerns about the way in which the authors of the paper had carried out some of the analysis of the data, chiefly because the number of revisions should have been divided by the total length of time observed. She drew those concerns to the attention of the claimants’ legal team, which resulted in them being put to Professor Pandit in cross-examination. Professor Pandit, who is not a statistician, and was not responsible for the statistical analysis in the Matharu paper, was in no position to quarrel with the points that were being put to him.

She did not attempt to quantify the impact on the data of the confounding factors she identified or accepted, save in re-examination when she said that it seemed implausible to her as a statistician that 42% or more of revisions fell into the category of having no proper clinical justification. She got that figure of 42% from a comparison of five-year data for patients whose primary operations occurred prior to April 2010 and five-year data for patients whose primary operations occurred after that date, even though she herself sounded a cautionary note about the reliability of the pre-2010 data.   </p>

The Court is evaluating an acceptable level of safety at the relevant time, and that evaluation must be conditioned by the circumstances that were then known (including any published information about the product, and any relevant safety standards or regulations).

Although in theory actual expectations may differ from the entitled expectation, that will depend on the relevant circumstances. In my judgment, the public would not be entitled to expect a new prosthesis to have a much lower failure rate in the first ten years after primary surgery than anyone would have regarded as acceptable at the time when it came onto the market, just because in the light of hindsight it could be demonstrated that an existing prosthesis performed better than anticipated. </p>

Depending on the circumstances, a new pharmaceutical product which carries with it a 5% greater chance of killing or causing serious injury to a patient than an existing product prescribed to treat the same disease <span style="font-style:italic">might</span> be regarded as falling below the entitled expectation of safety. By contrast, a hip prosthesis that has a 5% CRR within 10 years might not fall below that standard even if another hip prosthesis has only a 3% or a 2.5% CRR within the same period. That example illustrates Ms Smith’s point about the absolute effect being even more important than the size of the relative risk. Nor is it an answer to say, as Mr Oppenheim did, that if there is a 3 to 5 times difference in the revision risk, that is plainly material.

Attractive though that proposition may appear, it would be dangerous for the Court to attempt to set any parameters for materiality in circumstances in which the claimants have deliberately avoided doing so. In any event, for reasons that will become apparent, it is unnecessary for me to embark on that exercise.  </p>

One way to reflect how certain it is that a sample estimate (or “point estimate”) reflects that value is by using a confidence interval for a specified confidence level. The confidence level chosen, and the standard deviation of the sample estimate, determine the calculation of the margin of error; typically, the wider the confidence level, the wider the margin of error. The size of the population from which the data is taken will also affect the margin of error; a larger sample set will reduce the margin of error and vice versa. Confidence intervals are usually referred to by their chosen value of confidence level, e.g. a 95% confidence interval is one with a confidence level of 95%.  If 95% confidence intervals are calculated on each occasion the data is analysed, then 95% of those intervals will contain the true value of what is being measured.

The analysis aims to estimate a survival curve in a given population from the sample of patients in the presence of censoring. Although that type of analysis is commonly used in joint registries, it is limited because it does not adjust for covariates (other factors that can influence results). If such adjustment is needed, more complex multivariable statistical models must be used instead. </p>

At each time the hazard is calculated as the number of patients who were revised over the number of patients at risk. The analysis assumes that the risk of revision among those who are censored at a given time is the same risk faced by those who remain at risk at the time the hazard is calculated. To calculate the cumulative rate, the statistician adds all the individual risks together. This means that every single patient contributes to the data, even if they have only been observed for one day.  </p>

However, as Ms Smith explained, in assessment of the reliability of the risk of revision it is the confidence intervals rather than point estimates that matter. If the confidence intervals overlap, then there is no statistically significant difference between the rates reported: the differences are likely to be due to random variation. </p>

The third is to consider whether it can be reliably concluded on the evidence that there was a materially increased risk of early revision for the Pinnacle MOM implant. If the answer to that question is yes, the final step is to consider whether in the light of that materially increased risk and all other relevant circumstances, the product fell below the level of safety that the public generally was entitled to expect of a prosthesis used for a total hip arthroplasty at the time when it entered the market in 2002. </p>

Where the complaint is of an abnormal risk of early failure, compared with a prosthesis that the patient might have received instead, and especially bearing in mind that at the time the Pinnacle Ultamet was introduced all producers were aiming to improve on the durability of the existing products, the performance of later products cannot inform the assessment of the entitled expectation of safety. The current generation of CoC products were introduced some years after the Ultamet. Some of the new generation of cross-linked and HXLPE alternatives to conventional polyethylene were coming onto the market at around the same time as the Ultamet, but their scientific development continued throughout the 2000s. Different forms of HXLPE undergo different levels of intentional cross-linking and different stabilisation techniques, and so different versions of HXLPE were produced by different producers at different times. Therefore, it would be difficult to find a suitable comparator or comparators from that class. Moreover, the pattern of usage by surgeons of the different articulations shifted over time. For example, Mr Whitwell himself did not start using HXLPE implants until 2010.  </p>

However, that is no justification for using an otherwise inappropriate comparator. The public were not entitled to expect any one of a group of new products introduced onto the market at about the same time as the Ultamet to be safer (or “materially” safer) than any of the others, though they would be entitled to expect all of them to achieve at least a threshold level of safety. In the absence of something that would entitle anyone to expect that the new product would have an elevated level of safety (for example marketing claims by the manufacturer) that threshold level is likely to be measured by reference to the minimum level of safety that was then expected of existing comparable products.  </p>

Mr Whitwell agreed that, if this approach were to be taken, a manufacturer with more than one product on the market might be wise not to market a new product which might perform particularly well, given that others in the range might not compare favourably with it.

If the Court must look at the external comparators anyway, there is nothing to be achieved by carrying out an intra-modular comparison.

If safety is to be measured by the risk of early failure, the public would be entitled to expect that the new implants would not carry with them a risk of early failure that was materially worse than that expected of the tried and trusted products that were already on the market. The appropriate comparator should therefore be a product or product type that was already on the market, and which had been on the market for long enough to engender sufficient robust and reliable data about revision rates and survivorship to inform how long a person might reasonably expect their hip prosthesis to last before requiring revision, irrespective of who the manufacturer was.  </p>

Data about the performance of cemented prostheses, or which largely comprises data concerning their performance, must be treated with some caution, not just because there is a different method of fixation but, more importantly, the patient demographic receiving such implants is largely unrepresentative of the cohort which would be receiving Pinnacle Ultamet prostheses.

However, the fact remains that there will have been a much larger proportion of patients aged under 70 and more active patients in the group who received the Pinnacle Ultamet, especially in the early years, and they are the ones whose activity levels might be expected to (and were expected to) raise the revision rates. That is one reason why the overall statistics for all cohorts of patients with MoP implants prior to 2002 will not be a reliable direct comparator, because the overwhelming majority of the patients contributing to that data were over 70. The overall CRR are therefore likely to be a significant underestimate of the CRR that would have been produced if the Ultamet patients had been implanted with an alternative prosthesis.    </p>

This conclusion is supported by Professor MacGregor’s ready acceptance in crossexamination that from an epidemiological point of view it would be strange to use a cemented product as a comparator for the Ultamet. However, in view of the fact that the Pinnacle Ultamet prosthesis was implanted across all age groups, the material should not be confined to data relating to patients aged under 70. The Court must also bear in mind that the data on cemented MoP prostheses would improve the figures for survivorship, to the extent that such data reflects the likely performance of implants that would have been received by the elderly patients within the Ultamet cohort. </p>

Mr Whitwell said that there were cost implications with CoC articulations, which were significantly more expensive. There was also the risk of fracture, which had been reduced but not eliminated, and which made some clinicians (including Mr Whitwell) chary of recommending them. Ceramic on conventional polyethylene was the least popular combination at that time. </p>

A MoP hip also contained the highest wearing liner material of any of the articulations, which was also liable to degrade within the body over time, and therefore was likely to have the worst track record in terms of survivorship, but the claimants necessarily accept that its performance met the entitled expectation of safety. Therefore, the obvious comparator is an uncemented prosthesis with a MoP articulation using conventional polyethylene.  </p>

Admittedly some of the group of patients who received Pinnacle Ultamet prostheses may have received a CoC or CoP implant instead, but it is impossible to tell how many. Some of them may have had a resurfacing operation instead. An equally unknown number would not have had a total hip arthroplasty at all.  Any hip prosthesis containing third-generation ceramic material carried with it a higher risk of component fracture but a lower risk of aseptic loosening than MoP, which introduces unnecessary complications. Judging by the NJR data, the incidence of use of the alternative articulations using ceramic material was far smaller than for MoP. There was no long-term data relating to their survivorship over 10 years available in 2002; later data will be complicated by the introduction of the fourth-generation ceramic materials. In any event, the NJR data relied upon by the claimants indicates that the CRR of such other articulations were better than, though not significantly different from, the CRR they rely upon in respect of the performance of MoP, so looking at those other articulations is not really going to take matters further.  </p>

The whole purpose of the intentional cross-linking was to produce a harder wearing and more durable surface; if and to the extent that succeeded (as the short-term scientific information on its performance suggests that it has) one would expect data relating to the cross-linked product or products to improve the CRR even in the short-term. There was some debate at trial about whether the inclusion of HXLPE in the NJR data made a statistically appreciable difference to the CRR for MoP over 10 years.  Bearing in mind all the non-statistical evidence, as well as the history leading to the development of the alternative harder bearing surfaces, one would expect the data to demonstrate metal on HXLPE articulations to have an appreciably better CRR than metal on conventional polyethylene.  </p>

When asked about this in crossexamination, she said she would expect the CRR to be better for HXLPE, over 20 years, but not necessarily in the short term, and she was not surprised by these results. It then transpired that she mistakenly thought that the material in conventional polyethylene may have improved since the data reported in the SHAR 2000 report. She did not agree that the similarities in the CRR could be explained by HXLPE being given to the more active patients and conventional polyethylene to less active patients (though other evidence suggested that this is precisely what would have happened; indeed, that was Mr Whitwell’s own practice from 2010 onwards).  </p>

Osteolysis was not a problem that only developed in the longer term. I have already referred to Dr Haas’s evidence about his own experience and that of his surgical colleagues regarding the development of osteolysis, with which the generic orthopaedic experts broadly concurred. Typically, it would arise at around 7-10 years after the primary implant, but it could arise earlier than that if the implant were subjected to greater wear. If there was insufficiently regular follow up with conventional X-rays, the condition would only be detected at a later stage, but it could have arisen much earlier. The development of harder wearing alternative articulating surfaces, including crosslinked polyethylene and HXLPE, was driven by the incidence of osteolysis, although the focus was on longer-term survivorship. </p>

If Ms Smith’s conclusions based on her analysis of the intra-Pinnacle data in the NJR were a reliable indicator of how HXLPE compared with conventional polyethylene, then as Mr Antelme pointed out, either the whole history of prosthetic development in the 1990s and 2000s was a complete waste of time, or else DePuy fortuitously happened to develop a particularly hard-wearing brand of conventional polyethylene (which was not the case).  </p>

Ms Smith was generally very careful not to trespass beyond the bounds of her expertise. The figures on which she relied were predictions of the likelihood of failure within 9 years of prostheses using different articulating surfaces. She could not give evidence about how these materials behaved in the real world, as the orthopaedic surgeons could and did.  Bearing in mind their evidence, I cannot accept that HXLPE made no appreciable difference to the survival rates of MoP articulations over the first 10 years after primary surgery. It is far more likely that it improved them, and thus that the inclusion of significant amounts of data pertaining to articulations using HXLPE would have materially improved the 10-year CRR for MoP articulations, to an unknown and unascertainable extent. </p>

It will be seen that the data for the younger and more active patients in Sweden who formed the minority of patients in that country had an insignificant statistical impact on the overall CRR – it was only when these data were segregated that it became clear that the overall revision rates were wholly unrepresentative of the revision rates that could be predicted for the younger patient cohorts. The same is likely to be true if the demographics of the patient group were reversed. Thus, although the higher actual and predicted revision rates for the younger and more active patients who would have formed the majority of the Ultamet cohort would be balanced to a limited extent by the lower revision rates for the elderly and less active patients who formed the minority, it is unlikely that the latter would have had a significant impact on the CRR for the entire cohort.  </p>

The report stated that approximately 12,000 young patients were included in the entire cohort (1979-1998) with a high failure rate, and that it was for these patients that further scientific effort was mandatory. In the under-55 age group the graph for revision for all causes showed a survival rate at 10 years of 81.2% with a confidence interval of 78.4-84.2% for implants in male patients, but after 16 years that had plummeted to 32.9% with a confidence interval of 31.5%-34.3%.

Ms Smith accepted that in the period from 1988-1998 the risk of revision within ten years for the younger groups was calculated to be around 20% for both sexes. That was the data which led the authors of the SHAR 2000 report to conclude that younger and more active patients were at greater risk of implant failure in all diagnostic groups. That was also the received wisdom in the orthopaedic community, supported by practical experience, at the time when the Pinnacle Ultamet was introduced onto the UK market.  </p>

However, the poor fixation techniques should have affected all patients who were implanted, irrespective of age; moreover, they appear to have been more of a problem with the cemented implants. The narrative in the report indicated that uncemented technology had a disappointing result in the cohort operated on <span style="text-decoration:underline">prior</span> to 1988, but that results had improved since then, especially in the post-1992 period when modern cup designs and active surface coating on the femoral component were used.

In order to test whether the fixation of uncemented prostheses unduly distorted those statistics, the predicted survivorship for hips implanted during that period should be compared with the figures for the 10-year period from the time when those fixation techniques were improved, i.e. 1992.

In that report, which was compiled with the benefit of the additional data collated since 1998, the definition of “revision” now included changes in prosthetic components. Just as in the 2000 SHAR report, wear, rather than poor fixation, was identified as the main cause for concern. By then there were 10 years of data available since the introduction of the changes to uncemented fixation techniques in 1992. The 2002 report states that developmental work on solving the problem of wear, with subsequent osteolysis and prosthetic loosening in younger patients, must continue, with the focus on alternative bearing surfaces that are more resistant to wear. Like the 2000 report, this is consistent with all the other evidence about the concerns that had been driving the search for alternative articulations during the preceding decade.  </p>

In other words, the analysis of the data indicated a statistical probability that between 92.4% and 93.1% of patients implanted with a prosthesis at any time within that 10-year period would not require revision surgery for at least 10 years. Conversely, there was a risk that between 6.9% and 7.6% of those hips would be revised within 10 years. That was the most recent period for which 10-year statistics were available at that time. The graphs for that period indicated a slight improvement over the 10-year figures for the survival curves of implants where the primary operation took place in 1986 and 1989 (which are very similar to each other), a greater degree of improvement over the survival curve for primary implants in 1983, and a vast improvement over the survival curve for primary implants in 1979. Apart from the 1979 cohort, the predicted survivorship of all cohorts to around 7 years is comparable, and then the later implants begin to show an improvement.   </p>

When the statistics are broken down, it can be demonstrated how unrepresentative the overall percentages are of the performance of an uncemented MoP implant at that time, irrespective of the age of the patient. For cemented implants, the extrapolated figures for the 1992-2002 period were 94.0% over 10 years (93.7%-94.4%), a little better than the overall figures for all implants referred to above, but for uncemented implants the same figures at 10 years were 77.6% (74.6-90.7). That is the equivalent of a CRR of 22.4%, despite the change in surgical techniques in 1992, though the top end of the confidence intervals suggested that the CRR could be much lower, 9.3%. These rates are much worse than the six-year CRR for patients with uncemented implants in the 2000 SHAR report. The confidence intervals are also far wider than with other cohorts, possibly indicating that the data is based on small numbers. However, the figures for all uncemented implants and all causes of revision are also far worse than the figures for revisions for aseptic loosening in patients with osteoarthritis. From this it can be deduced that the poor overall CRR are linked with revisions for fractures, infection or dislocation. The overall figures for uncemented implants in the SHAR 2002 report therefore need to be treated with circumspection.  </p>

The figures which <span style="font-style:italic">are</span> comparable (though not exactly, as the later data include exchanges of components in the definition of revision) are those for revisions of implants for aseptic loosening at 10 years for patients with a primary diagnosis of osteoarthritis. For uncemented implants, the survival rates in the 2002 SHAR report were 83.3% (80.1%-86.6%). Those figures are similar to the survival rates for uncemented implants in osteoarthritic patients revised for aseptic loosening over the 10 years from 1988-1998 recorded in the 2000 report. There is also an overlap between the confidence intervals, making the recorded CRR statistically consistent. I regard this as being of considerable importance. Once the unknown factor that affected the statistics for revisions for other diagnoses and causes is eliminated, the data reliably indicates that the CRR over 10 years for uncemented implants were much the same before and after the changes in surgical fixation introduced in 1992. Uncemented implants were still performing worse than cemented implants over the first 10 years and even on a conservative basis it was predicted that around 15% of them would fail in that time. This puts the CRR of 7.2% for all implants, 93% of which were cemented, into context. </p>

For patients aged under 55 this dropped to 87.6% (85.9%-89.3%).

By then the registry had over 20 years' worth of data since 1992 when the surgical techniques for uncemented prosthesis changed, against which the CRR that had been calculated in 2000 and 2002 could be compared. Survival rates for revisions for all causes and all diagnoses from the latest 10-year periods from 1994-2004 and from 2005-2014 were broadly consistent with each other at around 94%-95%, (so the overall CRR had dropped from 7.2% in the 2002 SHAR report, to approximately 5%-6%) with confidence intervals that either overlapped or were within 1% or 2% of each other.  </p>

Of course, the data concerning implants in the 10 years from 2005-2014 would include a considerable amount of data relating to metal on HXLPE articulations, even though for the longest periods of data collection within the 10 years observed, contributing to the Kaplan Meier analysis, most of the implants would still have been metal on conventional polyethylene.  </p>

Whilst those figures appear to have improved to less than 3% and 1.2% respectively in the 2005-2014 group, there is no overlap in the confidence intervals between the two groups of data, but a clear gap, indicative of a reason for the difference other than random variation, though the gap is not large.

What they do illustrate in broad terms is that over that period, hip implants in patients aged under 50 still have a worse survivorship record than those in patients aged 50-59, and both those groups have a worse survivorship record than implants in patients aged 60-75 and 75 and older. The worst performing group, women aged under 50, have an implant survival rate of 80% at around 12.5 years, whereas in men the rate is 80% at 14 years. For the group aged between 50 and 59, the 80% survival rate is to 15 and 16 years respectively. Therefore, for all the under-60s, at least 20% of hip implants were still failing before 16 years, mainly for aseptic loosening/osteolysis.

For those reasons, I conclude that the figures in the SHAR 2014 report for the decade from 2005-2014 are insufficiently representative of the likely performance of an uncemented metal on conventional polyethylene prosthesis available in 2002 for me to be able to rely on them, and that they should therefore be left out of further consideration. </p>

It is obvious that the CRR for a comparable uncemented MoP prosthesis would not have been as low as the 4.8% for the 1995-2004 cohort with osteoarthritis who were revised for aseptic loosening alone. In any event, one must compare like with like as far as is possible, and the NJR statistics relied upon for the CRR of the Pinnacle Ultamet prosthesis relate to revisions of all patients for all causes. The CRR for all uncemented implants in the SHAR 2014 report for the period 1995-2004 was 8.3%, though once the confidence intervals are taken into account, they could have been as low as 7.5%.  </p>

The figure of 13.98% was far better than the recorded CRR for all patients with uncemented implants in SHAR 2002, which was more than 20%, but those figures are much less reliable, for reasons I have already explained.

On that hypothesis, the claimants’ claim also fails because there is no reliable data on the performance of an appropriate comparator with which the performance of the Pinnacle Ultamet prosthesis can be compared.  </p>

She concluded that that there were only three registries, namely, the NJR, the Australian Registry and the New Zealand Joint Registry that were suitable to examine the performance of the Pinnacle Ultamet. She used the NJR as her primary source and looked at the data from the other two registries to see if it was broadly consistent, which she concluded it was.

A surgeon revising for ARMD could have ticked either or both these boxes. It was only on 1 December 2007 that a new version of the form was introduced with additional details to be filled in. These included a box indicating whether the patient had consented to the data being recorded. The new form also added information on the patient’s body mass index (BMI) and changed the options for recording reasons for revision. There was now a box marked “Adverse Soft Tissue Reaction to Particulate Debris”. Professor Pandit’s evidence, which I accept, was that in practice surgeons interpreted that box as referring to ARMD because soft tissue damage was generally associated with MoM articulations.

Compliance (coverage) refers to the proportion of operations in England and Wales that are reported to the NJR. Linkability compares the number of records submitted with the patient’s NHS number with the number of procedures recorded in the NJR. The NHS number is required to link all primary and revision procedures relating to a single patient. In the absence of the NHS number, it may be possible to use other information, such as the patient’s date of birth, name and address to link the records, but it is far less easy and such information may not be provided. </p>

They did this by reference to all hip and knee procedures, not by reference to hip procedures alone. The two sources of data were (1) the number of levies imposed on the sale of prostheses; and (2) the number of operations recorded by NHS databases (“HES” in England and “PEDW” in Wales).  </p>

There is also a degree of missing data relating to Pinnacle Ultamet specifically. It was common ground that not all such prostheses sold were recorded in the NJR. Relying on sales data produced by one of DePuy’s witnesses, Ms Erin McKibben, Ms Smith identified that only 78.4% of sales of Pinnacle Ultamet were recorded in the NJR. </p>

If a patient did not consent to their personal details being kept, or their consent was not recorded, that could result in the revision not being linked to the primary operation.

Plainly there was no data available at all for 2002, when the Ultamet was introduced. Ms Smith’s initial evidence was that data completeness and linkability of patient records in the NJR was 90% by 2007, but in cross-examination she explained that she was referring to linkability only; that was a reference to a figure given by the NJR itself for the percentage of operations for which a “person-level identifier” was available in 2007. Mr Spencer put to her that if one multiplied compliance by linkability, it was only around 63% in 2006-7, and one only got to 90% in 2010. Ms Smith said that was not the approach she would take, but she agreed that as a rough calculation of how many of the total operations in a year were in the registry and linkable, the figure of 87.29% was produced for the year 2007-2008. On her approach, the percentage of usable data only reached 89.2% in the calendar year beginning January 2007. The two percentages are not that far apart, and both are still below the 90% of usable data that the experts regarded as optimal. Coverage in SHAR, by contrast, was over 90% at all material times, 98% in the 2014 report.  </p>

Even the data drawn on for some of the cohorts with less than 10 years’ data would have been drawn on usable data of less than 90%.  Therefore, by the time of the trial, the NJR data had not yet reached the stage where there was reliable ten-year follow-up from cohorts with at least 90% of useable data. The data used to produce CRR over shorter periods, especially in the period up to April 2010, when the first set of MHRA guidance on MoM hip prostheses came out, would be even less reliable. </p>

Ms Smith said that she would be surprised if there were a large amount of bias and the situation was consistent with a general lack of data from different surgical centres rather than from different types of patient. She referred to attempts made over the years by the NJR to ascertain if there were any systemic differences between the characteristics of patients in NHS data that were in the NJR and the characteristics of patients that are not in the NJR, which did not reveal such differences, and to studies that she herself had carried out to like effect.  </p>

However, he contended that the missing data still gave rise to some uncertainty because of surgeon factors. The centres that did not return the data may have had surgeons who performed far more (or far fewer) revisions than might be expected, and whose revision rates might have had a distorting impact on the overall data – known as statistical “outliers”. I am bound to say that I am sceptical about this, as the overall acceleration in revision rates, including by the outliers, largely took place in and after 2010, after a time when the data set was much more complete. </p>

If the NJR had gathered data on metal on conventional polyethylene prostheses and split it by cemented, uncemented, hybrid and reverse hybrid fixations, there would have been a viable argument that the Court (or the experts) could extrapolate figures for comparison purposes that were more reliable than those based on the Swedish data. However, I am not persuaded that it is possible to use the data from the NJR to produce a sufficiently reliable figure for the CRR over 10 years of a metal on conventional polyethylene prosthesis that might have been implanted in the same class of patients as received a Pinnacle Ultamet. There is insufficient information to be able to carry out that exercise, and there is far too much guesswork involved in trying to factor in all the variables and take account of the confounding factors.  </p>

The figures in the NJR for MoP are not reliable for this purpose, not just because of the mix of conventional and cross-linked and HXLPE and the inclusion of later products in the statistics, but also because most patients who were actually given MoP hips, certainly at the start of the 10-year period, would have been the older, less active patients, many of whom would never have been candidates for receiving a Pinnacle Ultamet prosthesis.

The much wider confidence intervals in the Australian data also invite caution. Overall, I am not persuaded that the Australian data provides reliable support for the NJR figures, particularly since the Australian data is confined to the intra-Pinnacle comparison which I have already held to be the wrong comparison for the purposes of evaluating the entitled expectation of safety. </p>

Ms Smith explained that if the PTIR per 1,000 patient years for ARMD was 9.2 it would mean that if one observed 200 patients each for five years, 9 of those 200 procedures would have been revised for ARMD in that time, but the figures would change if the time observed was different.

It was accepted that uncemented prostheses and prostheses implanted in younger patients had higher CRR than cemented prostheses. However, these confounders alone would not account for the differences in the CRR recorded in the NJR report. Ms Smith carried out a flexible parametric survival model to estimate revision rates for exactly the same types of patients to reduce the risk of bias for these factors, among others, and concluded that although there is some impact, the revision rates for Pinnacle MoM Ultamet implants with Corail stems (the only group on which there was sufficient data to perform the analysis) were still significantly higher than those for other bearing surfaces.

Whilst I agree that more research would be desirable, it seems to me to be difficult to make the assumption that BMI would make no appreciable difference, in the light of the engineering evidence about the role that loading, as well as other complex and variable factors which will vary from patient to patient, will have on the wear of a bearing. </p>

Professor MacGregor confirmed that the suggestions in guidance issued by NICE in 2014 that greater activity impacts on the need for revision came from surgeons, from the experience of an assessment group and from discussion in the orthopaedic community.

There are numerous complex factors affecting loading on the hip joint even before individual factors such as weight or BMI are taken into consideration. Professor Fisher pointed out that jogging or running increases the loading and the wear produced on all bearings, but it may only account for 10% or 20% of overall activity. In the 1990s, Dr Haas told his patients not to jog. Likewise, climbing stairs increases the loading, but that is something that may happen less often than walking around the house. Individual patients undertake different types of activity with different levels and intensity; a young active patient may undertake double the number of loading cycles on the implant per year than those undertaken by an elderly inactive patient. The information from SHAR provides some support for the view that revision rates are likely to be higher in younger and more active patients. </p>

She said that age and health status could be used as partial proxies, but they are not perfect measures because some patients will not fit the age and health profile. It was common ground between the orthopaedic experts that there are no good surrogates for activity in other data that has been gathered. As Dr Haas suggested, and Mr Whitwell confirmed, in broad terms activity does not correlate with age in patients aged between 55 and 70, but it may do so outside that range, though there will still be exceptions. There may be 80-year olds who run marathons and paraglide, and very inactive 50-year olds, particularly if they have co-morbidities, or if whatever has caused the need for revision has restricted their activity levels. The mismatch between age and activity is accentuated when prostheses are selected on the basis of activity rather than age.

The NJR tables relating to all prostheses and all patients, indicate that the 10-year CRR for CoC are 4.62% with confidence intervals of 3.92%-5.42% whereas the CRR for MoP are similar or better - 3.92% with confidence intervals of 3.33%-4.60%.

If the MoP articulations were mainly offered to the least active patients within each age band, and the hardest articulations, including CoC, were mainly offered to the most active, there is nothing particularly surprising about the rates of wear being comparable.

It is reasonable to assume that the alternative bearings, including HXLPE and CoC, might be offered to more active patients, as that was the very reason for their development. The NJR data stratified by age suggests that CoC was mainly offered to the youngest (and thus most active) cohort. However, as DePuy pointed out, the ability to provide a larger head, at least in the earlier years, might also have prompted a surgeon to choose a MoM articulation for an active patient instead of one of the alternative hard bearings, which means that the numbers of active patients falling within the datasets for the latter will not represent the full cohort of active patients. There were concerns about fractures in CoC, at least until the fourth generation was introduced, and that was long after the Ultamet came onto the market. This might have inhibited surgeons from implanting a third-generation CoC articulation in a more active patient. Mr Whitwell was very chary about using CoC. </p>

He said he would have liked patients to have more regular follow-ups with X-rays which would pick up signs of osteolysis earlier. He accepted that if there had been a similar system of review for osteolysis for MoP hips as there was for MoM from 2010 onwards, there would have been some earlier revisions of MoP hips.

However, the dissimilar monitoring of MoP hips meant that cases of osteolysis, or other reasons for revision which might have been detected much earlier in comparator prostheses were not detected, which would confound the statistics to an unknown extent. Ms Smith accepted that there was potential bias and confounding in relation to asymmetric monitoring when considering reasons for revision as a whole.

If the revision was a relatively straightforward exercise, as it would if there were just a head or liner swap, this would be a further factor weighing in the balance in favour of revising.  </p>

It was understandable given his experience from working in a tertiary centre of what could happen to a patient with serious soft tissue damage; some of the surgeons in the lead claims had similar experiences before they operated on the claimants.

She said that he demonstrated that there was a statistically significant variation between the surgeons who performed revisions of the Pinnacle Ultamet, but that his analysis did not reveal how much of this was due to random variation. Therefore, Ms Smith carried out a “funnel plot” analysis, which is the technique used by the NJR to identify individual surgeons with higher than expected revision rates. As she explained, a funnel plot is able to distinguish between a variation which is random in nature and that which is statistically significant.

They undertook up to 69% of all the Pinnacle Ultamet prostheses used as primary implantations in the earliest years of the NJR. Data from patients implanted in those years was particularly important for the 10-year CRR relied upon by the claimants. Overall, the four surgeons accounted for around 10% of the total number of prostheses implanted, but just under a fifth of the total revision rates identified by Ms Smith. On her figures (which were based on the slightly higher CRR in the 2016 NJR report, as she did not have the 2017 report when she did the calculations) the 10-year CRR for the Pinnacle Ultamet for those surgeons alone were 26.02%, whereas for the non-outlying surgeons the CRR were 12.94%. Ms Smith said, though she did not provide evidence of her workings, that if one counterbalanced this by taking into account the outliers below the confidence limit, the 10-year CRR for the 4 surgeons would go down to around 18% and the CRR for non-outlier surgeons would be around 13.3%.  </p>

NICE and orthopaedic surgeons generally would have known that the benchmark was unlikely to have been achieved in practice if an existing uncemented metal on conventional polyethylene prosthesis was implanted in a younger or more active patient.  </p>

All other factors being equal, such a prosthesis might be regarded as less suitable for use, or less clinically effective, than a product which met the target revision rate; but all other factors might not be equal, and such factors as the ease of revision and the risk of dislocation might have an impact on that assessment, as NICE itself acknowledged in the guidance.  </p>

Thus if, for example, 12% or 13% of prosthesis type A were likely to require revision within 10 years, it does not necessarily follow from the fact that that prosthesis did not meet the target in the NICE guidelines that it would not meet the expectation of performance (measured solely in terms of survivorship) let alone the expectation of safety, that the public generally was entitled to expect.  That would remain the position even if it were demonstrated that a different type of prosthesis, prosthesis B, had a CRR of only 6% within 10 years, i.e. its performance was twice as good as that of prosthesis A. Those facts might well lead to prosthesis A being withdrawn from the market over time, because it was comprehensively out-performed by prosthesis B, which clinicians who became aware of the revision rates would plainly choose in preference; but it would not necessarily follow that prosthesis A was defective. </p>

That evidence was somewhat at odds with his written report, which suggested that the NICE 2014 guidance reflected the “minimum acceptable level of performance” of hip prostheses from 2000 onwards.

Logically that would mean that if it later transpired that the information on which a target rate for early failure of the “best performing” prosthesis was based at the time the product goes onto the market was unduly pessimistic, and the target was revised accordingly years later, the fact that the product failed to meet the revised target rate could be relevant in determining the entitled expectation of safety <span style="font-style:italic">even if</span> it met the original target.

However, if the product met or was within reasonable parameters of the target rate that was thought to be acceptable at the relevant time, it does not matter whether it would have met a lower target rate which might or would have been set if NICE had known in 2000 what it knew in 2014.

Even with a metal head, it spreads the load and reduces micromotion.  Professor Hutchings explained why fluid ingress was less likely to be a problem with a spiral groove than it is with a smooth surface. It was his view, based upon a review of the literature on this topic, that taper grooving does not lead to enhanced material loss at the head taper and may even be beneficial.

The practical experience of the orthopaedic community was endorsed by the findings of SHAR in its 2000 report which contained the only data on long-term survivorship of prostheses at the time.

It was also known in the orthopaedic community that the histology around the earlier generations of MoM hip implants that had failed in the past was different from the histology around MoP hip implants. The regulators and the surgical community were expressly warned by DePuy that there was a risk that patients might develop an adverse reaction to the metal debris from the implant and that this could cause soft tissue damage, failure of the implant or even possibly cancer.

He was still playing golf around three times a week. Mr Haley’s GP, Dr Smith, saw him in August 2011 and diagnosed a groin strain. She referred him for physiotherapy. An entry in the physiotherapist’s notes for 24 November 2011 recorded that the symptoms had been abolished and that Mr Haley was walking well. Mr Haley’s recollection was that the pain did not go away completely, but that the physiotherapy eased it considerably.  </p>

One evening at home he saw a TV programme in which mention was made of patients with MoM hip replacements suffering damage to their soft tissues. This prompted him to have the hernia checked out by his GP. He saw Dr Smith on 4 February and asked if he could have an MRI scan, but she explained that they did not have access to specialist (i.e. MARS) MRI equipment. She ordered an X-ray, which showed nothing of concern, but decided to refer him to Mr Eskander in case he needed checking up because of his MoM hip replacement.  </p>

He noted that Mr Haley had no significant problems with his left hip and that he walked long distances unimpeded. He described the small muscle hernia as being of “no clinical significance” but stated that in accordance with recent guidelines governing MoM hip replacements he was referring Mr Haley for blood measurements of his Co and Cr levels and for ultrasound examination of the left hip to confirm or rule out ALVAL lesions. If the tests were negative, he would keep him under annual radiological review, and if they were positive he would recommend referral to the revision hip centre. Mr Eskander explained that he could treat the hernia with a cortisone injection but said that he would leave it if Mr Haley was not in pain (which was the case). </p>

When Mr Haley had the next consultation with Mr Eskander, the results of the blood tests had not yet arrived. Mr Eskander told him the ultrasound findings did not suggest that there was a problem. Mr Haley was not keen to have the apparent bursitis treated, and so, subject to the results of the blood tests, Mr Eskander planned to see him again in a year’s time. Mr Haley remembered asking what would happen if the blood ion levels were high, and Mr Eskander said that in that event, Mr Haley may have to undergo a hip revision.   </p>

However, Mr Haley’s readings were also above the 7ppb threshold in the MHRA guidance.

At that point Mr Webb broke the bad news that the MRI scan showed a large pseudotumour sitting around his hip on the left side. It was tracking distally down the thigh as well as up. There was lysis (loosening) in his proximal femur and possibly in his acetabulum as well. Mr Webb said that Mr Haley was facing revision surgery and that given the state of his MRI scan they would need to get on and do this fairly soon. He explained that the pseudotumour was around his sciatic nerve so that it would have to be dissected carefully. He told Mr Haley that removal of the pseudotumour would potentially leave him with some instability and warned of the possible risk of dislocation in the future. After discussing the pros and cons of surgery, Mr Haley agreed to have the revision, and this was carried out on 29 November 2012.  </p>

Notes taken by a cardiologist in July 2013 record that he was able to play golf and walk some 2-3 miles without too much trouble.

The expert orthopaedic surgeons in his case, Mr Kim and Professor Kay, agreed that the degenerative changes in his right hip are likely to play a role in his ongoing hip pain and ongoing mobility. Contemporaneous medical records bear this out. In November 2014 Mr Webb noted that he now had a Trendelenburg gait but was compensating for it fairly well. His left foot drop will impact on his mobility and it is likely that any residual weakness is secondary to the foot drop. </p>

He thought it was so good that it must have been mis-reported, but there is nothing to support that suggestion. Mr Jones himself referred to the Oxford hip score in his letter of 21 January 2013, which is unlikely if there were any doubt about the result. </p>

The GP considered this to be mechanical pain from her lumbar spine, an opinion shared by Mr Owen, DePuy’s orthopaedic expert in this case, who was not cross-examined about this. An X-ray taken in December 1998, at a time when she was experiencing lower back pain, had showed degenerative changes in her spine, and her lumbar spondylosis had got worse. </p>

Mr Jones wrote back to the GP to reassure Mrs Emery that this was not the case. In the event, she did not have a further consultation with him, and no further blood ion tests were taken. Unfortunately for Mrs Emery she had further respiratory problems which led to her spending Christmas 2016 in hospital.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The evidence in support of the conclusion that Mrs Emery suffered from ARMD necessitating revision surgery is overwhelming. The pattern of her symptoms was consistent with such a diagnosis; she developed pain around two years after her primary operation, and it continued and gradually increased in intensity up to the date of the revision. There was a large thick-walled pseudotumour, and the radiologist who carried out the MRI scan reported that the findings were compatible with a reaction to metal. The histology was entirely consistent with those findings. Overall, she is a good illustration of a patient whose symptoms and investigations pointed to a clinical diagnosis of ARMD, which was then borne out by the findings of a very experienced specialist orthopaedic surgeon at surgery and corroborated by the histological evidence. </p>

I accept the evidence of Mr Owen in this regard, supported by his findings upon examination, which ultimately was supported by the evidence of Mr Smith. There is no evidence of any significant symptoms or impairment to her function or mobility consequential on the revision and the fact she declined to see an orthopaedic consultant when afforded the opportunity to do so in April 2013 reinforces the impression that she was doing well. Medical records relating to her other problems are consistent with this; in May 2013 a consultant chest physician, Dr Lau, recorded that Mrs Emery “<span style="font-style:italic">successfully underwent revision of her hip</span>” and an anaesthetist’s assessment of her in September 2015 prior to her epigastric hernia repair recorded that apart from her chest condition “<span style="font-style:italic">she has no other medical problems</span>”. The acute pain reported in May 2016 was of recent origin and she had not been to see a GP complaining of hip pain at any point in the intervening period.

He was a generally fair and balanced witness who volunteered in the witness box that he wished to reappraise some aspects of the evidence in his expert’s report in the light of the oral evidence given at trial. DePuy criticised his reluctance to accept that if Dr Wilson’s and Professor Nelson’s evidence were accepted in the cases of Mrs Garratt and Mrs Blake, neither of those claimants had ARMD. I consider that this was more in keeping with a degree of diffidence about trespassing into an area that was a matter for the Court to determine, than with any conscious or subconscious desire to promote the claimants’ case.  </p>

At that time, she was also suffering pain in her right knee, which had been injected, though that only provided pain relief for a week. Her GP referred her to a consultant orthopaedic surgeon, Mr Taylor, at Lourdes Hospital, whose letter to the GP following that consultation on 2 June 2005 describes her as having discomfort in the whole of her knee and also particularly in her groin. The pain was significantly affecting her walking distance. X-rays confirmed that she had osteoarthritis of both hips and Mr Taylor felt that they were her main problem. His view was that although she was young (being then only 45) she needed bilateral hip replacements. Mrs Blake remembered that she was told by Mr Taylor that because of her age, if she had a hip replacement, she would have to have several revisions over the rest of her life. </p>

He told Mr Davidson that she was keen to have something done. Mrs Blake’s evidence was that the hip replacement had been such a success that she wanted a knee replacement. Mr Davidson noted that there was medial instability in the knee and that Mrs Blake could only walk with a crutch. He went through the pros and cons of a joint replacement with her, and advised her of the higher risk of infection to which she would be exposed, but she was keen to proceed.  In February 2008 she underwent a revision right total knee replacement.

He told the GP that he would review Mrs Blake again when he had all the results of the tests he had ordered to hand, and hopefully they could make a long-term plan at that stage. </p>

Mr Dunlop said the consensus at the time among his colleagues in the hospital and fellow members of the local forum of hip and knee surgeons was that increasing symptoms in a patient with a MoM hip prosthesis would warrant (surgical) exploration, and possibly revision. If he were to explore a MoM hip at that stage, the minimum he would have done, having opened it up, would have been to exchange the head and liner. However, before carrying out an exploration, he first wanted to rule out any other possible causes of Mrs Blake’s symptoms. </p>

There was a 4mm area of calcification/ossification noted in the trochanteric bursa as well.

As a first step, he would aspirate the joint and inject the bursa with a local anaesthetic and a steroid. He would contact her by telephone afterwards to find out if this had aided her symptoms. If it had no impact, he saw no other option but to explore the joint, replace the MoM bearing and assess the components intraoperatively for any loosening. That would also allow him to excise any bursa material and assess the abductor repair as a possible other source of her discomfort. Mrs Blake’s recollection was that Mr Dunlop said to her that he could not make a decision about what to do until he had gone in and found out what the problem was, but if he needed to revise the hip, he would revise it.  However, it appears from his letter to the GP that Mr Dunlop was going to replace the metal components of the prosthesis come what may - irrespective of whether there were any signs that she was suffering from ARMD. </p>

There was no targetable reason for having a revision other than unexplained pain.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In March 2016 Mrs Blake wrote a letter to her GP in which she said she knew there was a discussion about whether her right hip truly needed revision or not and that she had had over a year of trying to decide what to do. She made the decision to go for revision based on her pain, the difficulty she had in driving any distance, but also and most importantly, because her metal on metal hip on the left had “<span style="font-style:italic">failed drastically after three years and had all but destroyed her muscle in that leg and hip”</span>. That description of what had happened to her left hip prosthesis bears no resemblance to the contemporaneous medical notes; whilst I have no doubt that Mrs Blake sincerely believes that the primary implantation was a disaster, it would appear that over time she has convinced herself that matters were far worse than they really were. She subsequently underwent patient assessment for the revision surgery on the right hip, but it never took place. </p>

On 29 April 2017 Mr Khan agreed that the presenting complaint was now more suggestive of spinal origin than of hip pathology. He described how Mrs Blake had pain on both sides, but it was spreading down through the thighs down to her calves and that he considered it was more likely to be [a result of] lumbar stenosis. In consequence of that, it is no longer planned or anticipated that Mrs Blake should have a right sided hip revision. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Taken together, Mrs Blake’s symptoms prior to the revision surgery do not point towards a diagnosis of ARMD. The Hardinge approach, which was used in the primary surgery, involves cutting through the main muscle that controls the stability of the pelvis and stitching it back afterwards. A failure of the abductor repair following the Hardinge approach is quite a common occurrence, and it can lead to trochanteric bursitis. Unlike other surgeons in the lead cases who were faced with this possibility, to his credit Mr Dunlop did at least consider it. At surgery Mr Dunlop recorded that the abductor repair had failed. That was Mr Owen’s opinion of what was likely to have happened, and Mr Smith agreed that this might have been the cause of the problems that Mrs Blake was experiencing. On the balance of probabilities that would appear to be right.  </p>

There was a dispute between Mr Smith and Mr Owen as to whether it was consistent with fibromyalgia, but in their final submissions the claimants’ counsel rightly accepted that it was potentially consistent with referred pain, which is now thought to be the explanation for her similar symptoms on the other side. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">There is conflicting evidence as to when Mrs Blake first started to experience pain in and around the hip following the primary surgery. Given her various co-morbidities that is hardly surprising. The typical patient with ARMD will be initially asymptomatic, and will develop increasing pain over time, but there can be exceptions: as Mr Haley’s case suggests, someone can have a large pseudotumour without experiencing any significant pain at all (though the evidence in that regard could be attributable to Mr Haley’s stoicism). Whilst Mr Dunlop had the impression from what Mrs Blake told him in February 2009 that the pain had crept up on her insidiously over the years, it seems more likely from the medical records to have been of more recent origin. Whilst the timing and location of the pain could be consistent with ARMD, that is not the only explanation, nor is it the most likely one. </p>

The size of the extra-articular collection, 8cm x 4cm, was within the range for a trochanteric bursitis, albeit slightly larger than normal. The expert radiologists, Dr Ostlere and Dr Wilson, accepted that there was no record of any communication between the collection observed on the imaging and the joint. They did not see any images in this case, so had to rely on the contemporaneous report. Of course, there is a possibility that Dr Aniq failed to spot a communication, but this seems highly unlikely, given that Mr Dunlop had specifically asked him to look for “<span style="font-style:italic">any fluid collection around the hip which may be indicative of an allergic or vascular type problem with the hip”</span>.  </p>

Both radiology experts indicated that an experienced consultant radiologist was less likely to miss a connection, particularly if he was aware of the suspected pathology. They also agreed that if a consultant radiologist noted a collection around the greater trochanter he would be likely to look for the source of the collection. Dr Wilson said: “<span style="font-style:italic">the instant reaction of any competent radiologist would be to say where is it coming from and then to track it back, and ultrasound is a particularly effective technique at that because you can run the probe back to the ends and look and see if it’s tapering down”</span>. </p>

As Dr Wilson explained in his evidence, radiologists do not usually record negatives. That evidence accords with sense and logic – it would be a waste of time to note down everything seen that was normal. One can safely assume that the radiologist will only note down anything on the images that he considers to be significant, and that sufficient images will be taken to enable the radiologist to form a view about the overall effect of what he has seen. </p>

Whilst I do not doubt the sincerity of that view, it appears to have subconsciously fuelled an inclination on his part to find symptoms where none existed, and to explain away evidence that was either neutral or inconsistent with ARMD. I found some of his explanations or qualifications of Dr Wilson’s evidence, such as the one I have just referred to, implausible. Dr Ostlere candidly accepted that his approach had been to look for evidence to support the claimants’ case. He also appeared to be unduly swayed in his conclusions by the views of experts in other disciplines. I found Dr Wilson’s evidence more balanced and helpful, and preferred it in areas of disagreement between them. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The absence of any evidence that the collection communicated with the hip is consistent with the fact that the hip aspirate was dry. Of course, a “dry tap” is not conclusive evidence of the absence of fluid in the hip joint, because that result could be due to technical difficulties during the procedure. However, there was no evidence that Mr Dunlop encountered any such difficulties in this case; none was recorded, and Mr Owen said that for somebody of Mr Dunlop’s experience, a dry tap would be highly unusual. Mr Owen explained that if he had been actively looking for a joint effusion and got a dry tap, he would not just give up. He would speak to his radiology colleagues and perform the procedure again. That makes sense and accords with the likely approach of any surgeon. On the balance of probabilities, the combination of the dry tap and the radiology results in Mrs Blake’s case point firmly against a diagnosis of ARMD. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Next, I must consider the surgical findings by Mr Dunlop and the histopathology. There is no mention in the operation note of any necrosis of the soft tissues around the joint, which is the key feature of ARMD. There is no mention of any abnormal fluid within the hip joint or any hip effusion, and no mention of a pseudotumour. Whilst there was an abductor repair failure, the main muscles were intact, and whilst there was metallosis (metal staining) in the bursal tissue and the capsule, there was no obvious damage to the surrounding periarticular tissues. One cannot assume that because there was metallosis, there had to be a communication with the hip joint. Mr Dunlop did not notice any communication between the collection and the hip joint; as he clarified in his oral evidence, he simply assumed that there was one. A swab was taken, indicating that some fluid was present, but that is far too unspecific a finding for any inferences to be drawn from that – a collection of fluid was seen on the ultrasound. Mr Dunlop described the tissue he excised as “<span style="font-style:italic">abnormal</span>” and sent it off for histological examination, but I am satisfied that that was because of the metal staining and not because of anything else he had noticed. I was not persuaded by Mr Smith’s evidence that the clinical findings at revision were indicative of ARMD. </p>

It pains me to have to make such findings about any expert, particularly one who appeared to have an earnest desire to assist the Court, but Professor Freemont was an unreliable witness. He was evasive when challenged and produced convoluted explanations in an attempt to address the discrepancies between what he had written in his reports and the features of individual cases that were put to him in cross-examination. He appeared at times to be going to extraordinary lengths to support the claimants’ case or his own opinions, even when it was demonstrated that he could not possibly be right. I found his evidence frequently confusing and often contradictory. I reached the view, ultimately, that he had persuaded himself that he was right and honestly believed himself to be right, and that he had become so convinced by this that he refused to countenance any possibility that he might be wrong.

However, one would expect the authors of the papers to have given a more accurate description of the colour that they saw under the microscope than someone looking at reproductions of the slides in a copy of their work.  Professor Freemont was eventually driven to accept that none of the papers suggested that the colour of the cytoplasm (irrespective of whether it was brown, grey or blue) was a hallmark or even an indicator that there had been an adverse reaction to particles of metal in the body. The most that they suggested was that the colour of the cytoplasm was due to nanoparticles of cobalt or chromium. There was nothing in them to suggest any link with ARMD. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Mrs Stalker was born on 25 June 1930. She underwent a left total hip arthroplasty on 2 May 2007. She subsequently underwent a right total hip arthroplasty using a Pinnacle MoM prosthesis on 17 November 2007. She was then aged 77. The latter prosthesis was revised on 15 December 2011 when Mrs Stalker was 81 years old. The liner and head were exchanged. The cup and stem remained. DePuy accepts that Mrs Stalker had a reaction to metal debris, but denies that it was an adverse reaction, or that she required a revision as a result of an ARMD. </p>

Her witness statement, signed on 6 December 2016, was therefore admitted under the Civil Evidence Act, but its contents were not agreed. The Court heard evidence from the orthopaedic surgeon who performed both the original and the revision operation on Mrs Stalker, Mr Antoni Nargol, to whom reference has been made earlier in this judgment. Mr Nargol is an experienced surgeon specialising in hip replacement and revision surgery. He has performed many MoM revision operations – he said, over 400 in the last 8 years. It came to light at a much later stage in the trial that he was the most prevalent of the “outlier” surgeons identified in the NJR statistics. He contributed to some of the scientific research papers that were referred to in this litigation.  </p>

These matters were properly disclosed in his witness statement. However, he failed to disclose, until it was elicited in cross-examination, that he had also acted as a paid consultant for claimants in the <span style="text-decoration:underline">current</span> litigation (though not for Mrs Stalker’s case). I was not unduly concerned by this, even though he should have mentioned it, but unfortunately it was far from the only point of justifiable criticism that was made by DePuy about his evidence. </p>

He brought this to the attention of Mrs Stalker’s solicitors. In his evidence in chief, Mr Nargol amended his statement to set out what he said was an accurate transcription of that note (which included words that had been omitted). If he had gone to the trouble of retrieving the original document to satisfy himself of what he had recorded, and had used it for that purpose at the time, it is difficult to understand how Mr Nargol came to allow an uncorrected, inaccurate and incomplete transcription of it to remain in his statement when he signed it.  </p>

However, it is troubling that the only explanation he could give for the fact that, despite his checking the original, the inaccurate transcription was included in a witness statement to which a statement of truth was attached, was that “<span style="font-style:italic">the writing that I’ve written in the operation note is really poor and it is difficult to read</span>.” That was manifestly incorrect: unlike the note of the primary operation, the handwriting is relatively easy to decipher, (even by someone other than the author), and is certainly more legible than the copy with the overwriting on it.  </p>

Either he did not check the original operation note before he made his statement, as he said he had, or any check was so perfunctory that he did not appreciate that the transcription was inaccurate, or he did not consider the differences to be worthy of correction. The transcription in his witness statement of his note of the primary operation was also inaccurate, though the error did not materially affect the gist of what was recorded. At its lowest, Mr Nargol was careless about the content of a witness statement to which he was prepared to append a signed statement of truth. That led me to have concerns about his appreciation of the importance of accuracy, both in terms of making records and in terms of giving evidence. </p>

When faced with contemporaneous evidence that did not support Mrs Stalker’s case, Mr Nargol was evasive or tried to explain it away; he also sought to bolster evidence he plainly believed to be helpful to her. In either case, he sometimes volunteered explanations that flew in the face of the contemporaneous documents, and that were not in his witness statement.  </p>

He said that where he had a specific recollection he would make it clear. Unfortunately, on those occasions when he sought to draw on such “specific recollections” in his oral evidence, on the most benevolent interpretation of that evidence, he appeared to be reconstructing what he thought must have happened. He was dismissive of any views that did not coincide with his. He was also prone to expressing himself in overly dramatic terms. </p>

I found Mr Nargol to be, in many respects, a witness on whose evidence the Court could not safely place any weight. His unreliability has complicated the Court’s task of ascertaining whether, on the balance of probabilities, Mrs Stalker did suffer from ARMD. However bad an impression he made in the witness box, it does not mean that he is not a good surgeon.  </p>

At times, he tried to anticipate the questions in crossexamination and get his retaliation in first. For those reasons, I was driven to treat his evidence with some caution, although most of the time he made concessions where appropriate and gave sound reasons to justify his opinions. I had no similar reservations about any of the other orthopaedic experts, irrespective of who called them, though Mr Smith’s oral evidence was an improvement on his written reports.

Mr McMurtry saw Mrs Stalker on 15 March 2007. He noted that over the past six months she had had increasing pain from the left hip which was starting to significantly impact on her lifestyle. She did not go out very much at all and was severely limited in her walking distance. She had an obvious limp on the left. Her right leg was about 1½ cm short, secondary to the hip fracture.

Mrs Stalker had been fitted by a physiotherapist with a heel raise on the right shoe, and she was now mobile with one stick with reasonable balance. She was going up and down stairs unaided. Mr McMurtry noted that the right hip was still quite painful, with no internal rotation.

She had severe pain in her right groin and thigh. Her right hip was very stiff. The X-ray showed that the cannulated screws were in place but there was a collapse of the lateral part of the femoral head with osteoarthritis. Mr Nargol said that he did not believe that just simply removing the cannulated screws would work, and that she needed a total hip replacement using a Corail stem. Mr Nargol explained that his plan would have been to use a MoM configuration because Mrs Stalker had a smaller anatomy and therefore needed a 50mm cup. He agreed that she would not have been able to use a 36mm polyethylene liner at that stage. In re-examination, he said that he could have put in a 32mm MoP articulation. Of course, that would have meant using a smaller sized femoral head, increasing the risk of dislocation (which, it will be seen, was something that Mrs Stalker was really worried about). </p>

Around six weeks after the surgery, in January 2008, she was described as having “reasonable” abductor muscle control. That was something that Mr Nargol, who had used the Hardinge approach, said he would have checked for, particularly to ensure that the repair to the abductor muscle had not failed. He said that he would have expected some weakness of the muscle at that stage. At her follow-up consultation three months after the operation (on 20 February 2008) she was described as having no pain, no stick and good muscle power.

An assessment of Mrs Stalker by Social Services on 3 December 2008 indicated that she could get around indoors and could manage stairs; she could do light housework but needed help with heavy work, and she needed someone to go with her to help her when she went shopping.

The letter said that it appeared that a small number of patients with MoM articulated hip joints had developed problems after their surgery, potentially due to metallic wear, which in some cases was not consistent with the outcomes expected following hip joint replacement. These problems could present with pain and reduced mobility. The number of patients experiencing problems was less than one in a hundred, and therefore in most cases there would be no issue. The letter explained that all patients who had had such an implant should receive an annual follow-up appointment for the first five years following the implant. Mr Nargol’s evidence was that the letters were sent to different cohorts of patients, beginning with those who had received ASR MoM hips, then patients who had received Pinnacle MoM hips, and finally other patients who had received different MoM hip replacements. </p>

However, she was contacted again in early 2011 as part of the follow-up process, and on this occasion she kept the appointment. Mrs Stalker was seen in Mr Nargol’s clinic by a nurse practitioner on 18 January 2011. She recorded that Mrs Stalker’s Harris hip score was 91 (out of a possible 100), which was classed as “excellent” under that system. Her UCLA score was also good. She had no hip pain and scored the maximum on her range of motion, and although she was recorded as only being able to walk 200-300 metres, that was consistent with her presentation prior to the surgery. All these findings were very satisfactory, and Mrs Stalker was very satisfied with her hip.

Mr Nargol reviewed the test results (which he described at the time as “surprising”) and the results of X-rays, which he described as excellent, and instead of ordering another blood test three months later, he decided to order an ultrasound of the right hip immediately, to check for fluid. In his oral evidence, Mr Nargol explained that this approach was taken in the Nuffield Health Tees centre for all patients with Pinnacle MoM implants even if they were wholly asymptomatic, if the cobalt levels were higher than 4 ppb.

Mr Nargol told the Court that this was purely based on the fact that she had a Pinnacle MoM hip. He also said that he made a note that her cup size was 50mm because his own personal experience by then was that the 50mm cup sizes seemed to be failing at a higher rate than larger prostheses. Yet the MHRA guidance at the time stated that the size of cup was relevant only to resurfacing. Mr Kim, DePuy’s orthopaedic expert in this case, observed that a link with cup size was not established by evidence in the orthopaedic literature, and Ms Smith found that the size of the cup was not statistically significant once gender and age are taken into account.  </p>

Far from being “abundant”, there was no detectable joint effusion on the ultrasound. Dr Wilson’s view was that although the images were in keeping with an extra-articular collection, they could also be interpreted as showing an area of boggy tissue. It is possible that Dr Raju, having seen a collection in that area, assumed that there must be a connection with the joint. If he subscribed to Dr Ostlere’s view that a collection round the trochanter in a patient with a MoM prosthesis means ARMD unless and until proved otherwise, that is a highly likely scenario.   </p>

To an extent, therefore, Mr Nargol may have been led astray by his radiologist, whose confusing statements he made no attempt to clarify, even though it appeared from his evidence that the two of them had regular discussions and worked closely together.

Professor Pandit said in his expert report that although isolated reports do exist in literature about an association between metal ion levels around a MoM hip and ARMD, no long-term large studies have been carried out to establish thresholds for revision of MoM hips for suspected ARMD based on the metal ion levels in intra-articular fluid. There are no recommendations that suggest that measuring such levels is an appropriate method of monitoring or assessing a patient. His opinion, which was not challenged in cross-examination, was that “<span style="font-style:italic">there is no reliable data to assist clinicians on interpreting metal ion levels in intra-articular fluid”</span>.

He agreed that there would be a range of volumes on aspiration, and that 10ml would be “<span style="font-style:italic">quite normal</span>”. His evidence as to whether 15ml would be a cause for concern was confused, as he initially agreed that it would not be, and then on reflection said that it might.

One of the oddities in this case is that there is a single, high grade radiographic image which shows the needle stopping well short of the joint. Professor Kay described how a surgeon would see a series of lowgrade images as he was inserting the needle. He agreed that the normal practice would be to ask the radiographer to record the image when the needle was in its final position. Dr Ostlere said he assumed that the image in Mrs Stalker’s case was taken simply in order for the surgeon to make sure he was correctly aligning the needle. Unfortunately, Mr Nargol was not asked about that image and so he had no chance to explain it, but Dr Ostlere’s assumption makes sense in the context of Mr Nargol’s purpose in carrying out this procedure. There would be no point in an orthopaedic surgeon who is seeking to aspirate a hip joint deliberately leaving the needle short of the joint and drawing the fluid from somewhere else. That was Professor Kay’s view, and I agree with it. I am not prepared to find that a surgeon of Mr Nargol’s experience would have done such a thing if he was trying to aspirate the hip joint. He would know if he had made contact with the joint or not. </p>

None of the expert orthopaedic surgeons agreed with this, and there was no other evidence which would support it. Professor Pandit said in his expert report that he did not understand this and had not encountered any literature which would support such a conclusion. Surgeons will often note the colour of fluid at revision and reports of green or brown fluid have been made; the findings may be variable. The normal colour of synovial fluid is yellow (straw-coloured) and therefore it might have been thought that the presence of yellow fluid was either neutral or reassuring.

The presence of fibrin is also a non-specific finding. Professor Nelson’s evidence was that the immunological reaction seen and described by him as allowing for a score of “low to moderate ALVAL” on the Campbell scale (which is not a diagnostic) could be a non-specific reaction in an already abnormal osteoarthritic joint, even after the patient has undergone a hip replacement.

That evidence was initially based on two relatively low magnification images which he sought, unconvincingly, to equate to the images in Mr Haley’s and Mrs Emery’s cases. He then sought to identify areas of “necrosis” on Professor Nelson’s higher-powered images, but this was done by seeking to persuade the Court that it was possible to see individual dead or dying cells in isolation (I prefer Professor Athanasou’s evidence that this is virtually impossible).

Professor Nelson pointed out that as this was a cross-section of tissue, some of the nuclei would be visible, but others would not, because the “slice” has not gone through the centre of each cell.  In any event, tissue is made up of a variable number of cells. Thus, even if an area of tissue has fewer cells in it, that does not mean that the tissue is necrotic; in this slide, the histological features of necrotic tissue, namely, dead cells, and “ghost” forms of collagen fibres and blood vessels, are absent.  </p>

This, I find, was yet another example of Professor Freemont searching around for a means of rehabilitating his views when the evidence on which he originally relied was shown not to support them.

Bearing in mind the evidence of the immunology experts (one of whom was the only toxicologist called to give evidence at trial) about the state of scientific research at present, this concept of sub-lethal toxicity appears to be completely novel. What is visible on the slides appears to represent the normal response of macrophages to the presence of a very tiny amount of metal debris. This was a further example of Professor Freemont making up a thesis to try and salvage some credibility after being proved wrong. The point was not put to Professor Nelson in cross-examination, and for good reason. </p>

Her presentation before and after revision surgery was very similar. There was a consensus between Professor Kay and Mr Kim that, whilst a patient who had a failure of an abductor repair following surgery using a Hardinge approach would be expected to exhibit signs of weakness following primary surgery, and to walk with a limp, there are some patients who are able to compensate functionally for failed abductors.

On the other hand, if the abductor damage was a result of ARMD progressively destroying Mrs Stalker’s muscles in the period leading up to revision, both Professor Kay and Mr Kim would have expected to see a corresponding reduction in function and increasing pain in that period.

The macrophage pattern was very different from that seen in the cases of Mr Haley and Mrs Emery. It was consistent with a mild immunological reaction to metal debris that was insufficiently severe to cause any tissue damage, and/or chronic inflammation consistent with the underlying osteoarthritis. If what Mr Nargol saw was indeed a “<span style="font-style:italic">very large pseudotumour</span>” which was responsible for the damage to the abductors then, taking into account all the relevant expert evidence at trial, it is more likely than not that the histological findings would have been of a similar nature to those seen in the cases of Mr Haley and Mrs Emery. The histopathology is not in keeping with what Mr Nargol recorded in his note. It is impossible to reconcile them.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Some of the factors on which Mr Oppenheim relied take Mrs Stalker’s case nowhere. Nothing can be deduced from the fact that Mrs Stalker had slightly elevated (but fluctuating) levels of blood metal ions prior to the revision, and they came down afterwards; that is what one would expect of any patient who had an implant with a MoM articulation that was replaced by other materials and therefore was no longer in a position to shed metal debris. The blood ion levels are not a diagnostic factor, but a means of screening those patients who may be at risk. I have rejected Mr Nargol’s evidence that the aspirate taken from the hip joint was opaque. Even if it were, nothing can be deduced from that or from its colour. Mr Oppenheim referred to Mr Kim’s acceptance that the weakness of the external rotators could not be ascribed to a failed Hardinge repair – but whilst ARMD was one possible explanation for that feature, nobody suggested that it was the only explanation. She had weak external rotators even after the revision surgery but there was nothing in the operation note that indicated that any muscles other than the abductors had been damaged. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Oppenheim also relied on the size of the tissue samples excised and sent off for analysis. Professor Kay had referred in his evidence to the difficulties that surgeons encountered in excising the contents of pseudotumours; Mr Oppenheim submitted that it would be odd, to say the least, for a surgeon to excise so much tissue that his patient required a brace, if what he was really faced with was a case of chronic tendinopathy following a failed Hardinge repair. Although that submission has a superficial attraction, there are a number of answers to it. If the MRI image was indeed of an area of “boggy tissue” as Dr Wilson thought it might be, that might explain the extent of the excision. However even if it was purely a fluid collection, but he was working on the assumption that he was dealing with a pseudotumour, Mr Nargol would expect to find soft tissue damage in that area. What he found were signs of chronic inflammation, and thus it is unsurprising that he tried to ensure that he had cleared out anything that he believed might get progressively worse and cause further problems in the tissues around the joint even after he had swapped the head and liner. </p>

The burden is on the claimant to establish, on the balance of probabilities, that she suffered from ARMD, and in my judgment, standing back and considering the whole of the evidence, she has failed to do so. Had I been persuaded otherwise, the evidence indicates that Mrs Stalker has made a very good recovery from her revision surgery, and that the problems she has experienced since then are referable to other factors. </p>

That gives rise to insuperable problems in terms of causation, even if Mrs Garratt could prove that she did develop ARMD and her Pinnacle prosthesis was revised because of it. There was no evidence from which the Court would be able to infer anything about the likely survivorship of an implant that was used in a revision procedure. The claimants’ case depended on a comparison of the risks of failure of <span style="font-style:italic">primary</span> implants within the first 10 years after implantation, and the experts were agreed that revisions were generally associated with worse outcomes than primary surgery, though the outcomes in an individual case depended on a variety of factors. </p>

An X-ray of both hips in June 1992 showed moderate degenerative changes of osteoarthritis affecting the right hip joint, although the left hip joint remained relatively normal at that time. Nothing was done at that point, possibly because it was felt that she was too young. In February 1997, the pain in her hips was sufficiently bad for her to consult her GP.

Histology tests for rheumatoid arthritis proved inconclusive. At a review seven weeks later, she appeared to be making excellent progress and mobilising well with a good range of movement.

Four years after the total hip replacement, in 2001, Mrs Garratt was reported as being delighted with her hip. However, in 2003, when she consulted a cardiologist for an unrelated problem, he noted that her exercise was currently limited by painful hips. On 10 August 2004 she saw the GP because of left hip pain, and an X-ray confirmed evidence of degenerative change in that hip with mild/moderate loss of the joint space and a little marginal osteophyte formation. She was subsequently referred to Ms Muirhead Allwood at the London Hip Unit, with a view to having a left total hip replacement. Mrs Garratt had been carrying out some research and was interested in a new procedure that Ms Muirhead Allwood was carrying out; in oral evidence Mrs Garratt said she may have read an article about this in a newspaper. </p>

The left total hip arthroplasty was carried out on 1 December 2004 using what appears to have been a new design of Zimmer CoP prosthesis, and Mrs Garratt appears to have had an uneventful recovery. </p>

She said she wanted to see a private consultant again, and was referred to Mr Marsh at Somerset Nuffield hospital. Mr Marsh’s letter to the GP following his consultation described Mrs Garratt as a very interesting example of the evolution of hip arthroplasty. He stated that her right Charnley had become painful in the last 12 months or so, and showed typical signs of loosening of the acetabular component, which was to be expected at 10 years plus. In his evidence Mr Marsh agreed that radiological imaging would have shown gaps between the bone and the prosthesis and that the “cup effectively rattles within”. He said that most studies say that 10% to 15% of such implants are loose at ten years, and agreed that it was not a great surprise when problems arose with a Charnley hip after about ten years, especially with an active patient (as Mrs Garratt was). </p>

He reassured Mrs Garratt that it was technically a very straightforward matter to convert to an appropriate modern cementless design with a hard bearing (i.e. one where both the head and liner were made of hard materials). She was keen to proceed with this. Mr Marsh explained in his oral evidence that the Charnley stem had to be changed because it had a 22mm head and could not be retained for modern designs. He offered Mrs Garratt a Pinnacle hip with a 36mm femoral head and liner in a 54mm cup, because of its stabilising qualities. He viewed this as important because the incidence of dislocation in revision surgery is much higher than in primary surgery, and the large head gave a much more stable platform. He said that if he had wanted to use a material other than metal, he would not have been able to use such a large head. He considered that Mrs Garratt was fit for her age and that she could well live for another 15 years. </p>

Mr Marsh had to extract the first prosthesis completely as well as excising the cement. Aseptic loosening of a primary Charnley hip usually demanded complete replacement of the prosthesis, which was more complex than a simple head and liner exchange. There was a trochanteric fracture during the operation, which Mr Marsh repaired using two Dall-Miles cables to hold the bone back in place. This was a normal incidental risk of removing the original prosthesis. Mr Marsh did not alarm Mrs Garratt by telling her about this afterwards; he said he would not have done so unless he needed to carry out a massive reconstruction procedure. He fitted a KAR stem because this was revision surgery. He explained that it was the middle stem of the Pinnacle range and extended beyond the area of cement and into virgin bone where you can get good ingrow.

He noted that her walking distance decreased due to tiredness in the legs, which appeared to be of spinal origin. On examination, her right total hip arthroplasty was freely mobile, she had a negative Trendelenburg test, there was no pain on walking and no significant features on X-rays. Mr Marsh thought that was all encouraging for a revision. Mr Marsh reported to the GP that the symptoms sounded very much like low-grade spinal stenosis. Mrs Garratt did not want that investigated at that stage, but his next plan would be to have an MRI of the spine if the pain persisted. However, in the event, the pain appears to have settled. </p>

Mr Marsh was aware that concerns were being expressed in the orthopaedic community that, besides early failure, there may be systemic problems due to the metal debris.

The fluid collection had tended to wrap around the greater trochanter. It did not say there was any communication with the hip joint and there was no report of any joint effusion.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Marsh considered that this fluid collection was consistent with an adverse reaction to MoM components; the idea that it might have been a bursitis does not appear to have crossed his mind. Mr Marsh’s explanation for failing to ask Dr Cooke to look again for any communication was that he was sure that he would have done “<span style="font-style:italic">as assiduous an investigation as he could, given the equipment available to him at that time”</span>. However, it became clear that Mr Marsh would not have asked Dr Cooke to look for a communication anyway, because he did not seem to appreciate that an extra-articular collection can only be classified as a pseudotumour if it communicates with the hip joint. </p>

In his letter to the GP he said: “<span style="font-style:italic">my experience with this situation is steadily developing and my advice is that Mrs Garratt should seriously consider having the metal/metal bearings changed to a metal/polyethylene. Unfortunately, this does mean exposing the prosthesis surgically, but I have reassured her that the femoral and acetabulum components per se do not have to be dismantled, and to just simply change the lining in the acetabular component and the femoral head. This will be very successful in relieving this current situation. She quite understandably wishes to think about this and I would be very happy to see her again any time if she wishes to proceed.</span>” </p>

She recorded that Mrs Garratt was having problems with her hip, and that there was weakness on external rotation and abduction. X-rays revealed that the trochanter was avulsed at the attachment of the gluteus medius muscles, and Mrs Acton considered that to be the probable cause of her weakness. In all probability, the fracture was caused by the fall on the bus; that was Mr Marsh’s opinion, and if there had been a fracture during rerevision surgery I would expect him to have made some note of it. </p>

Whilst he speculated in the witness box about why he did it, the truth is that he could not remember. Mr Owen described the cables as braided, like multifilament steel rope. They are stronger than Charnley wires, which could break more easily, and bone grows into them, making them difficult to remove. The cables here were well fixed, and therefore a surgeon would only remove them for a good reason.  Mr Owen said the only reason to remove them would be if they were loose or broken or causing irritation or if the hip was infected, otherwise the risks of taking them out outweighed the advantages. The only one of those reasons that arose in Mrs Garratt’s case was irritation, and that is consistent with the local chronic inflammation and the blood in the fluid being caused by a haematoma. </p>

The only reason he gave for removing only one (apart from suggesting for the first time in oral evidence that was his normal practice, which does not explain the reason for that practice, or why he did not mention it in his witness statement) was that it had a potential for obstruction during surgery. That was something which he also volunteered for the first time in his oral evidence. It was not an explanation advanced by Mr Smith, and Mr Owen’s evidence was that it made no sense.

There is nothing recorded in the operation note to suggest that the collection tracked down to the hip joint itself.

Mr Woods was getting a dull aching sensation in the groin towards the end of the day, but experienced no functional disability at that time. He told Mr Hemmady that he did not take painkillers, and that he could easily walk for about 4 to 5 miles without much difficulty. Mr Hemmady decided to discuss the matter with Mr Hodgkinson on the latter’s return from his holidays, because although it appeared that Mr Woods had early osteoarthritic changes, it was rather difficult to be sure about whether the source of his pain was intra- or extra-articular. Mr Hodgkinson’s opinion was that the symptoms were mainly due to early degenerative changes in Mr Woods’ hip joint. Given the level of those symptoms Mr Hemmady told Mr Woods’ GP it would be best to leave things well alone for the time being, but that they would like to review him in six months’ time. </p>

They had a long discussion about the options available at that stage and on balance, in view of his relative youth, it was mutually agreed to leave things well alone for the time being, and to review him in two years’ time. Mr Woods was told that it was sensible to postpone having a total hip arthroplasty for as long as possible because hip prostheses need to be replaced from time to time, and that since he was only in his mid-thirties, it was rather early to be starting the process. </p>

By then he had moved away from Mr Hodgkinson’s team to Mr Garg, who was based in Lancaster Royal Infirmary, which was nearer to Mr Woods’ home. Mr Garg noted that Mr Woods had had a painful left hip now for some 10 years which had been getting worse in the very recent past. Despite this, Mr Woods was still able to manage his work as a warehouse manager. He was prescribed analgesics and told that if things became unbearable they would think about hip resurfacing or a MoM total hip replacement. Mr Garg explained that a conventional hip prosthesis could fail very quickly in a young and active man. but said that there were some new types of prosthesis that might have a longer life. Mr Garg suggested that if he opted for a total hip arthroplasty Mr Woods might want to try one of the newer types in the hope that they would serve him better.  </p>

An X-ray of the pelvis confirmed “quite significant arthritic changes, especially on the left side.” Mr Sinha’s note of the consultation states that he had explained the options of resurfacing or a MoM total hip arthroplasty. It also states that he explained the risks “including infection, revision and blood clots etc. He may be on crutches for about 6 weeks.” Mr Sinha noted that he thought that Mr Woods had made up his mind to go </p>

Clinically and radiologically he now had gross osteoarthritis of the left hip. There was a discussion about the pros and cons of a total hip arthroplasty, which included a discussion of the potential advantages of a MoM prosthesis over a conventional prosthesis. Mr Woods was told that with a MoM prosthesis he would get better function, a better range of movement, and that the prosthesis would be more durable, all of which would be beneficial for a young and active man like himself. Mr Garg did not put a timescale on how long the MoM prosthesis would last but indicated that it would last longer than a conventional prosthesis.

He took the Hardinge approach. Mr Woods made a good recovery from the surgery and at his check-up on 17 November, was reported to be very pleased with the results. Mr Woods made a deliberate decision not to go back to impact sports following the operation, but he was able to carry out a full range of normal activities. At his six-month review on 14 April 2008, he was described as having made “<span style="font-style:italic">excellent progress”</span>, with satisfactory x rays. He was Trendelenburg negative and fully independently mobile, back at work and otherwise comfortable. Likewise, when Mr Garg saw him at his 12-month review in November 2008 he described him as “completely symptom free”. Mr Garg noted that X-rays of the left hip showed some heterotrophic calcification around the greater trochanter area, but this was not causing any symptoms.

He saw a member of Mr Herlekar’s team, Mr Yousuf, and then Mr Herlekar himself on 28 January 2013. Mr Woods denied experiencing any pain around the trochanteric region and any significant pain in his groin area on the left side. Mr Yousuf and Mr Herlekar shared the view that the symptoms Mr Woods described were attributable to referred pain from his back. Mr Herlekar explained in his oral evidence that there is a specific pattern to such pain, which radiates down to the buttocks around the back of the thigh, and that where there is such a presentation, the patient is told that it is a back-related problem. Mr Yousuf carried out a thorough neurological examination which indicated no neurological abnormality. There was also no trochanteric tenderness and a good range of hip movement.

In one of the less satisfactory passages in his oral evidence, in which he appeared to be working backwards from an assumption that Mr Woods did have ARMD and finding features to justify that assumption, Professor Kay sought to suggest that because the 3mls of fluid from the hip joint was “<span style="font-style:italic">easily</span>” aspirated, that suggested there may have been more fluid in the joint to aspirate. This was clutching at straws. Mr Herlekar, who carried out that procedure, noted that the aspiration “<span style="font-style:italic">showed only a small amount of fluid</span>” which would be an odd remark to have made if he thought there was more fluid present.

In his oral evidence he confirmed that he found no tissue necrosis. He was surprised, because he was expecting to find evidence of ARMD and apart from the tissue staining there were no signs of it. He agreed that the 12 to 20 mls of brown fluid he recorded finding during surgery was not a surprising finding, and that it could have been caused by a haemorrhage, which was the view of Mr Kim. The tissue samples sent for histological examination were described as “<span style="font-style:italic">heavily blood stained</span>”.  I am satisfied that the colour of the fluid was not an indication of ARMD. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The histology samples revealed no soft tissue damage. The histopathologist reported that they could see “<span style="font-style:italic">no evidence of the peripheral soft tissue or perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate expected in ALVAL.</span>” Nothing can be deduced from the presence of some macrophages, which was consistent with Mr Woods’ underlying osteoarthritis. The macrophage response was not an exuberant one, and not many metal particles were visible within them. As Professor Nelson explained, it was noteworthy that the macrophages and multinucleated giant cells visible on the cells were surrounded by many viable cells, which would not be the case if the tissue was dying. Moreover, there was no evidence of significant inflammation in the deep tissue. As Professor Athanasou confirmed, the presence of metallosis or visible metal particles tells one nothing about whether there has been a reaction to the metal, let alone an adverse one. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The only evidence that there was necrotic tissue in the samples taken comes from Professor Freemont, who found a “<span style="font-style:italic">widespread necrosis</span>” that neither the original histopathologist, Dr Theaker, nor Professor Nelson identified. I have already given my reasons for finding Professor Freemont’s evidence unreliable. I prefer the evidence of Professor Nelson, who carefully reviewed the slides at high magnification and confirmed that no appreciable tissue necrosis was present. His findings were consistent with the contemporaneous report. Mr Woods’ case was the lead claim in which Professor Freemont went so far as to suggest that Professor Nelson had been “<span style="font-style:italic">highly selective</span>” in his high magnification images. I have no reason to suppose that Professor Nelson had been anything of the kind. The accusation was a knee-jerk reaction by Professor Freemont to being proved wrong. An image that he said showed tissue necrosis had been subjected to high magnification, and he was forced to agree in cross-examination that the enlarged image showed viable blood vessels and viable macrophages and other cells in the tissue, as well as fibrin.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Following the revision surgery, Mr Woods made steady progress. At his three-week check-up with his GP he was noted to be mobilising well with one elbow crutch. When he next saw Mr Herlekar, on 24 March 2014, the latter said he had recovered “<span style="font-style:italic">remarkably well</span>”. The X-rays were satisfactory, and he had satisfactory left hip movement, though there was some discomfort in his left knee. By the time of his next consultation on 19 May 2014, he could perform an active straight leg raise and full abduction without any problems.  There was nothing of significance at his next consultation with Mr Herlekar in early November, but about three weeks after that, he saw his GP who recorded that he was “still having pain symptoms in the left hip” described as radiating down his left knee from the buttock. </p>

Mr Woods told him that the pain on the left had significantly eased, but he continued to get some pain in the hip that he described as “<span style="font-style:italic">radiating to the back of his thigh as well as to the back of the knee joint</span>”. After reviewing the X-rays, Mr Herlekar concluded that most of his symptoms were originating in the back and that if they flared up he would need investigating for back problems. A year later, Mr Woods reported to Mr Herlekar that he still got some dull ache pain, but overall, he was happy with the outcome. He was discharged from the clinic. </p>

He was referred to a consultant, though he had not seen anyone by the time he came to give his oral evidence. The entry in the GP records states that this pain was similar to the left-sided pain before revision, and Mr Woods confirmed this in his oral evidence. The GP thought the location of the pain was possibly more indicative of a back problem.  </p>

On the contrary it seems highly likely that his MoM prosthesis was functioning perfectly well and would have continued to do so without problems had it been left alone. The blood metal levels were so low that one would not expect an adverse immunological reaction, unless he was one of those very unfortunate individuals who experienced extreme hypersensitivity – in which case, one would expect to see signs of adaptive immunological reactions. Professor Kay agreed that his metal ion levels “<span style="font-style:italic">no way suggested that there was a risk towards ARMD.</span>” There was no ALVAL type reaction here and the histopathology and radiology are inconsistent with ARMD.  I accept Professor Nelson’s conclusion that Mr Woods’ histopathological findings are unremarkable in the context of an arthritic joint capsule with a MoM prosthesis. </p>

This fitted with Dr Wilson’s view that the MRI scan revealed some swelling/oedema by the adductors which was caused by tendinosis. Although Mr Kim and Professor Kay were in agreement that there was no evidence of active tendinosis, Mr Kim did explain that the pathological process was </p>
