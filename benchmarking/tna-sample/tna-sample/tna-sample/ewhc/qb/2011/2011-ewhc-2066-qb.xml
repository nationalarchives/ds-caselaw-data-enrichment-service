	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The claimant, Leo Whiten, claims damages for personal injury and financial losses sustained as a result of the defendant’s negligent management of his mother’s labour and his birth.  In September 2005, breach of duty was admitted by the defendant and, in March 2006, the defendant further admitted that its breach of duty had caused the claimant’s injury.  Proceedings were commenced on 8 August 2006 and, on 30 August 2006, judgment was entered for the claimant.  Between 30 November and 3 December 2010 and on 12, 17, 18 and 23 May 2011, I heard evidence and submissions in relation to the issue of quantum of damages.  I have since received further written submissions from counsel, who were Mr David Melville QC and Mr Rohan Pershad QC for the claimant and Miss Philippa Whipple QC for the defendant. There was a further hearing today (28 July 2011) at which I dealt with a number of outstanding matters. At today’s hearing, Mr Robert Marven appeared with Mr Melville for the claimant and Miss Maria Roche appeared with Miss Whipple for the defendant. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The claimant’s claims under the various heads of damages are set out in the Final Updated Schedule of Loss (the Schedule of Loss) and the Supplementary Schedule of Loss filed on his behalf.  The defendant’s response to those claims is contained in its Amended Counter Schedule (the Counter Schedule) and Supplementary Schedule of Loss.  In addition, the parties have prepared a Scott Schedule, setting out areas of agreement and disagreement between them.  I shall refer to those documents when dealing with the individual heads of damage.  I have calculated all past losses to the claimant’s seventh birthday on 24 June 2011.  Future losses are deemed to start from 25 June 2011.  My awards under the various heads of damage are set out in the Appendices to this judgment. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Many of the heads of damage are in issue and have required detailed consideration in this judgment, hence its length.  Whilst some of the disputed matters involve questions of principle and/or large amounts of money, many of them are relatively minor.  I cannot help feeling that, had the parties exercised a greater degree of co-operation and good sense, the number of issues to be determined could have been considerably reduced and the amount of time spent on the case in and out of court could have been shortened significantly. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“.. the aim of an award of damages for personal injuries is to provide compensation. The principle is that ‘full compensation’ should be provided. … This principle of ‘full compensation’ applies to pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages alike. … The compensation must remain fair, reasonable and just. Fair compensation for the injured person. The level must also not result in injustice to the defendant, and it must not be out of accord with what society as a whole would perceive as being reasonable”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The claimant is entitled to damages to meet his reasonable needs arising from his injuries.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is agreed between the parties that damages for care and case management should be paid by way of periodical payments.  Clearly, this arrangement is in the claimant’s best interests.  It is now agreed that the 90<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> centile of the Average Earnings Index (ASHE) 6115 should be used for the annual up-rating of the periodical payments.  There was a dispute as to whether the award for loss of earnings should be paid by way of lump sum or periodical payments. I decided today that it was in the claimant’s best interests for a periodical payments order to be made. It is agreed that the award should be uprated annually by reference to the ASHE earnings data for the gross annual pay for all male full-time employees in the United Kingdom (currently Table 1.7a).   </p>

Dr Richard Miles, consultant paediatrician, and Mr Anthony Baldwin, chartered educational and paediatric psychologist, gave oral evidence on behalf of the claimant.  The Report of Mr Mark Paterson, consultant orthopaedic surgeon instructed by the claimant, was not in dispute.  Dr Neil Thomas, consultant paediatric neurologist, and Dr Jane Hood, consultant paediatric neuropsychologist and registered educational psychologist, gave oral evidence for the defendant.  The two pairs of experts (Dr Miles and Dr Thomas; Mr Baldwin and Dr Hood) provided agreed notes of telephone discussions which had taken place between them prior to the trial. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The experts were agreed about most aspects of the claimant’s current condition and prognosis.  By reason of the defendant’s negligence, he suffered profound hypoxic ischaemic damage and developed a mixed spastic-dystonic severe quadriplegic cerebral palsy.  He has hypertonia (stiffness) in all 4 limbs and hypotonia (floppiness) in his trunk.  He has limited mobility, the precise extent of which I shall discuss later in this judgment.  He cannot stand or walk unaided.  His hand function is also very limited and his hands tend to be fisted with his elbows bent.  He can open his fingers at times but a change of position, excitement or discomfort can cause his hands to fist again, making any further voluntary movement impossible.  He suffers from mild epilepsy which is controlled by medication.  However, he experiences frequent involuntary dystonic spasms and is prone to strong extensor spasms, particularly when startled.  He has poor head control with a strong asymmetric tonic neck reflex to the right which causes him to look to the right and makes it difficult for him to bring his head into the mid-line.  His eyes deviate to the right and he has reduced vision in his left eye and an intermittent convergent squint.  He can vocalise but has no functional speech.  He is doubly incontinent.  His general health is good although he has suffered a number of chest infections in the past.  Despite his profound disabilities, it is clear that he is a very engaging and generally happy child who is socially aware and thoroughly enjoys the company and attention of adults and other children. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The claimant has various orthopaedic problems which were described by Mr Paterson.  He reported that progressive subluxation of the claimant’s right hip had occurred during 2008.  The claimant had received botulinum toxin injections (Botox) and a course of intensive physiotherapy which had produced some improvement in the position of the hip.  Nevertheless, Mr Paterson described the hip as “precarious”.  He suggested that, on a balance of probabilities, it would require surgical stabilisation at some stage.  The aim should be to delay the need for surgery for as long as possible by means of Botox injections, continued intensive therapy and attention to the claimant’s posture and positioning.  Mr Paterson considered that soft tissue surgery was likely to be necessary within 2-3 years and that there was a 30% chance that bone surgery would be required at the age of 10-12 years. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Paterson also noted some increased spasticity of the claimant’s arms.  In order to combat this, he recommended daily ranging and stretching of the arms, together with the use of elbow and wrist splints and regular Botox injections.  He suggested that surgery might be necessary in the future in order to correct contractures of the arms.  Surgical intervention might also be required if a fixed scoliosis of the spine developed, or to lengthen his Achilles tendon so as to preserve his ability to stand with assistance.  </p>

Their assessments took place within a fortnight of each other in late 2009, when the claimant was 5½ years old.  They noted that the claimant has a constellation of problems: significant physical disabilities, impaired vision and lack of expressive communication skills, in addition to his cognitive deficits.  Because of those problems, they were unable to undertake a formal psychometric assessment.  In particular, they had difficulty in assessing his precise level of understanding of language.  It was clear that he understands certain key words although his reactions to the words were slow, suggesting a delay in information processing and speed of response. </p>

Their view was that, if the claimant continues to make progress – in particular with his communication skills – he can be expected, when he reaches adulthood, to have attained a level of cognitive functioning equivalent to a child of 4-5 years.  They agree that he will be capable of using communication aids and IT equipment appropriate for that level of cognitive functioning.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is clear from the evidence of the educational psychologists that the use of age level equivalents relating to uninjured children can be misleading when assessing a child with complex disabilities.  In reality, even if the claimant attains the abilities of a 4-5 year old in some areas, he will not be functioning at the same age equivalent level in all skills.  His motor and daily living skills, for example, will always remain below the level of a 2 year old.  Dr Hood’s evidence, which I accept, was that the claimant’s reasoning and functioning level is likely to remain well below the level of a 4-5 year old, so that, while he may apparently be able to perform a task at that age level, he will not have the underlying skills of reasoning and understanding possessed by an undamaged child functioning at that age level.  This evidence has important implications for some elements of the claim. </p>

A preferable arrangement, they say, would be to arrange a programme of activities based on his care arrangements at home.  The claim has been presented on the basis that their view is correct and that the claimant will cease full-time education when he attains the age of 19 years. </p>

The children were aged between 6 months and 3½ years at the time of entry into the study.  The paper demonstrated that the most powerful prognostic factors for survival of such children were their mobility and feeding skills.  The children were divided into categories according to their levels of skill in these areas.  Mobility skills were classified on a graduated scale.  Children who could not lift their heads when lying on their stomachs were at the lowest end of the scale.  The next most able group consisted of those who could lift their heads, but not their chests, when lying on their stomachs.  Those with greater mobility skills were classified as “lifts head and chest, partial rolling” and “full rolling, does not walk unaided”.  Highest on the scale of mobility skills were those who could walk 10 feet unaided.  There were three classifications of feeding skills: “tube fed”, “fed by others” and “some self-feeding”.   </p>

The graph shows that the mean additional survival time for children at this level of mobility skills who had to be tube fed was about 13 years.

Table III of the paper shows life expectancies for males and females aged 15, 30 and 45 years within three classifications of mobility skills: “cannot lift head”, “lifts head” and “rolls/sits”.  The subjects are further divided between the same three levels of feeding skills as in the 1998 Strauss paediatric paper.  It is to be noted that Table I of the 1998 Strauss adult paper shows that the mobility skills of the subjects of the study had been categorised more narrowly for some purposes.

At his first examination, in May 2007, Dr Miles noted that, when the claimant was lying prone (i.e. on his stomach), with his arms placed in position in front of him, he was able to lift his head and chest and hold himself in that position.  In May 2009, Dr Miles noted that he could push his head up when in a prone position and hold it up, especially when he was positioned over a wedge.  He made no mention on that occasion of the claimant being able to lift his chest.  He observed that the claimant could not sit without support.   </p>

He had seen a report from the physiotherapist who was treating the claimant which indicated that, on occasion, the claimant would roll from his stomach onto his back, usually to the left.  However, he could not roll from his back onto his stomach.  Dr Miles concluded that the claimant had partial – but not full – rolling abilities.  When he re-examined the claimant in May 2009, he noted that he could still roll only partially and with difficulty.  In oral evidence, he said that the claimant did not have consistent rolling. </p>

In August 2010, Ms Nowell made a witness statement in which she commented in some detail on the claimant’s mobility skills.  In it, she said that the claimant was able to roll from his back onto his stomach over the left side and would do this at will when playing on his own or with members of his family.  In oral evidence, she said that the claimant can roll over both to his left and his right although, because of the problems with his right hip, he finds it much more difficult to roll over his right side.  (At times, she appeared to be saying that it was more difficult for him to roll to the left but I think this was a mistake.)  She described how, when he rolls, his arm becomes stuck underneath him and he requires help to free it.  Ms Nowell told me that the claimant understands the request to roll over but will not always comply.  Mr Whiten’s evidence was that the claimant can roll over from back to front whenever he wishes to do so but will not “do tricks” on request.  He said that he had tried to capture the claimant’s rolling on video but had been unable to do so. </p>

In her witness statement, Lida described how the claimant could roll onto his stomach “right and left side”.  In oral evidence, she said that, for the first two and a half years of her employment as the claimant’s carer, she did not see him roll through 180 degrees, although his parents had told her that he was able to do so.  She described how she had first seen him do so on 28 October 2010 and had recorded it in her work diary.  In the diary, she described how the claimant “had rolled from right side onto his stomach”.  In oral evidence, she said that, by that, she had meant that he had rolled through 180 degrees from his back onto his stomach.  She said that she had then placed the claimant on his side and left him to get a camera.  When she returned to the room, he was on his stomach.  She tried to get him to repeat the movement so that she could photograph him but he just laughed at her.  She interpreted his behaviour as showing pleasure at being in control of events.  Lida’s evidence was that she had seen the claimant rolling on other occasions since October 2010.  She said that, when the claimant rolls to the left, his right arm becomes trapped underneath him.  She said that he is sometimes able to free the arm without physical assistance if he is given verbal encouragement and shown where his arm is.  Otherwise, she will assist by physically releasing it. </p>

As part of her regular regime of treatment, Miss Robinson writes periodic reports on the claimant’s mobility skills as she observes them to be.  In reports written in 2008 and 2009, she noted that he was able to lift his head against gravity when prone over a cushion.  When placed lying on his side, he was able to maintain that position for only a short time, after which he would push into extension (by arching his back)  in order to in order to move out of it.  He could roll from his back onto his right side (through 90 degrees) independently.  In March 2009, she recorded that he was still unable to roll from his back onto his left side or from his back to his front independently. </p>

On that occasion, she saw the claimant roll from his back to his left side independently.  Lida had reported to her that he could also roll to his right.

When placed lying on his side, he could maintain the position independently for about a minute then, in order to get out of it, either pushed into extension or rolled onto his front in an uncontrolled manner.  She observed the claimant rolling from his back onto his left side (i.e. through 90 degrees); she described the movement as “intentional and controlled”.  She also saw him roll from his right side onto his front intentionally and independently, but in an “uncontrolled” manner.

She had never seen him roll through 180 degrees. i.e. from his back to his front or <span style="font-style:italic">vice versa</span> or from side to side.  She said that the claimant had difficulty in getting his hips into the correct position to roll and rolling caused him pain in the right hip.  She explained that, when the claimant was lying on his front, she would position a cushion under his upper chest and then put his arms in position.  He would then weight bear through his arms whilst lifting his head.  She gave no indication that the claimant was able independently to lift his head and chest whilst lying on his stomach. </p>

She requested a video fluoroscopy swallow assessment at St George’s Hospital to determine whether there was any risk of aspiration (food or fluids entering the trachea).  If materials are aspirated, they can give rise to respiratory infection.  The assessment, when carried out, revealed severe aspiration with thin liquids and with syrup and custard consistency fluids.  All the aspiration was “silent” (i.e. it was not accompanied by any protective cough response), indicating reduced sensation in the larynx and pharynx.  Following the assessment, staff at the claimant’s school fed him only liquids that had been thickened. </p>

When the claimant was given a thin fluid (a Fortini drink) during the assessment, silent aspiration was observed.  However, on this occasion, no aspiration was observed when he was fed with syrup consistency fluids.  As a result of the assessment, the claimant’s parents were told that he was at high risk of aspiration on thin fluids.  They were advised that he should be offered syrup-thickened fluids from an open cup to minimise the risk.

Dr Thomas was particularly concerned that he might suffer from low level aspiration which, whilst not immediately apparent, might over time result in the development of chronic lung disease.  He was concerned about the claimant’s parents’ refusal to take the advice they had been given.  Dr Miles considered that, provided that those responsible for the claimant’s feeding take proper care, it was not likely that he would require tube feeding in the future.

In the assessment of life expectancy contained in his Report dated June 2009, Dr Miles placed the claimant in the latter category.  However, he later modified that view and acknowledged that, given that he considered that the claimant has only limited rolling skills, it would be over-generous to place him squarely in the “rolls/sits” category.  Nevertheless he argued that to place him in the “lifts head or chest” category would fail to recognise the rolling skills he has.

He estimated that risk at 6%.  He reached that figure by reference to Table 3 of the 1998 Strauss paediatric paper.  Table 3 suggests that a child aged 6 months to 3½ years who falls within the category “lifts head and chest/partial rolling” and has to be fed by others has an 87% chance of surviving (and therefore a 13% risk of <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> surviving) for a further 10 years.  Since the claimant is older than 3½ years, Dr Miles suggested that it would be reasonable to assume that the risk of him not surviving to the age of 15 would have been approximately 12% in 1998.  Given the 50% reduction in the mortality rate reported in the 2007 Strauss paper, the risk had now reduced to about 6%.  He observed that such a percentage would accord with his experience of mortality within his own patient group.  He therefore considered that a reduction of 2 years from the life expectancy of 41 years taken from Table I of the 2008 Strauss paper was appropriate.  That reduced the life expectancy figure to 39 years. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At the resumed hearing in May 2011, I gave leave for Dr Thomas to be recalled for further cross-examination on this issue.  In March 2011, the claimant’s solicitors became aware of a report written by Dr Thomas in November 2010 on behalf of the defendant in a clinical negligence claim brought by a child, <span style="font-style:italic">JR</span>, against a different hospital trust.  The <span style="font-style:italic">JR</span> case involved a child who was just over 4 years old when Dr Thomas’s report was written.  <span style="font-style:italic">JR</span> had cerebral palsy and other disabilities.  His mobility skills are significantly greater than those of this claimant.  He sits, rolls, crawls and bunny hops although he is unable to stand or walk unaided.  He is able to finger feed but is predominately fed by others.  In his report on <span style="font-style:italic">JR</span>, Dr Thomas took as his starting point Table I of the 2008 Strauss paper.  He noted that a male aged 15 years with <span style="font-style:italic">JR’s</span> mobility and feeding skills would have a life expectancy of 32 years.  He then referred to Table 3 of the 1998 Strauss paediatric paper and the fact that it shows that a child up to 3½ years with the same mobility and feeding skills has a 90% probability of living a further 15 years.  Dr Thomas calculated the life expectancy of an individual who was one of the 90% who would live to 15 years.  He then attempted to take account mathematically of the 10% of individuals who would not survive to the age of 15 years.  That calculation produced an estimated life expectancy for <span style="font-style:italic">JR</span> of 40 years.  Dr Thomas then increased the 40 years to 48 years to take account of the difference between US actual life expectancy rates and UK projected life expectancy rates and made a reduction to reflect the particular circumstances of <span style="font-style:italic">JR’s</span> case.  His eventual figure was an additional 46 years’ life expectancy, to the age of 50 years.</p>

Dr Thomas did not accept that it was appropriate to use the figure of 12% derived from Table 3 of the 1998 Strauss paediatric paper.  That figure represented the probability of a child aged up to 3½ years surviving a further 10 years.  It did not represent the probability of a child of that age surviving to the age of 15 years.  Moreover, Dr Miles’ figures took no account of the life expectancy of those individuals who would <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> survive to 15 years.  Nor, according to Dr Thomas, was the application of the 50% reduction in mortality rate (revealed by the 2007 Strauss paper) to the 12% risk derived from Table 3 statistically sound.  Overall, he did not consider that the reduction of 6% applied by Dr Miles properly reflected the risk that the claimant would not survive to the age of 15 years.

He said that could not be right.  It was, he said, appropriate to give the claimant a life expectancy longer than 25 years because he had survived beyond the age group covered by the 1998 Strauss paediatric paper.  Dr Miles also said that it was not appropriate to make extrapolations from the graph at Figure 2 of the 1998 Strauss paediatric paper when assessing the life expectancy of a child outside the age group covered by that paper.  He drew attention to a passage at page 148 of the paper, in which the authors warned against using the analysis in Figure 2 in order to obtain a prognosis for an older child.  </p>

Moreover, their natural and overwhelming desire to see the claimant progress and develop as far as possible is liable to give rise to excessive and unrealistic expectations.  I detected at times in their evidence an optimism about the claimant’s abilities, understanding and likely future development which appeared to me unrealistic and which was at variance with the clear views of the experienced professionals who had observed and assessed him.  One striking example was Mr Whiten’s assertion, made to Dr Hood in November 2009, that he had not ruled out the possibility of the claimant being able to manage his own affairs and to help run the family business (presumably Ms Nowell’s parents’ property letting business) in the future.  Mr Whiten’s vehement denial that the claimant has any feeding problems - in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary - provides another illustration.  Ms Nowell too was adamant that, in respect of feeding and other matters, she and Mr Whiten were right and the professionals were wrong.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I found the evidence of both Dr Miles and Dr Thomas unsatisfactory in some respects.  In November 2009, Dr Miles expressed the view that the claimant had a life expectancy to 52 years.  In the notes of the experts’ discussions in August 2010, he reduced that estimate very substantially to 44 years.  The reduction resulted from a change of mind as to the way the claimant’s mobility skills should be classified for the purposes of Table I of the 2008 Strauss paper.  In his Reports, Dr Miles gave no explanation for his decision to reduce the figure for life expectancy by 2 years to reflect the risk that the claimant might not survive to the age of 15 years.  When he gave his explanation in oral evidence, by reference to Table 3 of the 1998 Strauss paediatric paper, it was not clear to me that he had properly appreciated that the 87% probability of survival to which he referred was in fact the probability of a child aged no more than 3½ years surviving a further 10 years (i.e. not to the age of 15 years).  I found his proposition that it was appropriate to reduce the percentage risk of an individual not surviving to 15 years by 50% in order to reflect the contents of the 2007 Strauss paper unconvincing.  Dr Lewis Rosenbloom, a highly respected consultant paediatric neurologist and co-author of the 2007 and 2008 Strauss papers, had conducted a peer review of an article which Dr Miles had written for publication, setting out the methodology he used in this case.  In oral evidence, Dr Miles asserted that Dr Rosenbloom had accepted that his methodology was reasonable and had been “impressed” by it.  Subsequently, the defendant produced an email from Dr Rosenbloom.  In it, he said that, as a reviewer, he had been asked (as is usual with peer review) to advise whether the article was suitable for publication and to suggest any changes that might be required.  He had not been asked to endorse the contents of the article and had not done so.  He went on to say that he regarded the methodology as:</p>

Also, Dr Thomas did not appear (until the time he was cross-examined, when he accepted the fact) to have appreciated that the category “rolls/sits” in Table I of the 2008 Strauss paper includes individuals with “at least partial rolling”.  Moreover, I was concerned about the criticism that he made in December 2010 about Dr Miles’ use of the 2008 Strauss paper.  I had clearly understood that Dr Thomas was saying that it was wrong in principle to use that paper other than (as he had done) to show the top end of the range of life expectancies of individuals aged between 3½ and 15 years.  As he himself acknowledged in May 2011, that particular criticism was unjustified and was inconsistent with his own methodology in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">JR</span>. </p>

In any event, I found Ms Nowell’s evidence on the point somewhat confusing and am not certain that what she was describing was independent rolling since she said that the claimant’s arm becomes stuck under his body when he rolls and he needs help to free it.  It may be that, on a few occasions in recent months, he has rolled through 90 degrees from his back onto his side and then, being unable to maintain that position more than momentarily, has gone into extension and rolled onto his stomach in an uncontrolled manner, as observed by Miss Robinson (apparently for the first time) in November 2010.  </p>

That implies to me that such very limited rolling skills are not considered of any significance in predicting life expectancy.  I find that the claimant has experienced increasing difficulty in rolling as he has got bigger and heavier and has experienced pain in his right hip.

I also find that there is a small risk that, at some time in the future, it may be necessary for the claimant to be tube fed, at least in part.

Given my factual findings as to the claimant’s mobility skills, the available data in his case consists of (i) Figure 2 of the 1998 Strauss paediatric paper (updated in accordance with the 2007 Strauss paper), which gives a child aged no more than 3½ years who is able to lift his/her head, but not his/her chest, when lying on his/her stomach a life expectancy of a further 25 years; and (2) Table I of the 2008 Strauss paper, which gives a 15 year old male who can lift his head or chest, but not roll or sit, a life expectancy of an additional 20 years.</p>

Thus, he said that it was appropriate to treat the periods of 20 years and 25 years as the two ends of the bracket of life expectancies for children aged between 3½ and 15 years with the relevant mobility and feeding skills.  Dr Miles said that the probable survival time for the claimant must be more than an additional 25 years because he has already survived for at least 3 further years beyond the age of 3½ years.  He provided no convincing statistical or other support for that argument.  I accept Dr Thomas’s evidence on this point.  It cannot in my view be logical to find that a 7 year old child with the relevant mobility and feeding skills has a life expectancy outside the 20-25 year bracket.  I accept also that it is fair and reasonable to give the claimant a life expectancy towards the top of the bracket, i.e. of an additional 24 years, to the age of 31 years.</p>

On the positive side, the claimant’s mobility skills probably lie at the top end of the categories to which I have found that he belongs for the purposes of the Strauss papers.  He appears to enjoy generally good health at present.  Those factors militate in favour of a slightly increased life expectancy.  However, the risk of aspiration (increased as it is by his current feeding regime) is a negative factor, as is the risk that he might have to be tube fed in the future.  I consider that, on balance, the various factors cancel each other out.  It was no doubt for that reason that, once the paediatric neurologists had reached their conclusions based on the statistical data, neither of them considered it appropriate to make any further adjustment.  In the circumstances, it does not seem to me that any adjustment is appropriate. </p>

In general, this is likely to give a multiplier which is too high since this approach does not allow for the distribution of deaths around the expected length of life.  For a group of similarly impaired lives of the same age, some will die before the average life expectancy and some after; allowing for this spread of deaths results in a lower multiplier than assuming payment for a term certain equal to the life expectancy.  In such cases, it is preferable to look up the age in the 0 per cent column in Table 1 [for males] or 2 [for females] for which the value of the multiplier at 0 per cent is equal to the stated life expectancy.

The claimant in that case was 23 years old and the judge, Lloyd-Jones J, had found that he had a life expectancy of a further 49 years, to the age of 72 years.

These include his general medical history and that of his family, his weight, the fact that he does not smoke or drink, the extent of his susceptibility to heart disease or diabetes and his attitude to exercise.  In these circumstances, if Table 1 were used it would lead to double counting in respect of the negative factors and would lead to under-recognition of the effect of the positive factors.  [Counsel for the second defendant] is correct in submitting that the assessment of life expectancy did not take account of the risks of accidental death or certain other diseases.  In the light of that fact I have given careful consideration to the question whether I should arrive at the appropriate multiplier by employing a combination of Table 28 and Table 1.  However, in view of the fact that by far the greater proportion of risks to this Claimant’s life have already been taken into account by the experts in their assessment of life expectancy, and in the absence of any evidence as to what apportionment between Tables would be appropriate, I conclude that the appropriate multiplier should be calculated by reference to Table 28.”</p>

In that case, the claimant, who had suffered a brain injury in a road traffic accident when aged 28 years, was a heavy smoker and was addicted to alcohol and drugs. He had behavioural problems.  Many, if not all, the claimant’s difficulties had pre-dated the accident but they had been exacerbated thereby.  The medical experts gave evidence about the extent to which the claimant’s life expectancy had been reduced by these factors and by the claimant’s epilepsy which had been caused by the accident.  The judge found that the claimant’s life expectancy had been reduced by 12 years.  Neither the evidence of the medical experts nor the judge’s finding had taken account of the general mortality risks to which the claimant was subject.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have heard no statistical evidence explaining the Paragraph 20 methodology. Consequently, I do not understand the logic of assuming a spread of two years around the predicted life expectancy of 28 years, in preference to a spread of – say – four, six or eight years.  But, whatever the logic may be, it is clear that the Paragraph 20 methodology is intended to make allowance for the fact that the predicted life expectancy of 28 years might be wrong.  Moreover, it seems to me that underlying the methodology must be the assumption that the claimant has a greater chance of dying before the expiration of his predicted 28 years than of surviving for longer than 28 years.  If that were not the case, the multiplier produced by using Table 1 would be greater than that derived from the application of Table 28.  If I am right about that, the argument being mounted by the defendant in this case is, in reality, the same as that advanced unsuccessfully in <span style="font-style:italic">B</span>.</p>

None of the professionals who have examined the claimant – in particular, the psychologists – has suggested that he shows any recognition of his predicament.  Even his parents have not sought to suggest that.  The fact that he may on occasion demonstrate an unwillingness to do what he is asked or show signs of frustration or a sense of fun does not mean that he has an appreciation of what he has lost as a result of the defendant’s negligence.  It is that type of appreciation that gives rise to an award of damages at the highest end of the scale.

He said that his earnings had been at approximately the same level since about 2001 when he would have been aged 32 years.

A good starting point is to look at the employment history of his parents and other close relatives.  Mr Whiten and Ms Nowell are an intelligent couple who have benefited from a University education and have held remunerative jobs.  They would have been anxious for their children to perform well at school and to go on to tertiary education.  They would have given the claimant every support and encouragement to maximise his educational potential.  Other close family members hold (or have held) secure and reasonably well paid (though not necessarily highly paid) employment.  The exception is the claimant’s aunt, although she is still young and may well settle down to regular employment in the future.  These factors suggest that the claimant would probably have been motivated to seek and obtain employment and would have had the abilities and qualifications to find and retain a good job in the public or private sector.

Whilst it is possible that, by the end of the period of loss, the claimant might have been earning that amount, it is probable that, in the early years of his employment, his annual earnings would have been significantly less.

The current financial climate demonstrates that this is a real risk, even for the young and well-qualified.  Given the short period of the claimant’s notional working life and the other circumstances of the case, I consider that the discount should be modest, namely 5% of the annual figure.

The care required for an able child tends to diminish as he/she becomes older.  However, in the claimant’s case, this has not happened.  His limited mobility and his total dependence on others for all his needs have meant that his requirement for care has increased – rather than reduced – over time.  He has to be carried or transported everywhere, fed, washed, dressed and changed.  His feeding alone takes a significant amount of time.  During his waking hours, he has to be continually occupied and entertained.  Whilst awake, he requires the undivided attention of at least one adult at all times.  His sleep is frequently disturbed and he often needs attention during the night. </p>

Jana had trained as a physiotherapist in Slovakia and provided the claimant with regular sessions of a therapy known as “votja”.  The introduction of a paid carer enabled Ms Nowell to return to her former employment on a part-time basis in November 2005.  In September 2006, the claimant’s parents terminated Jana’s employment because of a disagreement.  At that time, Ms Nowell decided to stop working and care for the claimant herself.  She ceased working outside the home in December 2006 and, after spending a couple of months working from home, stopped work altogether in February 2007.  Shortly afterwards, she discovered that she was pregnant with her second child.

In September 2007, the claimant started to attend Linden Lodge, a special school for children with complex learning disabilities, including visual difficulties, which is situated only a short distance from 192 Crowborough Road.  Aga continued to provide care during the school term for a total of about 32½ hours per week (2 hours each weekday morning and 4½ hours each weekday afternoon/evening), with an additional 2 hours at weekends when required.  I have not been told how much care she gave during school holidays but assume that it was rather more than during term time.  The couple’s second child, Dexter, was born in October 2007.</p>

In 2009, some overnight care was introduced.  Between them, the two carers also began to provide 8 hours’ care at weekends.  Ms Nowell’s evidence is that, by late 2009, the carers were working for a total of 47 hours plus 3 nights per week during the school term and 65 hours plus 1 night per week during the school holidays.  In May 2009, Mr Whiten’s employment was terminated and he had a period of 6 months’ “gardening leave” at home.  By that time, Dexter was attending nursery 2 mornings a week.  Mr Whiten cared for Dexter during the periods when he was not at nursery and also assisted in co-ordinating the claimant’s therapy and other needs.  In December 2009, Mr Whiten started up a new “dotcom” consultancy business.

The difference between the experts lies in their choice of whether to use the basic, non-enhanced NJC rate (i.e. the Monday-Friday daytime rate) or the aggregate NJC rate, which is a weighted average rate calculated by reference to rates paid over the whole week, including evenings and weekends when enhanced rates would usually be payable for “unsocial” hours. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">From the beginning, the claimant has required a very high level of care by comparison with an uninjured child.  That care has been required at all hours of the day and night.  The levels of stress and exhaustion experienced by the claimant’s parents as a result of the demands placed upon them are well documented in the evidence.  When paid care was first introduced, it was available only on weekdays.  It was not until April 2009 that the claimant’s parents obtained some assistance with overnight and weekend care.  Up to that time, they had been solely responsible for his care at those periods.  Moreover, the claimant has always required one to one care.  His needs are such that it is not possible to care for him whilst at the same time carrying out any other activity.  I am quite satisfied therefore that, in the circumstances of this case, it is appropriate to value the gratuitous care given by the claimant’s parents throughout the relevant period at the aggregate NJC rates used by Mrs Sargent.</p>

In deciding to award the aggregate NJC rates, I have already taken into account the extent of the care given to the claimant by his parents.  Moreover, although it is true that his parents have had periods when they have not worked – or have worked less than full-time – because of the claimant’s needs, this has not been the case throughout the relevant period.  Some of their periods of absence from work have been for other reasons, e.g. Ms Nowell’s two periods of maternity leave.  In all the circumstances, I do not consider that this is one of those unusual cases where no deduction is appropriate.  Weighing up all the relevant factors, I take the view that a discount of 25% would be fair and reasonable.  </p>

Ms Nowell said that both her work and that of Mr Whiten afforded them some flexibility so that they were able to work at home on occasion.  She said that, after Dexter’s birth, she would probably have spent a period at home looking after him, whilst the claimant would have remained at nursery.  When she returned to work, Dexter too would have started nursery.  Dexter is currently attending nursery three days a week.

They had paid a deposit before the claimant’s birth to secure a place for him at nursery.  Subsequently, they have placed Dexter in a nursery.  There can be no doubt, having regard to the events that have occurred since the claimant’s birth, that Ms Nowell was correct in her belief that she and Mr Whiten would be able to “juggle” their work so as to cater for the occasional childcare emergency.  I therefore find that the claimant would have remained at nursery from October 2004 until he started school in September 2008.  Over that period, I have assumed that the nursery fees payable for the claimant would have been an average of £11,500 per annum.  This figure is based on the figure which was payable in 2004; I consider that the 2010 figures for Dexter are too high to reflect the average cost for the relevant period.  </p>

The end of the school day would have been significantly earlier than the latest time for collection from a nursery as a result of which some form of after-school care would have been required for the claimant on at least some weekdays.  By this time, Dexter would have been at nursery so would not have required care after school.  As for the school holidays, I consider it probable that the claimant’s parents would have organised matters so that at least one of them was available for a significant proportion of the time.  The claimant’s grandparents may also have assisted.  But, inevitably, there would have been some periods when paid childcare was required for the claimant.   I am satisfied that it would be fair and reasonable to assume that the claimant’s parents would have incurred average annual childcare costs for the claimant of about £7,500 from September 2008 to date. </p>

The care experts agree that, until the claimant attains the age of 19 years, it would be reasonable for carers to be recruited and employed directly (rather than through an agency), as they have been in the past.  Thereafter, Ms Douglas favours arranging part of the care package through an agency and part directly, whereas Mrs Sargent advocates the continued use of a team of directly employed carers.  It is agreed that, for directly employed carers, the current appropriate hourly rates are £13 per hour Monday-Friday and £15 per hour Saturday and Sunday.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mrs Sargent’s evidence was that the care regime is likely to work more effectively if one carer with an appropriate degree of experience is designated as “team leader” and is paid an enhanced rate for carrying out additional duties over and above his/her role as part of the care team.  Those duties would include providing advice and support for the care team, arranging training sessions, planning care rotas and acting as co-ordinator between the care team, therapists and anyone else involved with the claimant’s care.  The team leader would also be responsible for dealing with day to day problems such as covering staff absences.  Mrs Sargent said that she would also expect the team leader to assist the case manager to draw up a detailed plan for the claimant’s care.  The team leader would then have day to day responsibility for ensuring that the care plan was implemented.  The team leader would be paid a higher hourly rate than the other carers (agreed by the experts at £16) to reflect his/her greater level of experience and additional responsibilities.  Mrs Sargent has allowed for the team leader to work for 30 hours a week, to include his/her ordinary caring duties. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The defendant’s case is that the appointment of a team leader is unnecessary and may well be counter-productive.  Ms Douglas’s evidence was that the claimant’s needs are not sufficiently complex or unpredictable as to require the input of a team leader.  She considers that the claimant’s care regime has worked well in the past without a team leader.  She acknowledges that there is a need for a greater degree of cohesion between members of the care team and for the development of recognised goals and objectives for those working with the claimant.  However, her view is that this can be achieved by more active case management.  She said that the case manager should undertake any necessary training and supervision for the care team.  Meanwhile, day to day problems (e.g. covering staff absence) could be dealt with by the carers jointly, without the need for a team leader.  In the event of a crisis, the carers could call upon the case manager.  Ms Douglas said that the appointment of a team leader could potentially result in confusion as to who is in charge.  The pay differential between a team leader and the other carers could also lead to resentment within the care team. </p>

There is a real need for a clear and consistent channel of communication between carers, therapists, members of staff at the claimant’s school, his parents and his case manager.  At present, Mr Whiten continues to play a large role in the co-ordination of the claimant’s carers and therapists.  He has been able to do this recently because he has been working from home.  However, it is possible that his employment circumstances may change in the future, so that he is unable to continue to fulfil this role.  In any event, he and Ms Nowell should be free to pursue their careers without the need to undertake the day to day responsibility for organising the claimant’s care.

Moreover, it would be uneconomic for the case manager (whose hourly rate is agreed at £90) to undertake these duties in preference to a team leader (at £16 per hour).  </p>

I accept her evidence that the team leader model works well in practice and is required in this case in order to give the care regime the best possible chance of achieving continuity and stability.  The appointment of a team leader will provide promotion prospects for members of the care team.

The employer would be required to make pension contributions of not less than 3% of the employee’s earnings.  Currently, the proposal is that an employee should qualify for automatic enrolment into the scheme once his/her earnings reach the income tax threshold (£7,475 per annum) and that pension contributions should be based on earnings above the threshold for national insurance contributions (£5,715 per annum).

In doing so, I reflect the general uncertainties about the scheme, including those as to the start date.  I also take account of the fact that it seems likely that, initially, employers’ contributions will be payable at only 2%.  I have also worked on the basis that contributions will not be payable for all the members of the care team, since some may work only part-time or may choose to opt out.  Consequently, I have reduced Mrs Sargent’s figure of £2,625 per annum for this period to £1,500 per annum.

No doubt the claimant’s parents would have arranged for both boys – and Victor, in due course – to be cared for by the same person at the relevant times.  In the future, Dexter and Victor will still require additional childcare which will have to be paid for.  Thus, no deduction for the costs of that care is appropriate from the time that Dexter goes to school.  As I understand the position, that will be in December 2011.

If a high level of paid care is not available, this will severely curtail the family’s activities.  Nevertheless, I am satisfied that, at least for the next few years, they will still want some time most weekends when they can be together as a family without a carer being present.  Having said that, I do not consider that the allowance of 7 hours per day of care at weekends proposed by Ms Douglas is sufficient.

It is difficult to see how there will be time for as many as 3 swimming sessions each week in addition to other activities.  He already has a weekly session in the school pool as part of his curriculum.  I consider that it is more realistic to allow for a second carer to provide 2 hours’ assistance for one swimming session per week during term time and a total of 4 hours’ assistance for 2 sessions per week during school holidays.  I have assumed that all these sessions will take place during the week, since a carer will be available to assist his parents with physical activities at weekends.</p>

If he is to be adequately stimulated and is to play a full part in family life, he is likely to require a considerable number of transfers during the course of a day.  It is important that his activities are not restricted as a result of the absence of a second person to assist in transfers.  It cannot be assumed that either or both of his parents will always be available to assist.  Their other children will also require a good deal of attention, particularly at the beginning and end of the day.  At times, one or both of the claimant’s parents may be working and not available to help.  At weekends and in school holidays, the family may wish to go on outings which will necessitate the presence of a second carer.  Nevertheless, I consider that the period of 5 hours per day on school days proposed by Mrs Sargent is a little high.  Provision for 4 hours per day of care from a second carer on school days seems to me reasonable.  I accept Mrs Sargent’s evidence that 8 hours of additional care will be necessary at weekends and during school holidays. </p>

It would, she said, be cost effective and relatively easy to manage.  The live-in carer would be at hand to assist the sleep-in carer in the event that the claimant was taken ill or some other emergency arose overnight.  During the day, there would be a primary carer who would deal with the claimant’s care needs, whilst the live-in carer would be responsible for the domestic chores and would also be available (save in his/her rest periods) to assist with lifting and transferring of the claimant and with outings.  Thus, the second carer would be fully occupied and would not merely be waiting around until the assistance of a second person was required. </p>

She said that, in her experience, this type of arrangement worked well.  There are a number of agencies which specialise in providing live-in carers of the type required.  They would liaise with the claimant’s case manager to provide suitable staff and would organise relief/replacement staff when necessary.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mrs Sargent’s evidence was that the use of agency staff was unlikely to work satisfactorily.  Although a good agency will attempt to provide continuity of care, in practice it is difficult to find live-in carers who are prepared to do the job on a permanent basis.  People often take live-in posts as temporary “fill-in” jobs because of their own personal circumstances at the time.  When their circumstances change, they move on.  In addition, agency staff are paid significantly less than the rates paid to directly employed carers.  Mrs Sargent’s experience is that agency staff tend to be of lower calibre than staff who are recruited directly and often have less commitment to their clients than members of a directly employed care team.  Mrs Sargent said that the fact that the live-in carer would be entitled to a 3-hour rest period in the middle of the day would also present problems.  The claimant would require the assistance of a second carer throughout the day.  He may wish to go on an outing lasting all or most of the day.  The fact that, for 3 hours of every day, he would have only one carer available would place a significant restriction on his activities. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On this issue I have no hesitation in preferring the evidence of Mrs Sargent to that of Ms Douglas.  No doubt there are cases in which Ms Douglas’s proposed care model works well.  However, it is entirely dependent on the calibre and commitment of the individual whom the relevant agency is able to provide at any given time.  There is an obvious potential for rapid turnover of live-in staff and for difficulties in ensuring that any replacement/relief staff provided by the agency – perhaps at short notice – are fully and properly trained in the claimant’s needs.  There is also a potential for confusion of management responsibilities between the case manager and the agency, and for conflict to be caused by an arrangement whereby live-in carers are working alongside higher paid, directly employed staff.  Moreover, Ms Douglas’s proposed regime would inevitably leave the claimant for 3 hours every day without a second carer.  That would not be in his best interests. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I am satisfied that the claimant’s needs would best be met by the recruitment by his case manager of a team of carers who would, between them, provide care for him round the clock and would work under the direct control and management of the case manager, assisted by the team leader.  I consider that this arrangement has the best chance of providing continuity of care for the claimant and of ensuring that, at all times, those caring for him are fully trained to meet his specific requirements, in particular his mobility, communication and feeding needs.  The existence of a team of carers should mean that periods of illness, holidays and other absences can be covered by carers known to the claimant and appropriately trained.  I recognise that such a care regime will inevitably mean that a significant number of people will be visiting his home on a daily basis.  I also recognise that, during the night, only one carer will be present.  However, since it is envisaged that the claimant will be living with his parents throughout his life, it is likely that one or other of them would be available to help in the event of an emergency.  In any event, I consider that the advantages of Mrs Sargent’s proposed regime significantly outweigh any disadvantages.  I therefore accept her costings for this period.  </p>

In the event, I am quite satisfied that the evidence that Mrs Sargent gave in December 2010 was entirely untainted by any hope or expectation she may have had that her organisation would in the future take over the claimant’s case management.  Nevertheless, I regard the decision to accept the claimant as a client at a time when the litigation was still in progress as unfortunate and ill-judged.  Furthermore, I consider that Ms Ongley-Delgar’s decision (one of her “Goals for April”) to proceed with employing a team leader in advance of the court’s decision in relation to that issue was both unattractive and unwise.  It was unattractive because it appears to have been an attempt to pre-empt the court’s decision by establishing a <span style="font-style:italic">fait accompli</span>.

Thus, it is impossible for me to form a view as to whether the expenditure has been reasonable and/or necessary.  In the circumstances, I consider that it is appropriate to adopt figures which accord with Mrs Sargent’s estimate of future annual costs, as the defendant has suggested.  The total award for past case management fees and associated costs will therefore be <span style="font-weight:bold">£46,358</span>.</p>

It seems that, until about 2009, the claimant had direct contact with one of the physiotherapists attached to the school on a regular (usually weekly) basis.  Since then, however, the physiotherapy input has been much reduced.  The evidence of Ms Mia Dodsworth, Assistant Headteacher of the school, was that the visiting physiotherapists rarely have direct contact with pupils.  Their activities are confined to advising staff on programmes to be followed with individual children.  Those programmes are then implemented by staff, including (in the claimant’s case) the one to one classroom assistant whose function it is to support him at school.  In Ms Nowell’s latest witness statement, made in May 2011, she said that the claimant is currently receiving 15 minutes’ direct input each half term from the school physiotherapist.  That time includes training for his one to one assistant and the preparation of a written programme of therapy for him.  Ms Nowell observes that there is a great deal of concern amongst parents about the inadequate level of physiotherapy input available at the school.  Having heard the evidence of Ms Dodsworth, I have no difficulty in accepting that this is the case. </p>

However, having read the evidence given by the medical witnesses to the effect that the claimant had now reached the peak of his physical and functional potential, she revised her views.  When she gave oral evidence, she expressed the view that, from the present time until he leaves school, the claimant will require one session a week with a physiotherapist (or 45 sessions per annum, to take account of holidays).  The priority will be to maintain his existing level of function. </p>

She explained that her experience was that it was necessary to set aside separate time for the purpose of training, rather than to carry out all training during the regular therapy sessions.  This was necessary because of carers’ differing work schedules and the inevitable turnover of carers.  Also, she would expect to spend some sessions explaining to carers the physiological reasons for the techniques they are being instructed to use.  The additional sessions could also be used for reviewing the claimant’s equipment and for participating in meetings with therapists from other disciplines who are involved in the claimant’s care.  Mrs Filson’s assessment results in an annual claim of £5,130 for this period. </p>

However, given the current financial climate, this seems unlikely.  I therefore consider it appropriate to approach my assessment of the need for physiotherapy on the basis that the claimant will have minimal direct contact time with the school physiotherapist in future, although he will have the benefit of following a programme of physical activities implemented by the school staff.  That approach affects my assessment of the claimant’s need for physiotherapy in two ways.  First, I consider that more direct contact by the home physiotherapist will be necessary than would be the case if the claimant were having regular direct contact with a physiotherapist at school.  Second, it seems to me that, if the school physiotherapist is not seeing the claimant on a regular basis, there may well be a greater need for liaison between the home and school physiotherapists (and, possibly, the home physiotherapist and school staff) so as to ensure that the school’s programme of activities is updated as necessary to take account of any developments in the claimant’s physical condition.  In making my assessment of the claimant’s needs, I have taken these matters into account.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I consider that Mrs Holt’s proposed provision of direct physiotherapy is insufficient to take account of all the functions which the physiotherapist will be required to perform.  In particular, it does not, in my view, take account of the very limited physiotherapy provision at the claimant’s school.  I accept Mrs Filson’s evidence that, throughout the period until the claimant attains the age of 19 years, there will be an ongoing need for a physiotherapist to provide one to one therapy, in addition to monitoring the suitability of the claimant’s seating, walking aids and other equipment and conferring with other professionals involved with his care and treatment.  I accept also that it is not possible for all training and other functions to be performed effectively during the course of one to one therapy sessions. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Nevertheless, I regard Mrs Filson’s estimate of 45 sessions per annum as too high.  It seems to me that fortnightly one to one therapy sessions (say 24 per annum, allowing for holidays) will be sufficient.  Those sessions will be reinforced by a programme of physical activities to be devised by the physiotherapist and implemented on a daily basis by the claimant’s carers.  I consider that it is also reasonable to provide for additional sessions to be spent in training the claimant’s carers, liaising with the claimant’s school and carrying out other necessary functions which cannot be incorporated into the one to one sessions.  I would allow a further 12 sessions for these purposes, making a total of 36 sessions per annum.  The annual cost (at the claimant’s suggested rate of £90) will be £3,240.

During this period, there will be no requirement to liaise with the claimant’s school and there is likely to be less change in his equipment needs.  However, there will be a larger number of individuals involved in his care and they will require careful training and supervision.

This would assist in reducing the tightness of his muscles.  By contrast, Mrs Holt’s opinion is that there is no clinical need for regular aquatic physiotherapy.  Her evidence was that aquatic physiotherapy is a specific therapy which is beneficial for patients who have undergone surgery.  It enables them to move without pain and thus to gain confidence and progress to performing the same movements outside the water.  For patients such as the claimant, no such progress is possible.  Although it may be pleasurable for them to be able to have some freedom of movement in the water, the increased movements will not be replicable on dry land and therefore have no lasting therapeutic benefit.  Mrs Holt does, however, accept that there may be times during the claimant’s life (e.g. following surgery) when a course of aquatic physiotherapy might be beneficial. </p>

The only evidence in support of a clinical need for any additional provision of aquatic physiotherapy comes from Mrs Filson.  She suggests it as only one aspect of the activities to be undertaken in the course of the claimant’s general physiotherapy provision.  Her evidence does not support the extensive claim for aquatic physiotherapy contained in the Schedule of Loss.  I have no doubt that the claimant enjoys his aquatic physiotherapy sessions, just as he enjoys his visits to the swimming pool with his family and/or carers.  I readily accept that exercising in water is generally beneficial for him.  However, I am not satisfied that the claimant has established a clinical need which cannot adequately be met by physiotherapy exercises carried out in an ordinary swimming pool with suitably trained carers and, occasionally, his treating physiotherapist.

I am satisfied that, from the age of 19 years, it would be appropriate to award an annual sum to cover membership of the Virgin Active club or a comparable facility for the claimant and his carers.  I intend to adopt the defendant’s proposal of awarding an annual sum to cover the additional cost attributable to the claimant’s disabilities of accessing suitable leisure facilities (including a swimming pool) and of funding any necessary training for carers.  I consider that this annual allowance will be required throughout his lifetime.  When considering the annual sum that would be appropriate, I have taken into account various factors, including the fact that the need for additional facilities will decrease towards the end of the claimant’s life and that, from his late twenties, he might well have had membership of a private leisure facility in any event.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the past, the claimant has attended sessions at the Diamond Riding Centre, Carshalton (the Centre), a well known equestrian establishment offering riding for people with disabilities.  The claimant is not able to ride a pony in a conventional manner but has in the past undergone courses of “hippotherapy”, i.e. exercises performed in lying and other positions on a pony.  Hippotherapy sessions take place under the supervision of a member of staff at the Centre and with the assistance of volunteers.  Because of the high level of demand, attendance at the Centre is “rationed” to one school term per annum.  Although it was at one stage suggested at trial that, if an individual was prepared to pay for attendance, rationing did not apply, this did not accord with the evidence of the claimants’ parents. </p>

They have been unsuccessful in finding an alternative riding establishment where it would be possible for the claimant to have sessions all the year round.  At the suggestion of the Centre, they have purchased for his use a device known as an “I Joyride”,  which simulates the movements of a horse and which he can use for exercise at times when hippotherapy sessions are not available to him.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The claim is put on the basis that, until the age of 30, the claimant will have three 12-week terms per annum of weekly hippotherapy sessions at a cost of £15 per session.  The annual cost claimed is £540.  The defendant’s case is that the claimant will not be able to attend the Centre for more than one term per year.  In any event, the defendant contends that any costs that might be incurred should be met out of the allowance already made for the additional costs of accessing suitable leisure facilities.  The physiotherapy experts agree that a continuation of his hippotherapy sessions will be of benefit to the claimant and is clinically reasonable.</p>

That being the case, and since the annual figure I have allowed for the additional cost of accessing specific leisure facilities (see paragraph 268 above) was not intended to include the cost of hippotherapy sessions, I consider it appropriate to make an award for the annual cost of riding sessions to the age of 30.  Currently, the claimant can attend sessions for only one term per annum and there is no evidence that the position will change in the future.  I therefore allow one third of the annual cost claimed, i.e. <span style="font-weight:bold">£180</span>.</p>

The costs to the start of the trial in November 2010 were estimated in the sum of £700, which was agreed.  However, total costs of £4,540 were incurred during the period between November 2010 and June 2011.

No explanation has been advanced as to why expenses on this unexpectedly large scale have been incurred.  In those circumstances, I cannot be confident that all the expenditure has been reasonably required.

They described the steps that were being taken to enable him to communicate more effectively.  He had been provided with an e-tran frame, by which he could use his eyes to point to objects, pictures and symbols.  He had then progressed to a communication book, but his use of this was inconsistent and, at the time the educational psychologists saw him, he was refusing to use it at all.  The school speech and language therapist was preparing to introduce the claimant to a communication aid known as a Pragmatic Organised Dynamic Display (PODD) to practise scanning and selection.  He has subsequently been provided with a PODD which, at the time of the trial, he appeared to be using with some success.

As a result, his efforts were slow and laborious.  He had succeeded in using a hand switch to stop and start a SMART platform. (I shall refer at greater length to this activity later in this judgment).  The educational psychologists consider that the claimant will always have difficulty in manipulating switches speedily and accurately enough to communicate satisfactorily by that means.  They consider that he is more likely to benefit from the use of the newly developed “eye gaze” technology.  Shortly before the educational psychologists’ assessments, he had been given an opportunity to try out a communication aid known as a “My Tobii”.</p>

In oral evidence, Mr Baldwin noted that the claimant was now using a PODD and accepted that some progress appeared to have been made since his assessment.  He therefore reduced his proposed provision for intensive therapy to 5 sessions.  The defendant agrees that provision, although it is contended that the cost per session will be £150, not £200.

He suggested that the family as a whole had psychological issues which needed to be resolved by psychological input.  They were, he said, a high achieving family and the claimant’s parents (in particular, Mr Whiten) would need help to come to terms with the emotional effects of the claimant’s condition and with the restrictions placed upon them by the claimant’s disabilities.  They would also need advice and support in resolving practical questions such as whether or not they should move out of London.  This would involve looking at suitable alternative schools for the claimant and considering the needs of his brothers.

In oral evidence, she accepted that an additional 3 sessions (making 23 sessions in all) would be required for advice to be given to the claimant’s parents and carers about the claimant’s management during adolescence.  However, she did not consider that someone with the claimant’s profound learning disabilities would benefit from the type and scale of psychotherapeutic intervention suggested by Mr Baldwin.

There is no reason to believe that any change of carers will precipitate the type of psychological crisis envisaged by him.  Many of the other events identified by Mr Baldwin are unlikely to occur or, if they do, will not necessarily cause psychological upheaval.  Even if they, or other events, give rise on occasion to the need for psychotherapeutic input, such input is likely to be limited in scale and duration.  The intervention would not be directed at the claimant himself.  Its purpose would be to assist the claimant’s parents and carers in managing his behaviour.  If the advice given does not produce a positive result within a relatively short time, it is not working and there would be no point in persisting with further sessions. </p>

Another authority might refuse to fund the claimant’s one to one classroom assistant.  If that happened and the Tribunal upheld the decision, the claimant would have to employ a privately paid one to one assistant The cost of employing an assistant is claimed in the sum of £15,000 per annum, plus national insurance contributions of £1,920 per annum.

Despite that omission, the claimant had in fact been allocated a one to one assistant since he started at Linden Lodge.  She is funded partly by the local authority, the Borough of Wandsworth, and partly by the school.  In his Report, Mr Baldwin pointed out that the fact that the claimant’s Statement did not formally identify the need for one to one assistance meant that funding could be withdrawn at any time.  He advised the claimant’s parents to request an amendment to the claimant’s Statement.  He further advised that, if the Borough of Wandsworth refused the amendment, the claimant’s parents should appeal to a Tribunal. </p>

A copy of the email and the proposed amended Statement were in the trial bundle.

In the unlikely event that he did not see the email and/or open the attachment, there is no reason why he should not have received the hard copy of the proposed amended Statement.  If he had not done so and been satisfied by its contents, I have no doubt that he would have carried out his original threat and lodged an appeal to a Tribunal in October 2010.  If, as I find, Mr Whiten was well aware that the Statement had been amended, it seems inconceivable that he would not have told Ms Nowell of the fact.  Yet, until the documents were specifically drawn to her attention by counsel, her oral evidence was to the effect that the Borough of Wandsworth would not give the claimant the security he needed.  I find – with regret – that the claimant’s parents were intending deliberately to give the impression that the Borough of Wandsworth had not agreed to amend the Statement in an attempt to strengthen the claims for the legal costs associated with Tribunal proceedings and for the salary of a one to one assistant.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the past, the claimant has received some OT input from the statutory services.  In October 2008, his parents engaged a private occupational therapist, Mrs Margaret Ellis, to assess the claimant and provide OT advice and support.  She arranged for the manufacture of two hand orthoses (splints) for the claimant’s use.  During 2008 and 2009, she visited him at home and at school to give advice about such matters as seating, use of the orthoses and exercises to promote hand control.  In August 2010, Mrs Ellis was replaced by Ms Daphne Neethling.  The Schedule of Loss claimed OT costs incurred up to the end of October 2010 in the sum of £1,735 and estimated the likely further costs to the date of trial at £700, making a total of £2,435.  That figure was agreed.  In the event, however, the sum of £2,265 is claimed for the period from November 2010 to May 2011, making a total claim of £4,000.  The defendant contends that the recent provision of OT has been excessive and that past costs should be no more than £2,435. </p>

In addition, the defendant has now agreed to pay training costs incurred in respect of the claimant’s carer, Lida.  The training was in the HANDLE therapy which the defendant does not accept has any clinically proven benefit.  Nevertheless, the defendant concedes that some OT training for the claimant’s carers would have been required.  The sum claimed is £2,586.  The defendant queries whether this amount is correct, suggesting that the true figure is £2,006.  Invoices evidencing the higher figure appear at TB8/225-6 and I therefore allow the sum claimed of <span style="font-weight:bold">£2,586</span>.</p>

Consequently, the claimant will have to engage the services of a privately paid occupational therapist to carry out periodic reviews of his equipment, to advise on appropriate replacement  and to train his carers how to use the equipment appropriately.  She said that the claimant has complex needs and advising on new equipment to meet those needs will be a time-consuming business.  It will involve reviewing available products, dealing with equipment suppliers and, on occasion, obtaining for inspection a range of different products from which a choice can be made.  All the therapist’s actions will require appropriate documentation. </p>

He attends a school where the staff are highly skilled and will be able to alert his parents to any future equipment requirements he may have.  The case manager will deal with the maintenance and repair of equipment.  Ms Page accepted that the occupational therapist will have a role in training, guiding and encouraging the carers in a co-ordinated approach to handling the claimant.  He or she should contribute to the development of the care plan and should help set targets for progress.  However, she said that, because of the claimant’s physical condition, those targets will be modest and will not change very frequently.</p>

She said that there would be no need for regular visits throughout the year.  The claimant’s carers and members of staff at his school will be monitoring his needs on a daily basis and following his care plan.  The items of equipment upon which OT advice will be required are relatively limited.  His seating will need regular monitoring and advice.  However, once a suitable seating system has been identified, the identical system can be used in each of his various items of equipment.  From the age of 12 until he attains the age of 19 years, Ms Page considers that only 8 hours per annum of OT will be required at an annual cost of £520 (exclusive of travel and mileage).

In addition to his immediate needs, the OT experts have provided for the replacement of various items of equipment throughout the claimant’s life.  Each purchase of new equipment will require some research into available products and an informed decision as to which will best meet the claimant’s needs.  OT input will be necessary in order to ensure that the right decisions are made and that the various items of equipment, when purchased, are used correctly.  Equipment for persons with disability is constantly changing and developing and it cannot be assumed that, throughout the claimant’s life, replacement will always be of “like with like”.  If it were, the claimant would be denied the opportunity to take advantage of more advanced technology. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my view, Ms Page’s estimate of the need for OT fails to take account of these various factors and is unrealistically low.  However, I consider that Ms Jenkins’ allowance is too high, given the amount of equipment with which the claimant has already been provided and the assistance he will also receive from his physiotherapist and case manager and from members of the school staff.  Whilst I accept that a high level of OT input may be necessary in some years, when large items of equipment have to be replaced, I do not consider that such a high level of input will be required on an annual basis.  In some years, the need will be considerably less.  I am satisfied therefore that an allowance of 24 hours’ OT per annum is reasonable for the period from trial until the claimant is aged 19 years.  Taking the defendant’s figure of £30 per hour for travel and mileage, the annual cost of OT during this period, including training, will be <span style="font-weight:bold">£3,030</span>.  </p>

His parents were concerned that these aids did not enable him to maintain the correct foot, knee and hip positions when standing and walking.  Having assessed the claimant, Mr Walmsley recommended that he should be fitted with a pair of dynamic ankle foot orthoses (DAFOs) in an attempt to control and maintain a correct foot position.  The DAFOs were to be worn all day inside normal trainers or inside his Piedro boots, when he was standing or walking.  Mr Walmsley also recommended clip-on AFOs to be used in conjunction with the DAFOs for standing and therapy.

She noted that, in March 2009, the claimant’s father had reported to Mr Walmsley that the claimant had not been wearing his AFOs as much as his DAFOs.  In April 2010, he told Mr Walmsley that the AFOs had not been worn as much at home as at school.

It does not seem that they were intended to be used merely to reduce strain on the DAFOs, as Mrs Filson suggested.  In any event, it is clear that the AFOs have been used, albeit not to the same extent as the DAFOs.  I note that the AFOs are used when the claimant is at school.  This suggests that the school recognises that there is a therapeutic need for them in certain circumstances.  I am satisfied that there is a need for both AFOs and DAFOs and I allow the claim in full. </p>

The defendant accepts that the purchase of the buggy was reasonable.  The issue between the parties relates to the period for which a replacement buggy will be necessary.  The claim is for four-yearly replacement of the buggy for life.  The defendant accepts that the purchase of a larger buggy when the claimant is aged 11 or 12 years is reasonable but does not accept that any further replacement will be necessary or appropriate. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The buggy has a rigid back and does not afford good postural support.  The level of support can be improved by the use of a moulded insert but it is still not ideal for a person with the claimant’s problems.  As a consequence, the buggy will have to be used in conjunction with a tightly fitting garment known as a “second skin”.  Ms Page’s view was that, as the claimant gets older, he will not be prepared to tolerate wearing the “second skin” for long periods of time.  Even with the “second skin”, the buggy would not give sufficient postural support to be used for long periods.  Moreover, it would not be possible for the claimant to travel in a vehicle whilst sitting in the buggy so that he would have to be transferred from his wheelchair to the buggy at the start of an expedition and back into his wheelchair after it.  At present, Mr Whiten is able to lift him into his buggy.  However, that will become impossible when the claimant gets heavier and he will have to be lifted using a portable hoist or lifting sling.  This would be inconvenient and would involve a degree of risk.  As the claimant becomes heavier, the buggy will need a considerable amount of effort to push it on uneven surfaces.  For all these reasons, Ms Page did not consider that it would be practicable for the claimant to use the buggy beyond the age of about 18 years. </p>

However, she considered that the problems would have to be balanced against the claimant’s right to access more rugged terrain and against the family’s understandable wish to include him in their expeditions. </p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">I am satisfied that, once the claimant reaches adulthood, the problems associated with the use of the buggy are likely to outweigh any benefits to the claimant in having it available.  In particular, the “second skin” is likely to be hot and uncomfortable to wear and the fact that he will be able to tolerate it only for short periods of time will place a restriction on any expedition undertaken.  Moreover, the degree of manual handling which will be required to get the claimant in and out of the buggy is likely to prove a discouragement to both him and his carers.  The difficulty of pushing the buggy on uneven surfaces will also be a deterrent.  I have therefore allowed for only one replacement buggy at the age of 12 years. </p>

There are issues between the parties in relation to the cost of the bath and the appropriate replacement period.  Ms Jenkins quotes a cost of £8,760, whilst Ms Page’s costing is £7,476, the difference being that Ms Jenkins has included the cost of a whirlpool facility which Ms Page considers is not required.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At school, the claimant has had access to a SMART system whereby his manual wheelchair is mounted on a platform which runs along a track in the school corridor.  The platform can be operated by means of a single switch which causes the chair to stop and start.  Additional switches can be introduced in order to cause the chair to turn left or right.  When first introduced to the SMART system, the claimant demonstrated that he was physically able to use a single switch to stop and start the SMART platform, but rapidly lost interest in the activity which, as a result, was discontinued.  I am told that it has since been re-introduced with some success.  The claimant will continue to have access to the SMART system at school under the supervision of a member of staff.  It is possible to purchase a powered chair (a SMART chair) with similar controls to the SMART platform.  The SMART chair is a heavy and cumbersome piece of equipment which is not suitable for use in a community setting or as a functional means of transport.  Its primary use is as an aid to learning how to control a powered chair at a basic level and in a safe setting. </p>

If he can learn that skill reliably, he will be ready for the second stage.  The second stage would be aimed at giving him greater independence by teaching him to control a SMART chair independent of the track.  The chair would be fitted with sensors which would automatically cut off the power to the chair in the event of a collision with any object.  The claimant would have the option of moving in different directions, rather than just in a straight line.  He would have to learn to anticipate obstacles and to stop or change course in time to avoid them.  Ms Jenkins and Ms Page agreed that it is only at the second stage that they would expect the claimant to start to use eye gaze technology to control the SMART chair. </p>

Time would be wasted transferring him out of his manual wheelchair in order to access his SMART chair.  Ms Page agreed that the claimant might be able to use his own SMART chair on a track in the garden at home but said that it was not yet clear whether he would progress to being able to use additional switches to change direction.  If he did not, the SMART chair would be of very limited use.  At home, the claimant can already achieve a degree of independent mobility using his “skate” and (with assistance) his trike and walker.  Mrs Page doubts whether the SMART chair would offer him any greater degree of freedom or fun and points out that, when he was introduced to it at school, he rapidly lost interest in using it.  However, she accepts that he should be provided with a SMART chair from the age of 11½ to 25 years.  She agreed the costs of the chair and seating system as claimed.   </p>

Indeed, it is possible that his time might actually be reduced by the need to transfer him from his wheelchair into the SMART chair and back again.  As to use of the SMART chair at home, whilst the claimant is in the first stage of his learning, this could only take place on the paths in the garden and would be limited to travelling in a straight line on a track.  There is in my view a real danger that, if he spends too long on this activity, he will tire of it as he did in the past.  I consider that the need for a SMART chair will arise at the age of 11½ years, when the family move house and he is ready to move to the second stage. </p>

She said that they are appropriate for persons who suffer from pressure sores or other similar conditions.  The claimant does not have those problems.  She agreed that the Groove would give the claimant a smoother ride than the Spectra and that it has the advantage of having power to all four wheels, rendering it very stable.  However, she considers that the Groove is larger and more powerful than the claimant will require, bearing in mind that it is likely to be controlled by his carers for most, if not all, of the time.

By contrast, the Spectra wheelchair can be operated using both eye gaze technology and SMART controls.  In the Counter Schedule, the defendant agreed the addition of SMART controls, at a cost of £5,500, to the basic Spectra wheelchair.

That is the Alex 3 wheelchair which costs £13,000.  This model was mentioned at a late stage and I have little information about it.

At the same time, he will also be provided with a SMART chair and will, it is hoped, be starting to use the SMART chair in conjunction with eye gaze technology.  At that time, he will not need SMART controls or eye gaze facilities on his powered wheelchair.  However, in my view he will need high/low and tilt facilities.  The high/low facility will be of obvious benefit to him on occasion in order to bring his eye level to or nearer to the level of people standing around him, or to enable him to get a better view of something which is of interest to him.  The tilt facility will enable his carers easily to change his position within the wheelchair in order to relieve discomfort of any sort.  If the choice of wheelchair model were to be made now, it would be between the Groove at £9,020 and the Spectra (with the additional facilities) at about £6,000.  The fact that the Groove gives a smoother ride is of considerable importance to the claimant’s comfort, particularly in the event that he is suffering from pain in his hip or elsewhere.

At that stage, I consider that, on a balance of probabilities, his needs will best be met by the provision of a powered wheelchair which can be operated using SMART controls or eye gaze technology.  By that arrangement, the wheelchair will serve a dual purpose.  It will have attendant controls, enabling the claimant’s carers to operate it.  In addition, the provision of SMART controls or eye gaze technology will give the claimant the opportunity to retain a degree (albeit in all probability a very limited degree) of independent mobility throughout his life by operating his powered wheelchair in a protected environment such as a public park whilst under the supervision of his carers.

Mr Lysley estimated that the cost of installation would be between £10,000 and £15,000 with a replacement period of 10 years.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The defendant’s case is that an environmental control system is not appropriate for the claimant, who will always have very limited cognitive abilities.  The defendant contends that the claimant will be able to operate his leisure equipment without the necessity of a separate environmental control system by using other devices which have already been included in the claim.  Miss Whipple submitted that it will be unnecessary for the claimant to be able to switch lights on and off or open and close curtains as he will have carers to do these tasks for him.  There is, she suggests, a risk that, given his limited understanding, he would use the environmental as a plaything or as a means of thwarting his carers.  She argued that, given the marginal benefit that the claimant would derive from an environmental control system, the expense would not be justified.  She argued also that Mr Lysley is not an expert in the field and his cost estimates cannot therefore be relied upon. </p>

The cost of a system that would permit him to do this would be disproportionate to the benefit he would derive from it.  He will have carers to attend to his needs and comfort.  I am satisfied, however, that it would be of real benefit to him to be able to operate and adjust his leisure equipment.  My understanding is that it will be possible for him to do this by means of the “My Tobii” or a similar device, provided of course that he can develop the necessary skills to use it.  I therefore make no award for this item. </p>

There was a small private garden/courtyard accessed by means of a steep set of iron steps leading from the kitchen.  Before the claimant’s birth, his parents had carried out refurbishment work on the property, including installing a new kitchen/diner and a new bathroom, repairing the roof, fitting dormer windows, boarding the floor of the loft, installing a power supply there and redecorating throughout the property.  </p>

Accordingly, they decided to look for alternative accommodation in the same area.  In early 2006, they sold the maisonette for £295,000 and purchased their current home, 192 Crowborough Road, Tooting, at a price of £400,000.  Initially, £360,000 of the purchase price was funded by a mortgage.  The amount of the mortgage has since been increased to £420,000.  The property at 192 Crowborough Road was a two-storey terraced house with an unconverted loft.  Although the house was in poor repair, it offered considerably more space than the maisonette, together with the potential for adaptation and extension.  It also had the benefit of a good-sized garden. </p>

At that stage, the claimant’s parents began to explore the possibility of carrying out work to make the house suitable for the claimant’s needs.  With the help of the then case manager, they obtained advice from a specialist firm of architects, ARa, who drew up plans for limited adaptations, including the installation of a lift from the ground floor to the claimant’s bedroom on the first floor, the provision of specialist bathing and changing facilities for him and some redecoration work.  According to Ms Nowell’s witness statement of 23 October 2006, the estimated cost of the adaptations was initially £75,000.  Planning permission was obtained for these limited works and, in October 2006, an interim payment of £175,000 was made for the purpose, <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>, of funding the adaptations.

The revised plans were shown to Mr Wethers in May 2007.  In his first Report, he observed that the third proposed scheme (which included the conversion of the loft, with the creation of a bedroom for the claimant’s parents, a family bathroom and a further smaller bedroom) would enable carers’ accommodation to be created on the first floor and would afford the claimant’s parents a reasonable degree of privacy.  He considered that the revised plans were “a vast improvement” on the second proposed scheme and would render the house suitable for the claimant in the short term.  However, he identified a number of drawbacks which would remain.  He pointed out that the carers’ accommodation would not have an entrance separate from that used by the rest of the family, that the claimant’s bathroom would not be en suite (this, however, was later remedied), that there was no garage or undercover access to the front door and that the ramp leading to the front door was steeper than was ideal.  He expressed the view that, even with the proposed adaptations and extension the house would remain suitable only up to the point when the claimant’s equipment and care needs increased and he needed “reasonable independence”.  At that time, the claimant would require a “differently constituted and larger home”.  Mr Wethers noted that ARa estimated that the final proposed scheme would cost about £285,000, including professional fees and V.A.T., but excluding the cost of specialist equipment. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Wethers advised that, as an alternative to altering 192 Crowborough Road, the family should consider other possible options.  One possible course would be to purchase a larger property in the area of 192 Crowborough Road and adapt it to meet the claimant’s needs.  Mr Wethers identified an example of such a property which would have been capable of adaptation to provide suitable accommodation.  The property was a substantial and elegant detached house set in a landscaped garden.  It was on the market for £1,395,000 and would have required alterations costing about £200,000 to make it suitable for the claimant’s needs.  It would have been a very expensive option.  The second possibility identified by Mr Wethers was to purchase a four-bedroomed bungalow outside London (e.g. in Surrey) and to alter and extend it to meet the claimant’s needs.  Mr Wethers had carried out a preliminary investigation into available properties, as a result of which he estimated the cost of a suitable bungalow at £560,000-£600,000.  He estimated that the likely cost of the necessary adaptation work (including specialised equipment, professional fees and V.A.T.) would be £267,933.

He rejected that option immediately on the ground that it was highly unlikely that it would be possible to find a vacant plot of land at a reasonable price.  The second option was the same as that suggested by Mr Wethers, namely to purchase a four-bedroomed bungalow in South London/Surrey and to adapt and/or extend it.  He considered that it would be possible to purchase a suitable bungalow for about £500,000.  He estimated the cost of extending and adapting such a property at £250,958, inclusive of the necessary equipment, professional fees and V.A.T..</p>

The experts believed that the claimant and his family would outgrow the adapted property within five years or so, i.e. around the time of the claimant’s seventh or eighth birthday.  The claimant’s solicitors said that, in those circumstances, the claimant’s parents were prepared to abandon the idea of adapting 192 Crowborough Road, provided that a suitable property within the Borough of Wandsworth could be identified, purchased and suitably adapted.  They explained that it was necessary for the family to remain in the Borough of Wandsworth in order to preserve access to local services, established support networks and their preferred school placement for the claimant at Linden Lodge.

The property comprises, on the ground floor, a hall, an open plan sitting room (with lift to the claimant’s bedroom on the first floor), a kitchen/dining area, a conservatory, which is used as an equipment store and gives access to the garden, a physiotherapy/play room with storage cupboard, a small utility room and a lavatory with specially adapted shower.  The claimant’s bedroom and en suite bathroom are on the first floor, together with a small bedroom used as a study, a carers’ bedroom with en suite shower and another bedroom currently used by Dexter.  The loft has been converted so as to provide a large bedroom and store for the claimant’s parents, a family bathroom and a small bedroom which is at present being used as a nursery for Victor.  Further storage space for equipment is available in a garden shed which was erected as part of the adaptation work.</p>

In his original Schedule of Loss served in January 2010, the claim for future accommodation was put on the basis that the move to a new property would take place in about 2023 when he would be aged 19 years.  In April 2010, the Schedule of Loss was amended to bring the need for future accommodation forward to the end of 2015, when the claimant will be aged 11½ years. </p>

Until a late stage in the trial, the defendant’s contention was that, since the claimant’s parents had opted to continue with the adaptations regardless of the views of the experts, they would have to accept the consequences and continue to live at the property despite the fact that it was not ideal.  As to damages, its position was that the claimant was entitled to recover the cost of the adaptations to 192 Crowborough Road up to (but not beyond) the cost of adaptations that would have been incurred had his parents acted reasonably and purchased and adapted a bungalow outside London.  The claimant was not, the defendant contended, entitled to recover the costs associated with any future move since that would involve requiring the defendant to pay for adaptation work to be carried out twice over. </p>

When asked whether the property would meet the needs of the claimant and his family in the long term and, if not, why not, Mr Wethers referred to the disadvantages of the property to which he had already referred.  He then went on to say that the dimensions of the claimant’s bedroom, bathroom and therapy room are all well below the recommended levels and will be too small for him before he is fully grown.  There is no shower in the claimant’s bathroom and he has to be taken downstairs in order to be showered which is unsatisfactory and will not be acceptable when he is older.  The open plan design of the ground floor and the fact that the carers’ accommodation is situated in the main body of the house mean that there is no privacy for the family.  This will become particularly difficult as the claimant’s brothers grow up.  The dining area of the kitchen will be too small to accommodate the family as well as carers.  Mr Wethers said that, for those reasons, the family would have to look for an alternative property in the long term.</p>

He said that, in time, the claimant will become too big to be manoeuvred in his bedroom and bathroom.  That would, he said, be an “insuperable problem” and, in order to avoid it, the family will have to move. </p>

Whilst the adaptations have made good use of the available space and meet the current needs of the claimant and his family, there is no doubt in my mind that, as the claimant and his brothers grow up and the number of carers increases, the house will become too small for the family and a move will be essential.  It is unfortunate that the experts did not make their views (and the reasons for those views) clearer at an earlier stage.  If they had done so, a considerable amount of time and argument would have been saved.</p>

However, the defendant’s case on damages remains substantially the same.  It contends that the claimant should be awarded damages on the basis that his parents should have followed the experts’ advice and purchased and adapted a property outside London in 2006 or 2007.  Had they done so, the defendant contends, no further move would have been necessary and the costs of adapting 192 Crowborough Road would not have been incurred.  </p>

Mr Whiten’s evidence was that the couple had never discussed moving from the maisonette prior to the claimant’s birth.  I have seen witness statements from several of the couple’s friends, who confirm that, before the claimant’s birth, they had no intention of moving in the short term.  Ms Nowell’s mother says that they intended to stay at the maisonette for at least five years after the claimant’s birth but that does not accord with the evidence of Mr Whiten and Ms Nowell, which was far less certain.  They said in oral evidence that they would probably have moved to larger accommodation at some time, but professed themselves unable to say when they would have done so or even whether or not it was likely that they would have done so by the time of the trial. </p>

Those same features of the property which made it entirely unsuitable for the claimant with his disabilities would also have made it difficult to bring up one small child – let alone two small children – there.  The iron staircase leading to the garden would have been a particular hazard and the garden itself had little room for children to play.  Even if it had not previously been the couple’s intention to move on, I am confident that the disadvantages of the property would have become evident shortly after the claimant’s birth and a decision to move would have been taken.  </p>

Whilst it is true that the refurbishment work they carried out on the maisonette would have enabled them to convert the loft and remain there had they chosen to do so, the work would also have had the effect of enhancing the value of the flat in the event that they wished to sell it.  I am satisfied that, in doing the work, they had this very much in mind.  I do not consider that they (in particular Mr Whiten) have been frank with the court about their plans prior to the claimant’s birth or their probable accommodation arrangements thereafter.

I find that, at that time, they would have wished to progress up the housing ladder and, if necessary, would have sold Ms Nowell’s property in the North East in order to facilitate this.  I am satisfied, that they would have purchased a property of a similar value to 192 Crowborough Road and in the same area, which, as they told Mr Wethers in early 2007, was convenient for their work and friends.  They may have chosen a property in better repair than 192 Crowborough Road, but I am satisfied that their capital outlay would have been of the same order.  Consequently, the expenses associated with moving to 192 Crowborough Road (£27,835) would have been incurred in any event (albeit in connection with a different property) and I make no award under that head.  </p>

They were represented by solicitors and had access to the necessary advice.  However, that contention does not take into account the pressures upon the couple at the relevant time.  They were both working, Ms Nowell part-time.  They were trying to obtain the appropriate therapy and other support for the claimant.  They were living under difficult conditions.  There was no certainty that the claimant would receive damages at all.  The causation aspect of his claim might have remained unresolved for months, even years.  His parents took the view that they had to solve the problem by purchasing the most suitable house they could which was affordable for them and situated in the area where they were already living.  In the circumstances, it does not seem to me that it can properly be said that their decision to purchase 192 Crowborough Road was unreasonable.    </p>

He was due to start school at Linden Lodge, which was ideal for his needs and situated near to his home, in September 2007.  He was having regular physiotherapy sessions at a local hospital and at a private clinic nearby.  The family was employing a carer, Aga, who lived locally.  All these arrangements, together with the availability of the medical and other services from which the claimant was benefiting, would have been jeopardised by a move to a different area.  Moreover, Mr Whiten was employed in Central London and Ms Nowell was intending to resume work in Central London when she was able to do so.  They wanted to remain close to Central London for this purpose.

No adaptations had yet been undertaken, the house was in a poor state and the need for suitable facilities for the claimant was becoming urgent.  Ms Nowell was expecting her second child, who was born in October 2007.  The couple were unwilling to face the considerable disruption that would result from a move to an area outside London, together with the delay that would inevitably ensue.  Such a move would have involved selling 192 Crowborough Road, finding and purchasing an alternative property, planning and executing the adaptations, and moving the family there.  In addition, it would have been necessary to identify local carers and therapists, together with statutory, medical and other services for the claimant.  It might have involved moving the claimant from Linden Lodge to a school nearer the new property.  All this would have taken a great deal of time, effort and upheaval.  The move would have resulted in the claimant’s parents having longer distances to travel to work, at a time when they were already under great pressure.  Furthermore, the move would have been possible only if the defendant had been prepared to provide an interim payment large enough to enable a suitable new property to be purchased and adapted.  </p>

The cost would have been too great.  The claimant’s parents could not have afforded to buy such a property without a substantial interim payment.  Under the principle established in <span style="font-style:italic">Roberts v Johnstone</span>, a claimant does not receive an award equivalent to the capital cost of purchasing a suitable property.  Instead, he receives only the notional investment income (at the rate of 2.5% per annum) he would have earned on the capital cost incurred.  Thus, the funds for purchasing a suitable property inevitably have to be “borrowed” from the awards made under other heads of damage (e.g. for pain, suffering and loss of amenity; loss of earnings, capitalised awards for therapy and other costs).  Given that the defendant’s paediatric neurologist was expressing the view that the claimant may well have a very short life expectancy, there would have been considerable doubt at that stage as to whether, if he were given an interim payment of £1 million or so to spend on a property, he would be left with a sufficient capital sum to meet his other needs at the conclusion of the case.  </p>

That being the case, a court considering the issue of an interim payment would not have wished to make an order which might have the effect of fettering the freedom of the trial judge to allocate as large a proportion of the award to a periodical payments order as he/she considered appropriate.  Nor would the court want to make an interim award of a sum which might constitute more than a “reasonable proportion” of the lump sum that would be finally awarded: <span style="font-style:italic">Cobham Hire Services Limited v Benjamin Eeles </span>[2009] EWCA Civ 204.

As I have explained, they faced a choice between staying at 192 Crowborough Road and adapting it, or moving out of London.  Their reasons for staying at 192 Crowborough Road were compelling and I am not surprised that they came to the conclusion that it was in the best interests of the claimant and of the family as a whole to remain there.

They will be able to plan and execute any future move whilst living in a house fitted with the facilities necessary to care for the claimant.  They now have paid carers to assist with the claimant’s day to day care and are therefore under less pressure.  They are no longer reliant on employment which requires them to commute daily into Central London.  The necessary funding for the purchase and adaptations will be available.  I am satisfied that these and other factors will make any future move very much less difficult than it would have been in 2007.  </p>

Miss Whipple contended that, if the claimant’s parents were determined to stay at 192 Crowborough Road, they should have undertaken the minimum work necessary to make it possible to stay there (namely the work initially proposed by ARa in mid 2006), at a much more modest cost.  According to Ms Nowell’s witness statement of 23 October 2006, that work was intended to provide suitable bathing and changing facilities for the claimant, as well as a lift to his bedroom and some redecoration at a cost of about £75,000.  In written submissions, Miss Whipple suggested that, with V.A.T. and other costs and fees, the total cost of the work would have been in the region of £110,300.  The work would, she says, have enabled the family to manage at 192 Crowborough Road until the claimant was aged seven or eight years old.  At that time, they could have made the move to more suitable accommodation.  </p>

The house was in poor repair and work was required to put it into a decent condition.  Without the conversion of the loft, there would not have been enough room for a carer to stay overnight.  The care experts had already identified the need for an overnight carer.  Once Dexter and Victor arrived, the property would have been very cramped.  There would have been insufficient storage space for the claimant’s specialist equipment.  Without work being carried out in the garden, it would have been impossible for the claimant to benefit from it as he is currently able to do.  These are only some examples of the problems that would have arisen.  I note that it was Mr Wethers’ view that even the work contained in the second proposed scheme (which was much more extensive than that envisaged by the first scheme) would not have met the claimant’s immediate needs. </p>

Whilst they knew that 192 Crowborough Road would not be a permanent solution to the claimant’s housing needs, they did not intend to move in the short term.  Indeed, they plainly hoped (somewhat optimistically) that they would be able to stay at 192 Crowborough Road until the claimant was well into his teens.  As it is, by the time the family moves (which, for the purposes of this judgment I have assumed will be on 1 January 2016), they will have been at 192 Crowborough Road for almost 10 years.  They will have had the benefit of the adaptations for over seven years.  During those important years, the claimant will have had the opportunity to develop in an environment which has been designed and equipped to meet his specific needs.  The costs of adaptation cannot, therefore, be said to have been entirely wasted. </p>

I accept Mr Cowan’s view that the timber cube (and the paving on which it was to stand) would fall outside the boundary of what was reasonably required, as would the garden lighting.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For an initial period, repayments on the mortgage were fixed.  Ms Nowell’s evidence was that the fixed term period came to an end in about March 2008.  The alternative arrangements offered by Northern Rock were not competitive so she and Mr Whiten attempted to transfer their mortgage to an alternative provider.  However, as a result of the work being carried out on 192 Crowborough Road at that time, the house was deemed uninhabitable for mortgage purposes and they were unable to obtain an offer from any alternative provider.  Consequently, they had to pay mortgage repayments at an increased rate until the adaptation work was sufficiently advanced to permit transfer of the mortgage.  Ms Nowell said that she and Mr Whiten could not afford to pay the increased payments so they continued to pay the fixed amount whilst using monies from the claimant’s interim payment to pay the additional sum of £1,000 per month.  This arrangement continued for a period of seven months until transfer of the mortgage was eventually effected.  The claimant seeks re-imbursement of the payments made by him in the sum of £7,000. </p>

Mr Cowan does not agree that there is a need for a study (observing that there was not a study at the maisonette at 99 Lucien Road), a utility room (although, in his oral evidence, he agreed that this was necessary), a separate lavatory, a bedroom for a third child or a guest bedroom.  Nor does he agree that there is a need for a carers’ office or store room in the extension.  He said that the store room could be located within the existing bungalow.  Mr Wethers estimates that a property with an area of about 250 m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span> (inclusive of the extension ) is required, whilst Mr Cowan’s view is that a property with an area of 185-200 m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span> would suffice. </p>

It is necessary in the interests of the family as a whole that the claimant’s parents and brothers should have accommodation which is equivalent to that which they would have expected to occupy had it not been for the claimant’s disabilities.  This is particularly important since it is intended that the claimant should live with his family throughout his life.  I am satisfied that, had the claimant been uninjured, the family would have lived in a house with at least four, and probably five, bedrooms (one for the parents and one for each child, together with a guest room), a family bathroom and (very possibly) a separate lavatory.  The suggestion made by Mr Cowan that the family should have only two bedrooms is plainly untenable.  I am satisfied also that the claimant’s parents need a study.  Mr Whiten is currently running his business from home and Ms Nowell plans to work from home to some extent in the future as she has in the past.  They cannot carry out their work in rooms being used by other members of the family and/or in circumstances where they have to move their working equipment because the room is needed for other purposes.  Their circumstances are very different from when they lived at 99 Lucien Road and the fact that they did not have a study there is, I consider, irrelevant.  They have a study at 192 Crowborough Road and, having seen it, it is clear that it is well-used. </p>

The accommodation for the claimant and his carers will have to be sited in the proposed extension, as will the necessary storage space for the claimant’s equipment.  In any event, that arrangement is likely to be more satisfactory since it will enable the rest of the family to have some privacy and will not require the carers to go into the family accommodation every time they want to reach the carers’ accommodation or fetch a piece of equipment for the claimant. </p>

The carers will need a computer, some paper and a few files and a small desk or table on which to do their administration work.  I do not consider that an office is required to accommodate these items.  A desk or a table and a shelf or filing cabinet can be provided in the carers’ bedroom for this purpose.  I have therefore reduced the size of the extension by 7 m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span> (i.e. 6 m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span> plus circulation space).

I do not accept that an automatic garage door is a reasonable requirement.  The claimant will have carers to open and close the garage.  It seems to me unlikely that the garage will require widening, as Mr Wethers suggests.  I have removed the cost of wiring for an environmental control system since, as I have already indicated, I do not consider that this will be required.  I have already awarded the purchase price of the specialist bath: see Appendix I.  On the other hand, I consider it reasonable to increase the sum allowed for alterations to the kitchen to Mr Cowan’s figure of £10,000.  It seems likely that this will be necessary.   </p>

I accept Mr Cowan’s approach in principle since it properly reflects the expenses that will be incurred as a direct result of the claimant’s disabilities.  However, I have increased his figure to take account of the fact that area of the property will be larger than that on which his calculations were based.  I have therefore allowed additional furnishing costs of <span style="font-weight:bold">£6,500</span>.  That figure should be discounted for accelerated receipt. </p>

However, by the time of the trial, they were contending that it was wrong in principle for the value of the claimant’s parents’ home to be offset against the value of the property owned by the claimant.  On the particular facts of that case, the judge was able to avoid deciding that issue by finding that it was fair and just for the rental income to be brought into account by setting it against the damages awarded for gratuitous care given to the claimant by her parents.  He observed that it would be wrong for the defendant to have to pay both for the future care which the parents would give the claimant, and as for all the costs of accommodation, including adaptations to the property to make it suitable for the claimant’s parents.

In many cases, the parents would be able to afford to pay some rent, even if it fell short of the market rent for the property.  However, this would not be possible in all cases since some parents (like those in <span style="font-style:italic">Iqbal</span>) would lack the financial resources to pay rent.  There would moreover be a risk that the parents’ ability to pay rent might change over time.

Nevertheless, he will always function at the level of a young child and his parents will remain ultimately responsible for him.  His condition means that he will require a considerable amount of emotional and other support from them.  His disabilities will inevitably restrict the range of choices open to them in the future.  If they are to take holidays as a family, their destination and mode of travel will have to be suitable for him.  If they want to undertake leisure activities as a family, those activities will have to be tailored to meet his requirements.  Once they are in the new property, it will be difficult or impossible for them to move again, because of the substantial costs of adapting another property for the claimant.  In these and many other ways, their quality of life in the future will be adversely affected.

However, when the family move, the carers’ bedroom will have to be furnished and equipment for the kitchenette will have to be provided.  Various estimates for the cost of furnishing the carers’ accommodation have been provided.  Mr Wethers estimated the cost of furnishing the carers’ bedroom (excluding carpet and curtains) at £2,344.  Ms Jenkins allowed £1,220, inclusive of carpet, curtains and some kitchen equipment, plus £96 for a desk and chair.  Mr Cowan’s assessment (also inclusive of carpets and curtains) was £3,245.  Taking into account these various views, and bearing in mind that it should be possible to re-use some of the items from the current house, I consider that a reasonable sum for furnishing and equipping the carers’ accommodation at the new property would be <span style="font-weight:bold">£2,500</span>.  Ms Jenkins has provided replacement periods for every individual item of equipment.  I consider that I should take a broadbrush approach to this item.

This evidence contrasted with the information contained in the Schedule of Loss in which the claim is put on the basis of incidental expenses incurred as a result of the employment of carers.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is a very substantial claim (£541,845) for future additional holiday costs.  The claim comprises three distinct elements.  The first element relates to the additional costs associated with an annual visit to Barbados, comprising the cost of travelling there and back and the costs of carrying out adaptations to the claimant’s grandparents’ home to make it suitable for the claimant.  The second element concerns the costs of adapting, equipping and running a farmhouse in Northern France so as to be suitable to accommodate the claimant and his family.  The third element comprises carers’ subsistence costs during holidays.</p>

Her parents now live in the North East of England but retain a house and land in Barbados where they spend part of each year.  Before the claimant’s birth.  Ms Nowell regularly spent holidays in Barbados.  In 2007, she told Ms Jenkins that, had it not been for the claimant’s disabilities, she would have anticipated taking him to Barbados every few years.  In the intervening years, the family would have taken a holiday in Europe.  In 2009, Mr Whiten and Ms Nowell took the claimant and Dexter to Barbados for the first time.  They travelled by air.  Because of the claimant’s disabilities, it was necessary for him (and therefore his parents and Dexter also) to travel business, rather than economy, class.  This worked well and both the claimant and his equipment were accommodated satisfactorily on the aircraft.  The family did not visit Barbados in 2010.</p>

The defendant accepts that, in principle, the claimant is entitled to the increased cost of visits to Barbados up to the age of 11 years.  However, it is contended that there should be a deduction of £500 from the annual sum claimed to reflect the cost of the single fare which would have been incurred in any event.  In addition, the defendant suggests that, having regard in particular to Mr Whiten’s oral evidence that the claimant dislikes the heat and the evidence of both parents that he tends to be ill when on holiday, it is doubtful whether, even in the short term, a holiday in Barbados is really a sensible option for the claimant.  The defendant contends that I should discount this part of the claim by 50% to reflect the fact that the claimant is unlikely to make the journey to Barbados every year.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The defendant’s case, based on the evidence of its OT expert, Ms Page, and its care expert, Ms Douglas, is that the process of transferring the claimant into an aircraft seat, even in business class, is already hazardous and, by the time he reaches the age of 12, will give rise to an unacceptable risk of injury both to the claimant and his parents or carers.  Ms Page pointed out that the transfer has to be carried out in a confined space using a lifting sling to bear the claimant’s whole weight.  The manoeuvre carries a risk of injury to those lifting the claimant, as well as a risk that they might drop the claimant and cause him injury.  Ms Page pointed out that the claimant will have to be transferred into and out of his aircraft seat using a wheelchair provided by the airline, rather than his own wheelchair with its special seating system.  That would make him more difficult to manoeuvre, particularly if he were to go into spasm whilst being transferred.  A further difficulty is that the claimant’s incontinence pads will have to be changed during the flight.  This has to be done in the aircraft cabin and, when the claimant is older, will, Ms Page suggested, involve an unacceptable loss of the claimant’s personal dignity.  Her view was that these difficulties will make it impracticable and undesirable for the claimant to fly once he attains the age of 12 years.  </p>

The annual cost of the journey, which would take between 10 and 14 days each way, is claimed in the sum of £18,700.  Mrs Sargent said that she has clients who go on cruises and it works well.

I am sure that is correct.  As the claimant gets bigger and heavier, the risk must inevitably increase.  His uncontrolled movements will make the task of transferring him in an enclosed space even more hazardous, both for him and for his parents who will have to lift him.  Even if they were prepared to take the risk of injuring themselves, there is still the risk to the claimant himself to be considered.  There is also the effect on him and other passengers of changing his incontinence pads in the cabin during the flight and the fact that, as Ms Nowell pointed out, air travel places severe restrictions on the amount of equipment that can accompany the claimant.  I find that it is probable that, in about five years’ time (i.e. when he attains the age of 12), the problems associated with air travel will be such that an alternative means of transport will have to be found.  It is not a question, as his parents suggest, of the claimant not being “entitled” to travel by air from that time.  The fact is that it will probably not be safe or practicable for him to do so in the long term. Fortunately, that will not prevent him from seeing his grandparents on a regular basis since they spend much of the year in the UK.   </p>

It would be extremely expensive, both in terms of time and money.  It would involve the claimant missing school and his various therapies and being parted from much of his specialised equipment for protracted periods.  The difficulties of managing the claimant for 3-4 weeks in a confined space without much of the specialised equipment necessary for his care would be considerable.  He would have no access to suitable medical care if needed.  Moreover, the evidence of Ms Nowell in her witness statement of 19 April 2010 that the claimant “doesn’t tolerate” ferry travel even to France does not suggest that he would react well to a sea voyage lasting 10-14 days.  I am satisfied that, once travel to Barbados becomes impossible, the claimant’s parents or carers will select some other holiday destination for him which is accessible by car and/or train. </p>

The evidence of the claimant’s parents to the effect that the family would be able to spend weeks of the year in France is, the defendant says, wholly unrealistic, having regard to the parents’ need to maintain their earnings and the claimant’s requirement for therapy and access to his specialised physiotherapy and other equipment.  It is argued that there is real doubt as to whether the claimant’s parents would be able to afford to buy and run an additional property, in view of their other financial commitments and their limited earnings at present.  The suggestion (made in oral evidence by Ms Nowell)  that the claimant might lend his parents the funds to purchase the French house is, the defendant submits, entirely inappropriate.  The defendant contends that it is doubtful whether the property would be purchased at all and, if it were, whether it would benefit the claimant to any great extent. </p>

The costs of adaptation are likely to be significantly higher than that suggested in the estimates of the accommodation experts.  For example, if the claimant’s parents buy a property which requires the installation of a lift (and that seems to be their intention), that will be a significant item of additional expenditure.  If a property were to be purchased and the adaptations were to prove significantly more expensive than the damages the claimant had received for that purpose, either his parents would have to meet the difference or (more likely) the excess would be paid from the claimant’s capital fund, thus reducing the amount available to him for his other needs.  That would not be in his best interests. </p>

His needs would be met satisfactorily if his parents, with the assistance of his case manager, were to identify, in France or elsewhere, a property or properties with appropriate accommodation for a person with his disabilities.  I am satisfied that it should be possible to find a suitable property which has all or most of the specialist fittings he requires.  Many of the benefits of local knowledge could be achieved by holidaying in the same property or area on a regular basis. </p>

The claim is for 50% of that sum on the basis that, because of the claimant’s disabilities, it will be necessary to take a second vehicle to France.  Ms Page puts the additional cost at £158 per annum.  I regard it as reasonable to allow the additional cost of one vehicle and two persons (the claimant’s carers) on Eurostar, together with associated travelling expenses. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is a claim for subsistence allowances for carers when they accompany the claimant on holiday.  Ms Jenkins has suggested an allowance of £20 per day per carer.  This is in addition to the carers’ expenses which form part of the care claim and which I have awarded in the sums of £170 per month from now to the age of 11 years, £270 from 11 years to 19 years and £390 from 19 years for life.  The defendant’s case is that those awards include carers’ subsistence when on holiday.  Ms Jenkins said that it was generally expected that the expenses on holiday would be greater than at home since the carers would accompany the claimant for more meals and expeditions. </p>
