The claim relates to the use of force, and the threatened use of force, against the claimant, Mr Felix Wamala, by employees of the defendant, a company which has changed its name and is now known as Tascor Services Ltd. At the time of relevant events its name was Reliance Secure Task Management Limited.</p>

It did not dispute that, in the circumstances of the present case, it would be liable for legal wrongs committed by its employees. Accordingly, where it is convenient to do so and clear from the context that this is what I have done, I have from time to time used the abbreviation “Reliance” to include its employees. This and other abbreviations and short forms used in this judgment are set out in <span style="text-decoration:underline;color:#0000FF">Annex 1</span>.</p>

The fax also included a covering letter referring to policy under which UKBA would “normally defer removal where a JR application has been properly lodged…”.

Flight MS778 was scheduled to depart from Terminal 3 at Heathrow airport. If Mr Wamala were to be removed on flight MS778 at its scheduled time of departure, then in the ordinary course he would have been collected from Brook House IRC mid-morning. It is difficult to see how he could be put on the flight at its scheduled departure time if he were collected from Brook House much later than noon.

From May 2011 onwards it provided immigration escort services under contractual arrangements with the Home Office. At around 3pm on Christmas eve, after flight MS778 had departed, Reliance employees asked for and took custody of Mr Wamala at Brook House. They transported him in their van to Heathrow. Their intention was that at Heathrow he, accompanied by 4 of the Reliance employees, would be put on Qatar Airways flight QR2 to Doha in order to connect with an onward flight to Uganda. Flight QR2 was scheduled to depart from Heathrow Terminal 4 at 8.30pm on Christmas eve. At Heathrow Terminal 4 they put Mr Wamala on an Airbus A340-600 aircraft (“the aircraft”) used by Qatar Airways for flight QR2. A struggle occurred on board. Force was used by Reliance employees on Mr Wamala. The captain then refused to carry Mr Wamala. Reliance employees took Mr Wamala off the aircraft, put him in their van, and took him to Colnbrook Immigration Removal Centre.</p>

It would not have taken long – perhaps a minute. My rough timing for Mr Wamala’s arrival on board the aircraft is thus 19:54. Getting Mr Wamala down the staircase took much longer. It was probably 3 minutes or so before the process of transferring him to the van began. My rough timing for Mr Wamala’s exit from the aircraft is thus 19:59.</p>

Mr Wamala’s claim form and amended particulars of claim had sought such damages by alleging that a number of legal wrongs had been committed. At the trial, however, the legal wrongs asserted by Mr Wamala were limited. First, it was said that Reliance was responsible for two types of trespass to the person. These were battery, constituted by force that was used upon Mr Wamala, and assault, constituted by the threat of battery. Second, it was said that the overall damages could equally be awarded for breach of article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (“ECHR”).</p>

Reliance adds that Mr Wamala has exaggerated his physical injuries. As to mental injuries, it is common ground that Mr Wamala suffers from MDD and PTSD. However Reliance rejects the contention that these disorders arose from the events on Christmas eve. Relevant mental injuries, says Reliance, have arisen from other causes.</p>

Concern remained that, despite what had been accepted by the Home Office, Mr Wamala was treated as if he had been wanted by the police for such an offence. This led to a telephone conversation between DPG and UKBA on the morning of 22 December 2011. At DPG’s request, UKBA wrote that day confirming that Mr Wamala’s records on Home Office files, including computer records, had been amended to reflect that he was never charged, convicted nor given conditional discharge for the alleged offence of assault on a police officer.</p>

He was due to be removed to Angola on the afternoon of 12 October 2010, using a scheduled British Airways flight. Mr Mubenga boarded the flight accompanied by immigration escorts. About twenty minutes after boarding, and before the plane began to taxi towards the runway, the escorts used force to restrain Mr Mubenga. His hands were cuffed behind his back and he was manoeuvred into a seat in the back row of the plane. When the plane began to taxi towards the runway the escorts realised that Mr Mubenga was unconscious and not responding. The plane returned to the stand, where paramedics attended and made attempts to resuscitate Mr Mubenga. Those attempts were unsuccessful: Mr Mubenga was transferred to hospital where his death was later confirmed. A post-mortem report concluded that he died from cardiorespiratory collapse, caused by restraint.</p>

An inquest into his death was held after the eventswith which the present case was concerned. The jury at the inquest concluded that Mr Mubenga’s death had been caused by the restraint to which he had been subject, and that his death was unlawful. Following the inquest, Assistant Deputy Coroner for Hammersmith and Fulham issued a report under rule 43 of the Coroner’s Rules 1984. The report concluded, among other things, that:</p>

The first was that the previous directions for Mr Wamala’s removal had been cancelled, and the claim was therefore academic. The second was that Mr Wamala’s outstanding representations had been considered in a letter from UKBA dated 8 February 2012. That letter had concluded that none of the matters raised by Mr Wamala amounted to a fresh claim for asylum or human rights purposes. Ms Laing QC commented that there was no arguable error in that conclusion and that there was now no legal obstacle to Mr Wamala’s removal.</p>

The further information added that Reliance cannot be sure who made those amendments, but was making further enquiries to ascertain whether the person who made the amendments could be identified. The stance taken by Reliance since then has been that it does not know who made those amendments.</p>

The fax noted that Mr Wamala had removal directions set for the next day, and asked whether they could be put on hold until two applications by Mr Wamala were considered. The first application comprised further submissions dated 15 December 2011 for discretionary leave to remain, posted to the Home Office’s Further Submissions Unit in Liverpool. The second was a request made on form FLR(O) for leave to remain on the basis of long residence, submitted to UKBA’s Durham Office.</p>

As to the applications referred to in Mr Timm’s fax, the reply noted that an application for discretionary leave had been received on 16 December 2011 and an application for long residence had been received on 23 December 2011. It commented that these applications were submitted only after the removal directions were issued, and added that Mr Wamala’s unsuccessful tribunal challenges had taken place after an earlier application on the basis of long residency had been rejected. Moreover, the letter relied on, and attached a copy of, the Rix refusal. The letter concluded that UKBA remained satisfied that Mr Wamala had submitted no new information sufficient to justify reversing the original decision, and that upon this basis his removal would proceed as arranged.</p>

Mr Wamala gets onto the van at 15:42:23hrs and has indicated that he does not want to engage in conversation or to be engaged. Less than two minutes after he [enters] the van, DCO Govey says to him “Only trying to be polite… just trying to be nice and polite and professional”. This is the first in a number of statements which can only have served to antagonise Mr Wamala, who could not have made any clearer that he did not wish to engage with the escorts.</p>

She looks at Mr Wamala and says “You have got some serious paperwork” before laughing. Her tone is jocular. She asks whether he had kept it all, and DCO Duke asks “Did they let you have it all, your paperwork?” When Mr Wamala does not respond DCO Govey sits down and takes her gloves off, saying “Only trying to be polite, Bruno, just trying to be nice and polite and professional”</p>

The notion that UKBA, or any other part of government, can “overturn” a judicial review is fundamentally wrong. This case will, I hope, emphasise how important it is that escorts, and those who give information to them, have a basic understanding of elementary principles as to what UKBA can and cannot do. In order to avoid confusion, it is also important that those communicating information to escorts, and escorts when communicating information to those who are to be removed, use correct terminology. Adherence to professional standards requires nothing less.</p>

The escorts’ assertion that the immigration authorities can “overturn” a judge’s decision was absolutely wrong. It suggested that the escorts had no understanding of the rule of law. The only way in which an Administrative Court judge’s decision can be altered is by a further order of the Administrative Court or a higher court. The immigration authorities may seek a further court order of that kind.

At Mr Adelabuo’s request Mr Wamala had asked the escorts for information about the flight that they intended to put him on, and had learned that it was to depart at 8.30pm. Mr Adelabuo then made the point that Mr Wamala’s MS778 notice specified the MS778 flight, and he could not be removed on any other flight. Mr Wamala passed his mobile phone to Mr Charles, and Mr Adelabuo made the same point to Mr Charles. The response of Mr Charles was that he was “not too bothered”. Mr Charles commented that he had received no phone call stopping the removal. One of the escorts asked where Mr Wamala’s paperwork was. When Mr Wamala said it was in his luggage, the reaction of the escorts was laughter, along with a joke that if the flight had been at 2 o’clock Mr Wamala would already have been on it. But this was a serious matter. If there had been no removal direction for flight QR2 then Mr Wamala could not be put on the aircraft that Reliance put him on. In oral evidence Mr Charles said that he was not concerned about this, as he had spoken with Ms Payne when he arrived at Brook House and reviewed the paperwork there, and she had told him he was going on the right flight.  </p>

In that regard she allowed Reliance time to formulate an application to re-amend its defence. In the event Reliance’s re-amended defence was not served until February 2015, and the issues that it raised were extensive. In March 2015 it became clear that the amendments introduced in the purported QR2 movement notice had been made by someone in Reliance’s office.

The result, as will be seen in sections F9 and F10 below, was that there were continued developments in the way that Reliance’s case was put. I do not underestimate the difficulties that arose for Reliance once it acknowledged that the amendments introduced in the purported QR2 movement notice had been made by someone in Reliance’s office. Nevertheless it seems to me that the difficulties in formulating the further amendments would have been reduced, if not avoided, if a detailed list of issues had been formulated, and subjected to critical analysis, prior to the trial.</p>

I invited counsel to give consideration to this. On day 1 of the trial neither side objected to my proposal, provided that it was confined to the course of events from the process of Mr Wamala’s boarding the aircraft through to the process of his departure from the aircraft.</p>

Reliance had no objection to this course in relation to the five escorts who had taken Mr Wamala from Brook House to Heathrow, put him on the aircraft, and taken him off again. It submitted that there was no warrant, however, for taking such a course in relation to a Qatar Airways employee, Mr Jayatilaka, and in relation to a Reliance employee, Ms Payne, who had not formed part of the escort team. In a civil case witnesses are normally present when the evidence of other witnesses is given. For this reason, it seemed to me that I should not require Reliance to go beyond what had been conceded. Arrangements were accordingly made under which each of the five escorts</p>

It contained new amendments which were proposed to deal with, among other things, the alterations to the MS778 movement notification. I expressed concern at what appeared to me to be deficiencies in the proposed new amendments. It was agreed that a revised version would be prepared for consideration that afternoon. Much of the remainder of the morning was taken up with Reliance’s oral closing submissions on the law. It seemed to me that there was no prospect of completing both sides’ closing submissions on the facts as well as on the law in the time available on 29 July 2015. This was the last day of the hearing. I asked the parties to consider over the short adjournment what directions might be made for submissions to be dealt with in writing.

Turning to the proposed new amendments, it was apparent that there was insufficient time for them to be considered by Mr Wamala’s legal team that afternoon. The stance taken for Mr Wamala was that I should, without considering the content of the latest version, make a ruling barring any further amendments to the defence. I declined to make such a ruling. Instead I allowed Reliance, when filing its written submissions on facts and aggravated damages, in addition to apply in writing for a revised version of the proposed amendments to be permitted. This was on the footing that in due course Mr Wamala’s answer to the final version of the proposed revisions would be filed. This was to be done when filing his written submissions dealing with aggravated damages and facts.</p>

My conclusion was that this dispute could not sensibly be resolved in yet further oral argument at the end of what had already been a long day. I had earlier suggested that if there were any dispute between the parties as to the extent of entitlement to reply this should be dealt with in a joint note from counsel.

They concern the circumstances which led to Mr Wamala’s conviction for smuggling Class A drugs. In cross-examination Mr Wamala accepted that he travelled on a forged passport to the United States and back, that for this purpose he supplied a photo of himself, and that he knew he was bringing back something for the man who had arranged the forged passport and had financed his airline tickets. Mr Wamala nevertheless claimed in cross-examination that he had not appreciated that he was bringing back illegal drugs. It was rightly pointed out to him that if this were the case then he would have been advised to plead not guilty. Mr Wamala sought to justify his account by saying that he was a young man at the time, that he had not even known the name cocaine, and that when he was told that this substance was illegal he thought the honourable thing to do was to plead guilty.</p>

As to that, it is right that Mr Wamala has expressed remorse and that he accepted his punishment. However, I do not regard Mr Wamala’s evidence in relation to his conviction as either accurate or frank. It was unreal for Mr Wamala to suggest that he had not heard of cocaine. The offence that he had committed was a serious offence. It involved dishonesty, in that Mr Wamala falsely represented to customs officers that he had nothing to declare. His evidence did not recognize the true extent of his culpability. His attempts to blame the offending on his youth, and later on immaturity, were grasping at straws. In the circumstances I am sure that Mr Wamala must have appreciated that what he was being asked to bring back was illegal, and also appreciated that in all probability it comprised illicit drugs.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.07in">As to the remaining matters identified by Reliance, the fifth concerned the use of aliases. Mr Wamala’s drug smuggling attempt had involved the use of a false Kenyan passport, a false name and a false date of birth. The deployment of these falsehoods by Mr Wamala was what led to the inaccurate nationality, name and date of birth in the detention authority: see section A2.2 above.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.07in">The ninth matter involved Mr Wamala working here while not permitted to do so. He frankly accepted that he had done this. In his words, it was necessary “to put food on the table”. Under cross-examination Mr Wamala had been asked whether he drove a taxi without a licence. In that regard I reminded Mr Wamala of the privilege against self-incrimination. Mr Wamala did not answer the question. As Reliance points out, however, Mr Wamala’s account to Professor Katona gives ground to conclude that Mr Wamala was driving a taxi without a licence during the period 2000 to 2010. The likely consequence is that he was driving without insurance and exposing his passengers to the risk of being carried by an uninsured minicab driver.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.07in">As regards these remaining matters the closing submissions for Mr Wamala said that he was open with the court about working without permission in the UK and using false names and papers to do so. It was submitted that the position he had found himself in, needing to work in order to provide food, was not uncommon. It was added that Mr Wamala paid his taxes and did not claim benefits. It was also submitted that these matters had no bearing on the truthfulness of his account of events relevant in the present case. My assessment is that Mr Wamala has shown a willingness to lie on occasions when it was not necessary to do so in order to ensure his own safety. This, and his attempt to minimise the seriousness of his conduct leading to the drug smuggling conviction, mean that I must approach his evidence with caution. That said, however, what happened on the occasions identified by Reliance does not of itself warrant a conclusion that the present proceedings are being brought dishonestly for gain.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.07in">The second feature identified by Reliance asserted that Mr Wamala had attempted to present a false picture of his medical condition to the doctors instructed by Reliance. In sections D and E below I examine Reliance’s contention that Mr Wamala did this. As regards Mr Wamala’s mental condition, for the reasons given in section D, I do not accept that Mr Wamala tried to present a false picture. In relation to Mr Wamala’s physical condition, what happened when he was seen by Mr Matthews is more complex. Mr Wamala’s account of his injuries was not consistent with what was seen by Mr Matthews. For reasons given in section E below I conclude that in significant respects Mr Wamala attempted to present a false picture to Mr Matthews. In these circumstances, the second feature identified by Reliance causes concern, but it does not warrant a conclusion that I should reject Mr Wamala’s evidence altogether unless it is corroborated by other evidence.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.07in">Overall, in relation to disputed matters I must consider whether assertions by Mr Wamala may be unreliable because of his misleading evidence about his drug-smuggling conviction, because of his willingness to lie in inexcusable circumstances, because of his willingness to make wild accusations, because of his willingness to lie to the court about what happened when he was seen by Mr Matthews, or because of the effect of Mr Wamala’s PTSD. For these reasons, and because of the numerous and serious nature of the inconsistencies, I must approach Mr Wamala’s evidence with particular care. These features, however, are not in my view sufficient to justify an approach under which Mr Wamala’s evidence must inevitably be rejected altogether unless corroborated by other evidence. In particular, as to the period prior to boarding the aircraft, I have identified in section A4 above important uncorroborated evidence concerning Mr Wamala’s beliefs and concerns which I accept.</p>

As to how she has come to convince herself of this, the likely explanation is that it has come about through learning what others say or have said on the matter. For these reasons I cannot assume that Ms Lee is a reliable witness.</p>

The question she was being asked concerned whether it was possible to keep the head still. Ms Lee did not directly answer that question, but instead said that Mr Wamala was trying to bite the officers. She re-affirmed that she saw Mr Wamala trying to bite. Mr Hickman pointed out that Mr Wamala was lying on the floor with his head a few inches in front of Mr Duke’s knee, with Mr Duke holding him down. Ms Lee replied that Mr Wamala was a very strong man and could lift his head slightly. Ms Hickman asked who it was that Mr Wamala got his mouth near, to which Ms Lee replied, “whoever was closest to him at the time”. She was then asked whether someone’s body was very close to Mr Wamala’s mouth, to which she replied, “No”. At this point Ms Lee retreated and said simply that Mr Wamala had “made the motion”, lifting his head up with his mouth open. The closing submissions for Mr Wamala said that Ms Lee had constructed an account thought to be helpful to Reliance’s case. I agree: in this respect Ms Lee’s evidence had plainly been concocted.</p>

Curiously, Jayatilaka 1 omitted several prominent features that had been present in the Jayatilaka email. An example is that the Jayatilaka email had said that on boarding the aircraft Mr Wamala was shown to his seat by cabin staff. Jayatilaka 1 made no mention of this. Another example is that the Jayatilaka email said that before taking Mr Wamala down the stairs the escorts were able to stop him struggling by placing a strap around his upper body. Jayatilaka 1 made no mention of this either. In relation to both these examples, what had been said in the Jayatilaka email was completely different from what was said by other witnesses.</p>

As noted earlier, by this stage Mr Jayatilaka was no longer advancing the assertion in the Jayatilaka email that Mr Wamala had been shown to his seat by cabin staff. Indeed in this part of Jayatilaka 1 there was no mention of cabin staff at all. Paragraph 15 asserted that as “the forward escort, Mr Wamala, and the other escorts moved into the galley” Mr Jayatilaka had moved backwards into the left hand aisle towards the front of the aircraft, and that there was a security escort between him and Mr Wamala. Paragraph 16 said that in the galley Mr Wamala turned towards the left hand aisle, and that at that point refused to move to his seat until he had spoken to the captain; that one of the escorts said they would ask the captain to come and speak to him, and that he replied that he wanted to go and speak with the captain and would not wait. Paragraph 17 said that Mr Wamala then moved towards the left hand aisle, looked around, “and he then elbowed the security escort behind him who fell to the floor in the galley. Then he went for the security escort between us and that security escort also fell to the floor.” As to that, Mr Jayatilaka said in evidence in chief:</p>

Similarly in relation to the second “clarification” he had given an account of unprovoked violence on the part of Mr Wamala before any struggle took place, whereas the violence that Jayatilaka 1 identified as having happened prior to the struggle had, according to Mr Jayatilaka’s “clarified” version, in fact happened during that struggle.</p>

In relation to the two “clarifications”, what had been said in Jayatilaka 1 was also completely different from what was said by other witnesses. This pattern continued in Mr Jayatilaka’s oral evidence. He said that he was in the galley area when Mr Wamala came up the staircase. Nobody else described him as being there. In paragraph 19 of Jayatilaka 1 he described Mr Wamala as having started to make a move towards him, and as becoming more aggressive still when the remaining two security escorts (those who had not been elbowed to the floor) stopped Mr Wamala. All of this was said to have happened at a time at which no handcuff had been applied to Mr Wamala. Nobody else gave an account remotely similar to this.</p>

The suggestion advanced in the submissions, as I understood it, was that this supported Mr Wamala’s account of being carried down the whole of the staircase. However, Mr Jayatilaka is so plainly wrong on other aspects of events that I cannot rely on anything which he says about the interaction between Mr Wamala and the escorts.</p>

As Lord Bridge said in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Deputy Governor of Parkhurst Prison, Ex p Hague</span> [1992] 1 AC 58 , 162C-D: “The tort of false imprisonment has two ingredients: the fact of imprisonment and the absence of lawful authority to justify it.”</p>

Mr Wamala entered the UK unlawfully in 1999 when he returned clandestinely, and in breach of the 1997 deportation order, a few weeks after he had been deported. From that time he remained in the UK unlawfully, subject only to a grant of temporary admission which is immaterial for present purposes. In these circumstances s 4(2) of the 1971 Act and paragraph 10(2) of schedule 2 to that Act gave power to the Secretary of State to give directions to, among others, the owners or agents of an aircraft for Mr Wamala’s removal in accordance with arrangements made by the Secretary of State. The giving of such directions would then enable Mr Wamala to be placed on board an aircraft for removal, but only in accordance with the directions. This is clear from paragraph 11 of schedule 2, which states:</p>

There was then a question asking how the incident had affected Mr Wamala’s mind. It seems to me that the answer to this question was misinterpreted: Mr Wamala said he did not want to talk about it because he had to fight with it everyday. Reliance said that this was a refusal to answer the question. In my view it was directly answering the question. The question concerned the effect of the incident on Mr Wamala’s mind. The answer was that the effect on his mind was that he did not want to talk about the incident, the reason being that he had to fight with it everyday. Mr Wamala was then specifically asked about mental health problems and gave a description of them. In response to an additional question as to whether Mr Wamala wanted to say anything more about his mental health, Mr Wamala described speaking to his dead grandfather, being told by his dead grandfather to hide in the cemetery, and doing exactly that.</p>

Dr Britto’s reluctance to accept that there was psychosis is largely founded on the assertion that Mr Wamala did not give Dr Britto an opportunity to explore any symptoms related to psychotic phenomena other than persecutory ideation. For the reasons given in section D1.3 above, I do not accept that this was the case. Dr Britto made an additional point that prescriptions for antipsychotic medication were prescriptions for drugs that are also used to treat other conditions. This is a valid point so far as it goes. More difficult, however, for Dr Britto is that Mr Wamala’s medical reports include conclusions that Mr Wamala was suffering from psychosis. Dr Britto suggested that these were inconsistent with records from around the same period which showed no evidence of psychosis.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">Reliance’s written closing submissions relied on an additional reason for concluding that re-traumatisation had occurred because of the stressor of deportation rather than because of what happened on the aircraft. This was that Professor Katona had regarded the twisting of Mr Wamala’s neck as the main element in the incident that contributed to its traumatic nature. If, as Reliance submitted, there had been no twisting of the neck then this main element would fall away.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">To my mind Professor Katona has given a full and convincing answer to the points made by Dr Britto. First,PTSD symptoms are often delayed in onset. Accordingly, if it were right to say that Mr Wamala was not suffering from symptoms of PTSD until 2013, that is not inconsistent with the re-traumatisation leading to those symptoms having come about by reason of what occurred on the aircraft. Second, however, Professor Katona gave compelling evidence that in his professional experience a detailed assessment by an experienced practitioner such as himself can often illicit mental symptoms that immigration detainees have felt unable or reluctant to disclose to detention healthcare staff. In that regard Professor Katona takes account of a report by Dr Goldwin in January 2012, where the focus was on documenting the acute physical injuries resulting from Mr Wamala’s attempted removal. This would explain the suggested “thematic coherence” identified in her report between Uganda and the PTSD. Professor Katona was taken to a note made by Dr Pang on 10 Ma y2013, “assaulted in Uganda, hence has PTSD”. Professor Katona acknowledged that this gave him pause for thought. He acknowledged that the fact of deportation, the fact of removal, the fear of removal to Uganda, quite irrespective of what happened on the aircraft, would have some worsening effect. It would undoubtedly have increased Mr Wamala’s stress level, as indeed the mere fact of being detained would have done. On the other hand, the physically violent acute events around the attempted removal seemed to Professor Katona to be a more effective acute trigger. The re-experiencing that Mr Wamala described was more around those events than anything else.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">This evidence by Professor Katona was in my view compelling. I have already made findings as to Mr Wamala’s fear that his removal would be accompanied by violence: see section A4 above. My findings as to what in fact occurred on Christmas eve are set out in section F below. It would be astonishing if, in the light of Mr Wamala’s beliefs and concerns prior to the incident, what took place on the aircraft could be treated as playing no causative part in the re-traumatisation experienced by Mr Wamala.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">To my mind the first point to be made about the degree of flexion and rotation of the neck demonstrated by Mr Wamala to Mr Matthews is that if Mr Wamala were indeed only able to achieve the degree of flexion and rotation which he demonstrated to Mr Matthews, then between 5 April 2013 and 10 January 2014 there had been a dramatic deterioration. On 5 April 2013 Mr Wamala had been able to achieve at least 80% of normal flexion and 80% of normal rotation. By contrast, the points at which he told Mr Matthews that he could go no further were 50% of the normal range of flexion and 30% of the normal range of rotation. Mr Mohammad accepted in cross-examination that such a deterioration was inconsistent with the result of a soft tissue injury, that it was inconsistent with simple disc degeneration, and that there was no evidence of any severe neck disease which would otherwise explain such a marked deterioration.</p>

It is not suggested, however, by Reliance that in this respect Mr Wamala was faking when he saw Mr Mohammad. On the contrary, the strength of the evidence of faking in relation to what Mr Wamala told Mr Matthews arises out of the stark contrast between the account given to Mr Matthews and the findings of Mr Mohammad.</p>

As a layman, I was a little surprised when Mr Matthews said that he was able to witness a full range of movement. It was suggested to Mr Matthews in cross-examination that when getting dressed Mr Wamala was simply putting on a jacket and perhaps a pullover. There was no evidence that, as a matter of orthopaedics, a person putting on a jacket or a pullover would not be able, or would not be likely, to demonstrate a full range of movement. It is suggested on behalf of Mr Wamala that it was absurd to suggest that Mr Matthews could have seen a full range of movement, but in the absence of any expert evidence to support such a contention I am in no position to find that Mr Matthews’s evidence is absurd. I add that if it were, indeed, suggested that a full range of movement could not be seen when a person was putting on the suggested items of clothing then, if so minded, Mr Wamala could have applied for permission for Mr Mohammad to deal with this in a supplementary report. No such course was taken. On this aspect of feature (3), what Mr Matthews saw is again strong evidence of faking.</p>

What is described in paragraph 14 of Matthews 1 is what was demonstrated by Mr Wamala in relation to the myotomes either side of the spinal column at the fifth, sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae and the first thoracic vertebra. Feature (4) concerns the finding of global weakness in this regard. Mr Mohammad accepted in crossexamination that the whole point of the tests conducted by Mr Matthews in relation to these myotomes is to find out which nerve is affected, there being specific tests associated with each one, and that a global weakness would not be expected to be exhibited throughout the different discs. Mr Mohammad said he had no reason to disagree that, if Mr Matthews had accurately carried out the tests, the response from Mr Wamala was a very strong indication that he was either refusing to co-operate or exhibiting abnormal illness behaviour. It seems to me that this is indeed a very strong indication of faking when Mr Wamala was seen by Mr Matthews. By contrast, however, Reliance accepts that there had been no complaint of such weakness when Mr Wamala was seen by Mr Mohammad. Accordingly this feature does not demonstrate that Mr Wamala was faking when describing his symptoms to Mr Mohammad.</p>

Mr Matthews’s reply was that if something was painful, the patient might only be able to achieve grade 3 out of 5 due to pain inhibition. However, the patient would not in the next moment be able to achieve 5 out of 5, because the same pain would still be there and would prevent the patient reaching 5 out of 5. It was then suggested that these findings could have been caused by mental health difficulties experienced by a patient. Mr Matthews rejected this too. He said that if 5 out of 5 could be achieved in one moment, no matter what the patient’s mental state was, there would be no reason why the next moment it should be 3 out of 5.</p>

A genuine shoulder injury in the present case, said Mr Matthews, was not compatible with the remainder of the findings of the other myotomes also being weak.

The joint orthopaedic report in this regard added that where relaxation was “not achievable” both Mr Mohammad and Mr Matthews would “comment or use diversional techniques”. There is no evidence, however, on the extent to which comments or the use of diversional techniques can be expected to succeed where a patient who is seeking to be co-operative nevertheless tenses up prior to a reflex test. In these circumstances it does not seem to me that this feature adds significantly to feature (6).</p>

It is not the role of the Case Examiners to resolve conflicts of evidence, such as whether verbal consent was or was not obtained before the recording device was switched on. However, it is clear that <span style="font-style:italic">robust</span> consent was not obtained or recorded. If this had occurred, it would have been clear to Mr Wamala that the recording was being made, and may have been forwarded to a third party (i.e. the instructing solicitor). However, the Case Examiners note that the recording was made to assist the legal process, and has not been used for any other reason. We also note that Mr Matthews has determined to change his practice in this regard. We therefore believe that there is insufficient evidence to show that Mr Matthews’ fitness to practice is <span style="font-style:italic">currently</span> impaired, and believe that the realistic prospect test is not satisfied.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">The case examiners stressed that confidentiality between patient and doctor is the basis of the trust that exists between the public and the medical profession, and that anything which might call that trust into question is a very serious matter. Nothing in the present judgment should be regarded as detracting from the vital importance of confidentiality as between doctor and patient. Nor should anything in the present judgment be regarded as detracting from the importance of the duty of all those affected by relevant data protection legislation to comply with the requirements of that legislation. In relation to Mr Matthews, however, the lapse identified by the case examiners was a failure to have in place procedures to ensure that robust consent was both obtained and recorded. There is no finding by the case examiners that Mr Matthews in fact failed to obtain consent from Mr Wamala. Still less is there any finding by the case examiners that Mr Matthews deliberately made a covert recording. In these circumstances, the sentence relied upon by Mr Wamala gives no assistance to a contention that Mr Matthews was biased.</p>

In fact, however, the transcript shows that Mr Wamala’s immediate response was, “Yeah, you’ve got my medical reports”. That immediate response of itself justified what was said in the last sentence of paragraph 7 of Matthews 1. He had earlier referred Mr Matthews to “my medical reports”, and in his immediate response to Mr Matthews’s explanation of why Mr Wamala should answer Mr Matthews’s questions, Mr Wamala continued to refer Mr Matthews to Mr Wamala’s medical reports. Moreover, after an exchange which I deal with in section E3.7 below, Mr Wamala again said that he would refer Mr Matthews “to the medical reports because I can’t answer it”. There is no merit in this first aspect of criticism (5).</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">I add that in cross-examination there was a complaint that the second sentence of paragraph 7 of Matthews 1 was inaccurate. This second sentence asserted that Mr Wamala had repeatedly referred Mr Matthews to the documentation supplied, and had said “it’s all in the medical records” or “it’s all in the records”. The sentence had been said to be inaccurate because it was a claim that those repeated remarks had been made before Mr Matthews’s explanation of why it was in Mr Wamala’s interest to co-operate. Mr Matthews rebutted that allegation of inaccuracy by observing that the second sentence of paragraph 7 was not limited to what was said before that explanation. The closing submissions for Mr Wamala rightly did not persist in this complaint.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">The second alleged inaccuracy concerned a statement at paragraph 46 of Wamala 1 that during the physical examination Mr Wamala had “simply refused to co-operate”. It is said in Mr Wamala’s closing written submissions that no such refusal is apparent from the transcript. However this contention was not put to Mr Matthews in cross-examination, and accordingly I refuse to allow it. I add that it takes a small part of paragraph 46 out of context: the full assertion in paragraph 46 is that during the physical examination Mr Wamala “either simply refused to co-operate or alternatively has exhibited substantial abnormal illness behaviour”. It seems to me that this general comment could well have been made in relation to the instances where I have identified “faking” on the part of Mr Wamala in section E2 above, and might also have reflected Mr Matthews’s assessment of Mr Wamala’s conduct in failing to relax muscles on his right side for the purposes of reflex tests.</p>

The hostility demonstrated to Mr Matthews, however, went far beyond such hostility as was demonstrated to Dr Britto. I think it likely that the reason for this was because Mr Wamala had decided that he would fake some, at least, of his symptoms when examined by Mr Matthews, and was for that reason on edge and surly in his dealings with Mr Matthews.</p>

In particular, if Mr Matthews had read Professor Katona’s report before the meeting, he would have been alerted to Mr Wamala’s PTSD and MDD, and could have given thought to ways in which the particular problems associated with those conditions could be anticipated.  Mr Matthews appeared to suggest in evidence that knowledge of Mr Wamala’s PTSD would have made no difference to his approach. That runs counter to the experience of the judiciary, who have gained assistance from the Equal Treatment Bench Book</p>

Mr Matthews sought to explain his approach by saying that he wished to form his own view without the danger of it being influenced by the views of others. It seems to me, however, that the court is likely to be better assisted by Mr Matthews if, prior to examining those whom he is asked to report on, he has read available reports. This will enable him to give thought, prior to meeting the individual in question to the particular matters that the court will be likely to want to know about, and to any potential difficulties of communication that may be capable of being catered for.</p>

This was that a radicular symptom was caused by compression of the nerve root at the cervical spine causing pain which often radiated and caused paresthesia (heightened sensitivity, numbness, prickling or tingling) and the like. Mr Mohammad also agreed that pain radiating into the hand and wrist with pins and needles and aching could constitute radicular symptoms. However, Mr Mohammad went on to explain that those symptoms could equally have a peripheral cause originating in the wrist or forearm. As to how radicular symptoms were to be distinguished from those not caused by compression of the nerve root at the cervical spine, Mr Mohammad explained that a symptom coming specifically from the neck gave rise to a dermatomal pattern – a circumscribed thickening of the skin. This pattern is not found where the symptom has a cause which is non-spinal. It was not found in relation to the right wrist pain in the present case. He accepted</p>

He agreed that soft tissue injuries generally had an acute phase, followed by a lengthy stage where the injury gradually subsides to nothingness. In Mohammad 1 he had considered that the likely end date for continuing symptoms to the neck and back, on the basis of soft tissue injury, would be March 2014. This was not the same as soft tissue injury in any other part of the body. He differed from the opinion which Mr Matthews had described, in which pain going beyond a year would be attributable to degenerative changes rather than pain from the soft tissue injury.</p>

The reason for the change was that Mr Mohammad considered that Mr Wamala was “going into a pain syndrome type of scenario”. When a patient has had pain for some time other factors become important and pain pathways change. Patients develop “chronic pain syndrome”. At that stage it was not the structural injury which was the driver, it was more the overall dimension of what was happening. For this reason, Mr Mohammad had suggested looking at cognitive behavioural therapy and involving a specialist.</p>

It can only assist a decision maker if it is properly examined in the light of the circumstances of the particular case. In the criminal law the importance of this has been emphasised repeatedly in the context of DNA evidence. The statistical evidence may be that the probability of someone other than the defendant having the DNA profile in question is one in a million. It is tempting for the prosecutor to invite the jury to infer that it is 99.9999% probable that it was the defendant who left the DNA profile at the scene of the crime. This is, however, what is known as “the prosecutor’s fallacy”. First, in Great Britain, with a population well in excess of 50m people, this statistical evidence actually suggests that there are at least 50 individuals, other than the defendant, with the DNA profile in question. This puts the matter in quite a different perspective. If, moreover, there is evidence that one such individual, perhaps a close relative of the defendant, was at or near the scene of a crime, then unless that individual can be excluded the statistical evidence offers no basis for convicting the defendant.</p>

In the present case the scan shows that there are underlying degenerative changes. It would be quite wrong to assume on a statistical basis that Mr Wamala was a person in respect of whom it was more probable than not that the normal course would be followed. It was entirely right for the matter to be revisited in reexamination, and I have been assisted by Mr Mohammad’s answer pointing out that there is a core of patients, particularly with the spine, where symptoms come and go in a way which differs from the normal position.</p>

Mr Wamala’s evidence was that he did his very best with everything that Mr Matthews asked him to do. That evidence was plainly untrue. As explained in section B2.1 the result is that I must approach Mr Wamala’s evidence with particular care.</p>

Under that approach, I work on the basis that people’s recollections are likely to be more accurate when recounting their own actions and what happened to them than when attempting to recall what they saw or heard others doing or saying. As regards Mr Wamala’s evidence, that approach requires modification. The reason is that, as described in the Equal Treatment Bench Book and in the evidence of Professor Katona, those who experience severe trauma can find it very difficult to recall accurately and in sequence the details of events that happened to them, and the traumatic nature of some of the sequence of events may have the consequence that an individual’s memory of the whole of the sequence might be somewhat distorted.</p>

Thus, for example, numerous witnesses described Mr Wamala crying out that the escorts were killing him.

There was no paragraph 7C. Prior to the re-amendment, the amended defence had stated that the Home Office directions to Reliance were contained in the MS778 movement notification “amended by the Home Office by hand to change the printed departure time and flight number …” . It admitted that if these directions were unlawful then “the admitted use of force by the second Defendant’s agent was unlawful…”, and claimed an indemnity from the Home Office.

What Reliance’s September 2015 proposed amendments will do in paragraph 7B and 7C is to explain that the “instructions given to it by the first defendant’s servants or agents” were those in the MS778 movement notification, which required Reliance to put Mr Wamala on the EgyptAir flight departing at 2pm. The first paragraph of the proposed paragraph 7D makes no change to the words which previously appeared. However, when it is read with the changes introduced in paragraphs 7B and 7C, those same words have the effect of making a new allegation that Reliance’s servants and agents at all times reasonably believed that the instructions to put Mr Wamala on the EgyptAir flight departing at 2pm were lawful. I comment that there is no evidence that anyone at Reliance had any belief about the instructions in the MS778 movement notification.

On other documentation I had it was Mr Mvoi and there was a talk about a Kenyan. There were problems there on which I immediately contacted the control command centre at my company and I spoke with Michelle [Ms Payne] on that. She allayed all my fears and said I was going on the right flight. The gentleman was Ugandan and I was to remove him on that flight to Uganda.</p>

There he was searched and his bags were x-rayed. While there Mr Wamala stated that he wanted to claim asylum. No immigration officer was available in Wilson James. Mr Charles made a number of calls to seek to ensure that UKBA was aware of Mr Wamala’s wish to make such a claim. Mr Wamala was kept in the van on the tarmac while a response to those calls was awaited. At around 7:46pm Mr Charles was told that despite Mr Wamala’s wish to make a further claim for asylum UKBA was not prepared to stop his removal.

The first is whether, as alleged in the amended particulars of claim, an escort following Mr Wamala grabbed hold of Mr Wamala’s trousers and pulled him up the stairs. All escorts reject this. This rejection is in my view plainly right. Mr Wamala is a tall and heavy man. It is difficult to see how an escort below him could pull him up the stairs. In evidence in chief Mr Wamala merely said that his belt had been held from the back, and in cross-examination that his waistband had been grabbed. No allegation of being pulled up the stairs was made in his initial complaint or in his interview with the Beck team on 30 December 2011. I conclude that this was a wild allegation which should never have been advanced by Mr Wamala.</p>

It is convenient to deal first with the second of these. What was asserted in this regard in the amended particulars of claim was that the escorts assaulted Mr Wamala by striking his upper body. In his initial complaint on 29 December 2011 Mr Wamala had said he was “beat by five escorts out of the blue, the force was extremely immense”. In his interview with the Beck team on 30 December 2011 Mr Wamala said that he was “hit and handcuffed”. Reliance’s closing submissions asserted that Mr Wamala had “shied away from all versions of his previous account and restricted the allegation to one that he was being manhandled/ overpowered by 5 escorts”. I am not persuaded that this is right. In particular, on day 2 in his evidence in chief Mr Wamala was asked whether the escort on his right had changed the way that Mr Wamala was being held. Mr Wamala replied:</p>

As to Mr Wamala’s oral testimony concerning what he was saying to Ms Lertsakdadet, Reliance’s closing submissions made an accusation that Mr Wamala gave “opportunistic evidence”, by saying he had told Ms Lertsakdadet that the reason he wanted to see the captain was because he was being put on the wrong flight at the wrong time. The accusation has no merit. Wamala 1 stated at paragraph 101 that he had said that he wanted to speak to the captain of the aircraft as he was being taken unlawfully against his will. He was not giving a verbatim account of the precise words that he used. Whatever explanation he was giving was, on both his and Ms Lertsakdadet’s accounts, interrupted before it was completed. Whether he was saying to Ms Lertsakdadet simply that he was being taken unlawfully against his will, or that he was being taken on the wrong flight at the wrong time against his will, or that he was being taken unlawfully because he was on the wrong flight at the wrong time, is neither here nor there.</p>

Mr Wamala was indeed taken to the floor in the course of a struggle. The key issue is the timing of two actions admitted by Reliance as part of allegation (f). They are, first, the actions by which “Mr Wamala was taken a firm hold of”, and second, the securing of Mr Wamala’s right hand in the handcuffs. Is Reliance right to say that these two actions (“the firm hold” and “the right hand cuffing”) occurred only after the events described at (b) to (d)?

His use of force incident report described Mr Wamala becoming agitated when Mr Charles said that after Mr Wamala had taken his seat the captain would be asked to come and speak to him. The interview with Ms Beck began by saying that on at least one occasion, possibly twice, Mr Charles had told Mr Wamala to take his seat. By the end of the interview he said he thought he had said this at least twice. In his evidence in chief Mr Charles he thought he possibly repeated “the request or the command for him to take his seat”, and in cross-examination he insisted that what he had said was an order, which if obeyed would have resulted in Mr Wamala walking towards the seats, being guided by the staff, and then taking the seat. This all seems to me to be unreal. What was really happening was what both Mr Charles and Mr Simmons would have expected to happen as set out in subparagraphs (4) to (6) above:  there would be no question of Mr Wamala merely being “guided by the staff”. Within seconds of Mr Wamala approaching Ms Lertsakdadet he was being pulled towards the seats.</p>

There is no doubt that Mr Duke repeatedly said “Do not bite me.” Mr Duke said in examination in chief that Mr Wamala was moving towards Mr Duke’s thigh and that Mr Wamala’s mouth was open in a manner which led Mr Duke to think that Mr Wamala was going to bite him. However in crossexamination Mr Duke said that this occurred after Mr Charles had handcuffed Mr Wamala, that Mr Duke’s concern was that Mr Wamala would bite Mr Duke’s colleagues, and that Mr Wamala did not have the opportunity to bite anyone because Mr Duke had control of his head.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.07in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the period when Mr Wamala was taken up the staircase, I start in section F9.2 below with the light holds used by the escorts when going up the staircase to the aircraft. In that context I discuss issue 1, and explain why I conclude that the answer to the March 2014 question is “No”. In section F9.3 I discuss issue 3 and give initial consideration to whether paragraph 18A of the defence, even if revised in the manner proposed by Reliance, assists Reliance in relation to force used when going up the staircase. I explain that in the context of going up the staircase, while I can rule out the self-defence justification, and I can rule out actual or potential justifications concerned with the prevention of escape, it is necessary to give more detailed consideration to the prevention of crime justification, the keeping the peace justification, and the 1999 Act duties justification. Those justifications are then considered in sections F9.4, F9.5 and F9.6. My conclusions on liability for the light holds are set out in section F9.7.</p>

The assertion is unfounded for reasons given in Mr Wamala’s October 2015 submissions. It is true that Mr Wamala applied these and other characterisations to the actions of the escorts. But these characterisations were not the only basis on which he claimed for trespass to the person. Paragraph 129 of the particulars of claim said expressly:</p>

The same contention was clearly advanced at the outset of Mr Wamala’s skeleton argument, and in the oral opening submissions on behalf of Mr Wamala. Thus the point apparently taken in paragraph 32 in Reliance’s closing written submissions is a false point. It appeared to be the prelude to a contention in paragraph 38 that Mr Wamala originally proceeded upon the basis that Reliance’s officers were entitled to use reasonable force to restrain him if it was necessary to do so. For the reasons given above that contention is unsound.</p>

In a regular case a lawful removal direction will have been issued and served on the agent of the relevant aircraft and notice of that direction will have been issued and served on the detainee. In such a case there would normally be no reason to doubt that DCOs acting in accordance with escort arrangements may use force where reasonably necessary to convey the detainee to the airport, and to put the detainee on board the aircraft using light holds to ensure good order and discipline. In the event that boarding is denied, escort arrangements for overseas removal will normally provide for the escorts to advise UKBA of this, and to escort the detainee in accordance with directions given by UKBA, and the same entitlement to use force will normally apply to this as well.</p>

Reliance nevertheless took Mr Wamala and put him on flight QR2, without there being any removal directions issued for flight QR2, let alone notified to Mr Wamala, and without there being any movement notification issued by UKBA for flight QR2. Reliance’s original defence made a conditional admission of liability. This was that if the Home Office’s directions, meaning by this what I have called the purported QR2 movement notification, were unlawful then the escorts’ use of force was unlawful. In that event Reliance’s original defence claimed an indemnity from the Home Office. It was the Home Office which, causing a degree of judicial consternation, suggested that Reliance’s conditional admission of liability was wrong. Eventually Reliance decided no longer to seek an indemnity from the Home Office, and secured permission to amend so as to withdraw the conditional admission.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.07in;text-indent:0.5in">The March 2014 question asks whether there was lawful justification for the use of force for three purposes: see section A1.4 above. As regards force used when going up the staircase, it is the second of these purposes that arises: “the use of force to … put him on … flight QR2”. The analysis, however, seems to me to be the same for all three purposes. It does not matter whether the purpose is conveying Mr Wamala to Heathrow, putting him on the aircraft, or removing him from the aircraft. The position is that none of these purposes is said by Reliance to provide lawful justification for the use of force. Instead, as regards the use of force during the period when Reliance held Mr Wamala in their custody, Reliance’s case is different. Both as currently pleaded, and as set out in the proposed re-re-amendments, Reliance’s case is that it used force for certain specified other purposes (“the other purposes”), and was entitled to do so <span style="font-style:italic">for the other purposes</span>. It necessarily follows that the answer to the March 2014 question is, “No”.</p>

Effectively, the result of Reliance’s first general reply was that, as regards a person falling within Mr Wamala’s general answer (i.e. a person using reasonable force to resist unlawful removal), the prevention of crime justification was no longer advanced as an independent defence.

That schedule, concerned with DCOs, makes it a criminal offence to assault a DCO acting in accordance with escort arrangements.

Reliance was responsible for his custody in accordance with escort arrangements for his custody made under s 156(1)(c) (whether or not the directions for his removal were properly given under the 1971 Act, so as to entitle Reliance to rely upon s 156(b)).  It follows that Reliance’s officers had the right to use reasonable force to prevent escape, to restrain unlawful acts and to ensure Mr Wamala’s good order and discipline, while he was a detained person in Reliance’s custody temporarily outside premises where he might lawfully be detained, e.g. the Immigration Removal Centre at Brook House from which he was collected.</p>

That cannot be a proper construction of the legislation in respect of a person who is lawfully in custody. Nor can it be what Parliament intended.  Such a construction would mean that because the removal direction in respect of Mr Wamala’s removal was for the wrong flight and he had not been served with a fresh removal direction for the right flight, he would, as a matter of construction of the 1999 Act, have been able to resist the escorts’ attempts to restrain him and escape at will or commit other offences without the officers in charge of him having any statutory authority to bring him under control.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">Finally, in relation to relevant parts of the opening submissions for Mr Wamala, I summarise contentions in Mr Wamala’s skeleton argument which anticipated that Reliance would seek to justify its actions by citing the third of the 1999 Act duties. This third duty is to ensure good order and discipline on the part of the detained person. It is important in this regard to note that these, like all other contentions in Mr Wamala’s skeleton argument, were advanced at a stage where there was no inkling that Reliance would say that the governing escort arrangements were those for custody of detained persons temporarily outside authorised premises. I shall refer to these contentions by Mr Wamala as “Mr Wamala’s good order contentions”. In summary:</p>

As to the second, found in s 156(1)(b), Reliance noted that this concerned the delivery of persons for the purpose of removal in accordance with removal directions. The third concession (“Reliance’s type of escort arrangements concession”) was that the events on Christmas eve did not involve the second type of escort arrangements, because what took place on Christmas eve was not a delivery of Mr Wamala in accordance with removal directions;</p>

[3] The lack of a valid removal direction makes the   removal unlawful. It does not render the detainee free of the requirement of the Secretary of State that he be held in detention; and [4] if his detention is for the time being in the hands of DCOs acting under the Services Agreement then the detainee is in the DCOs’ lawful custody.</p>

For the reasons given in section F9.3, I conclude that neither the self defence justification, nor actual or potential justifications concerned with the prevention of escape, can justify the light holds. For the reasons given in sections F9.4 and F9.5, Reliance has not identified any basis upon which the use of reasonable force by Mr Wamala to resist his unlawful removal could give rise to the commission by him of a crime, or constitute a breach of the peace, such as to give rise to the prevention of crime justification or the keeping the peace justification.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.53in;margin-right:0.07in">As it seems to me, Reliance’s type of escort arrangements concession (see stage (7) of Reliance’s oral closing submissions as summarised in section F9.6 above) acknowledged the correctness of this simple stance: once flight MS778 had departed without him, the “escort arrangements” for removal of Mr Wamala were no longer effective. Reliance then advanced a contention that there were nevertheless effective escort arrangements in relation to Mr Wamala which were for “the custody of detained persons who are temporarily outside [authorised] premises” (see stage (8) of Reliance’s oral closing submissions as set out in section F9.6 above). The first difficulty is that I was not shown anything in the 2010 Services Agreement dealing with escort arrangements of that type. Even if that difficulty here can be overcome, however, I cannot accept that any such escort arrangements for Mr Wamala came into being. The reason is that Reliance’s submissions in this regard have two obvious flaws: UKBA had not directed Reliance to take custody of Mr Wamala as a detained person temporarily outside authorised premises, and the escorts’ avowed purpose was different: they sought and obtained custody of Mr Wamala for removal on flight QR2. The only direction that UKBA had given Reliance in relation to Mr Wamala was the MS778 movement notification. That direction plainly authorised Reliance to take custody of Mr Wamala only for the purpose of his removal to Uganda on flight MS778.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.53in;margin-right:0.07in">Reliance’s submissions did not seem to me to grapple with these obvious flaws. Instead, in large part, they demolished arguments which Mr Wamala had not advanced. The most striking of these was the suggestion that under Mr Wamala’s arguments he had become a free man. This suggestion was nonsense. Mr Wamala did not dispute that his duty was to return to detention. His arguments on this aspect, in effect, would put him in the same position as he would have been in if imposters had come to Brook House IRC and taken custody of him. That would not mean that he ceased to be a person who was detained: he was detained at Brook House IRC. All that had happened was that Brook House IRC had given up custody of him on a false basis. In that regard Brook House IRC received an amended movement notification that was presented as if it had been authorised by UKBA, whereas in fact it had not been and could not lawfully have been authorised by UKBA. Mr Wamala did not dispute that his duty was to return to detention in accordance with any instruction given by UKBA. Thus Reliance’s limitation on freedom contention (stage (11) of my summary in section F9.6 above of Reliance’s September 2015 submissions), assuming it to be right, does not warrant Reliance’s unlawful freedom criticism. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.53in;margin-right:0.07in">In other arguments the submissions for Reliance embarked upon the task of finding a way in which, even though Reliance had taken custody of Mr Wamala without any effective instruction from UKBA to do so, the escorts’ illegitimately gained custody of Mr Wamala attracted the 1999 Act duties. This task was bound to fail, for it was inconsistent with fundamental principles of the common law and of the interpretation of statutes. As to the common law, I need do no more than refer to Mr Wamala’s basic principles assertion, and the celebrated decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Entick v Carrington</span> (see the summary in section B9.6 above of Mr Wamala’s opening submissions). In the passage in question the submissions for Mr Wamala were seeking to answer submissions in Reliance’s skeleton argument. Those submissions included extravagant contentions that on Mr Wamala’s case a minor defect in a removal direction would entitle Mr Wamala to resist attempts to restrain him, to escape at will, or to commit other offences. However relevant submissions for Mr Wamala made no such contentions, being concerned at that stage with Mr Wamala’s entitlement to use reasonable force to resist removal in the absence of removal directions. Reliance’s elision contentions do not work at common law, for if Mr Wamala is doing no more than what is permitted by the common law, then he will not be guilty of any common law offence. As to the interpretation of statutes, both in relation to the circumstances in which an offence will be committed, and in relation to the grant of powers to escorts which would curtail the rights of others, it is not necessary to go beyond <span style="font-style:italic">Morris v Beardmore</span>: the clearest possible language will be required before the statute could be interpreted in a way which would impair Mr Wamala’s entitlement to use reasonable force to resist unlawful force. Reliance accepted that that entitlement arose by virtue of the fact that there were no removal directions in place for flight QR2. To my mind, that entitlement arose just as much by virtue of the fact that the escorts had no authority to take custody of Mr Wamala.</p>

Second, Mr Wamala had not suggested that the mere fact that there was a breach of the 2010 Services Agreement of itself resulted in a loss of 1999 Act duties status, and thus the position in relation to the use of rigid bar handcuffs had nothing to do with the matter. Third, Reliance’s invalid removal directions consequences contention would, even if correct, not assist Reliance, for it only applied in relation to “an authorised DCO”, whereas for reasons given by Mr Wamala none of the escorts have been authorised to do anything in relation to him;</p>

Using the numbering I adopted when summarising stage (13) above, element [1] is inconsistent with Reliance’s type of escort arrangements  concession in Reliance’s oral closing submissions (see stage (7) of Reliance’s oral closing submissions as summarised in section F9.6 above): Reliance has in that concession accepted that in the absence of removal directions for flight QR2 there were no valid escort arrangements for Mr Wamala’s removal. It may be assumed that element [1] would be correct if there had been an instruction by UKBA for Reliance to take custody of Mr Wamala while he was temporarily outside authorised premises, but there was no such instruction. The arguments of public policy advanced in element [2] are unsound for the reasons that I have identified earlier. Element [3] repeats Reliance’s unlawful freedom criticism. For the reasons given earlier in this section, and when discussing stage (11) of Reliance’s September 2015 submissions, this criticism is targeted at something which does not form any part of Mr Wamala’s submissions.

If it means “DCOs acting pursuant to a valid direction given by UKBA to Reliance under the 2010 Services Agreement”, then that may well have the consequence that the detainee is in the DCOs’ lawful custody.

It seems to me that there are two good reasons for thinking that that was right. The first is the reason Mr Wamala himself gave: he had not resisted his removal in 1999. The second arises from my findings in section A4.9 above: Mr Wamala greatly feared that if he offered any resistance to the escorts he might suffer the same fate as Mr Mubenga. Consistently with this I have found in section F6 above that Mr Wamala<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>did not offer resistance to the escorts on QR2 until they used force against him;</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.07in;text-indent:0.5in">In the light of Reliance’s reasonable resistance concession, and my finding that the premise of that concession is met, it is not open to Reliance to assert that the escorts acted in self defence. So long as Mr Wamala was using no more than reasonable force, what he did by way of menacing the physical security of the escorts was lawful. In these circumstances Mr Wamala was not the assailant. The common law right of self defence does not arise where the so-called assailant has an entitlement to use force and is acting within that entitlement. It was the escorts who, by using force to bring about an unlawful removal, were the assailants. Mr Wamala was the victim and was himself entitled to the benefit of the common law of the right of self defence. The duty of the escorts in response to Mr Wamala’s use of force was not to seek to counter that use of force. Their duty, although they did not appreciate it at the time, was to stop trying to bring about the unlawful removal of Mr Wamala. The fact that the escorts did not appreciate that the removal was unlawful no doubt explains why they thought they were entitled to counter Mr Wamala’s use of force. Whether they could reasonably have been expected to have appreciated that the removal was unlawful does not matter. Once it is established, as is clearly established in the present case, that the escorts’ attempts at bringing about removal were themselves unlawful, Mr Wamala had a clear legal entitlement to use force reasonably necessary to resist removal, and to insist that the escorts were in the wrong, both in maintaining the force that they had used originally, and in using additional force to counter his attempts at self defence.</p>

This asserted that even if Mr Wamala was entitled to resist removal he nevertheless committed offences under the 2005 Order. If this is to be reconciled with Reliance’s unlawful acts concession, it can only be by reference to the express qualification set out in that concession. This express qualification is that the concession applies on the premise that Mr Wamala “was using reasonable force for the purpose of resisting his unlawful removal”.</p>

It would be incompatible with Reliance’s reasonable resistance concession. As set out in section F10.3 above, if Mr Wamala used force for the purpose of resisting his unlawful removal, and were prosecuted for assault in respect of the force he was using, it is conceded that an assertion by the prosecutor that Mr Wamala had used unreasonable force would not succeed. If there was no such unreasonable force as would undermine Mr Wamala’s defence to a charge of assault, then there was no such unreasonable force as would take the case outside the unlawful acts concession. Thus the only question becomes whether the force used by Mr Wamala was indeed used for the purpose of resisting his unlawful removal. For the reasons given in section F10.3 above I am satisfied that this was indeed the case.</p>

I cannot accept this suggestion. Nothing said by Ms Lertsakdadet suggests that Mr Wamala did anything which endangered her, or gave a reason to think that she would be endangered. Paragraph [8] of the Lertsakdadet email referred to a female escort standing “in front of me to protect me”. This was said to have occurred at the stage when the escorts pulled Mr Wamala back. There was no suggestion by Ms Lertsakdadet that she in fact needed protection. On the basis of my findings of fact in section F6 above, there is no reason to think that Ms Lertsakdadet actually needed such protection. Mr Wamala had been pulled away from her. If in fact she needed protection, then that protection was provided by the female escort who stood in front of her. I have explained in section F6 why I do not accept Ms Govey’s evidence as warranting a conclusion that Mr Wamala either lunged or moved in a frightening way towards Ms Lertsakdadet.</p>

As to this, it seems to me that a painstaking examination of the jumble that I have described in section F9.4 above would have revealed the inclusion of a reference to the 2005 Order. The request for further information had been made generally in order to know the offences which Reliance said in paragraph 18A that it had used force to prevent being committed by Mr Wamala. The answer appears to me to have been a general one in relation to allegations in paragraph 18A that force was used for that purpose. Thus it seems to me that the answer was given both in relation to the general prevention of crime justification and in relation to the specific power arising from the 1999 Act duty to prevent the commission or attempted commission of unlawful acts (although Reliance did not go this far in its October 2015 submissions).</p>

As matters stood at the end of oral closing submissions, I had no submissions from Reliance which would have enabled me to find that there had been reason to fear the commission of offences under the 2005 Order. In those circumstances the mere reference to that order in the further information supplied by Reliance would not have enabled me to conclude that the Order assisted Reliance’s case. As indicated earlier in this judgment, Reliance had no entitlement to advance further submissions in that regard. However Mr Wamala’s October 2015 submissions were content to deal with new legal arguments advanced by Reliance in the September 2015 submissions, and for that reason I give permission for Reliance to advance the arguments on the 2005 Order set out in Reliance’s September 2015 submissions.</p>

In the light of my findings above, this is no more than an additional reason for concluding that the 2005 Order does not assist Reliance. Reliance now seeks to say that the 2009 Order contains materially identical provisions. That, however, cannot assist them: for the reasons indicated above the provisions in the 2005 Order do not assist Reliance, and materially identical provisions in the 2009 Order will equally not assist Reliance.

As also noted in section A5.5 above, two propositions were advanced in Mr Wamala’s skeleton argument as to the relevance of the Convention. The first was that the common law should be read consistently with Article 3 so as to provide at least equivalent protection. It is not, however, necessary to examine this proposition. Mr Wamala has not identified any aspect of the present case in which the common law fails to achieve at least equivalent protection to that which would be achieved in a claim under Article 3.</p>

This contention appears to proceed on the basis that if fresh removal directions had been served on Mr Wamala for flight QR2, then the escorts would have been entitled to use force for the purpose of bringing about Mr Wamala’s removal, and that the force in fact used by the escorts was no more than reasonable force for this purpose. For reasons given earlier in this judgment that assumption would not be right: on board the aircraft the escorts used more force than was reasonably necessary for the purpose of ensuring Mr Wamala’s removal. Thus, if I am right to hold that the escorts used more force on board the aircraft than was reasonably necessary, the premise for Reliance’s contention has not been satisfied, for the outcome that the contention postulates has not occurred.</p>

The mere fact that the force actually used by Reliance would have been permissible if a valid removal direction were in place does not of itself show that Mr Wamala has “failed on his case that he was subjected to a serious assault”. The amount of physical force permissible to bring about a lawful removal may well be considerable, depending on the circumstances. Such a degree of physical force may equally constitute a serious trespass to the person if it is used with the aim of achieving an unlawful removal.</p>

There was no suggestion by Mr Wamala that he wanted to see the captain in any other context.

Reliance submitted that in that event the damages recoverable would be reduced to take account of the consequences of such use of force as would have been reasonable. In the light of my findings earlier in this judgment, however, this contention will not assist Reliance. From the moment that force was first used against Mr Wamala on the aircraft that force went beyond what was reasonable. It involved the violent pulling away of Mr Wamala and the almost immediate application of handcuffs. There was, however, at that stage, no need to use force at all. For the reasons given in section A4 above, I do not consider that Mr Wamala would have used force if none had been used against him. Accordingly I do not conclude that there is anything which falls to be deducted in the way that Reliance suggests.</p>

What does, however, in my view justify such an award is the reaction of the escorts when Mr Wamala raised the matter.

This had consequences for Mr Wamala which can properly be described as severe. He was thereafter treated as a violent and aggressive detainee. Among other things, when attending court for the purposes of litigation seeking to prevent a later attempt to remove him, Mr Wamala was brought to court in handcuffs. Earlier, at Colnbrook IRC, Mr Wamala was held in segregation for a lengthy period, which it seems to me is likely to have been attributable to the account of events on Christmas eve given by Reliance.</p>

This category involves matters which were relied on as warranting an award of aggravated damages, but which in that context I have rejected, or in large part rejected, because their nature was not such as to impact on Mr Wamala in a way that required additional compensation.

It is plain that an employee of Reliance made those alterations. Suggestions by Reliance that there may have been a telephone conversation authorising that employee to do so have come to nothing. I am sure that all concerned at Reliance knew that it was highly improper to amend a movement notification in this way. Thus, for example, Ms Payne was adamant in Payne 1 that, “We do not make handwritten amendments to movement notifications”. Mr Wamala’s complaints resulted in an immediate investigation by the Professional Standards Unit. The irregularity of what happened must have been apparent to whoever it was that had made the QR2 alterations. On Reliance’s own case it made no attempt to examine the original of the altered notification until Mr Mitchell asked to inspect it in March 2015. All these matters in my view amply make good the contention in Mr Wamala’s schedule of damages that there was at the very least indifference to the legality of removal on the part of Reliance. Reliance’s insistence on maintaining its stance without checking the original document seems to me to be a further indication of its failure to appreciate the seriousness of the very important principles which were at stake.</p>

My award of aggravated damages includes allowance for the need to supplement the ordinary damages so as to give Mr Wamala full compensation in this regard. In my view, over and above that compensation, there were features of the techniques adopted by the escorts, techniques which according to the evidence were regularly adopted by Reliance’s staff, and the approach to the requirements of the 2010 Services Agreement, which taken together can properly be described as outrageous. I have already expressed my concern about the use of handcuffs incorporating a pain control mechanism in circumstances where this could and did easily go wrong: see the final sentence of section F10.3 above. This was contrary to the 2010 Services Agreement, as the technique used was not one which was approved by the prison service. A second and serious breach of the 2010 Services Agreement was the flagrant disregard of the express prohibition in that agreement of the use of any head restraint. There was a failure to comply with the requirement in the 2010 Services Agreement that handcuffs should only be used with the consent of the captain. Reliance has conducted this litigation on the basis that such matters are insignificant, and that it was appropriate to adopt procedures which Reliance considered to be needed, and had regularly used. This is utterly unacceptable and calls for condemnation. The starting point must be that requirements in the 2010 Services Agreement have been inserted for good reason and must be respected unless and until they are changed.</p>

To some extent, however, elements in the matters calling for exemplary damages have been compensated by the award of aggravated damages. I will accordingly reduce the award of exemplary damages to £10,000.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.48in;margin-right:0.07in">558.<span style="font-size:6.5pt">          </span>For the reasons given in this judgment I conclude that Mr Wamala is entitled to damages for physical and mental injuries in the amounts totalling £30,000 as set out in <span style="text-decoration:underline;color:#0000FF">Annex 2</span> of this judgment, and is further entitled to £8,000 for aggravated damages and £10,000 for exemplary damages as set out in sections G3 and G4 above. Thus the total award of damages will be £48,000. In that regard, and in relation to declaratory and any other relief, I ask the parties to seek to agree on consequential orders. In relation to Reliance’s application for permission to make the proposed September 2015 amendments to the defence, I have set out in section F10.2 above my reasons for considering that as regards the alterations of the MS778 movement notification, the proposed amendments are incoherent. As regards the proposed additional paragraph (iv), seeking to introduce a general prevention of escape justification, I have set out earlier in this judgment my reasons for concluding that no such justification can succeed. In these circumstances, I cannot accept that Reliance is able to surmount the high hurdle which would need to be surmounted to allow further amendments at such a late stage.</p>

However, given his psychological symptoms (not caused by the incident) Mr Wamala ought ideally to have anti-depressants for a period of 12 to 24 months to relieve them.</span>
